ill cut your throat mr tupman we are observed i trotty veck and his daughter meg trotty seems a strange name for an old man but it was given to toby veck because of his always going at a trot to do his errands for he was a ticket porter or messenger and his office was to take letters and messages for people who were in too great a hurry to send them by post which in those days was neither so cheap nor so quick as it is now he did not earn very much and had to be out in all weathers and all day long but toby was of a cheerful disposition and looked on the bright side of everything and was grateful for any small mercies that came in his way and so was happier than many people who never knew what it is to be hungry or in want of comforts his greatest joy was his dear bright pretty daughter meg who loved him dearly one cold day near the end of the year toby had been waiting a long time for a job trotting up and down in his usual place before the church and trying hard to keep himself warm when the bells chimed twelve oclock which made toby think of dinner theres nothing he remarked carefully feeling his nose to make sure it was still there more regular in coming round than dinnertime and nothing less regular in coming round than dinner thats the great difference between em he went on talking to himself trotting up and down and never noticing who was coming near to him why father father said a pleasant voice and toby turned to find his daughters sweet bright eyes close to his why pet said he kissing her and squeezing her blooming face between his hands whats todo i didnt expect you today meg neither did i expect to come father said meg nodding and smiling but here i am and not alone not alone why you dont mean to say observed trotty looking curiously at the covered basket she carried that you smell it father dear said meg only smell it trotty was going to lift up the cover at once in a great hurry when she gaily interposed her hand no no no said meg with the glee of a child lengthen it out a little let me just lift up the corner just a little tiny corner you know said meg suiting the action to the word with the utmost gentleness and speaking very softly as if she were afraid of being overheard by something inside the basket there now whats that toby took the shortest possible sniff at the edge of the basket and cried out in rapture why its hot he said but to megs great delight he could not guess what it was that smelt so good polonies trotters liver pigs feet sausages he tried one after the other at last he exclaimed in triumph why what am i athinking of its tripe and it was and so said meg ill lay the cloth at once father for i have brought the tripe in a basin and tied the basin up in a pockethandkerchief and if i like to be proud for once and spread that for a cloth and call it a cloth theres nobody to prevent me is there father not that i know of my dear said toby but theyre always abringing up some new law or other and according to what i was reading you in the paper the other day father what the judge said you know we poor people are supposed to know them all ha ha what a mistake my goodness me how clever they think us yes my dear cried trotty and theyd be very fond of any one of us that did know em all hed grow fat upon the work hed get that man and be popular with the gentlefolks in his neighborhood very much so hed eat his dinner with an appetite whoever he was if it smelt like this said meg cheerfully make haste for theres a hot potato besides and half a pint of freshdrawn beer in a bottle where will you dine fatheron the post or on the steps dear dear how grand we are two places to choose from the steps today my pet said trotty steps in dry weather post in wet theres greater conveniency in the steps at all times because of the sitting down but theyre rheumatic in the damp then here said meg clapping her hands after a moments bustle here it is all ready and beautiful it looks come father come illustration they broke in like a grace my dear page and just as toby was about to sit down to his dinner on the doorsteps of a big house close by the chimes rang out again and toby took off his hat and said amen amen to the bells father they broke in like a grace my dear said trotty theyd say a good one if they could im sure manys the kind thing they say to me how often have i heard them bells say toby veck keep a good heart toby a million times more well i never cried meg when things is very bad then its toby veck toby veck job coming soon toby and it comesat last father said meg with a touch of sadness in her pleasant voice always answered toby never fails while this discourse was holding trotty made no pause in his attack upon the savory meat before him but cut and ate and cut and drank and cut and chewed and dodged about from tripe to hot potato and from hot potato back again to tripe with an unfailing relish but happening now to look all round the streetin case anybody should be beckoning from any door or window for a porterhis eyes in coming back again saw meg sitting opposite him with her arms folded and only busy in watching his dinner with a smile of happiness why lord forgive me said trotty dropping his knife and fork my dove meg why didnt you tell me what a beast i was father sitting here said trotty in a sorrowful manner cramming and stuffing and gorging myself and you before me there never so much as breaking your precious fast nor wanting to when but i have broken it father interposed his daughter laughing all to bits i have had my dinner nonsense said trotty two dinners in one day it aint possible you might as well tell me that two new years days will come together or that i have had a gold head all my life and never changed it i have had my dinner father for all that said meg coming nearer to him and if you will go on with yours ill tell you how and where and how your dinner came to be brought andand something else besides toby still appeared not to believe her but she looked into his face with her clear eyes and laying her hand upon his shoulder motioned him to go on while the meat was hot so trotty took up his knife and fork again and went to work but much more slowly than before and shaking his head as if he were not at all pleased with himself i had my dinner father said meg after a little hesitation withwith richard his dinnertime was early and as he brought his dinner with him when he came to see me wewe had it together father trotty took a little beer and smacked his lips then he said oh because she waited and richard says father meg resumed then stopped what does richard say meg asked toby richard says father another stoppage richards a long time saying it said toby he says then father meg continued lifting up her eyes at last and speaking in a tremble but quite plainly another year is nearly gone and where is the use of waiting on from year to year when it is so unlikely we shall ever be better off than we are now he says we are poor now father and we shall be poor then but we are young now and years will make us old before we know it he says that if we wait people as poor as we are until we see our way quite clearly the way will be a narrow one indeedthe common waythe grave father a bolder man than trotty veck must needs have drawn upon his boldness largely to deny it trotty held his peace and how hard father to grow old and die and think we might have cheered and helped each other how hard in all our lives to love each other and to grieve apart to see each other working changing growing old and gray even if i got the better of it and forgot him which i never could oh father dear how hard to have a heart so full as mine is now and live to have it slowly drained out every drop without remembering one happy moment of a womans life to stay behind and comfort me and make me better trotty sat quite still meg dried her eyes and said more gailythat is to say with here a laugh and there a sob and here a laugh and sob together so richard says father as his work was yesterday made certain for some time to come and as i love him and have loved him full three yearsah longer than that if he knew itwill i marry him on new years day just then richard himself came up to persuade toby to agree to their plan and almost at the same moment a footman came out of the house and ordered them all off the steps and some gentlemen came out who called up trotty and asked a great many questions and found a good deal of fault telling richard he was very foolish to want to get married which made toby feel very unhappy and richard very angry so the lovers went off together sadly richard looking gloomy and downcast and meg in tears toby who had a letter given him to carry and a sixpence trotted off in rather low spirits to a very grand house where he was told to take the letter in to the gentleman while he was waiting he heard the letter read it was from alderman cute to tell sir joseph bowley that one of his tenants named will fern who had come to london to try to get work and been brought before him charged with sleeping in a shed and asking if sir joseph wished him to be dealt kindly with or otherwise to tobys great disappointment for sir joseph had talked a great deal about being a friend to the poor the answer was given that will fern might be sent to prison as a vagabond and made an example of though his only fault was that he was poor on his way home toby thinking sadly with his hat pulled down low on his head ran against a man dressed like a countryman carrying a fairhaired little girl toby enquired anxiously if he had hurt either of them the man answered no and seeing toby had a kind face he asked him the way to alderman cutes house its impossible cried toby that your name is will fern thats my name said the man thereupon toby told him what he had just heard and said dont go there poor will told him how he could not make a living in the country and had come to london with his orphan niece to try to find a friend of her mothers and to endeavor to get some work and wishing toby a happy new year was about to trudge wearily off again when trotty caught his hand saying stay the new year never can be happy to me if i see the child and you go wandering away without a shelter for your heads come home with me im a poor man living in a poor place but i can give you lodging for one night and never miss it come home with me here ill take her cried trotty lifting up the child a pretty one id carry twenty times her weight and never know id got it tell me if i go too quick for you im very fast i always was trotty said this taking about six of his trotting paces to one stride of his tired companion and with his thin legs quivering again beneath the load he bore why shes as light said trotty trotting in his speech as well as in his gaitfor he couldnt bear to be thanked and dreaded a moments pauseas light as a feather lighter than a peacocks feathera great deal lighter here we are and here we go and rushing in he set the child down before his daughter the little girl gave one look at megs sweet face and ran into her arms at once while trotty ran round the room saying here we are and here we go here uncle will come to the fire meg my precious darling wheres the kettle here it is and here it goes and itll bile in no time why father said meg as she knelt before the child and pulled off her wet shoes youre crazy tonight i think i dont know what the bells would say to that poor little feet how cold they are oh theyre warmer now exclaimed the child theyre quite warm now no no no said meg we havent rubbed em half enough were so busy and when theyre done well brush out the damp hair and when thats done well bring some color to the poor pale face with fresh water and when thats done well be so gay and brisk and happy the child sobbing clasped her round the neck saying o meg o dear meg good gracious me said meg presently fathers crazy hes put the dear childs bonnet on the kettle and hung the lid behind the door trotty hastily repaired this mistake and went off to find some tea and a rasher of bacon he fancied he had seen lying somewhere on the stairs he soon came back and made the tea and before long they were all enjoying the meal trotty and meg only took a morsel for forms sake for they had only a very little not enough for all but their delight was in seeing their visitors eat and very happy they werethough trotty had noticed that meg was sitting by the fire in tears when they had come in and he feared her marriage had been broken off after tea meg took lilian to bed and toby showed will fern where he was to sleep as he came back past megs door he heard the child saying her prayers remembering megs name and asking for his then he went to sit by the fire and read his paper and fell asleep to have a wonderful dream so terrible and sad that it was a great relief when he woke and whatever you do father said meg dont eat tripe again without asking some doctor whether its likely to agree with you for how you have been going on good gracious she was working with her needle at the little table by the fire dressing her simple gown with ribbons for her weddingso quietly happy so blooming and youthful so full of beautiful promise that he uttered a great cry as if it were an angel in his house then flew to clasp her in his arms but he caught his feet in the newspaper which had fallen on the hearth and somebody came rushing in between them no cried the voice of this same somebody a generous and jolly voice it was not even you not even you the first kiss of meg in the new year is minemine i have been waiting outside the house this hour to hear the bells and claim it meg my precious prize a happy year a life of happy years my darling wife and richard smothered her with kisses you never in all your life saw anything like trotty after this i dont care where you have lived or what you have seen you never in your life saw anything at all approaching him he kept running up to meg and squeezing her fresh face between his hands and kissing it going from her backwards not to lose sight of it and running up again like a figure in a magic lantern and whatever he did he was constantly sitting himself down in his chair and never stopping in it for one single moment beingthats the truthbeside himself with joy and tomorrows your weddingday my pet cried trotty your real happy weddingday today cried richard shaking hands with him today the chimes are ringing in the new year hear them they were ringing bless their sturdy hearts they were ringing great bells as they weremelodious deepmouthed noble bells cast in no common metal made by no common founderwhen had they ever chimed like that before trotty was backing off to that wonderful chair again when the child who had been awakened by the noise came running in halfdressed why here she is cried trotty catching her up heres little lilian ha ha ha here we are and here we go oh here we are and here we go again and here we are and here we go and uncle will too before will fern could make the least reply a band of music burst into the room attended by a flock of neighbors screaming a happy new year meg a happy wedding many of em and other fragmentary goodwishes of that sort the drum who was a private friend of trottys then stepped forward and said trotty veck my boy its got about that your daughter is going to be married tomorrow there aint a soul that knows you that dont wish you well or that knows her and dont wish her well or that knows you both and dont wish you both all the happiness the new year can bring and here we are to play it in and dance it in accordingly then mrs chickenstalker came in a goodhumored nicelooking woman who to the delight of all turned out to be the friend of lilians mother for whom will fern had come to look with a stone pitcher full of flip to wish meg joy and then the music struck up and trotty making meg and richard second couple led off mrs chickenstalker down the dance and danced it in a step unknown before or since founded on his own peculiar trot ii tiny tim it will surprise you all very much to hear that there was once a man who did not like christmas in fact he had been heard on several occasions to use the word humbug with regard to it his name was scrooge and he was a hard sourtempered man of business intent only on saving and making money and caring nothing for anyone he paid the poor hardworking clerk in his office as little as he could possibly get the work done for and lived on as little as possible himself alone in two dismal rooms he was never merry or comfortable or happy and he hated other people to be so and that was the reason why he hated christmas because people will be happy at christmas you know if they possibly can and like to have a little money to make themselves and others comfortable well it was christmas eve a very cold and foggy one and mr scrooge having given his poor clerk permission very unwillingly to spend christmas day at home locked up his office and went home himself in a very bad temper and with a cold in his head after having taken some gruel as he sat over a miserable fire in his dismal room he got into bed and had some wonderful and disagreeable dreams to which we will leave him whilst we see how tiny tim the son of his poor clerk spent christmas day the name of this clerk was bob cratchit he had a wife and five other children besides tim who was a weak and delicate little cripple and for this reason was dearly loved by his father and the rest of the family not but what he was a dear little boy too gentle and patient and loving with a sweet face of his own which no one could help looking at whenever he could spare the time it was mr cratchits delight to carry his little boy out on his shoulder to see the shops and the people and today he had taken him to church for the first time whatever has got your precious father and your brother tiny tim exclaimed mrs cratchit heres dinner all ready to be dished up ive never known him so late on christmas day before here he is mother cried belinda and here he is cried the other children in came little bob the father with at least three feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe hanging down before him and his threadbare clothes darned up and brushed to look just as well as possible and tiny tim upon his shoulder alas for tiny tim he bore a little crutch and had his limbs supported by an iron frame why wheres our martha cried bob cratchit looking round not coming said mrs cratchit not coming said bob with a sudden dropping in his high spirits for he had been tims blood horse all the way from church and had come home rampant not coming upon christmas day martha didnt like to see him disappointed if it were only in joke so she came out sooner than had been agreed upon from behind the closetdoor and ran into his arms while the two young cratchits hustled tiny tim and bore him off into the washhouse that he might hear the pudding singing in the copper kettle and how did tim behave asked mrs cratchit as good as gold and better replied his father i think wife the child gets thoughtful sitting at home so much he told me coming home that he hoped the people in church who saw he was a cripple would be pleased to remember on christmas day who it was who made the lame to walk bless his sweet heart said the mother in a trembling voice and the fathers voice trembled too as he remarked that tiny tim was growing strong and hearty at last his active little crutch was heard upon the floor and back came tiny tim before another word was spoken led by his brother and sister to his stool beside the fire while bob master peter and the two young cratchits who seemed to be everywhere at once went to fetch the goose with which they soon returned in high procession such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose the rarest of all birds a perfect marvel to which a black swan was a matter of courseand in truth it was something very like it in that house mrs cratchit made the gravy ready beforehand in a little saucepan hissing hot master peter mashed the potatoes with tremendous vigor miss belinda sweetened up the applesauce martha dusted the hot plates bob took tiny tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table the two young cratchits set chairs for everybody not forgetting themselves and mounting guard upon their posts crammed spoons into their mouths lest they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped at last the dishes were set on and grace was said it was succeeded by a breathless pause as mrs cratchit looking slowly all along the carvingknife prepared to plunge it in the breast but when she did and when the longexpected gush of stuffing issued forth one murmur of delight arose all round the board and even tiny tim excited by the two young cratchits beat on the table with the handle of his knife and feebly cried hurrah there never was such a goose bob said he didnt believe there ever was such a goose cooked its tenderness and flavor size and cheapness were the themes of universal admiration eked out by applesauce and mashed potatoes it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family indeed as mrs cratchit said with great delight surveying one small atom of a bone upon the dish they hadnt ate it all at that yet everyone had had enough and the youngest cratchits in particular were steeped in sage and onions to the eyebrows but now the plates being changed by miss belinda mrs cratchit left the room alonetoo nervous to bear witnessesto take up the pudding and bring it in suppose it should not be done enough suppose it should break in turning out suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the back yard and stolen it while they were merry with the goosea supposition at which the two young cratchits became livid all sorts of horrors were supposed halloo a great deal of steam the pudding was out of the copper a smell like a washingday that was the cloth a smell like an eatinghouse and a pastrycooks next door to each other with a laundress next door to that that was the pudding in half a minute mrs cratchit enteredflushed but smiling proudlywith the pudding like a speckled cannonball so hard and firm blazing in half of halfaquartern of lighted brandy and decorated with christmas holly stuck into the top oh a wonderful pudding bob cratchit said and calmly too that he regarded it as the greatest success achieved by mrs cratchit since their marriage mrs cratchit said that now the weight was off her mind she would confess she had her doubts about the quantity of flour everybody had something to say about it but nobody said or thought it was a small pudding for a large family it would have been really wicked to do so any cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a thing at last the dinner was all done the cloth was cleared the hearth swept and the fire made up the hot stuff in the jug being tasted and considered perfect apples and oranges were put upon the table and a shovel full of chestnuts on the fire then all the cratchit family drew round the hearth in what bob cratchit called a circle meaning half a one and at bob cratchits elbow stood the family display of glass two tumblers and a custard cup without a handle these held the hot stuff from the jug however as well as golden goblets would have done and bob served it out with beaming looks while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily then bob proposed a merry christmas to us all my dears god bless us which all the family reechoed god bless us everyone said tiny tim the last of all now i told you that mr scrooge had some disagreeable and wonderful dreams on christmas eve and so he had and in one of them he dreamt that a christmas spirit showed him his clerks home he saw them all gathered round the fire and heard them drink his health and tiny tims song and he took special note of tiny tim himself how mr scrooge spent christmas day we do not know he may have remained in bed having a cold but on christmas night he had more dreams and in one of his dreams the spirit took him again to his clerks poor home the mother was doing some needlework seated by the table a tear dropped on it now and then and she said poor thing that the work which was black hurt her eyes the children sat sad and silent about the room except tiny tim who was not there upstairs the father with his face hidden in his hands sat beside a little bed on which lay a tiny figure white and still my little child my pretty little child he sobbed as the tears fell through his fingers on to the floor tiny tim died because his father was too poor to give him what was necessary to make him well you kept him poor said the dreamspirit to mr scrooge the father kissed the cold little face on the bed and went downstairs where the sprays of holly still remained about the humble room and taking his hat went out with a wistful glance at the little crutch in the corner as he shut the door mr scrooge saw all this and many more things as strange and sad the spirit took care of that but wonderful to relate he woke the next morning feeling a different manfeeling as he had never felt in his life before for after all you know that what he had seen was no more than a dream he knew that tiny tim was not dead and scrooge was resolved that tiny tim should not die if he could help it why i am as light as a feather and as happy as an angel and as merry as a schoolboy scrooge said to himself as he skipped into the next room to breakfast and threw on all the coals at once and put two lumps of sugar in his tea i hope everybody had a merry christmas and heres a happy new year to all the world on that morning the day after christmas poor bob cratchit crept into the office a few minutes late expecting to be roundly abused and scolded for it but no such thing his master was there with his back to a good fire and actually smiling and he shook hands with his clerk telling him heartily he was going to raise his salary and asking quite affectionately after tiny tim and mind you make up a good fire in your room before you set to work bob he said as he closed his own door bob could hardly believe his eyes and ears but it was all true such doings as they had on new years day had never been seen before in the cratchits home nor such a turkey as mr scrooge sent them for dinner tiny tim had his share too for tiny tim did not die not a bit of it mr scrooge was a second father to him from that day he wanted for nothing and grew up strong and hearty mr scrooge loved him and well he might for was it not tiny tim who had without knowing it through the christmas dreamspirit touched his hard heart and caused him to become a good and happy man iii the runaway couple the boots at the holly tree inn was the young man named cobbs who blacked the shoes and ran errands and waited on the people at the inn and this is the story that he told one day supposing a young gentleman not eight years old was to run away with a fine young woman of seven would you consider that a queer start that there is a start as ithe boots at the holly tree innhave seen with my own eyes and i cleaned the shoes they ran away in and they was so little that i couldnt get my hand into em master harry walmers father he lived at the elms away by shooters hill six or seven miles from london he was uncommon proud of master harry as he was his only child but he didnt spoil him neither he was a gentleman that had a will of his own and an eye of his own and that would be minded consequently though he made quite a companion of the fine bright boy still he kept the command over him and the child was a child i was undergardener there at that time and one morning master harry he comes to me and says cobbs how should you spell norah if you was asked and then begun cutting it in print all over the fence he couldnt say he had taken particular notice of children before that but really it was pretty to see them two mites agoing about the place together deep in love and the courage of the boy bless your soul hed have throwed off his little hat and tucked up his little sleeves and gone in at a lion he would if they had happened to meet one and she had been frightened of him one day he stops along with her where boots was hoeing weeds in the gravel and saysspeaking up cobbs he says i like you do you sir im proud to hear it yes i do cobbs why do i like you do you think cobbs dont know master harry i am sure because norah likes you cobbs indeed sir thats very gratifying gratifying cobbs its better than millions of the brightest diamonds to be liked by norah certainly sir youre going away aint you cobbs yes sir would you like another situation cobbs well sir i shouldnt object if it was a good un then cobbs says he you shall be our headgardener when we are married and he tucks her in her little skyblue mantle under his arm and walks away it was better than a picter and equal to a play to see them babies with their long bright curling hair their sparkling eyes and their beautiful light tread arambling about the garden deep in love boots was of opinion that the birds believed they was birds and kept up with em singing to please em sometimes they would creep under the tulip tree and would sit there with their arms round one anothers necks and their soft cheeks touching areading about the prince and the dragon and the good and bad enchanters and the kings fair daughter sometimes he would hear them planning about having a house in a forest keeping bees and a cow and living entirely on milk and honey once he came upon them by the pond and heard master harry say adorable norah kiss me and say you love me to distraction or ill jump in headforemost and boots made no question he would have done it if she hadnt done as he asked her cobbs says master harry one evening when cobbs was watering the flowers i am going on a visit this present midsummer to my grandmammas at york are you indeed sir i hope youll have a pleasant time i am going into yorkshire myself when i leave here are you going to your grandmammas cobbs no sir i havent got such a thing not as a grandmamma cobbs no sir the boy looked on at the watering of the flowers for a little while and then said i shall be very glad indeed to go cobbsnorahs going youll be all right then sir says cobbs with your beautiful sweetheart by your side cobbs returned the boy flushing i never let anybody joke about it when i can prevent them it wasnt a joke sir says cobbs with humilitywasnt so meant i am glad of that cobbs because i like you you know and youre going to live with us cobbs sir what do you think my grandmamma gives me when i go down there i couldnt so much as make a guess sir a bank of england fivepound note cobbsa whew says cobbs thats a spanking sum of money master harry a person could do a great deal with such a sum of money as that couldnt a person cobbs i believe you sir cobbs said the boy ill tell you a secret at norahs house they have been joking her about me and pretending to laugh at our being engaged pretending to make game of it cobbs such sir says cobbs is the wickedness of human natur the boy looking exactly like his father stood for a few minutes with his glowing face towards the sunset and then departed with good night cobbs im going in i was the boots at the holly tree inn when one summer afternoon the coach drives up and out of the coach gets these two children the guard says to our governor the innkeeper i dont quite make out these little passengers but the young gentlemans words was that they were to be brought here the young gentleman gets out hands his lady out gives the driver something for himself says to our governor were to stop here tonight please sittingroom and two bedrooms will be required chops and cherrypudding for two and tucks her in her little skyblue mantle under his arm and walks into the house much bolder than brass boots leaves me to judge what the amazement of that establishment was when those two tiny creatures all alone by themselves was marched into the parlormuch more so when he who had seen them without their seeing him gave the governor his views of the errand they was upon cobbs says the governor if this is so i must set off myself to york and quiet their friends minds in which case you must keep your eye upon em and humor em till i come back but before i take these measures cobbs i should wish you to find out from themselves whether your opinions is correct sir to you says cobbs that shall be done directly so boots goes up stairs to the parlor and there he finds master harry on an enormous sofa adrying the eyes of miss norah with his pockethankecher their little legs were entirely off the ground of course and it really is not possible for boots to express to me how small them children looked its cobbs its cobbs cries master harry and comes running to him and catching hold of his hand miss norah comes running to him on tother side and catching hold of his tother hand and they both jump for joy i see you agetting out sir says cobbs i thought it was you i thought i couldnt be mistaken in your height and figure whats the object of your journey sir are you going to be married we are going to be married cobbs at gretna green returned the boy we have run away on purpose norah has been in rather low spirits cobbs but shell be happy now we have found you to be our friend thank you sir and thank you miss says cobbs for your good opinion did you bring any luggage with you sir if i will believe boots when he gives me his word and honor upon it the lady had got a parasol a smellingbottle a round and a half of cold buttered toast eight peppermint drops and a hairbrushseemingly a dolls the gentleman had got about half a dozen yards of string a knife three or four sheets of writingpaper folded up surprisingly small an orange and a china mug with his name upon it what may be the exact natur of your plans sir says cobbs to go on replied the boywhich the courage of that boy was something wonderfulin the morning and be married tomorrow just so sir says cobbs would it meet your views sir if i was to go with you when cobbs said this they both jumped for joy again and cried out oh yes yes cobbs yes well sir says cobbs if you will excuse my having the freedom to give an opinion what i should recommend would be this im acquainted with a pony sir which put in a phaeton that i could borrow would take you and mrs harry walmers jr myself driving if you agree to the end of your journey in a very short space of time i am not altogether sure sir that this pony will be at liberty tomorrow but even if you had to wait over tomorrow for him it might be worth your while as to the small account for your board here sir in case you was to find yourself running at all short that dont signify because im a part proprietor of this inn and it could stand over boots tells me that when they clapped their hands and jumped for joy again and called him good cobbs and dear cobbs and bent across him to kiss one another in the delight of their trusting hearts he felt himself the meanest rascal for deceiving em that ever was born is there anything you want just at present sir says cobbs mortally ashamed of himself we would like some cakes after dinner answered master harry folding his arms putting out one leg and looking straight at him and two applesand jam with dinner we should like to have toast and water but norah has always been accustomed to half a glass of currant wine at dessert and so have i it shall be ordered at the bar sir says cobbs and away he went the way in which the women of that housewithout exceptioneveryone of emmarried and single took to that boy when they heard the story boots considers surprising it was as much as he could do to keep em from dashing into the room and kissing him they climbed up all sorts of places at the risk of their lives to look at him through a pane of glass they were seven deep at the keyhole they were out of their minds about him and his bold spirit in the evening boots went into the room to see how the runaway couple was getting on the gentleman was on the windowseat supporting the lady in his arms she had tears upon her face and was lying very tired and halfasleep with her head upon his shoulder mrs harry walmers jr tired sir says cobbs yes she is tired cobbs but she is not used to be away from home and she has been in low spirits again cobbs do you think you could bring a biffin please i ask your pardon sir says cobbs what was it you i think a norfolk biffinb would rouse her cobbs she is very fond of them boots withdrew in search of the required restorative and when he brought it in the gentleman handed it to the lady and fed her with a spoon and took a little himself the lady being heavy with sleep and rather cross what should you think sir says cobbs of a chamber candlestick the gentleman approved the chambermaid went first up the great staircase the lady in her skyblue mantle followed gallantly led by the gentleman the gentleman kissed her at the door and retired to his own room where boots softly locked him up boots couldnt but feel what a base deceiver he was when they asked him at breakfast they had ordered sweet milkandwater and toast and currant jelly overnight about the pony it really was as much as he could do he dont mind confessing to me to look them two young things in the face and think how wicked he had grown up to be howsomever he went on alying like a trojan about the pony he told em it did so unfortunately happen that the pony was halfclipped you see and that he couldnt be taken out in that state for fear that it should strike to his inside but that hed be finished clipping in the course of the day and that tomorrow morning at eight oclock the phaeton would be ready boots view of the whole case looking back upon it in my room is that mrs harry walmers jr was beginning to give in she hadnt had her hair curled when she went to bed and she didnt seem quite up to brushing it herself and its getting in her eyes put her out but nothing put out master harry he sat behind his breakfast cup atearing away at the jelly as if he had been his own father after breakfast boots is inclined to think that they drawed soldiersat least he knows that many such was found in the fireplace all on horseback in the course of the morning master harry rang the bellit was surprising how that there boy did carry onand said in a sprightly way cobbs is there any good walks in this neighborhood yes sir says cobbs theres love lane get out with you cobbsthat was that there boys expressionyoure joking begging your pardon sir says cobbs there really is love lane and a pleasant walk it is and proud i shall be to show it to yourself and mrs harry walmers jr norah dear said master harry this is curious we really ought to see love lane put on your bonnet my sweetest darling and we will go there with cobbs boots leaves me to judge what a beast he felt himself to be when that young pair told him as they all three jogged along together that they had made up their minds to give him two thousand guineas a year as headgardener on account of his being so true a friend to em boots could have wished at the moment that the earth would have opened and swallowed him up he felt so mean with their beaming eyes alooking at him and believing him well sir he turned the conversation as well as he could and he took em down love lane to the watermeadows and there master harry would have drowned himself in half a moment more agetting out a waterlily for herbut nothing frightened that boy well sir they was tired out all being so new and strange to em they was tired as tired could be and they laid down on a bank of daisies like the children in the wood leastways meadows and fell asleep well sir they woke up at last and then one thing was getting pretty clear to boots namely that mrs harry walmers jr temper was on the move when master harry took her round the waist she said he teased her so and when he says norah my young may moon your harry tease you she tells him yes and i want to go home however master harry he kept up and his noble heart was as fond as ever mrs walmers turned very sleepy about dusk and began to cry therefore mrs walmers went off to bed as per yesterday and master harry ditto repeated about eleven or twelve at night comes back the innkeeper in a chaise along with mr walmers and an elderly lady mr walmers looks amused and very serious both at once and says to our missis we are very much indebted to you maam for your kind care of our little children which we can never sufficiently acknowledge pray maam where is my boy our missis says cobbs has the dear children in charge sir cobbs show forty then he says to cobbs ah cobbs i am glad to see you i understand you was here and cobbs says yes sir your most obedient sir i may be surprised to hear boots say it perhaps but boots assures me that his heart beat like a hammer going upstairs i beg your pardon sir says he while unlocking the door i hope you are not angry with master harry for master harry is a fine boy sir and will do you credit and honor and boots signifies to me that if the fine boys father had contradicted him in the daring state of mind in which he then was he thinks he should have fetched him a crack and taken the consequences but mr walmers only says no cobbs no my good fellow thank you and the door being open goes in boots goes in too holding the light and he sees mr walmers go up to the bedside bend gently down and kiss the little sleeping face then he stands looking at it for a minute looking wonderfully like it and then he gently shakes the little shoulder harry my dear boy harry master harry starts up and looks at him looks at cobbs too such is the honor of that mite that he looks at cobbs to see whether he has brought him into trouble i am not angry my child i only want you to dress yourself and come home yes pa master harry dresses himself quickly his breast begins to swell when he has nearly finished and it swells more and more as he stands alooking at his father his father standing alooking at him the quiet image of him please may ithe spirit of that little creatur and the way he kept his rising tears downplease dear pamay ikiss norah before i go you may my child so he takes master harry in his hand and boots leads the way with the candle and they come to that other bedroom where the elderly lady is seated by the bed and poor little mrs harry walmers jr is fast asleep there the father lifts the child up to the pillow and he lays his little face down for an instant by the little warm face of poor unconscious little mrs harry walmers jr and gently draws it to hima sight so touching to the chambermaids who are peeping through the door that one of them calls out its a shame to part em but this chambermaid was always as boots informs me a softhearted one not that there was any harm in that girl far from it footnotes a for the benefit of some of our young readers it may be well to explain that this is about the same as a bill of twentyfive dollars would be in america b a biffin is a red apple growing near norfolk and generally eaten after having been baked iv little dorrit many years ago when people could be put in prison for debt a poor gentleman who was unfortunate enough to lose all his money was brought to the marshalsea prison which was the prison where debtors were kept as there seemed no prospect of being able to pay his debts his wife and their two little children came to live there with him the elder child was a boy of three the younger a little girl of two years old and not long afterwards another little girl was born the three children played in the courtyard and on the whole were happy for they were too young to remember a happier state of things but the youngest child who had never been outside the prison walls was a thoughtful little creature and wondered what the outside world could be like her great friend the turnkey who was also her godfather became very fond of her and as soon as she could walk and talk he brought a little armchair and stood it by his fire at the lodge and coaxed her with cheap toys to come and sit with him in return the child loved him dearly and would often bring her doll to dress and undress as she sat in the little armchair she was still a very tiny creature when she began to understand that everyone did not live locked up inside high walls with spikes at the top and though she and the rest of the family might pass through the door that the great key opened her father could not and she would look at him with a wondering pity in her tender little heart one day she was sitting in the lodge gazing wistfully up at the sky through the barred window the turnkey after watching her some time said thinking of the fields aint you where are they she asked why theyreover there my dear said the turnkey waving his key vaguely just about there does anybody open them and shut them are they locked well said the turnkey not knowing what to say not in general are they pretty bob she called him bob because he wished it lovely full of flowers theres buttercups and theres daisies and theres here he hesitated not knowing the names of many flowerstheres dandelions and all manner of games is it very pleasant to be there bob prime said the turnkey was father ever there hem coughed the turnkey o yes he was there sometimes is he sorry not to be there now nnot particular said the turnkey nor any of the people she asked glancing at the listless crowd within o are you quite sure and certain bob at this point bob gave in and changed the subject to candy but after this chat the turnkey and little amy would go out on his free sunday afternoons to some meadows or green lanes and she would pick grass and flowers to bring home while he smoked his pipe and then they would go to some teagardens for shrimps and tea and other delicacies and would come back hand in hand unless she was very tired and had fallen asleep on his shoulder when amy was only eight years old her mother died and the poor father was more helpless and brokendown than ever and as fanny was a careless child and edward idle the little one who had the bravest and truest heart was led by her love and unselfishness to be the little mother of the forlorn family and struggled to get some little education for herself and her brother and sister at first such a baby could do little more than sit with her father deserting her livelier place by the high fender and quietly watching him but this made her so far necessary to him that he became accustomed to her and began to be sensible of missing her when she was not there through this little gate she passed out of her childhood into the careladen world what her pitiful look saw at that early time in her father in her sister in her brother in the jail how much or how little of the wretched truth it pleased god to make plain to her lies hidden with many mysteries it is enough that she was inspired to be something which was not what the rest were and to be that something different and laborious for the sake of the rest inspired yes shall we speak of a poet or a priest and not of the heart impelled by love and selfdevotion to the lowliest work in the lowliest way of life the family stayed so long in the prison that the old man came to be known as the father of the marshalsea and little amy who had never known any other home as the child of the marshalsea at thirteen she could read and keep accountsthat is could put down in words and figures how much the bare necessaries that they wanted would cost and how much less they had to buy them with she had been by snatches of a few weeks at a time to an evening school outside and got her sister and brother sent to dayschools from time to time during three or four years there was no teaching for any of them at home but she knew wellno one betterthat a man so broken as to be the father of the marshalsea could be no father to his own children to these scanty means of improvement she added another of her own contriving once among the crowd of prisoners there appeared a dancingmaster her sister had a great desire to learn the dancingmasters art and seemed to have a taste that way at thirteen years old the child of the marshalsea presented herself to the dancingmaster with a little bag in her hand and offered her humble petition if you please i was born here sir oh you are the young lady are you said the dancingmaster surveying the small figure and uplifted face yes sir and what can i do for you said the dancingmaster nothing for me sir thank you anxiously undrawing the strings of the little bag but if while you stay here you could be so kind as to teach my sister cheap my child ill teach her for nothing said the dancingmaster shutting up the bag he was as goodnatured a dancingmaster as ever danced to the insolvent court and he kept his word the sister was so apt a pupil and the dancingmaster had such abundant time to give her that wonderful progress was made indeed the dancingmaster was so proud of it and so wishful to show it before he left to a few select friends among the collegians the debtors in the prison were called collegians that at six oclock on a certain fine morning an exhibition was held in the yardthe collegerooms being of too small size for the purposein which so much ground was covered and the steps were so well executed that the dancingmaster having to play his fiddle besides was thoroughly tired out the success of this beginning which led to the dancingmasters continuing his teaching after his release led the poor child to try again she watched and waited months for a seamstress in the fullness of time a milliner came in sent there like all the rest for a debt which she could not pay and to her she went to ask a favor for herself i beg your pardon maam she said looking timidly round the door of the milliner whom she found in tears and in bed but i was born here everybody seemed to hear of her as soon as they arrived for the milliner sat up in bed drying her eyes and said just as the dancingmaster had said oh you are the child are you yes maam i am sorry i havent got anything for you said the milliner shaking her head its not that maam if you please i want to learn needlework why should you do that returned the milliner with me before you it has not done me much good nothingwhatever it isseems to have done anybody much good who comes here she returned in her simple way but i want to learn just the same i am afraid you are so weak you see the milliner objected i dont think i am weak maam and you are so very very little you see the milliner objected yes i am afraid i am very little indeed returned the child of the marshalsea and so began to sob over that unfortunate smallness of hers which came so often in her way the millinerwho was not unkind or hardhearted only badly in debtwas touched took her in hand with goodwill found her the most patient and earnest of pupils and made her a good workwoman in course of time the father of the marshalsea gradually developed a new trait of character he was very greatly ashamed of having his two daughters work for their living and tried to make it appear that they were only doing work for pleasure not for pay but at the same time he would take money from any one who would give it to him without any sense of shame with the same hand that had pocketed a fellowprisoners halfcrown half an hour ago he would wipe away the tears that streamed over his cheeks if anything was spoken of his daughters earning their bread so over and above her other daily cares the child of the marshalsea had always upon her the care of keeping up the makebelieve that they were all idle beggars together the sister became a dancer there was a ruined uncle in the family groupruined by his brother the father of the marshalsea and knowing no more how than his ruiner did but taking the fact as something that could not be helped naturally a retired and simple man he had shown no particular sense of being ruined at the time when that calamity fell upon him further than he left off washing himself when the shock was announced and never took to washing his face and hands any more he had been a rather poor musician in his better days and when he fell with his brother supported himself in a poor way by playing a clarionet as dirty as himself in a small theatre band it was the theatre in which his niece became a dancer he had been a fixture there a long time when she took her poor station in it and he accepted the task of serving as her guardian just as he would have accepted an illness a legacy a feast starvationanything but soap to enable this girl to earn her few weekly shillings it was necessary for the child of the marshalsea to go through a careful form with her father fanny is not going to live with us just now father she will be here a good deal in the day but she is going to live outside with uncle you surprise me why i think uncle wants a companion father he should be attended to and looked after a companion he passes much of his time here and you attend and look after him amy a great deal more than ever your sister will you all go out so much you all go out so much this was to keep up the form and pretense of his having no idea that amy herself went out by the day to work but we are always very glad to come home father now are we not and as to fanny perhaps besides keeping uncle company and taking care of him it may be as well for her not quite to live here always she was not born here as i was you know father well amy well i dont quite follow you but its natural i suppose that fanny should prefer to be outside and even that you often should too so you and fanny and your uncle my dear shall have your own way good good ill not meddle dont mind me to get her brother out of the prison out of the low work of running errands for the prisoners outside and out of the bad company into which he had fallen was her hardest task at eighteen years of age her brother edward would have dragged on from hand to mouth from hour to hour from penny to penny until eighty nobody got into the prison from whom he gained anything useful or good and she could find no patron for him but her old friend and godfather the turnkey dear bob said she what is to become of poor tip his name was edward and ted had been changed into tip within the walls the turnkey had strong opinions of his own as to what would become of poor tip and had even gone so far with the view of preventing their fulfilment as to talk to tip in urging him to run away and serve his country as a soldier but tip had thanked him and said he didnt seem to care for his country well my dear said the turnkey something ought to be done with him suppose i try and get him into the law that would be so good of you bob the turnkey now began to speak to the lawyers as they passed in and out of the prison he spoke so perseveringly that a stool and twelve shillings a week were at last found for tip in the office of a lawyer at cliffords inn in the palace court tip idled in cliffords inn for six months and at the end of that term sauntered back one evening with his hands in his pockets and remarked to his sister that he was not going back again not going back again said the poor little anxious child of the marshalsea always calculating and planning for tip in the front rank of her charges i am so tired of it said tip that i have cut it tip tired of everything with intervals of marshalsea lounging and errandrunning his small second mother aided by her trusty friend got him into a warehouse into a market garden into the hop trade into the law again into an auctioneers into a brewery into a stockbrokers into the law again into a coach office into a wagon office into the law again into a general dealers into a distillery into the law again into a wool house into a dry goods house into the fishmarket into the foreign fruit trade and into the docks but whatever tip went into he came out of tired announcing that he had cut it wherever he went this useless tip appeared to take the prison walls with him and to set them up in such trade or calling and to prowl about within their narrow limits in the old slipshod purposeless downatheel way until the real immovable marshalsea walls asserted their power over him and brought him back nevertheless the brave little creature did so fix her heart on her brothers rescue that while he was ringing out these doleful changes she pinched and scraped enough together to ship him for canada when he was tired of nothing to do and disposed in its turn to cut even that he graciously consented to go to canada and there was grief in her bosom over parting with him and joy in the hope of his being put in a straight course at last god bless you dear tip dont be too proud to come and see us when you have made your fortune all right said tip and went but not all the way to canada in fact not further than liverpool after making the voyage to that port from london he found himself so strongly impelled to cut the vessel that he resolved to walk back again carrying out which intention he presented himself before her at the expiration of a month in rags without shoes and much more tired than ever at length after another period of running errands he found a pursuit for himself and announced it amy i have got a situation have you really and truly tip all right i shall do now you neednt look anxious about me any more old girl what is it tip why you know slingo by sight not the man they call the dealer thats the chap hell be out on monday and hes going to give me a berth what is he a dealer in tip horses all right i shall do now amy she lost sight of him for months afterwards and only heard from him once a whisper passed among the elder prisoners that he had been seen at a mock auction in moorfields pretending to buy plated articles for real silver and paying for them with the greatest liberality in banknotes but it never reached her ears one evening she was alone at workstanding up at the window to save the twilight lingering above the wallwhen he opened the door and walked in she kissed and welcomed him but was afraid to ask him any question he saw how anxious and timid she was and appeared sorry i am afraid amy youll be vexed this time upon my life i am i am very sorry to hear you say so tip have you come back whyyes not expecting this time that what you had found would answer very well i am less surprised and sorry than i might have been tip ah but thats not the worst of it not the worst of it dont look so startled no amy not the worst of it i have come back you see butdont look so startledi have come back in what i may call a new way i am off the volunteer list altogether i am in now as one of the regulars im here in prison for debt like everybody else oh dont say that you are a prisoner tip dont dont well i dont want to say it he returned in unwilling tone but if you cant understand me without my saying it what am i to do i am in for forty pound odd for the first time in all those years she sunk under her cares she cried with her clasped hands lifted above her head that it would kill their father if he ever knew it and fell down at tips worthless feet it was easier for tip to bring her to her senses than for her to bring him to understand that the father of the marshalsea would be beside himself if he knew the truth tip thought that there was nothing strange in being there a prisoner but he agreed that his father should not be told about it there were plenty of reasons that could be given for his return it was accounted for to the father in the usual way and the collegians with a better understanding of the kind fraud than tip stood by it faithfully this was the life and this the history of the child of the marshalsea at twentytwo with a still abiding interest in the one miserable yard and block of houses as her birthplace and home she passed to and fro in it shrinking now with a womanly consciousness that she was pointed out to everyone since she had begun to work beyond the walls she had found it necessary to hide where she lived and to come and go secretly as she could between the free city and the iron gates outside of which she had never slept in her life her original timidity had grown with this concealment and her light step and her little figure shunned the thronged streets while they passed along them worldly wise in hard and poor necessities she was innocent in all things else innocent in the mist through which she saw her father and the prison and the dark living river that flowed through it and flowed on illustration mr clennam followed her home page this was the life and this the history of little dorrit until the son of a lady mrs clennam to whose house amy went to do needlework became interested in the pale patient little creature he followed her to her home one day and when he found that it was the debtors prison he walked in learning her sad history from her father arthur clennam resolved to do his best to try to get him released and to help them all one day when he was walking home with amy to try to find out the names of some of the people her father owed money to a voice was heard calling little mother little mother and a strange figure came bouncing up to them and fell down scattering her basketful of potatoes on the ground oh maggie said amy what a clumsy child you are she was about eight and twenty with large bones large features large hands and feet large eyes and no hair amy told mr clennam that maggie was the granddaughter of her old nurse who had been dead a long time and that her grandmother had been very unkind to her and beat her when maggie was ten years old she had a fever and she has never grown older since ten years old said maggie but what a nice hospital so comfortable wasnt it such a evnly place such beds there is there such lemonades such oranges such delicious broth and wine such chicking oh aint it a delightful place to stop at poor maggie thought that a hospital was the nicest place in all the world because she had never seen another home as good for years and years she looked back to the hospital as a sort of heaven on earth then when she came out her grandmother did not know what to do with her and was very unkind but after some time maggie tried to improve and was very attentive and industrious and now she can earn her own living entirely sir amy did not say who had taken pains to teach and encourage the poor halfwitted creature but mr clennam guessed from the name little mother and the fondness of the poor creature for amy one cold wet evening amy and maggie went to mr clennams house to thank him for having freed edward from the prison and on coming out found it was too late to get home as the gate was locked they tried to get in at maggies lodgings but though they knocked twice the people were asleep as amy did not wish to disturb them they wandered about all night sometimes sitting at the gate of the prison maggie shivering and whimpering it will soon be over dear said patient amy oh its all very well for you mother said maggie but im a poor thing only ten years old thanks to mr clennam a great change took place in the fortunes of the family and not long after this wretched night it was discovered that mr dorrit was owner of a large property and they became very rich but little dorrit never forgot as sad to say the rest of the family did the friends who had been kind to them in their poverty and when in his turn mr clennam became a prisoner in the marshalsea little dorrit came to comfort and console him and after many changes of fortune she became his wife and they lived happy ever after v the toymaker and his blind daughter caleb plummer and his blind daughter lived alone in a little cracked nutshell of a house they were toymakers and their house which was so small that it might have been knocked to pieces with a hammer and carried away in a cart was stuck like a toadstool on to the premises of messrs gruff tackleton the toy merchants for whom they workedthe latter of whom was himself both gruff and tackleton in one i am saying that caleb and his blind daughter lived here i should say caleb did while his daughter lived in an enchanted palace which her fathers love had created for her she did not know that the ceilings were cracked the plaster tumbling down and the woodwork rotten that everything was old and ugly and povertystricken about her and that her father was a grayhaired stooping old man and the master for whom they worked a hard and brutal taskmaster oh dear no she fancied a pretty cosy compact little home full of tokens of a kind masters care a smart brisk gallantlooking father and a handsome and noblelooking toy merchant who was an angel of goodness this was all calebs doing when his blind daughter was a baby he had determined in his great love and pity for her that her loss of sight should be turned into a blessing and her life as happy as he could make it and she was happy everything about her she saw with her fathers eyes in the rainbowcolored light with which it was his care and pleasure to invest it caleb and his daughter were at work together in their usual workingroom which served them for their ordinary livingroom as well and a strange place it was there were houses in it finished and unfinished for dolls of all stations in life tenement houses for dolls of moderate means kitchens and single apartments for dolls of the lower classes capital town residences for dolls of high estate some of these establishments were already furnished with a view to the needs of dolls of little money others could be fitted on the most expensive scale at a moments notice from whole shelves of chairs and tables sofas bedsteads and upholstery the nobility and gentry and public in general for whose use these dollhouses were planned lay here and there in baskets staring straight up at the ceiling but in showing their degrees in society and keeping them in their own stations which is found to be exceedingly difficult in real life the makers of these dolls had far improved on nature for they not resting on such marks as satin cottonprint and bits of rag had made differences which allowed of no mistake thus the dolllady of high rank had wax limbs of perfect shape but only she and those of her grade the next grade in the social scale being made of leather and the next coarse linen stuff as to the commonpeople they had just so many matches out of tinderboxes for their arms and legs and there they wereestablished in their place at once beyond the possibility of getting out of it there were various other samples of his handicraft besides dolls in caleb plummers room there were noahs arks in which the birds and beasts were an uncommonly tight fit i assure you though they could be crammed in anyhow at the roof and rattled and shaken into the smallest compass most of these noahs arks had knockers on the doors perhaps not exactly suitable to an ark as suggestive of morning callers and a postman yet a pleasant finish to the outside of the building there were scores of melancholy little carts which when the wheels went round performed most doleful music many small fiddles drums and other instruments of torture no end of cannon shields swords spears and guns there were little tumblers in red breeches incessantly swarming up high obstacles of redtape and coming down head first upon the other side and there were innumerable old gentlemen of respectable even venerable appearance flying like crazy people over pegs inserted for the purpose in their own streetdoors there were beasts of all sorts horses in particular of every breed from the spotted barrel on four pegs with a small tippet for a mane to the fine rocking horse on his highest mettle you were out in the rain last night in your beautiful new overcoat said bertha yes in my beautiful new overcoat answered caleb glancing to where a roughlymade garment of sackcloth was hung up to dry how glad i am you bought it father and of such a tailor quite a fashionable tailor a bright blue cloth with bright buttons its a deal too good a coat for me too good cried the blind girl stopping to laugh and clap her handsas if anything was too good for my handsome father with his smiling face and black hair and his straight figure as if any thing could be too good for my handsome father im half ashamed to wear it though said caleb watching the effect of what he said upon her brightening face upon my word when i hear the boys and people say behind me halloa heres a swell i dont know which way to look and when the beggar wouldnt go away last night and when i said i was a very common man said no your honor bless your honor dont say that i was quite ashamed i really felt as if i hadnt a right to wear it happy blind girl how merry she was in her joy i see you father she said clasping her hands as plainly as if i had the eyes i never want when you are with me a blue coat bright blue said caleb yes yes bright blue exclaimed the girl turning up her radiant face the color i can just remember in the blessed sky you told me it was blue before a bright blue coat made loose to the figure suggested caleb yes loose to the figure cried the blind girl laughing heartily and in it you dear father with your merry eye your smiling face your free step and your dark hair looking so young and handsome halloa halloa said caleb i shall be vain presently i think you are already cried the blind girl pointing at him in her glee i know you father ha ha ha ive found you out you see how different the picture in her mind from caleb as he sat observing her she had spoken of his free step she was right in that for years and years he never once had crossed that threshold at his own slow pace but with a footfall made ready for her ear and never had he when his heart was heaviest forgotten the light tread that was to render hers so cheerful and courageous there we are said caleb falling back a pace or two to form the better judgment of his work as near the real thing as sixpenorth of halfpence is to sixpence what a pity that the whole front of the house opens at once if there was only a staircase in it now and regular doors to the rooms to go in at but thats the worst of my calling im always fooling myself and cheating myself you are speaking quite softly you are not tired father tired echoed caleb with a great burst in his manner what should tire me bertha i was never tired what does it mean to give the greater force to his words he stopped himself in an imitation of two small stretching and yawning figures on the mantelshelf who were shown as in one eternal state of weariness from the waist upwards and hummed a bit of a song it was a drinking song something about a sparkling bowl and he sang it with an air of a devilmaycare voice that made his face a thousand times more meager and more thoughtful than ever what youre singing are you said tackleton the toyseller for whom he worked putting his head in at the door go it i cant sing nobody would have thought that tackleton could sing he hadnt what is generally termed a singing face by any means i cant afford to sing said tackleton im glad you can i hope you can afford to work too hardly time for both i should think if you could only see him bertha how hes winking at me whispered caleb such a man to joke youd think if you didnt know him he was in earnest wouldnt you now the blind girl smiled and nodded i am thanking you for the little tree the beautiful little tree replied bertha bringing forward a tiny rosetree in blossom which by an innocent story caleb had made her believe was her masters gift though he himself had gone without a meal or two to buy it the bird that can sing and wont sing must be made to sing they say grumbled tackleton what about the owl that cant sing and oughtnt to sing and will sing is there anything that he should be made to do the extent to which hes winking at this moment whispered caleb to his daughter oh my gracious always merry and lighthearted with us cried the smiling bertha oh youre there are you answered tackleton poor idiot he really did believe she was an idiot and he founded the belief i cant say whether consciously or not upon her being fond of him well and being therehow are you said tackleton in his cross way oh well quite well and as happy as even you can wish me to be as happy as you would make the whole world if you could poor idiot muttered tackleton no gleam of reason not a gleam the blind girl took his hand and kissed it held it for a moment in her own two hands and laid her cheek against it tenderly before releasing it there was such unspeakable affection and such fervent gratitude in the act that tackleton himself was moved to say in a milder growl than usual whats the matter now bertha said tackleton assuming for once a little cordiality come here oh i can come straight to you you neednt guide me she rejoined shall i

looking at her for you seem to have forgotten all about it already caleb i may venture to say im here i suppose thought caleb sir take care she dont forget what ive been saying to her she never forgets returned caleb its one of the few things she aint clever in every man thinks his own geese swans observed the toy merchant with a shrug poor devil having delivered himself of which remark with infinite contempt old gruff tackleton withdrew bertha remained where he had left her lost in meditation the gaiety had vanished from her downcast face and it was very sad three or four times she shook her head as if bewailing some remembrance or some loss but her sorrowful reflections found no vent in words father i am lonely in the dark i want my eyes my patient willing eyes here they are said caleb always ready they are more yours than mine bertha any hour in the fourandtwenty what shall your eyes do for you dear look round the room father all right said caleb no sooner said than done bertha tell me about it its much the same as usual said caleb homely but very snug the gay colors on the walls the bright flowers on the plates and dishes the shining wood where there are beams or panels the general cheerfulness and neatness of the building make it very pretty cheerful and neat it was wherever berthas hands could busy themselves but nowhere else were cheerfulness and neatness possible in the crazy shed which calebs fancy so transformed you have your working dress on and are not so gay as when you wear the handsome coat said bertha touching him not quite so gay answered caleb pretty brisk though father said the blind girl drawing close to his side and stealing one arm round his neck tell me something about may she is very fair she is indeed said caleb and she was indeed it was quite a rare thing to caleb not to have to draw on his invention her hair is dark said bertha pensively darker than mine her voice is sweet and musical i know i have often loved to hear it her shape theres not a dolls in all the room to equal it said caleb and her eyes he stopped for bertha had drawn closer round his neck and from the arm that clung about him came a warning pressure which he understood too well he coughed a moment hammered for a moment and then fell back upon the song about the sparkling bowl the song which helped him through all such difficulties our friend father the one who has helped us so many times mr tackleton i am never tired you know of hearing about him now was i ever she said hastily of course not answered caleb and with reason ah with how much reason cried the blind girl with such fervency that caleb though his motives were pure could not endure to meet her face but dropped his eyes as if she could have read in them his innocent deceit then tell me again about him dear father said bertha many times again his face is good kind and tender honest and true i am sure it is the manly heart that tries to cloak all favors with a show of roughness and unwillingness beats in its every look and glance and makes it noble added caleb in his quiet desperation and makes it noble cried the blind girl he is older than may father yees said caleb reluctantly hes a little older than may but that dont signify bertha said caleb softly what has happened how changed you are my darling in a few hourssince this morning you silent and dull all day what is it tell me oh father father cried the blind girl bursting into tears oh my hard hard fate caleb drew his hand across his eyes before he answered her but think how cheerful and how happy you have been bertha how good and how much loved by many people that strikes me to the heart dear father always so mindful of me always so kind to me caleb was very much perplexed to understand her to beto be blind bertha my poor dear he faltered is a great affliction but i have never felt it cried the blind girl i have never felt it in its fullness never i have sometimes wished that i could see you or could see him only once dear father only for one little minute but father oh my good gentle father bear with me if i am wicked said the blind girl this is not the sorrow that so weighs me down bertha my dear said caleb i have something on my mind i want to tell you while we are alone hear me kindly i have a confession to make to you my darling a confession father i have wandered from the truth and lost myself my child said caleb with a pitiable look on his bewildered face i have wandered from the truth intending to be kind to you and have been cruel she turned her wonderstricken face towards him and repeated cruel he cruel to me cried bertha with a smile of incredulity not meaning it my child said caleb but i have been though i never suspected it till yesterday my dear blind daughter hear me and forgive me the world you live in heart of mine doesnt exist as i have represented it the eyes you have trusted in have been false to you she turned her wonderstricken face towards him still your road in life was rough my poor one said caleb and i meant to smooth it for you i have altered objects invented many things that never have been to make you happier i have had concealments from you put deceptions on you god forgive me and surrounded you with fancies but living people are not fancies she said hurriedly and turning very pale and still retiring from him you cant change them i have done so bertha pleaded caleb there is one person that you know my dove oh father why do you say i know she answered in a tone of keen reproach what and whom do i know i who have no leader i so miserably blind in the anguish of her heart she stretched out her hands as if she were groping her way then spread them in a manner most forlorn and sad upon her face the marriage that takes place today said caleb is with a stern sordid grinding man a hard master to you and me my dear for many years ugly in his looks and in his nature cold and callous always unlike what i have painted him to you in everything my child in everything oh why cried the blind girl tortured as it seemed almost beyond endurance why did you ever do this why did you ever fill my heart so full and then come in like death and tear away the objects of my love oh heaven how blind i am how helpless and alone her afflicted father hung his head and offered no reply but in his grief tell me what my home is what it truly is it is a poor place bertha very poor and bare indeed the house will scarcely keep out wind and rain another winter it is as roughly shielded from the weather bertha as your poor father in his sackcloth coat those presents that i took such care of that came almost at my wish and were so dearly welcome to me she said trembling where did they come from caleb did not answer she knew already and was silent i see i understand said bertha and now i am looking at you at my kind loving compassionate father tell me what is he like an old man my child thin bent grayhaired wornout with hard work and sorrow a weak foolish deceitful old man the blind girl threw herself on her knees before him and took his gray head in her arms it is my sight it is my sight restored she cried i have been blind but now i see i have never till now truly seen my father does he think that there is a gay handsome father in this earth that i could love so dearly cherish so devotedly as this worn and grayheaded old man father there is not a gray hair on your head that shall be forgotten in my prayers and thanks to heaven my bertha sobbed caleb and the brisk smart father in the blue coathes gone my child dearest father no hes not gone nothing is gone everything i loved and believed in is here in this worn old father of mine and moreoh so much more too i have been happy and contented but i shall be happier and more contented still now that i know what you are i am not blind father any longer vi little nell the house where little nell and her grandfather lived was one of those places where old and curious things were kept one of those old houses which seem to crouch in odd corners of the town and to hide their musty treasures from the public eye in jealousy and distrust there were suits of mail standing like ghosts in armor here and there curious carvings brought from monkish cloisters rusty weapons of various kinds distorted figures in china and wood and iron and ivory tapestry and strange furniture that might have been designed in dreams and in the old dark dismal rooms there lived alone together the man and a childhis grandchild little nell solitary and dull as was her life the innocent and cheerful spirit of the child found happiness in all things and through the dim rooms of the old curiosity shop little nell went singing moving with gay and lightsome step illustration little nell and her grandfather page but gradually over the old man whom she so tenderly loved there stole a sad change he became thoughtful sad and wretched he had no sleep or rest but that which he took by day in his easychair for every night and all night long he was away from home to the child it seemed that her grandfathers love for her increased even with the hidden grief by which she saw him struck down and to see him sorrowful and not to know the cause of his sorrow to see him growing pale and weak under his trouble of mind so weighed upon her gentle spirit that at times she felt as though her heart must break at last the time came when the old mans feeble frame could bear up no longer against his hidden care a raging fever seized him and as he lay delirious or insensible through many weeks nell learned that the house which sheltered them was theirs no longer that in the future they would be very poor that they would scarcely have bread to eat at length the old man began to mend but his mind was weakened he would sit for hours together with nells small hand in his playing with the fingers and sometimes stopping to smooth her hair or kiss her brow and when he saw that tears were glistening in her eyes he would look amazed as the time drew near when they must leave the house he made no reference to the necessity of finding other shelter an indistinct idea he had that the child was desolate and in need of help though he seemed unable to understand their real position more distinctly but a change came upon him one evening as he and nell sat silently together let us speak softly nell he said hush for if they knew our purpose they would say that i was mad and take thee from me we will not stop here another day we will travel afoot through the fields and woods and trust ourselves to god in the places where he dwells tomorrow morning dear well turn our faces from this scene of sorrow and be as free and happy as the birds the childs heart beat high with hope and confidence she had no thought of hunger or cold or thirst or suffering to her it seemed that they might beg their way from door to door in happiness so that they were together when the day began to glimmer they stole out of the house and passing into the street stood still which way asked the child the old man looked doubtfully and helplessly at her and shook his head it was plain that she was thenceforth his guide and leader the child felt it but had no doubts or misgivings and putting her hand in his led him gently away forth from the city while it yet was asleep went the two poor wanderers going they knew not whither they passed through the long deserted streets in the glad light of early morning until these streets dwindled away and the open country was about them they walked all day and slept that night at a small cottage where beds were let to travelers the sun was setting on the second day of their journey and they were jaded and worn out with walking when following a path which led through a churchyard to the town where they were to spend the night they fell in with two traveling showmen the exhibitors or keepers of a punch and judy show these two men raised their eyes when the old man and his young companion were close upon them one of them the real exhibitor no doubt was a little merryfaced man with a twinkling eye and a red nose who seemed to be something like old punch himself the otherthat was he who took the moneyhad rather a careful and cautious look which perhaps came from his business also the merry man was the first to greet the strangers with a nod and following the old mans eyes he observed that perhaps that was the first time he had ever seen a punch off the stage why do you come here to do this said the old man sitting down beside them and looking at the figures with extreme delight why you see rejoined the little man were putting up for tonight at the public house yonder and it wouldnt do to let em see the present company undergoing repair no cried the old man making signs to nell to listen why not eh why not because it would destroy all the reality of the show and take away all the interest wouldnt it replied the little man would you care a hapenny for the lord chancellor if you knowd him in private and without his wigcertainly notc good said the old man venturing to touch one of the puppets and drawing away his hand with a shrill laugh are you going to show em tonight are you that is the purpose governor replied the other and unless im much mistaken tommy codlin is acalculating at this minute what weve lost through your coming upon us cheer up tommy it cant be much the little man accompanied these latter words with a wink expressive of the estimate he had formed of the travelers pocketbook to this mr codlin who had a surly grumbling manner replied as he twitched punch off the tombstone and flung him into the box i dont care if we havent lost a farden but youre too free if you stood in front of the curtain and see the publics faces as i do youd know human natur better turning over the figures in the box like one who knew and despised them mr codlin drew one forth and held it up for the inspection of his friend look here heres all this judys clothes falling to pieces again you havent got a needle and thread i suppose the little man shook his head and scratched it sadly as he contemplated this condition of a principal performer in his show seeing that they were at a loss the child said timidly i have a needle sir in my basket and thread too will you let me try to mend it for you i think i could do it neater than you could even mr codlin had nothing to urge against a proposal so seasonable nell kneeling down beside the box was soon busily engaged in her task and finished it in a wonderful way while she was thus at work the merry little man looked at her with an interest which did not appear to be any less when he glanced at her helpless companion when she had finished her work he thanked her and asked to what place they were traveling nno farther tonight i think said the child looking toward her grandfather if youre wanting a place to stop at the man remarked i should advise you to take up at the same house with us thats it the long low white house there its very cheap they went to the little inn and when they had been refreshed the whole house hurried away into an empty stable where the show stood and where by the light of a few flaring candles stuck round a hoop which hung by a line from the ceiling it was to be forthwith shown and now mr thomas codlin after blowing away at the pans pipes took his station on one side of the curtain which concealed the mover of the figures and putting his hands in his pockets prepared to reply to all questions and remarks of punch and to make a pretence of being his most intimate private friend of believing in him to the fullest and most unlimited extent of knowing that mr punch enjoyed day and night a merry and glorious life in that temple and that he was at all times and under every circumstance the same wise and joyful person that all present then beheld him the whole performance was applauded until the old stable rang and gifts were showered in with a liberality which testified yet more strongly to the general delight among the laughter none was more loud and frequent than the old mans nells was unheard for she poor child with her head drooping on his shoulder had fallen asleep and slept too soundly to be roused by any of his efforts to awaken her to a part in his glee the supper was very good but she was too tired to eat and yet would not leave the old man until she had kissed him in his bed he happily insensible to every care and anxiety sat listening with a vacant smile and admiring face to all that his new friends said and it was not until they retired yawning to their room that he followed the child upstairs she had a little money but it was very little and when that was gone they must begin to beg there was one piece of gold among it and a need might come when its worth to them would be increased a hundred times it would be best to hide this coin and never show it unless their case was entirely desperate and nothing else was left them her resolution taken she sewed the piece of gold into her dress and going to bed with a lighter heart sunk into a deep slumber and where are you going today said the little man the following morning addressing himself to nell indeed i hardly knowwe have not made up our minds yet replied the child were going on to the races said the little man if thats your way and you like to have us for company let us travel together if you prefer going alone only say the word and youll find that we shant trouble you well go with you said the old man nellwith them with them the child thought for a moment and knowing that she must shortly beg and could scarcely hope to do so at a better place than where crowds of rich ladies and gentlemen were met together for enjoyment determined to go with these men so far she therefore thanked the little man for his offer and said glancing timidly toward his friend that they would if there was no objection to their staying with them as far as the racetown and with these men they traveled forward on the following day they made two long days journey with their new companions passing through villages and towns and meeting upon one occasion with two young people walking upon stilts who were also going to the races and now they had come to the time when they must beg their bread soon after sunrise the second morning she stole out and rambling into some fields at a short distance plucked a few wild roses and such humble flowers purposing to make them into little nosegays and offer them to the ladies in the carriages when the company arrived her thoughts were not idle while she was thus busy when she returned and was seated beside the old man tying her flowers together while the two men lay dozing in the corner she plucked him by the sleeve and slightly glancing toward them said in a low voice grandfather dont look at those i talk of and dont seem as if i spoke of anything but what i am about what was that you told me before we left the old house that if they knew what we were going to do they would say that you were mad and part us the old man turned to her with a look of wild terror but she checked him by a look and bidding him hold some flowers while she tied them up and so bringing her lips closer to his ear said i know that was what you told me you neednt speak dear i recollect it very well it was not likely that i should forget it grandfather i have heard these men say they think that we have secretly left our friends and mean to carry us before some gentleman and have us taken care of and sent back if you let your hand tremble so we can never get away from them but if youre only quiet now we shall do so easily how muttered the old man dear nell how they will shut me up in a stoneroom dark and cold and chain me up to the wall nellflog me with whips and never let me see thee more youre trembling again said the child keep close to me all day never mind them dont look at them but me i shall find a time when we can steal away when i do mind you come with me and do not stop or speak a word hush thats all halloo what are you up to my dear said mr codlin raising his head and yawning making some nosegays the child replied i am going to try to sell some these three days of the races will you have oneas a present i mean mr codlin would have risen to receive it but the child hurried toward him and placed it in his hand and he stuck it in his buttonhole as the morning wore on the tents at the racecourse assumed a gayer and more brilliant appearance and long lines of carriages came rolling softly on the turf blackeyed gipsy girls their heads covered with showy handkerchiefs came out to tell fortunes and pale slender women with wasted faces followed the footsteps of conjurers and counted the sixpences with anxious eyes long before they were gained as many of the children as could be kept within bounds were stowed away with all the other signs of dirt and poverty among the donkeys carts and horses and as many as could not be thus disposed of ran in and out in all directions crept between peoples legs and carriage wheels and came forth unharmed from under horses hoofs the dancingdogs the stilts the little lady and the tall man and all the other attractions with organs out of number and bands innumerable came out from the holes and corners in which they had passed the night and flourished boldly in the sun along the uncleared course short led his party sounding the brazen trumpet and speaking in the voice of punch and at his heels went thomas codlin bearing the show as usual and keeping his eye on nell and her grandfather as they rather lingered in the rear the child bore upon her arm the little basket with her flowers and sometimes stopped with timid and modest looks to offer them at some gay carriage but alas there were many bolder beggars there gipsies who promised husbands and others skillful in their trade and although some ladies smiled gently as they shook their heads and others cried to the gentlemen beside them see what a pretty face they let the pretty face pass on and never thought that it looked tired or hungry there was but one lady who seemed to understand the child and she was one who sat alone in a handsome carriage while two young men in dashing clothes who had just stepped out from it talked and laughed loudly at a little distance appearing to forget her quite there were many ladies all around but they turned their backs or looked another way or at the two young men not unfavorably at them and left her to herself the lady motioned away a gipsy woman eager to tell her fortune saying that it was told already and had been for some years but called the child toward her and taking her flowers put money into her trembling hand and bade her go home and keep at home many a time they went up and down those long long lines seeing everything but the horses and the race when the bell rung to clear the course going back to rest among the carts and donkeys and not coming out again until the heat was over many a time too was punch displayed in the full glory of his humor but all this while the eye of thomas codlin was upon them and to escape without notice was almost impossible at length late in the day mr codlin pitched the show in a spot right in the middle of the crowd and the punch and judy were surrounded by people who were watching the performance short was moving the images and knocking them in the fury of the combat against the sides of the show the people were looking on with laughing faces and mr codlins face showed a grim smile as his roving eye detected the hands of thieves in the crowd going into waistcoat pockets if nell and her grandfather were ever to get away unseen that was the very moment they seized it and fled they made a path through booths and carriages and throngs of people and never once stopped to look behind the bell was ringing and the course was cleared by the time they reached the ropes but they dashed across it paying no attention to the shouts and screeching that assailed them for breaking in it and creeping under the brow of the hill at a quick pace made for the open fields at last they were free from codlin and short that night they reached a little village in a woody hollow the village schoolmaster a good and gentle man pitying their weariness and attracted by the childs sweetness and modesty gave them a lodging for the night nor would he let them leave him until two days more had passed they journeyed on when the time came that they must wander forth again by pleasant country lanes and as they passed watching the birds that perched and twittered in the branches overhead or listening to the songs that broke the happy silence their hearts were peaceful and free from care but byandby they came to a long winding road which lengthened out far into the distance and though they still kept on it was at a much slower pace for they were now very weary the afternoon had worn away into a beautiful evening when they arrived at a point where the road made a sharp turn and struck across a common on the border of this common and close to the hedge which divided it from the cultivated fields a caravan was drawn up to rest upon which they came so suddenly that they could not have avoided it if they would do you know what a caravan is it is a sort of gipsy house on wheels in which people live while the house moves from place to place it was not a shabby dingy dusty cart but a smart little house with white dimity curtains hung over the windows and windowshutters of green picked out with panels of a staring red in which happilycontrasted colors the whole house shone brilliant neither was it a poor caravan drawn by a single donkey or feeble old horse for a pair of horses in pretty good condition were released from the shafts and grazing on the frouzy grass neither was it a gipsy caravan for at the open door graced with a bright brass knocker sat a christian lady stout and comfortable to look upon who wore a large bonnet trembling with bows and that it was not a caravan of poor people was clear from what this lady was doing for she was taking her tea the teathings including a bottle of rather suspicious looks and a cold knuckle of ham were set forth upon a drum covered with a white napkin and there as if at the most convenient roundtable in all the world sat this roving lady taking her tea and enjoying the prospect it happened at that moment that the lady of the caravan had her cup which that everything about her might be of a stout and comfortable kind was a breakfast cup to her lips and that having her eyes lifted to the sky in her enjoyment of the full flavor of her tea it happened that being thus agreeably engaged she did not see the travelers when they first came up it was not until she was in the act of setting down the cup and drawing a long breath after the exertion of swallowing its contents that the lady of the caravan beheld an old man and a young child walking slowly by and glancing at her proceedings with eyes of modest but hungry admiration hey cried the lady of the caravan scooping the crumbs out of her lap and swallowing the same before wiping her lips yes to be surewho won the helterskelter plate child won what maam asked nell the helterskelter plate at the races childthe plate that was run for on the second day on the second day maam second day yes second day repeated the lady with an air of impatience cant you say who won the helterskelter plate when youre asked the question civilly i dont know maam dont know repeated the lady of the caravan why you were there i saw you with my own eyes nell was not a little alarmed to hear this supposing that the lady might be intimately acquainted with the firm of short and codlin but what followed tended to put her at her ease and very sorry i was said the lady of the caravan to see you in company with a puncha low common vulgar wretch that people should scorn to look at i was not there by choice returned the child we didnt know our way and the two men were very kind to us and let us travel with them do youdo you know them maam know em child cried the lady of the caravan in a sort of shriek know them but youre young and ignorant and thats your excuse for asking sich a question do i look as if i knowd em does the caravan look as if it knowd em no maam no said the child fearing she had committed some grievous fault i beg your pardon the lady of the caravan was in the act of gathering her tea things together preparing to clear the table but noting the childs anxious manner she hesitated and stopped the child courtesied and giving her hand to the old man had already got some fifty yards or so away when the lady of the caravan called to her to return come nearer nearer still said she beckoning to her to ascend the steps are you hungry child not very but we are tired and itsit is a long way well hungry or not you had better have some tea rejoined her new acquaintance i suppose you are agreeable to that old gentleman the grandfather humbly pulled off his hat and thanked her the lady of the caravan then bade him come up the steps likewise but the drum proving an inconvenient table for two they went down again and sat upon the grass where she handed down to them the teatray the bread and butter and the knuckle of ham set em out near the hind wheels child thats the best place said their friend superintending the arrangement from above now hand up the teapot for a little more hot water and a pinch of fresh tea and then both of you eat and drink as much as you can and dont spare anything thats all i ask of you the mistress of the caravan saying the girl and her grandfather could not be very heavy invited them to go along with them for a while for which nell thanked her with all her heart when they had traveled slowly forward for some short distance nell ventured to steal a look round the caravan and observe it more closely onehalf of itthat part in which the comfortable proprietress was then seatedwas carpeted and so divided the farther end as to form a sleepingplace made after the fashion of a berth on board ship which was shaded like the little windows with fair white curtains and looked comfortable enough though by what kind of gymnastic exercise the lady of the caravan ever contrived to get into it was a mystery the other half served for a kitchen and was fitted up with a stove whose small chimney passed through the roof the mistress sat looking at the child for a long time in silence and then getting up brought out from a corner a large roll of canvas about a yard in width which she laid upon the floor and spread open with her foot until it nearly reached from one end of the caravan to the other there child she said read that nell walked down it and read aloud in enormous black letters the inscription jarleys waxwork read it again said the lady complacently jarleys waxwork repeated nell thats me said the lady i am mrs jarley giving the child an encouraging look the lady of the caravan unfolded another scroll whereon was the inscription one hundred figures the full size of life and then another scroll on which was written the only stupendous collection of real waxwork in the world and then several smaller scrolls with such inscriptions as now exhibiting withinthe genuine and only jarleyjarleys unrivaled collectionjarley is the delight of the nobility and gentrythe royal family are the patrons of jarley when she had exhibited these large painted signs to the astonished child she brought forth specimens of the lesser notices in the shape of handbills some of which were printed in the form of verses on popular times as believe me if all jarleys waxwork so rarei saw thy show in youthful primeover the water to jarley while to satisfy all tastes others were composed with a view to the lighter and merrier spirits as a verse on the favorite air of if i had a donkey beginning if i knowd a donkey wot wouldnt go to see mrs jarleys waxwork show do you think id own him oh no no then run to jarleys besides several compositions in prose pretending to be dialogues between the emperor of china and an oyster i never saw any waxwork maam said nell is it funnier than punch funnier said mrs jarley in a shrill voice it is not funny at all oh said nell with all possible humility it isnt funny at all repeated mrs jarley its calm andwhats that word againcriticalnoclassical thats itits calm and classical no low beatings and knockings about no jokings and squeakings like your precious punches but always the same with a constantly unchanging air of coldness and dignity and so like life that if waxwork only spoke and walked about youd hardly know the difference i wont go so far as to say that as it is ive seen waxwork quite like life but ive certainly seen some life that was exactly like waxwork this conference at length concluded she beckoned nell to sit down and the old gentleman too said mrs jarley for i want to have a word with him do you want a good place for your granddaughter master if you do i can put her in the way of getting one what do you say i cant leave her answered the old man we cant separate what would become of me without her if youre really ready to employ yourself said mrs jarley there would be plenty for you to do in the way of helping to dust the figures and take the checks and so forth what i want your granddaughter for is to point em out to the company they would be soon learned and she has a way with her that people wouldnt think unpleasant though she does come after me for ive been always accustomed to go round with visitors myself which i should keep on doing now only that my spirits make a little rest absolutely necessary its not a common offer bear in mind said the lady rising into the tone and manner in which she was accustomed to address her audiences its jarleys waxwork remember the dutys very light and genteel the company particularly select the exhibition takes place in assemblyrooms townhalls large rooms at inns or auction galleries there is none of your openair wondering at jarleys recollect there is no tarpaulin and sawdust at jarleys remember every promise made in the handbills is kept to the utmost and the whole forms an effect of splendor hitherto unknown in this kingdom remember that the price of admission is only sixpence and that this is an opportunity which may never occur again we are very much obliged to you maam said nell and thankfully accept your offer and youll never be sorry for it returned mrs jarley im pretty sure of that so as thats all settled let us have a bit of supper rumbling along with most unwonted noise the caravan stopped at last at the place of exhibition where nell came down from the wagon among an admiring group of children who evidently supposed her to be an important part of the curiosities and were almost ready to believe that her grandfather was a cunning device in wax the chests were taken out of the van for the figures with all haste and taken in to be unlocked by mrs jarley who attended by george and the driver arranged their contents consisting of red festoons and other ornamental work to make the best show in the decoration of the room when the festoons were all put up as tastily as they might be the wonderful collection was uncovered and there were shown on a raised platform some two feet from the floor running round the room and parted from the rude public by a crimson rope breast high a large number of sprightly waxen images of famous people singly and in groups clad in glittering dresses of various climes and times and standing more or less unsteadily upon their legs with their eyes very wide open and their nostrils very much inflated and the muscles of their legs and arms very strongly developed and all their faces expressing great surprise all the gentlemen were very narrow in the breast and very blue about the beards and all the ladies were wonderful figures and all the ladies and all the gentlemen were looking intensely nowhere and staring with tremendous earnestness at nothing when nell had shown her first wonder at this glorious sight mrs jarley ordered the room to be cleared of all but herself and the child and sitting herself down in an armchair in the center presented nell with a willow wand long used by herself for pointing out the characters and was at great pains to instruct her in her duty that said mrs jarley in her exhibition tone as nell touched a figure at the beginning of the platform is an unfortunate maid of honor in the time of queen elizabeth who died from pricking her finger in consequence of working upon a sunday observe the blood which is trickling from her finger also the goldeyed needle of the period with which she is at work all this nell repeated twice or thricepointing to the finger and the needle at the right times and then passed on to the next that ladies and gentlemen said mrs jarley is jasper packlemerton of terrible memory who courted and married fourteen wives and destroyed them all by tickling the soles of their feet when they were sleeping in the consciousness of innocence and virtue on being brought to the scaffold and asked if he was sorry for what he had done he replied yes he was sorry for having let em off so easy and hoped all christian husbands would pardon him the offense let this be a warning to all young ladies to be particular in the character of the gentlemen of their choice observe that his fingers are curled as if in the act of tickling and that his face is represented with a wink as he appeared when committing his barbarous murders when nell knew all about mr packlemerton and could say it without faltering mrs jarley passed on to the fat man and then to the thin man the tall man the short man the old lady who died of dancing at a hundred and thirtytwo the wild boy of the woods the woman who poisoned fourteen families with pickled walnuts and other historical characters and interesting but misguided individuals and so well did nell profit by her instructions and so apt was she to remember them that by the time they had been shut up together for a couple of hours she was in full possession of the history of the whole establishment and perfectly able to tell the stories of the waxwork to visitors for some time her life and the life of the poor vacant old man passed quietly and happily they traveled from place to place with mrs jarley nell spoke her piece with the wand in her hand before the waxen images and her grandfather in a dull way dusted the images when he was told to do so but heavier sorrow was yet to come one night a holiday night for them neil and her grandfather went out to walk a terrible thunderstorm coming on they were forced to take refuge in a small public house and here they saw some shabbily dressed and wicked looking men were playing cards the old man watched them with increasing interest and excitement until his whole appearance underwent a complete change his face was flushed and eager his teeth set with a hand that trembled violently he seized nells little purse and in spite of her pleadings joined in the game gambling with such a savage thirst for gain that the distressed and frightened child could almost better have borne to see him dead it was long after midnight when the play came to an end and they were forced to remain where they were until the morning and in the night the child was wakened from her troubled sleep to find a figure in the rooma figure busying its hands about her garments while its face was turned to her listening and looking lest she should awake it was her grandfather himself his white face pinched and sharpened by the greediness which made his eyes unnaturally bright counting the money of which his hands were robbing her evening after evening after that night the old man would steal away not to return until the night was far spent demanding wildly money and at last there came an hour when the child overheard him tempted beyond his feeble powers of resistance undertake to find more money to feed the desperate passion which had laid its hold upon his weakness by robbing the kind mrs jarley who had done so much for them the poor old man had become so weak in his mind that he did not understand how wicked was his act that night the child took her grandfather by the hand and led him forth through the strait streets and narrow outskirts of the town their trembling feet passed quickly the child sustained by one ideathat they were flying from wickedness and disgrace and that she could save her grandfather only by her firmness unaided by one word of advice or any helping hand the old man following her as though she had been an angel messenger sent to lead him where she would the hardest part of all their wanderings was now before them they slept in the open air that night and on the following morning some men offered to take them a long distance on their barge on the river these men though they were not unkindly were very rugged noisy fellows and they drank and quarreled fearfully among themselves to nells inexpressible terror it rained too heavily and she was wet and cold at last they reached the great city whither the barge was bound and here they wandered up and down being now penniless and watched the faces of those who passed to find among them a ray of encouragement or hope ill in body and sick to death at heart the child needed her utmost courage and will even to creep along they lay down that night and the next night too with nothing between them and the sky a penny loaf was all they had had that day and when the third morning came it found the child much weaker yet she made no complaint the great city with its many factories hemmed them in on every side and seemed to shut out hope faint and spiritless as they were its streets were terrible to them after humbly asking for relief at some few doors and being driven away they agreed to make their way out of it as speedily as they could and try if the people living in some lone house beyond would have more pity on their worn out state they were dragging themselves along through the last street and the child felt that the time was close at hand when her enfeebled powers would bear no more there appeared before them at this moment going in the same direction as themselves a traveler on foot who with a bundle of clothing strapped to his back leaned upon a stout stick as he walked and read from a book which he held in his other hand it was not an easy matter to come up with him and ask his aid for he walked fast and was a little distance in advance at length he stopped to look more attentively at some passage in his book encouraged by a ray of hope the child shot on before her grandfather and going close to the stranger without rousing him by the sound of her footsteps began in a few faint words to beg his help he turned his head the child clapped her hands together uttered a wild shriek and fell senseless at his feet it was the poor schoolmaster no other than the poor schoolmaster scarcely less moved and surprised by the sight of the child than she had been on recognizing him he stood for a moment silent without even the presence of mind to raise her from the ground but quickly recovering himself he threw down his stick and book and dropping on one knee beside her tried simple means as came to his mind to restore her to herself while her grandfather standing idly by wrung his hands and begged her with many words of love to speak to him were it only a whisper she appears to be quite worn out said the schoolmaster glancing upward into his face you have used up all her strength friend she is dying of want answered the old man i never thought how weak and ill she was till now casting a look upon him halfangry and halfpitiful the schoolmaster took the child in his arms and bidding the old man gather up her little basket and follow him directly bore her away at his utmost speed there was a small inn within sight to which it would seem he had been walking when so unexpectedly overtaken toward this place he hurried with his unconscious burden and rushing into the kitchen and calling upon the company there assembled to make way for gods sake laid it down on a chair before the fire the company who rose in confusion on the schoolmasters entrance did as people usually do under such circumstances everybody called for his or her favorite remedy which nobody brought each cried for more air at the same time carefully shutting out what air there was by closing round the object of sympathy and all wondered why somebody else didnt do what it never appeared to occur to them might be done by themselves the landlady however who had more readiness and activity than any of them and who seemed to understand the case more quickly soon came running in with a little hot medicine followed by her servantgirl carrying vinegar hartshorn smellingsalts and such other restoratives which being duly given helped the child so far as to enable her to thank them in a faint voice and to hold out her hand to the poor schoolmaster who stood with an anxious face near her side without suffering her to speak another word or so much as to stir a finger any more the women straightway carried her off to bed and having covered her up warm bathed her cold feet and wrapped them in flannel they sent a messenger for the doctor the doctor who was a rednosed gentleman with a great bunch of seals dangling below a waistcoat of ribbed black satin arrived with all speed and taking his seat by the bedside of poor nell drew out his watch and felt her pulse then he looked at her tongue then he felt her pulse again and while he did so he eyed the halfemptied wineglass as if in profound abstraction i should give her said the doctor at length a teaspoonful every now and then of hot medicine why thats exactly what weve done sir said the delighted landlady i should also observed the doctor who had passed the footbath on the stairs i should also said the doctor in a very wise tone of voice put her feet in hot water and wrap them up in flannel i should likewise said the doctor with increased solemnity give her something light for supperthe wing of a roasted chicken now why goodness gracious me sir its cooking at the kitchen fire this instant cried the landlady and so indeed it was for the schoolmaster had ordered it to be put down and it was getting on so well that the doctor might have smelled it if he had tried perhaps he did you may then said the doctor rising gravely give her a glass of hot mulled portwine if she likes wine and a piece of toast sir suggested the landlady ay said the doctor in a very dignified tone and a toastof bread but be very particular to make it of bread if you please maam with which parting advice slowly and solemnly given the doctor departed leaving the whole house in admiration of that wisdom which agreed so closely with their own everybody said he was a very shrewd doctor indeed and knew perfectly what peoples bodies needed which there appears some reason to suppose he did while her supper was preparing the child fell into a refreshing sleep from which they were obliged to rouse her when it was ready as she showed extraordinary uneasiness on learning that her grandfather was below stairs and as she was greatly troubled at the thought of their being apart he took his supper with her finding her still very anxious for the old man they made him up a bed in an inner room to which he soon went the key of this room happened by goodfortune to be on that side of the door which was in nells room she turned it on him when the landlady had withdrawn and crept to bed again with a thankful heart the schoolmaster sat for a long time smoking his pipe by the kitchen fire which was now deserted thinking with a very happy face on the fortunate chance which had brought him at just the right moment to the childs assistance the schoolmaster as it appeared was on his way to a new home and when the child had recovered somewhat from her hunger and weariness it was arranged that she and her grandfather should go with him to the village whither he was bound and that he should endeavor to find them some work by which they could get their living it was a lonely little village lying among the quiet country scenes nell loved and here her grandfather being peaceful and at rest a great calm fell upon the spirit of the child often she would steal into the church and sitting down among the quiet figures carved upon the tombs would think of the summer days and the bright springtime that would come of the rays of sun that would fall in aslant those sleeping forms of the songs of birds and the sweet air that would steal in what if the spot awakened thoughts of death it would be no pain to sleep amid such sights and sounds as these for the time was drawing nearer every day when nell was to rest indeed she never murmured or complained but faded like a light upon a summers evening and died day after day and all day long the old man brokenhearted and with no love or care for anything in life would sit beside her grave with her straw hat and the little basket she had been used to carry waiting till she should come to him again at last they found him lying dead upon the stone and in the church where they had often prayed and mused and lingered hand in hand the child and the old man slept together footnote c the lord chancellor it may be explained is the highest judge in the courts of england and when in court always wears a great wig and a robe vii little david copperfield i little david copperfield lived with my mother in a pretty house in the village of blunderstone in suffolk i had never known my father who died before i could remember anything and i had neither brothers nor sisters i was fondly loved by my pretty young mother and our kind good servant peggotty and was a very happy little fellow we had very few friends and the only relation my mother talked about was an aunt of my fathers a tall and rather terrible old lady from all accounts who had once been to see us when i was quite a tiny baby and had been so angry to find i was not a little girl that she had left the house quite offended and had never been heard of since one visitor a tall dark gentleman i did not like at all and was rather inclined to be jealous that my mother should be so friendly with the stranger peggotty and i were sitting one night by the parlor fire alone i had been reading to peggotty about crocodiles i was tired of reading and dead sleepy but having leave as a high treat to sit up until my mother came home from spending the evening at a neighbors i would rather have died upon my post of course than have gone to bed i had reached that stage of sleepiness when peggotty seemed to swell and grow immensely large i propped my eyelids open with my two forefingers and looked perseveringly at her as she sat at work at the little house with a thatched roof where she kept her yardmeasure at her workbox with a slidinglid with a view of st pauls cathedral with a pink dome painted on the top at the brass thimble on her finger at herself whom i thought lovely i felt so sleepy that i knew if i lost sight of anything for a moment i was gone peggotty says i suddenly were you ever married lord master davy replied peggotty whats put marriage in your head she answered with such a start that it quite awoke me and then she stopped in her work and looked at me with her needle drawn out to its threads length but were you ever married peggotty says i you are a very handsome woman aint you me handsome davy said peggotty lawk no my dear but what put marriage in your head i dont know you mustnt marry more than one person at a time may you peggotty certainly not says peggotty with the promptest decision but if you marry a person and the person dies why then you may marry another person maynt you peggotty you may says peggotty if you choose my dear thats a matter of opinion but what is your opinion peggotty said i i asked her and looked curiously at her because she looked so curiously at me my opinion is said peggotty taking her eyes from me after waiting a little and going on with her work that i never was married myself master davy and that i dont expect to be thats all i know about the subject you aint cross i suppose peggotty are you said i after sitting quiet for a minute i really thought she was she had been so short with me but i was quite mistaken for she laid aside her work which was a stocking of her own and opening her arms wide took my curly head within them and gave it a good squeeze i know it was a good squeeze because being very plump whenever she made any little exertion after she was dressed some of the buttons on the back of her flew off and i recollect two bursting to the opposite side of the parlor while she was hugging me one day peggotty asked me if i would like to go with her on a visit to her brother at yarmouth is your brother an agreeable man peggotty i inquired oh what an agreeable man he is cried peggotty then theres the sea and the boats and ships and the fishermen and the beach and am to play with ham was her nephew i was quite anxious to go when i heard of all these delights but my mother what would she do all alone peggotty told me my mother was going to pay a visit to some friends and would be sure to let me go so all was arranged and we were to start the next day in the carriers cart i was so eager that i wanted to put my hat and coat on the night before but when the time came to say goodby to my dear mamma i cried a little for i had never left her before it was rather a slow way of traveling and i was very tired and sleepy when i arrived at yarmouth and found ham waiting to meet me he was a great strong fellow six feet high and took me on his back and the box under his arm to carry both to the house i was delighted to find that this house was made of a real big black boat with a door and windows cut in the side and an iron funnel sticking out of the roof for a chimney inside it was very cozy and clean and i had a tiny bedroom in the stern i was very much pleased to find a dear little girl about my own age to play with and after tea i said mr peggotty sir says he did you give your son the name of ham because you lived in a sort of ark mr peggotty seemed to think it a deep idea but answered no sir i never giv him no name who gave him that name then said i putting question number two of the catechism to mr peggotty why sir his father giv it him said mr peggotty i thought you were his father my brother joe was his father said mr peggotty dead mr peggotty i hinted after a respectful pause drowndead said mr peggotty i was very much surprised that mr peggotty was not hams father and began to wonder whether i was mistaken about his relationship to anybody else there i was so curious to know that i made up my mind to have it out with mr peggotty little emly i said glancing at her she is your daughter isnt she mr peggotty no sir my brotherinlaw tom was her father i couldnt help it dead mr peggotty i hinted after another respectful silence drowndead said mr peggotty i felt the difficulty of resuming the subject but had not got to the bottom of it yet and must get to the bottom somehow so i said havent you any children mr peggotty no master he answered with a short laugh im a bacheldore a bachelor i said astonished why whos that mr peggotty pointing to the person in the apron who was knitting thats missis gummidge said mr peggotty gummidge mr peggotty but at this point peggottyi mean my own peggottymade such impressive motions to me not to ask any more questions that i could only sit and look at all the company until it was time to go to bed mrs gummidge lived with them too and did the cooking and cleaning for she was a poor widow and had no home of her own i thought mr peggotty was very good to take all these people to live with him and i was quite right for mr peggotty was only a poor man himself and had to work hard to get a living almost as soon as morning shone upon the oystershell frame of my mirror i was out of bed and out with tittle emly picking up stones upon the beach youre quite a sailor i suppose i said to emly i dont know that i supposed anything of the kind but i felt it proper to say something and a shining sail close to us made such a pretty little image of itself at the moment in her bright eye that it came into my head to say this no replied emly shaking her head im afraid of the sea afraid i said with a becoming air of boldness and looking very big at the mighty ocean i aint ah but its cruel said emly i have seen it very cruel to some of our men i have seen it tear a boat as big as our house all to pieces i hope it wasnt the boat that that father was drowned in said emly no not that one i never see that boat nor him i asked her little emly shook her head not to remember here was something remarkable i immediately went into an explanation how i had never seen my own father and how my mother and i had always lived by ourselves in the happiest state imaginable and lived so then and always meant to live so and how my fathers grave was in the churchyard near our house and shaded by a tree beneath the boughs of which i had walked and heard the birds sing many a pleasant morning but there were some differences between emlys orphanhood and mine it appeared she had lost her mother before her father and where her fathers grave was no one knew except that it was somewhere in the depths of the sea besides said emly as she looked about for shells and pebbles your father was a gentleman and your mother is a lady and my father was a fisherman and my mother was a fishermans daughter and my uncle dan is a fisherman dan is mr peggotty is he said i illustration david copperfield and little emly page uncleyonder answered emly nodding at the boathouse yes i mean him he must be very good i should think good said emly if i was ever to be a lady id give him a skyblue coat with diamond buttons nankeen trousers a red velvet waistcoat a cocked hat a large gold watch a silver pipe and a box of money i said i had no doubt that mr peggotty well deserved these treasures little emly had stopped and looked up at the sky while she named these articles as if they were a glorious vision we went on again picking up shells and pebbles you would like to be a lady i said emly looked at me and laughed and nodded yes i should like it very much we would all be gentlefolks together then me and uncle and ham and mrs gummidge we wouldnt mind then when there come stormy weather not for our own sakes i mean we would for the poor fishermens to be sure and wed help em with money when they come to any hurt i was quite sorry to leave these kind people and my dear little companion but i was glad to think i should get back to my own dear mamma when i reached home however i found a great change my mother was married to the dark man i did not like whose name was mr murdstone and he was a stern hard man who had no love for me and did not allow my mother to pet and indulge me as she had done before mr murdstones sister came to live with us and as she was even more difficult to please than her brother and disliked boys my life was no longer a happy one i tried to be good and obedient for i knew it made my mother very unhappy to see me punished and found fault with i had always had lessons with my mother and as she was patient and gentle i had enjoyed learning to read but now i had a great many very hard lessons to do and was so frightened and shy when mr and miss murdstone were in the room that i did not get on at all well and was continually in disgrace let me remember how it used to be and bring one morning back again i come into the secondbest parlor after breakfast with my books and an exercisebook and a slate my mother is ready for me at her writingdesk but not half so ready as mr murdstone in his easychair by the window though he pretends to be reading a book or as miss murdstone sitting near my mother stringing steel beads the very sight of these two has such an influence over me that i begin to feel the words i have been at infinite pains to get into my head all sliding away and going i dont know where i wonder where they do go bytheby i hand the first book to my mother perhaps it is a grammar perhaps a history or geography i take a last drowning look at the page as i give it into her hand and start off aloud at a racing pace while i have got it fresh i trip over a word mr murdstone looks up i trip over another word miss murdstone looks up i redden tumble over half a dozen words and stop i think my mother would show me the book if she dared but she does not dare and she says softly oh davy davy now clara says mr murdstone be firm with the boy dont say oh davy davy thats childish he knows his lesson or he does not know it he does not know it miss murdstone interposes awfully i am really afraid he does not says my mother then you see clara returns miss murdstone you should just give him the book back and make him know it yes certainly says my mother that is what i intend to do my dear jane now davy try once more and dont be stupid i obey the first clause of my mothers words by trying once more but am not so successful with the second for i am very stupid i tumble down before i get to the old place at a point where i was all right before and stop to think but i cant think about the lesson i think of the number of yards of net in miss murdstones cap or of the price of mr murdstones dressinggown or any such ridiculous matter that i have no business with and dont want to have anything at all to do with mr murdstone makes a movement of impatience which i have been expecting for a long time miss murdstone does the same my mother glances submissively at them shuts the book and lays it by to be worked out when my other tasks are done there is a pile of these tasks very soon and it swells like a rolling snowball the bigger it gets the more stupid i get the case is so hopeless and i feel that i am wallowing in such a bog of nonsense that i give up all idea of getting out and abandon myself to my fate the despairing way in which my mother and i look at each other as i blunder on is truly melancholy but the greatest effect in these miserable lessons is when my mother thinking nobody is observing her tries to give me the cue by the motion of her lips at that instant miss murdstone who has been lying in wait for nothing else all along says in a deep warning voice clara my mother starts colors and smiles faintly mr murdstone comes out of his chair takes the book throws it at me or boxes my ears with it and turns me out of the room by the shoulders my only pleasure was to go up into a little room at the top of the house where i had found a number of books that had belonged to my own father and i would sit and read robinson crusoe and many tales of travels and adventures and i imagined myself to be sometimes one and sometimes another hero and went about for days with the centrepiece out of an old set of boottrees pretending to be a captain in the british royal navy one morning when i went into the parlor with my books i found my mother looking anxious miss murdstone looking firm and mr murdstone binding something round the bottom of a canea lithe and limber cane which he left off binding when i came in and poised and switched in the air i tell you clara said mr murdstone i have often been flogged myself to be sure of course said miss murdstone certainly my dear jane faltered my mother meekly butbut do you think it did edward good do you think it did edward harm clara asked mr murdstone gravely thats the point said his sister to this my mother returned certainly my dear jane and said no more i felt afraid that all this had something to do with myself and sought mr murdstones eye as it lighted on mine now david he saidand i saw that cast again as he said ityou must be far more careful today than usual he gave the cane another poise and another switch and having finished his preparation of it laid it down beside him with an expressive look and took up his book this was a good freshener to my memory as a beginning i felt the words of my lessons slipping off not one by one or line by line but by the entire page i tried to lay hold of them but they seemed if i may so express it to have put skates on and to skim away from me with a smoothness there was no checking we began badly and went on worse i had come in with an idea of doing better than usual thinking that i was very well prepared but it turned out to be quite a mistake book after book was added to the heap of failures miss murdstone being firmly watchful of us all the time and when we came at last to a question about five thousand cheeses canes he made it that day i remember my mother burst out crying clara said miss murdstone in her warning voice i am not quite well my dear jane i think said my mother i saw him wink solemnly at his sister as he rose and said taking up the cane why jane we can hardly expect clara to bear with perfect firmness the worry and torment that david has caused her today clara is greatly strengthened and improved but we can hardly expect so much from her david you and i will go upstairs boy as he took me out at the door my mother ran towards us miss murdstone said clara are you a perfect fool and interfered i saw my mother stop her ears then and i heard her crying he walked me up to my room slowly and gravelyi am certain he had a delight in that formal show of doing justiceand when we got there suddenly twisted my head under his arm mr murdstone sir i cried to him dont pray dont beat me i have tried to learn sir but i cant learn while you and miss murdstone are by i cant indeed cant you indeed david he said well try that he had my head as in a vise but i twined round him somehow and stopped him for a moment entreating him not to beat me it was only for a moment that i stopped him for he cut me heavily an instant afterwards and in the same instant i caught the hand with which he held me in my mouth between my teeth and bit it through it sets my teeth on edge to think of it he beat me then as if he would have beaten me to death above all the noise we made i heard them running up the stairs and crying outi heard my mother crying outand peggotty then he was gone and the door was locked outside and i was lying fevered and hot and torn and raging in my puny way upon the floor how well i recollect when i became quiet what an unnatural stillness seemed to reign through the whole house how well i remember when my smart and passion began to cool how wicked i began to feel i sat listening for a long while but there was not a sound i crawled up from the floor and saw my face in the glass so swollen red and ugly that it almost frightened me my stripes were sore and stiff and made me cry afresh when i moved but they were nothing to the guilt i felt it lay heavier on my breast than if i had been a most terrible criminal i dare say and the longer i thought of it the greater the offense seemed it had begun to grow dark and i had shut the window i had been lying for the most part with my head upon the sill by turns crying dozing and looking listlessly out when the key was turned and miss murdstone came in with some bread and meat and milk these she put down upon the table without a word glaring at me the while and then retired locking the door after her i never shall forget the waking next morning the being cheerful and fresh for the first moment and then the being weighed down by the stale and dismal oppression of remembrance miss murdstone came again before i was out of bed told me in so many words that i was free to walk in the garden for half an hour and no longer retired leaving the door open that i might avail myself of that permission i did so and did so every morning of my imprisonment which lasted five days if i could have seen my mother alone i should have gone down on my knees to her and besought her forgiveness but i saw no one miss murdstone excepted during the whole time the length of those five days i can convey no idea of to anyone they occupy the place of years in my remembrance on the last night of my restraint i was awakened by hearing my own name spoken in a whisper i started up in bed and putting out my arms in the dark said is that you peggotty there was no immediate answer but presently i heard my name again in a tone so very mysterious and awful that i think i should have gone into a fit if it had not occurred to me that it must have come through the keyhole i groped my way to the door and putting my own lips to the keyhole whispered is that you peggotty dear yes my own precious davy she replied be as soft as a mouse or the catll hear us i understood this to mean miss murdstone and knew that we must be careful and quiet her room being close by hows mamma dear peggotty is she very angry with me i could hear peggotty crying softly on her side of the keyhole as i was doing on mine before she answered no not very what is going to be done with me peggotty dear do you know school near london was peggottys answer i was obliged to get her to repeat it for she spoke it the first time quite down my throat in consequence of my having forgotten to take my mouth away from the keyhole and put my ear there and though her words tickled me a good deal i didnt hear them when peggotty tomorrow is that the reason why miss murdstone took the clothes out of my drawers which she had done though i have forgotten to mention it yes said peggotty box shant i see mamma yes said peggotty morning then peggotty fitted her mouth close to the keyhole and spoke these words through it with as much feeling and earnestness as a keyhole has ever been the means of communicating i will venture to say shooting in each broken little sentence in a convulsive little burst of its own davy dear if i aint been azackly as intimate with you lately as i used to be it aint because i dont love you just as well and more my pretty poppet its because i thought it better for you and for someone else besides davy my darling are you listening can you hear yeyeyeyes peggotty i sobbed my own said peggotty with infinite compassion what i want to say is that you must never forget me for ill never forget you and ill take as much care of your mamma davy as i ever took of you and i wont leave her the day may come when shell be glad to lay her poor head on her stupid cross old peggottys arm again and ill write to you my dear though i aint no scholar and illill peggotty fell to kissing the keyhole as she couldnt kiss me thank you dear peggotty said i oh thank you thank you will you promise me one thing peggotty will you write and tell mr peggotty and little emly and mrs gummidge and ham that i am not so bad as they might suppose and that i sent em all my loveespecially to little emly will you if you please peggotty the kind soul promised and we both of us kissed the keyhole with the greatest affectioni patted it with my hand i recollect as if it had been her honest faceand parted in the morning miss murdstone appeared as usual and told me i was going to school which was not altogether such news to me as she supposed she also informed me that when i was dressed i was to come downstairs into the parlor and have my breakfast there i found my mother very pale and with red eyes into whose arms i ran and begged her pardon from my suffering soul oh davy she said that you could hurt anyone i love try to be better pray to be better i forgive you but i am so grieved davy that you should have such bad passions in your heart miss murdstone was good enough to take me out to the cart and to say on the way that she hoped i would repent before i came to a bad end and then i got into the cart and the lazy horse walked off with it we might have gone about half a mile and my pocket handkerchief was quite wet through when the carrier stopped short looking out to ascertain for what i saw to my amazement peggotty burst from a hedge and climb into the cart she took me in both her arms and squeezed me until the pressure on my nose was extremely painful though i never thought of that till afterwards when i found it very tender not a single word did peggotty speak releasing one of her arms she put it down in her pocket to the elbow and brought out some paperbags of cakes which she crammed into my pockets and a purse which she put into my hand but not one word did she say after another and a final squeeze with both arms she got down from the cart and ran away and my belief is and has always been without a solitary button on her gown i picked up one of several that was rolling about and treasured it as a keepsake for a long time the carrier looked at me as if to inquire if she were coming back i shook my head and said i thought not then come up said the carrier to the lazy horse who came up accordingly having by this time cried as much as i possibly could i began to think it was of no use crying any more the carrier seeing me in this resolution proposed that my pocket handkerchief should be spread upon the horses back to dry i thanked him and agreed and particularly small it looked under those circumstances i had now time to examine the purse it was a stiff leather purse with a snap and had three bright shillings in it which peggotty had evidently polished up with whitening for my greater delight but its precious contents were two halfcrowns folded together in a bit of paper on which was written in my mothers hand for davy with my love i was so overcome by this that i asked the carrier to be so good as reach me my pocket handkerchief again but he said he thought i had better do without it and i thought i really had so i wiped my eyes on my sleeve and stopped myself for good too though in consequence of my previous feelings i was still occasionally seized with a stormy sob after we had jogged on for some little time i asked the carrier if he was going all the way all the way where inquired the carrier there i said wheres there inquired the carrier near london i said why that horse said the carrier jerking the rein to point him out would be deader than pork afore he got over half the ground are you only going to yarmouth then i asked thats about it said the carrier and there i shall take you to the stagecutch and the stagecutch thatll take you towherever it is i shared my cakes with the carrier who asked if peggotty made them and told him yes she did all our cooking the carrier looked thoughtful and then asked if i would send a message to peggotty from him i agreed and the message was barkis is willing while i was waiting for the coach at yarmouth i wrote to peggotty my dear peggottyi have come here safe barkis is willing my love to mamma yours affectionately pshe says he particularly wanted you to know barkis is willing at yarmouth i found dinner was ordered for me and felt very shy at having a table all to myself and very much alarmed when the waiter told me he had seen a gentleman fall down dead after drinking some of their beer i said i would have some water and was quite grateful to the waiter for drinking the ale that had been ordered for me for fear the people of the hotel should be offended he also helped me to eat my dinner and accepted one of my bright shillings after a long tiring journey by the coach for there were no trains in those days i arrived in london and was taken to the school at blackheath by one of the masters mr mell i gazed upon the schoolroom into which he took me as the most forlorn and desolate place i had ever seen i see it now a long room with three long rows of desks and six of long seats bristling all round with pegs for hats and slates scraps of old copybooks and exercises litter the dirty floor mr mell having left me for a few moments i went softly to the upper end of the room observing all this as i crept along suddenly i came upon a pasteboard placard beautifully written which was lying on the desk and bore these wordstake care of him he bites i got upon the desk immediately afraid of at least a great dog underneath but though i looked all round with anxious eyes i could see nothing of him i was still engaged in peering about when mr mell came back and asked me what i did up there i beg your pardon sir says i if you please im looking for the dog dog says he what dog isnt it a dog sir isnt what a dog thats to be taken care of sir that bites no copperfield says he gravely thats not a dog thats a boy my instructions are copperfield to put this placard on your back i am sorry to make such a beginning with you but i must do it with that he took me down and tied the placard which was neatly constructed for the purpose on my shoulders like a knapsack and wherever i went afterwards i had the consolation of carrying it what i suffered from that placard nobody can imagine whether it was possible for people to see me or not i always fancied that somebody was reading it it was no relief to turn round and find nobody for wherever my back was there i imagined somebody always to be there was an old door in this playground on which the boys had a custom of carving their names it was completely covered with such inscriptions in my dread of the end of the vacation and their coming back i could not read one boys name without inquiring in what tone and with what emphasis he would read take care of him he bites there was one boya certain j steerforthwho cut his name very deep and very often who i conceived would read it in a rather strong voice and afterwards pull my hair there was another boy one tommy traddles who i dreaded would make game of it and pretend to be dreadfully frightened of me there was a third george demple who i fancied would sing it i have looked a little shrinking creature at that door until the owners of all the namesthere were fiveandforty of them in the school then mr mell saidseemed to cry out each in his own way take care of him he bites tommy traddles was the first boy who returned he introduced himself by informing me that i should find his name on the righthand corner of the gate over the top bolt upon that i said traddles to which he replied the same and then he asked me for a full account of myself and family it was fortunate for me that traddles came back first he enjoyed my placard so much that he saved me from the embarrassment of either telling about it or trying to hide it by presenting me to every other boy who came back great or small immediately on his arrival in this form of introduction look here heres a game happily too the greater part of the boys came back lowspirited and were not so boisterous at my expense as i had expected some of them certainly could not resist the temptation of pretending that i was a dog and patting and smoothing me lest i should bite and saying lie down sir and calling me towzer this was naturally confusing among so many strangers and cost some tears but on the whole it was much better than i had anticipated i was not considered as being formally received into the school however until j steerforth arrived before this boy who was reputed to be a great scholar and was very goodlooking and at least halfadozen years older than i i was carried as before a judge he inquired under a shed in the playground into the particulars of my punishment and was pleased to express his opinion that it was a jolly shame for which i became bound to him ever afterwards what money have you got copperfield he said walking aside with me when he had disposed of my affair in these terms i told him seven shillings you had better give it to me to take care of he said at least you can if you like you neednt if you dont like i hastened to comply with his friendly suggestion and opening peggottys purse turned it upside down into his hand do you want to spend anything now he asked me no thank you i replied you can if you like you know said steerforth say the word no thank you sir i repeated perhaps youd like to spend a couple of shillings or so in a bottle of currant wine byandby up in the bedroom said steerforth you belong to my bedroom i find it certainly had not occurred to me before but i said yes i should like that very good said steerforth youll be glad to spend another shilling or so in almond cakes i dare say i said yes i should like that too and another shilling or so in biscuits and another in fruit eh said steerforth i say young copperfield youre going it i smiled because he smiled but i was a little troubled in my mind too well said steerforth we must make it stretch as far as we can thats all ill do the best in my power for you i can go out when i like and ill smuggle the prog in with these words he put the money in his pocket and kindly told me not to make myself uneasy he would take care it should be all right he was as good as his word if that were all right which i had a secret misgiving was nearly all wrongfor i feared it was a waste of my mothers two halfcrownsthough i had preserved the piece of paper they were wrapped in which was a precious saving when we went upstairs to bed he produced the whole seven shillings worth and laid it out on my bed in the moonlight saying there you are young copperfield and a royal spread youve got i couldnt think of doing the honors of the feast at my time of life while he was by my hand shook at the very thought of it i begged him to do me the favor of taking charge of the treat and my request being seconded by the other boys who were in that room he agreed to it and sat upon my pillow handing round the foodwith perfect fairness i must sayand giving out the currant wine in a little glass without a foot which was his own property as to me i sat on his left hand and the rest were grouped about us on the nearest beds and on the floor how well i recollect our sitting there talking in whispers or their talking and my respectfully listening i ought rather to say the moonlight falling a little way into the room through the window painting a pale window on the floor and the greater part of us in shadow except when steerforth scratched a match when he wanted to look for anything on the board and shed a blue glare over us that was gone directly a certain mysterious feeling consequent on the darkness the secrecy of the revel and the whisper in which everything was said steals over me again and i listen to all they tell me with a vague feeling of solemnity and awe which makes me glad they are all so near and frightens me though i feign to laugh when traddles pretends to see a ghost in the corner i heard all kinds of things about the school and all belonging to it i heard that mr creakle was the sternest and most severe of masters that he laid about him right and left every day of his life charging in among the boys like a trooper and slashing away unmercifully i heard that the man with the wooden leg whose name was tungay was an obstinate fellow who had formerly been in the hop business but had come into the line with mr creakle in consequence as was supposed among the boys of his having broken his leg in mr creakles service and having done a deal of dishonest work for him and knowing his secrets but the greatest wonder that i heard of mr creakle was there being one boy in the school on whom he never ventured to lay a hand and that that boy being j steerforth steerforth himself confirmed this when it was stated and said that he should like to begin to see him do it on being asked by a mild boy not me how he would proceed if he did begin to see him do it he scratched a match on purpose to shed a glare over his reply and said he would commence with knocking him down with a blow on the forehead from the sevenandsixpenny inkbottle that was always on the mantelpiece we sat in the dark for some time breathless i heard that miss creakle was regarded by the school in general as being in love with steerforth and i am sure as i sat in the dark thinking of his nice voice and his fine face and his easy manner and his curling hair i thought it very likely i heard that mr mell was not a bad sort of fellow but hadnt a sixpence to bless himself with and that there was no doubt that old mrs mell his mother was as poor as job one day traddles the most unfortunate boy in the world breaks a window accidentally with a ball i shudder at this moment with the tremendous sensation of seeing it done and feeling that the ball has bounded on to mr creakles sacred head poor traddles in a tight skyblue suit that made his arms and legs like german sausages or rolypoly puddings he was the merriest and most miserable of all the boys he was always being canedi think he was caned every day that halfyear except one holiday monday when he was only rulered on both handsand was always going to write to his uncle about it and never did after laying his head on the desk for a little while he would cheer up somehow begin to laugh again and draw skeletons all over his slate before his eyes were dry i used at first to wonder what comfort traddles found in drawing skeletons but i believe he only did it because they were easy and didnt want any features he was very honorable traddles was and held it as a solemn duty in the boys to stand by one another he suffered for this on several occasions and particularly once when steerforth laughed in church and the beadle thought it was traddles and took him out i see him now going away under guard despised by the congregation he never said who was the real offender though he smarted for it next day and was imprisoned so many hours that he came forth with a whole churchyard full of skeletons swarming all over his latin dictionary but he had his reward steerforth said there was nothing of the sneak in traddles and we all felt that to be the highest praise for my part i could have gone through a great deal though i was much less brave than traddles and nothing like so old to have won such a reward as praise from j steerforth to see steerforth walk to church before us arminarm with miss creakle was one of the great sights of my life i didnt think miss creakle equal to little emly in point of beauty and i didnt love her i didnt dare but i thought her a young lady of extraordinary attractions and in point of gentility not to be surpassed when steerforth in white trousers carried her parasol for her i felt proud to know him and believed that she could not choose but adore him with all her heart mr sharp and mr mell were both great personages in my eyes but steerforth was to them what the sun was to two stars an accidental matter strengthened the friendship between steerforth and me in a manner that inspired me with great pride and satisfaction though it sometimes led to inconvenience it happened on one occasion when he was doing me the honor of talking to me in the playground that i remarked that something or somebodyi forget what nowwas like something or somebody in the story of peregrine pickle he said nothing at the time but when i was going to bed at night asked me if i had got that book i told him no and explained how it was that i had read it and all those other books of which i had made mention and do you recollect them steerforth said oh yes i replied i had a good memory and i believed i recollected them very well then i tell you what young copperfield said steerforth you shall tell em to me i cant get to sleep very early at night and i generally wake rather early in the morning well go over em one after another well make some regular arabian nights of it i felt extremely flattered by this arrangement and we commenced carrying out the plan that very evening steerforth showed his thought for me in one particular instance in an unflinching manner that was a little troublesome to poor traddles and the rest peggottys promised letterwhat a comfortable letter it wasarrived before the half of the schoolterm was many weeks old and with it a cake in a perfect nest of oranges and two bottles of cowslip wine this treasure as in duty bound i laid at the feet of steerforth and begged him to divide it among the boys now ill tell you what young copperfield said he the wine shall be kept to wet your whistle when you are storytelling i blushed at the idea and begged him in my modesty not to think of it but he said he had observed i was sometimes hoarsea little roopy was his exact expressionand it should be every drop set apart to the purpose he had mentioned accordingly it was locked up in his box and drawn off by himself in a phial and administered to me through a piece of quill in the cork when i was supposed to be in want of something to restore my voice sometimes to make it more powerful he was so kind as to squeeze orange juice into it or to stir it up with ginger or dissolve a peppermint drop in it we seem to me to have been months over peregrine and months more over the other stories the school never flagged for want of a story i am certain and the wine lasted out almost as well as the matter poor traddlesi never think of that boy but with a strange disposition to laugh and with tears in my eyeswas a sort of echo to the story and pretended to be overcome with laughing at the funny parts and to be overcome with fear when there was any passage of an alarming character in the story this rather put me out very often it was a great jest of his i recollect to pretend that he couldnt keep his teeth from chattering whenever mention was made of an alguazil in connection with the adventures of gil blas and i remember when gil blas met the captain of the robbers in madrid this unlucky joker acted such a shudder of terror that he was overheard by mr creakle who was prowling about the passage and handsomely flogged for disorderly conduct in the bedroom one day i had a visit from mr peggotty and ham who had brought two enormous lobsters a huge crab and a large canvas bag of shrimps as they remembered i was partial to a relish with my meals i was proud to introduce my friend steerforth to these kind simple friends and told them how good steerforth was to me and how he helped me with my work and took care of me and steerforth delighted the fishermen with his friendly pleasant manners the relish was greatly enjoyed by the boys at supper that night only poor traddles became very ill from eating crab so late at last the holidays came and i went home the carrier barkis met me at yarmouth and was rather gruff which i soon found out was because he had not had any answer to his message i promised to ask peggotty for one ah what a strange feeling it was to be going home when it was not home and to find that every object i looked at reminded me of the happy old home which was like a dream i could never dream again god knows how like a child the memory may have been that was awakened within me by the sound of my mothers voice in the old parlor when i set foot in the hall i believed from the solitary and thoughtful way in which my mother murmured her song that she was alone and i went softly into the room she was sitting by the fire nursing an infant whose tiny hand she held against her neck her eyes were looking down upon its face and she sat singing to it i was so far right that she had no other companion i spoke to her and she started and cried out but seeing me she called me her dear davy her own boy and coming half across the room to meet me kneeled down upon the ground and kissed me and laid my head down on her bosom near the little creature that was nestling there and put its hand up to my lips i wish i had died i wish i had died then with that feeling in my heart i should have been more fit for heaven than i ever have been since he is your brother said my mother fondling me davy my pretty boy my poor child then she kissed me more and more and clasped me round the neck this she was doing when peggotty came running in and bounced down on the ground beside us and went mad about us both for a quarter of an hour we had a very happy afternoon the day i came mr and miss murdstone were out and i sat with my mother and peggotty and told them all about my school and steerforth and took the little baby in my arms and nursed it lovingly but when the murdstones came back i was more unhappy than ever i felt uncomfortable about going down to breakfast in the morning as i had never set eyes on mr murdstone since the day when i committed my memorable offense however as it must be done i went down after two or three false starts halfway and as many runs back on tiptoe to my own room and presented myself in the parlor he was standing before the fire with his back to it while miss murdstone made the tea he looked at me steadily as i entered but made no sign of recognition whatever i went up to him after a moment of confusion and said i beg your pardon sir i am very sorry for what i did and i hope you will forgive me i am glad to hear you are sorry david he replied how do you do maam i said to miss murdstone ah dear me sighed miss murdstone giving me the teacaddy scoop instead of her finger how long are the holidays a month maam counting from when from today maam oh said miss murdstone then heres one day off she kept a calendar of the holidays in this way and every morning checked a day off in exactly the same manner she did it gloomily until she came to ten but when she got into two figures she became more hopeful and as the time advanced even jocular thus the holidays lagged away until the morning came when miss murdstone said heres the last day off and gave me the closing cup of tea of the vacation i was not sorry to go again mr barkis appeared at the gate and again miss murdstone in her warning voice said clara when my mother bent over me to bid me farewell i kissed her and my baby brother it is not so much the embrace she gave me that lives in my mind though it was as fervent as could be as what followed the embrace i was in the carriers cart when i heard her calling to me i looked out and she stood at the garden gate alone holding her baby up in her arms for me to see it was cold still weather and not a hair of her head or fold of her dress was stirred as she looked intently at me holding up her child so i lost her so i saw her afterwards in my sleep at schoola silent presence near my bedlooking at me with the same intent faceholding up her baby in her arms about two months after i had been back at school i was sent for one day to go into the parlor i hurried in joyfully for it was my birthday and i thought it might be a box from peggottybut alas no it was very sad news mrs creakle had to give memy dear mamma had died mrs creakle was very kind and gentle to me and the boys especially traddles were very sorry for me i went home the next day and heard that the dear baby had died too peggotty received me with great tenderness and told me about my mothers illness and how she had sent a loving message to me tell my dearest boy that his mother as she lay here blessed him not once but a thousand times and she had prayed to god to protect and keep her fatherless boy mr murdstone did not take any notice of me nor had miss murdstone a word of kindness for me peggotty was to leave in a month and to my great joy i was allowed to go with her on a visit to mr peggotty on our way i found out that the mysterious message i had given to peggotty meant that barkis wanted to marry her and peggotty had consented everyone in mr peggottys cottage was pleased to see me and did their best to comfort me little emly was at school when i arrived and i went out to meet her i knew the way by which she would come and presently found myself strolling along the path to meet her a figure appeared in the distance before long and i soon knew it to be emly who was a little creature still in stature though she was grown but when she drew nearer and i saw her blue eyes looking bluer and her dimpled face looking brighter and her own self prettier and gayer a curious feeling came over me that made me pretend not to know her and pass by as if i were looking at something a long way off i have done such a thing since in later life or i am mistaken little emly didnt care a bit she saw me well enough but instead of turning round and calling after me ran away laughing this obliged me to run after her and she ran so fast that we were very near the cottage before i caught her oh its you is it said little emly why you knew who it was emly said i and didnt you know who it was said emly i was going to kiss her but she covered her cherry lips with her hands and said she wasnt a baby now and ran away laughing more than ever into the house she seemed to delight in teasing me which was a change in her i wondered at very much the teatable was ready and our little locker was put out in its old place but instead of coming to sit by me she went and bestowed her company upon that grumbling mrs gummidge and on mr peggottys inquiring why rumpled her hair all over her face to hide it and would do nothing but laugh a little puss it is said mr peggotty patting her with his great hand ah said peggotty running his fingers through her bright curls heres another orphan you see sir and here giving ham a backhanded knock in the chest is another of em though he dont look much like it if i had you for a guardian mr peggotty said i i dont think i should feel much like it emly was confused by our all observing her and hung down her head and her face was covered with blushes glancing up presently through her stray curls and seeing that we were all looking at her still i am sure i for one could have looked at her for hours she ran away and kept away till it was nearly bedtime i lay down in the old little bed in the stern of the boat and the wind came moaning on across the flat as it had done before but i could not help fancying now that it moaned of those who were gone and instead of thinking that the sea might rise in the night and float the boat away i thought of the sea that had risen since i last heard those sounds and drowned my happy home i recollect as the wind and water began to sound fainter in my ears putting a short clause into my prayers petitioning that i might grow up to marry little emly and so dropping lovingly asleep during this visit peggotty was married to mr barkis and had a nice little house of her own and i spent the night before i was to return home in a little room in the roof young or old davy dear so long as i have this house over my head said peggotty you shall find it as if i expected you here directly every minute i shall keep it as i used to keep your old little room my darling and if you was to go to china you might think of its being kept just the same all the time you were away i felt how good and true a friend she was and thanked her as well as i could for they had brought me to the gate of my home and peggotty had me clasped in her arms i was poor and lonely at home with no one near to speak a loving word or a face to look on with love or liking only the two persons who had broken my mothers heart how utterly wretched and forlorn i felt i found i was not to go back to school any more and wandered about sad and solitary neglected and uncared for peggottys weekly visits were my only comfort i longed to go to school however hard an one to be taught something anyhow anywherebut no one took any pains with me and i had no friends near who could help me at last one day after some weary months had passed mr murdstone told me i was to go to london and earn my own living there was a place for me at murdstone grinbys a firm in the wine trade my lodging and clothes would be provided for me by my stepfather and i would earn enough for my food and pocket money the next day i was sent up to london with the manager dressed in a shabby little white hat with black crape round it for my mother a black jacket and hard stiff corduroy trousers a little fellow of ten years old to fight my own battles with the world my place i found was one of the lowest in the firm of murdstone grinby with boys of no education and in quite an inferior station to myselfmy duties were to wash the bottles stick on labels and so on i was utterly miserable at being degraded in this way when i thought of my former companions steerforth and traddles and my hopes of becoming a learned and famous man and shed bitter tears as i feared i would forget all i had learnt at school my lodging one bare little room was in the house of some people named micawber shiftless careless goodnatured people who were always in debt and difficulties i felt great pity for their misfortunes and did what i could to help poor mrs micawber to sell her books and other little things she could spare to buy food for herself her husband and their four children i was too young and childish to know how to provide properly for myself and often found i was obliged to live on bread and slices of cold pudding at the end of the week if i had not been a very innocentminded good little boy i might easily have fallen into bad ways at this time but god took care of me and kept me from harm i would not even tell peggotty how miserable i was for fear of distressing her the troubles of the micawbers increased more and more until at last they were obliged to leave london i was very sad at this for i had been with them so long that i felt they were my friends and the prospect of being once more utterly alone and having to find a lodging with strangers made me so unhappy that i determined to endure this sort of life no longer the last sunday the micawbers were in town i dined with them i had bought a spotted horse for their little boy and a doll for the little girl and had saved up a shilling for the poor servantgirl after i had seen them off the next morning by the coach i wrote to peggotty to ask her if she knew where my aunt miss betsy trotwood lived and to borrow halfaguinea for i had resolved to run away from murdstone grinbys and go to this aunt and tell her my story i remembered my mother telling me of her visit when i was a baby and that she fancied miss betsy had stroked her hair gently and this gave me courage to appeal to her peggotty wrote enclosing the halfguinea and saying she only knew miss trotwood lived near dover but whether in that place itself or at folkestone sandgate or hythe she could not tell hearing that all these places were close together i made up my mind to start as i had received my weeks wages in advance i waited till the following saturday thinking it would not be honest to go before i went out to look for someone to carry my box to the coach office and unfortunately hired a wicked young man who not only ran off with the box but robbed me of my halfguinea leaving me in dire distress in despair i started off to walk to dover and was forced to sell my waistcoat to buy some bread the first night i found my way to my old school at blackheath and slept on a haystack close by feeling some comfort in the thought of the boys being near i knew steerforth had left or i would have tried to see him on i trudged the next day and sold my jacket at chatham to a dreadful old man who kept me waiting all day for the money which was only one shilling and fourpence i was afraid to buy anything but bread or to spend any money on a bed or a shelter for the night and was terribly frightened by some rough tramps who threw stones at me when i did not answer to their calls after six days i arrived at dover ragged dusty and halfdead with hunger and fatigue but here at first i could get no tidings of my aunt and in despair was going to try some of the other places peggotty had mentioned when the driver of a fly dropped his horsecloth and as i was handing it up to him i saw something kind in the mans face that encouraged me to ask once more if he knew where miss trotwood lived the man directed me towards some houses on the heights and thither i toiled going into a little shop i by chance met with miss trotwoods maid who showed me the house and went in leaving me standing at the gate a forlorn little creature without a jacket or waistcoat my white hat crushed out of shape my shoes worn out my shirt and trousers torn and stained my pretty curly hair tangled my face and hands sunburnt and covered with dust lifting my eyes to one of the windows above i saw a pleasantfaced gentleman with gray hair who nodded at me several times then shook his head and went away i was just turning away to think what i should do when a tall erect elderly lady with a gardening apron on and a knife in her hand came out of the house and began to dig up a root in the garden go away she said go away no boys here but i felt desperate going in softly i stood beside her and touched her with my finger and said timidly if you please maam and when she looked up i went on please aunt i am your nephew oh lord she exclaimed in astonishment and sat flat down on the path staring at me while i went on i am david copperfield of blunderstone in suffolk where you came the night i was born and saw my dear mamma i have been very unhappy since she died i have been neglected and taught nothing and thrown upon myself and put to work not fit for me it made me run away to you i was robbed at first starting out and have walked all the way and have never slept in a bed since i began the journey here i broke into a passion of crying and my aunt jumped up and took me into the house where she opened a cupboard and took out some bottles pouring some of the contents of each into my mouth not noticing in her agitation what they were for i fancied i tasted aniseseed water anchovy sauce and salad dressing then she put me on the sofa and sent the servant to ask mr dick to come down the gentleman whom i had seen at the window came in and was told by miss trotwood who the ragged little object on the sofa was and she finished by saying now here you see young david copperfield and the question is what shall i do with him do with him answered mr dick then after some consideration and looking at me he said well if i was you i should wash him miss trotwood was quite pleased at this and a warm bath was got ready at once after which i was dressed in a shirt and trousers belonging to mr dick for janet had burnt my rags rolled up in several shawls and put on the sofa till dinnertime where i slept and woke with the impression that my aunt had come and put my hair off my face and murmured pretty fellow poor fellow after dinner i had to tell my story all over again to my aunt and mr dick miss trotwood again asked mr dicks advice and was delighted when that gentleman suggested i should be put to bed i knelt down to say my prayers that night in a pleasant room facing the sea and as i lay in the clean snowwhite bed i felt so grateful and comforted that i prayed earnestly i might never be homeless again and might never forget the homeless the next morning my aunt told me she had written to mr murdstone i was alarmed to think that my stepfather knew where i was and exclaimed oh i dont know what i shall do if i have to go back to mr murdstone but my aunt said nothing of her intentions and i was uncertain what was to become of me i hoped she might befriend me at last mr and miss murdstone arrived to miss betsys great indignation miss murdstone rode a donkey across the green in front of the house and stopped at the gate nothing made miss trotwood so angry as to see donkeys on that green and i had already seen several battles between my aunt or janet and the donkey boys after driving away the donkey and the boy who had dared to bring it there miss trotwood received her visitors she kept me near her fenced in with a chair mr murdstone told miss betsy that i was a very bad stubborn violenttempered boy whom he had tried to improve but could not succeed that he had put me in a respectable business from which i had run away if miss trotwood chose to protect and encourage me now she must do it always for he had come to fetch me away from there and then and if i was ready to come and miss trotwood did not wish to give me up to be dealt with exactly as mr murdstone liked he would cast me off for always and have no more to do with me are you ready to go david asked my aunt but i answered no and begged and prayed her for my fathers sake to befriend and protect me for neither mr nor miss murdstone had ever liked me or been kind to me and had made my mamma who always loved me dearly very unhappy about me and i had been very miserable mr dick said miss trotwood what shall i do with this child mr dick considered have him measured for a suit of clothes directly mr dick said miss trotwood your common sense is invaluable then she pulled me towards her and said to mr murdstone you can go when you like ill take my chance with the boy if hes all you say he is i can at least do as much for him as you have done but i dont believe a word of it then she told mr murdstone what she thought of the way he had treated me and my mother which did not make that gentleman feel very comfortable and finished by turning to miss murdstone and saying goodday to you too maam and if i ever see you ride a donkey across my green again as sure as you have a head upon your shoulders ill knock your bonnet off and tread upon it this startled miss murdstone so much that she went off quite quietly with her brother while i overjoyed threw my arms round my aunts neck and kissed and thanked her with great heartiness some clothes were bought for me that same day and marked trotwood copperfield for my aunt wished to call me by her name now i felt my troubles were over and i began quite a new life well cared for and kindly treated i was sent to a very nice school in canterbury where my aunt left me with these words which i never forgot trot be a credit to yourself to me and mr dick and heaven be with you never be mean in anything never be false never be cruel avoid these three vices trot and i shall always be hopeful of you i did my best to show my gratitude to my dear aunt by studying hard and trying to be all she could wish when you are older you can read how little david copperfield grew up to be a good clever man and met again all his old friends and made many new ones also what became of steerforth traddles the peggottys little emly and the micawbers viii jenny wren walking into the city one holiday a great many years ago a gentleman ran up the steps of a tall house in the neighborhood of st mary axe the lower windows were those of a countinghouse but the blinds like those of the entire front of the house were drawn down the gentleman knocked and rang several times before any one came but at last an old man opened the door what were you up to that you did not hear me said mr fledgeby irritably i was taking the air at the top of the house sir said the old man meekly it being a holiday what might you please to want sir humph holiday indeed grumbled his master who was a toy merchant amongst other things he then seated himself in the countinghouse and gave the old mana jew and riah by namedirections about the dressing of some dolls about which he had come to speak and as he rose to go exclaimed illustration seated on the crystal carpet were two girls page bytheby how do you take the air do you stick your head out of a chimneypot no sir i have made a little garden on the leads lets look it at said mr fledgeby sir i have company there returned riah hesitating but will you please come up and see them mr fledgeby nodded and passing his master with a bow the old man led the way up flight after flight of stairs till they arrived at the housetop seated on a carpet and leaning against a chimneystack were two girls bending over books some humble creepers were trained round the chimneypots and evergreens were placed round the roof and a few more books a basket of gaily colored scraps and bits of tinsel and another of common print stuff lay near one of the girls rose on seeing that riah had brought a visitor but the other remarked im the person of the house downstairs but i cant get up whoever you are because my back is bad and my legs are queer this is my master said riah speaking to the two girls and this he added turning to mr fledgeby is miss jenny wren she lives in this house and is a clever little dressmaker for little people her friend lizzie continued riah introducing the second girl they are good girls both and as busy as they are good in spare moments they come up here and take to book learning we are glad to come up here for rest sir said lizzie with a grateful look at the old jew no one can tell the rest what this place is to us humph said mr fledgeby looking round humph he was so much surprised that apparently he couldnt get beyond that word and as he went down again the old chimneypots in their black cowls seemed to turn round and look after him as if they were saying humph too lizzie the elder of these two girls was strong and handsome but little jenny wren whom she so loved and protected was small and deformed though she had a beautiful little face and the longest and loveliest golden hair in the world which fell about her like a cloak of shining curls as though to hide the poor little misshapen figure the jew riah as well as lizzie was always kind and gentle to jenny wren who called him her godfather she had a father who shared her poor little rooms whom she called her child for he was a bad drunken worthless old man and the poor girl had to care for him and earn money to keep them both she suffered a great deal for the poor little bent back always ached sadly and was often weary from constant work but it was only on rare occasions when alone or with her friend lizzie who often brought her work and sat in jennys room that the brave child ever complained of her hard lot sometimes the two girls jenny helping herself along with a crutch would go and walk about the fashionable streets in order to note how the grand folks were dressed as they walked along jenny would tell her friend of the fancies she had when sitting alone at her work i imagine birds till i can hear them sing she said one day and flowers till i can smell them and oh the beautiful children that come to me in the early mornings they are quite different to other children not like me never cold or anxious or tired or hungry never any pain they come in numbers in long bright slanting rows all dressed in white and with shiny heads who is this in pain they say and they sweep around and about me take me up in their arms and i feel so light and all the pain goes i know when they are coming a long way off by hearing them say who is this in pain and i answer oh my blessed children its poor me have pity on me and take me up and then the pain will go lizzie sat stroking and brushing the beautiful hair whilst the tired little dressmaker leant against her when they were at home again and as she kissed her goodnight a miserable old man stumbled into the room hows my jenny wren best of children he mumbled as he shuffled unsteadily towards her but jenny pointed her small finger towards him exclaiminggo along with you you bad wicked old child you troublesome wicked old thing i know where you have been i know your tricks and your manners the wretched man began to whimper like a scolded child slave slave slave from morning to night went on jenny still shaking her finger at him and all for this aint you ashamed of yourself you disgraceful boy yes my dear yes stammered the tipsy old father tumbling into a corner thus was the poor little dolls dressmaker dragged down day by day by the very hands that should have cared for and held her up poor poor little dolls dressmaker one day when jenny was on her way home with riah who had accompanied her on one of her walks to the west end they came on a small crowd of people a tipsy man had been knocked down and badly hurt let us see what it is said jenny coming swiftly forward on her crutches the next moment she exclaimedoh gentlemengentlemen he is my child he belongs to me my poor bad old child your childbelongs to you repeated the man who was about to lift the helpless figure on to a stretcher which had been brought for the purpose aye its old dollstipsy old dolls cried someone in the crowd for it was by this name that they knew the old man hes her father sir said riah in a low tone to the doctor who was now bending over the stretcher so much the worse answered the doctor for the man is dead yes mr dolls was dead and many were the dresses which the weary fingers of the sorrowful little worker must make in order to pay for his humble funeral and buy a black frock for herself riah sat by her in her poor room saying a word of comfort now and then and lizzie came and went and did all manner of little things to help her but often the tears rolled down on to her work my poor child she said to riah my poor old child and to think i scolded him so you were always a good brave patient girl returned riah smiling a little over her quaint fancy about her child always good and patient however tired and so the poor little person of the house was left alone but for the faithful affection of the kind jew and her friend lizzie her room grew pretty and comfortable for she was in great request in her profession as she called it and there were now no one to spend and waste her earnings but nothing could make her life otherwise than a suffering one till the happy morning when her childangels visited her for the last time and carried her away to the land where all such pain as hers is healed for evermore illustration keep still you little imp or ill cut your throat page ix pips adventure all that little philip pirrip usually called pip knew about his father and mother and his five little brothers was from seeing their tombstones in the churchyard he was cared for by his sister who was twenty years older than himself she had married a blacksmith named joe gargery a kind good man while she unfortunately was a hard stern woman and treated her little brother and her amiable husband with great harshness they lived in a marshy part of the country about twenty miles from the sea one cold raw day towards evening when pip was about six years old he had wandered into the churchyard and was trying to make out what he could of the inscriptions on his family tombstones the darkness was coming on and feeling very lonely and frightened he began to cry hold your noise cried a terrible voice and a man started up from among the graves close to him keep still you little imp or ill cut your throat he was a dreadful looking man dressed in coarse gray cloth with a great iron on his leg wet muddy and miserable he limped and shivered and glared and growled his teeth chattered in his head as he seized pip by the chin oh dont cut my throat sir cried pip in terror pray dont do it sir tell us your name said the man quick pip sir once more said the man staring at him give it mouth pip pip sir show us where you live said the man point out the place pip showed him the village about a mile or more from the church the man looked at him for a moment and then turned him upside down and emptied his pockets he found nothing in them but a piece of bread which he ate ravenously you young dog said the man licking his lips what fat cheeks you ha got darn me if i couldnt eat em and if i hant half a mind to pip said earnestly that he hoped he would not now lookee here said the man wheres your mother there sir said pip at this the man started and seemed about to run away but stopped and looked over his shoulder there sir explained pip showing him the tombstone oh and is that your father along of your mother yes sir said pip ha muttered the man then who dye live withsupposin youre kindly let to live which i hant made up my mind about my sister sir mrs joe gargery wife of joe gargery the blacksmith sir blacksmith eh said the man and looked down at his leg then he seized the trembling little boy by both arms and glaring down at him he said now lookee here the question being whether youre to be let to live you know what a file is yes sir and you know what wittles is something to eat yes sir you get me a file and you get me wittlesyou bring em both to me all this time he was tilting poor pip backwards till he was so dreadfully frightened and giddy that he clung to the man with both hands you bring me tomorrow morning early that file and them wittles you do it and you never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your having seen such a person as me or any person sumever and you shall be let to live then he threatened all sorts of dreadful and terrible things to poor pip if he failed to do all he had commanded and made him solemnly promise to bring him what he wanted and to keep the secret then he let him go saying you remember what youve undertook and you get home googoodnight sir faltered pip much of that said he glancing over the cold wet flat i wish i was a frog or a eel pip ran home without stopping joe was sitting in the chimneycorner and told him mrs joe had been out to look for him and taken tickler with her tickler was a cane and pip was rather downhearted by this piece of news mrs joe came in almost directly and after having given pip a taste of tickler she sat down to prepare the tea and cutting a huge slice of bread and butter she gave half of it to joe and half to pip pip managed after some time to slip his down the leg of his trousers and joe thinking he had swallowed it was dreadfully alarmed and begged him not to bolt his food like that pip old chap youll do yourself a mischiefitll stick somewhere you cant have chewed it pip you know pip you and me is always friends and id be the last one to tell upon you any time but such asuch a most uncommon bolt as that been bolting his food has he cried mrs joe you know old chap said joe i bolted myself when i was your agefrequentand as a boy ive been among a many bolters but i never see your bolting equal yet pip and its a mercy you aint bolted dead mrs joe made a dive at pip fished him up by the hair saying you come along and be dosed it was christmas eve and pip had to stir the pudding from seven to eight and found the bread and butter dreadfully in his way at last he slipped out and put it away in his little bedroom poor pip passed a wretched night thinking of the dreadful promise he had made and as soon as it was beginning to get light outside he got up and crept downstairs fancying that every board creaked out stop thief and get up mrs joe as quickly as he could he took some bread some rind of cheese about half a jar of mincemeat which he tied up in a handkerchief with the slice of bread and butter some brandy from a stone bottle a meatbone with very little on it and a porkpipe which he found on an upper shelf then he got a file from among joes tools and ran for the marshes it was a very misty morning and pip imagined that all the cattle stared at him as if to say halloa young thief and one black ox with a white cravat on that made pip think of a clergyman looked so accusingly at him that pip blubbered out i couldnt help it sir it wasnt for myself i took it upon which the ox put down his head blew a cloud of smoke out of his nose and vanished with a kickup of his hind legs and a flourish of his tail pip was soon at the place of meeting after that and there was the manhugging himself and limping to and fro as if he had never all night left off hugging and limping he was awfully cold to be sure pip half expected to see him drop down before his face and die of cold his eyes looked so awfully hungry too that when pip handed him the file it occurred to him he would have tried to eat it if he had not seen the bundle he did not turn pip upside down this time to get at what he had but left him right side upward while he opened the bundle and emptied his pockets whats in the bottle boy said he brandy said pip he was already handing mincepie down his throat in the most curious manner more like a man who was putting it away somewhere in a violent hurry than a man who was eating itbut he left off to take some of the liquor shivering all the while so violently that it was quite as much as he could do to keep the neck of the bottle between his teeth i think you have got the chills said pip im much of your opinion boy said he its bad about here youve been lying out on the marshes and theyre dreadful for the chills rheumatic too ill eat my breakfast before theyre the death of me said he id do that if i was going to be strung up to that there gallows as there is over there directly arterward ill beat the shivers so far ill bet you a guinea he was gobbling mincemeat meatbone bread cheese and porkpie all at once staring distrustfully while he did so at the mist all round and often stoppingeven stopping his jawsto listen some real or fancied sound some clink upon the river or breathing of beasts upon the marsh now gave him a start and he said suddenly youre not a false imp you brought no one with you no sir no nor told nobody to follow you no well said he i believe you youd be but a fierce young hound indeed if at your time of life you should help to hunt a wretched warmint hunted as near death and dunghill as this poor wretched warmint is something clicked in his throat as if he had works in him like a clock and was going to strike and he smeared his ragged rough sleeve over his eyes pitying his desolation and watching him as he gradually settled down upon the pie pip made bold to say i am glad you enjoy it did you speak i said i was glad you enjoyed it thankee my boy i do pip had often watched a large dog eating his food and he now noticed a decided similarity between the dogs way of eating and the mans the man took strong sharp sudden bites just like the dog he swallowed or rather snapped up every mouthful too soon and too fast and he looked sideways here and there while he ate as if he thought there was danger of somebodys coming to take the pie away he was altogether too unsettled in his mind over it to enjoy it comfortably pip thought or to have anybody to dine with him without making a chop with his jaws at the visitor in all of which particulars he was very like the dog pip watched him trying to file the iron off his leg and then being afraid of stopping longer away from home he ran off pip passed a wretched morning expecting every moment that the disappearance of the pie would be found out but mrs joe was too much taken up with preparing the dinner for they were expecting visitors and were to have a superb dinner consisting of a leg of pickled pork and greens and a pair of roast stuffed fowls a mincepie and a pudding just at the end of the dinner pip thought his time had come to be found out for his sister said graciously to her guests you must taste a most delightful and delicious present i have had its a pie a savory porkpie pip could bear it no longer and ran for the door and there ran head foremost into a party of soldiers with their muskets one of whom held out a pair of handcuffs to him saying here you are look sharp come on but they had not come for him they only wanted joe to mend the handcuffs for they were on the search for two convicts who had escaped and were somewhere hid in the marshes this turned the attention of mrs joe from the disappearance of the pie without which she had come back in great astonishment when the handcuffs were mended the soldiers went off accompanied by joe and one of the visitors and joe took pip and carried him on his back pip whispered i hope joe we shant find them and joe answered id give a shilling if they had cut and run pip but the soldiers soon caught them and one was the wretched man who had talked with pip and once when he looked at pip the child shook his head to try and let him know he had said nothing but the convict without looking at anyone told the sergeant he wanted to say something to prevent other people being under suspicion and said he had taken some wittles from the blacksmiths it was some broken wittles thats what it was and a dram of liquor and a pie have you happened to miss such an article as a pie blacksmith inquired the sergeant my wife did at the very moment when you came in dont you know pip so said the convict looking at joe youre the blacksmith are you then im sorry to say ive eat your pie god knows youre welcome to it said joe we dont know what you have done but we wouldnt have you starved to death for it poor miserable fellowcreature would us pip then the boat came and the convicts were taken back to their prison and joe carried pip home some years after some mysterious friend sent money for pip to be educated and brought up as a gentleman but it was only when pip was quite grown up that he discovered this mysterious friend was the wretched convict who had frightened him so dreadfully that cold dark christmas eve he had been sent to a far away land and there had grown rich but he never forgot the little boy who had been kind to him x todgers this is the story of a visit made by mr pecksniff a very pompous man and his two daughters miss mercy and miss charity to the boardinghouse kept by mrs todgers in london and a call while there on miss pinch a governess or young lady teaching in a rich family mr pecksniff with his two beautiful young daughters looked about him for a moment and then knocked at the door of a very dingy building even among the choice collection of dingy houses around on the front of which was a little oval board like a teatray with this inscriptioncommercial boardinghouse m todgers it seemed that m todgers was not up yet for mr pecksniff knocked twice and rang three times without making any impression on anything but a dog over the way at last a chain and some bolts were withdrawn with a rusty noise and a small boy with a large red head and no nose to speak of and a very dirty boot on his left arm appeared who being surprised rubbed the nose just mentioned with the back of a shoebrush and said nothing still abed my man asked mr pecksniff still abed replied the boy i wish they was still abed theyre very noisy abed all calling for their boots at once i thought you was the paper and wondered why you didnt shove yourself through the grating as usual what do you want considering his years which were tender the youth may be said to have asked this question sternly and in something of a defiant manner but mr pecksniff without taking offense at his bearing put a card in his hand and bade him take that upstairs and show them in the meanwhile into a room where there was a fire surely there never was in any other borough city or hamlet in the world such a singular sort of a place as todgers and surely london to judge from that part of it which hemmed todgers round and hustled it and crushed it and stuck its brickandmortar elbows into it and kept the air from it and stood perpetually between it and the light was worthy of todgers there were more trucks near todgers than you would suppose a whole city could ever need not trucks at work but a vagabond race forever lounging in the narrow lanes before their masters doors and stopping up the pass so that when a stray hackneycoach or lumbering wagon came that way they were the cause of such an uproar as enlivened the whole neighborhood and made the very bells in the next churchtower ring again in the narrow dark streets near todgers winemerchants and wholesale dealers in groceryware had perfect little towns of their own and deep among the very foundations of these buildings the ground was undermined and burrowed out into stables where carthorses troubled by rats might be heard on a quiet sunday rattling their halters as disturbed spirits in tales of haunted houses are said to clank their chains to tell of half the queer old taverns that had a drowsy and secret existence near todgers would fill a goodly book while a second volume no less in size might be given to an account of the quaint old guests who frequented their dimlylighted parlors the top of the house was worthy of notice there was a sort of terrace on the roof with posts and fragments of rotten lines once intended to dry clothes upon and there were two or three teachests out there full of earth with forgotten plants in them like old walkingsticks whoever climbed to this observatory was stunned at first from having knocked his head against the little door in coming out and after that was for the moment choked from having looked perforce straight down the kitchen chimney but these two stages over there were things to gaze at from the top of todgers well worth your seeing too for first and foremost if the day were bright you observed upon the housetops stretching far away a long dark paththe shadow of the tall monument which stands in memory of the great fire in london many years before and turning round the monument itself was close beside you with every hair erect upon his golden head as if the doings of the city frightened him then there were steeples towers belfries shining vanes and masts of ships a very forest gables housetops garretwindows wilderness upon wilderness smoke and noise enough for all the world at once after the first glance there were slight features in the midst of this crowd of objects which sprung out from the mass without any reason as it were and took hold of the attention whether the spectator would or no thus the revolving chimneypots on one great stack of buildings seemed to be turning gravely to each other every now and then and whispering the result of their separate observation of what was going on below others of a crookedback shape appeared to be maliciously holding themselves askew that they might shut the prospect out and baffle todgers the man who was mending a pen at an upper window over the way became of vast importance in the scene and made a blank in it ridiculously large in its size when he went away the fluttering of a piece of cloth upon the dyers pole had far more interest for the moment than all the changing motion of the crowd yet even while the lookeron felt angry with himself for this and wondered how it was the tumult swelled into a roar the hosts of objects seemed to thicken and expand a hundredfold and after gazing round him quite scared he turned into todgers again much more rapidly than he came out and ten to one he told m todgers afterwards that if he hadnt done so he would certainly have come into the street by the shortest cut that is to say headforemost so said the two miss pecksniffs when they came down with mrs todgers from the roof of the house leaving the youthful porter to close the door and follow them downstairs who being of a playful temperament and contemplating with a delight peculiar to his sex and time of life any chance of dashing himself into small fragments lingered behind to walk upon the wall around the roof it was the second day of their stay in london and by this time the misses pecksniff and mrs todgers were becoming very friendly insomuch that the lastnamed lady had already told the story of three early disappointments in love and had furthermore given her young friends a general account of the life conduct and character of mr todgers who it seemed had cut his life as a husband rather short by unlawfully running away from his happiness and staying for a time in foreign countries as a bachelor your pa was once a little particular in his attentions my dears said mrs todgers but to be your ma was too much happiness denied me youd hardly know who this was done for perhaps she called their attention to an oval miniature like a little blister which was tacked up over the kettleholder and in which there was a dreamy shadowing forth of her own visage its a speaking likeness cried the two misses pecksniff it was considered so once said mrs todgers warming herself in a gentlemanly manner at the fire but i hardly thought you would have known it my loves they would have known it anywhere if they could have met with it in the street or seen it in a shopwindow they would have cried good gracious mrs todgers being in charge of a boardinghouse like this makes sad havoc with the features my dear misses pecksniff said mrs todgers the gravy alone is enough to add twenty years to ones age i do assure you lor cried the two misses pecksniff the anxiety of that one thing my dears said mrs todgers keeps the mind continually upon the stretch there is no such passion in human nature as the passion for gravy among business men its nothing to say a joint wont yielda whole animal wouldnt yieldthe amount of gravy they expect each day at dinner and what i have undergone in consequence cried mrs todgers raising her eyes and shaking her head no one would believe just like mr pinch mercy said charity we have always noticed it in him you remember yes my dear giggled mercy but we have never given it him you know mr pecksniff kept what was called a school for architects and tom pinch was one of his students you my dears having to deal with your pas pupils who cant help themselves are able to take your own way said mrs todgers but in a boardinghouse where any gentleman may say any saturday evening mrs todgers this day week we part in consequence of the cheese it is not so easy to preserve a pleasant understanding your pa was kind enough added the good lady to invite me to take a ride with you today and i think he mentioned that you were going to call upon miss pinch any relation to the gentleman you were speaking of just now miss pecksniff for goodness sake mrs todgers interposed the lively mercy dont call him a gentleman my dear cherry pinch a gentleman the idea what a wicked girl you are cried mrs todgers embracing her with great affection you are quite a joker i do declare my dear miss pecksniff what a happiness your sisters spirits must be to your pa and self that pinch is the most hideous goggleeyed creature mrs todgers in existence resumed mercy quite an ogre the ugliest awkwardest frightfullest being you can imagine this is his sister so i leave you to suppose what she is i shall be obliged to laugh outright i know i shall cried the charming girl i never shall be able to keep my face straight the notion of a miss pinch really living at all is sufficient to kill one but to see heroh my stars mrs todgers laughed immensely at the dear loves humor and declared she was quite afraid of her that she was she was so very severe who is severe cried a voice at the door there is no such thing as severity in our family i hope and then mr pecksniff peeped smilingly into the room and said may i come in mrs todgers mrs todgers almost screamed for the little door between that room and the inner one being wide open there was a full showing of the sofabedstead open as a bed and not closed as a sofa but she had the presence of mind to close it in the twinkling of an eye and having done so said though not without confusion oh yes mr pecksniff you can come in if you please how are we today said mr pecksniff jocosely and what are our plans are we ready to go and see tom pinchs sister ha ha ha poor thomas pinch are we ready returned mrs todgers nodding her head in a mysterious manner to send a favorable reply to mr jinkins roundrobind thats the first question mr pecksniff why mr jinkins robin my dear madam asked mr pecksniff putting one arm round mercy and the other round mrs todgers whom he seemed for the moment to mistake for charity why mr jinkins because he began to get it up and indeed always takes the lead in the house said mrs todgers playfully thats why sir jinkins is a man of superior talents observed mr pecksniff i have formed a great regard for jinkins i take jinkins desire to pay polite attention to my daughters as an additional proof of the friendly feelings of jinkins mrs todgers well now returned the lady having said so much you must say the rest mr pecksniff so tell the dear young ladies all about it with these words she gently drew away from mr pecksniffs grasp and took miss charity into her own embrace though whether she was led to this act solely by the affection she had conceived for that young lady or whether it had any reference to a lowering not to say distinctly spiteful expression which had been visible in her face for some moments has never been exactly ascertained be this as it may mr pecksniff went on to inform his daughters of the purpose and history of the roundrobin aforesaid which was in brief that the young men who helped to make up the sum and substance of that company called todgers desired the honor of their presence at the general table so long as they remained in the house and besought that they would grace the board at dinnertime next day the same being sunday he further said that mrs todgers having consented to this invitation he was willing for his part to accept it and so left them that he might write his gracious answer the while they armed themselves with their best bonnets for the utter defeat and overthrow of miss pinch tom pinchs sister was governess in a family a lofty family perhaps the wealthiest brass and copper founders family known to mankind they lived at camberwell in a house so big and fierce that its mere outside like the outside of a giants castle struck terror into vulgar minds and made bold persons quail there was a great front gate with a great bell whose handle was in itself a note of admiration and a great lodge which being close to the house rather spoiled the lookout certainly but made the lookin tremendous at this entry a great porter kept constant watch and ward and when he gave the visitor high leave to pass he rang a second great bell answering to whose notes a great footman appeared in due time at the great halldoor with such great tags upon his liveried shoulders that he was perpetually entangling and hooking himself among the chairs and tables and led a life of torment which could scarcely have been surpassed if he had been a bluebottle in a world of cobwebs to this mansion mr pecksniff accompanied by his daughters and mrs todgers drove gallantly in a onehorse fly the foregoing ceremonies having been all performed they were ushered into the house and so by degrees they got at last into a small room with books in it where mr pinchs sister was at that moment instructing her eldest pupil to wit a little woman thirteen years old who had already arrived at such a pitch of whalebone and education that she had nothing girlish about her which was a source of great rejoicing to all her relations and friends visitors for miss pinch said the footman he must have been an ingenious young man for he said it very cleverly with a nice distinction in his manner between the cold respect with which he would have announced visitors to the family and the warm personal interest with which he would have announced visitors to the cook visitors for miss pinch miss pinch rose hastily with such tokens of agitation as plainly declared that her list of callers was not numerous at the same time the little pupil became alarmingly upright and prepared herself to take notice of all that might be said and done for the lady of the establishment was curious in the natural history and habits of the animal called governess and encouraged her daughters to report thereon whenever occasion served which was in reference to all parties concerned very proper improving and pleasant it is a melancholy fact but it must be related that mr pinchs sister was not at all ugly on the contrary she had a good facea very mild and friendly face and a pretty little figureslight and short but remarkable for its neatness there was something of her brother much of him indeed in a certain gentleness of manner and in her look of timid truthfulness but she was so far from being a fright or a dowdy or a horror or anything else predicted by the two misses pecksniff that those young ladies naturally regarded her with great indignation feeling that this was by no means what they had come to see miss mercy as having the larger share of gayety bore up the best against this disappointment and carried it off in outward show at least with a titter but her sister not caring to hide her disdain expressed it pretty openly in her looks as to mrs todgers she leaned on mr pecksniffs arm and preserved a kind of genteel grimness suitable to any state of mind and involving any shade of opinion dont be alarmed miss pinch said mr pecksniff taking her hand condescendingly in one of his and patting it with the other i have called to see you in pursuance of a promise given to your brother thomas pinch my namecompose yourself miss pinchis pecksniff the good man spoke these words as though he would have said you see in me young person the friend of your race the patron of your house the preserver of your brother who is fed with manna daily from my table and in right of whom there is a considerable balance in my favor at present standing in the books beyond the sky but i have no pride for i can afford to do without it the poor girl felt it all as if it had been gospel truth her brother writing in the fullness of his simple heart had often told her so and how much more as mr pecksniff ceased to speak she hung her head and dropped a tear upon his hand oh very well miss pinch thought the sharp pupil crying before strangers as if you didnt like the situation thomas is well said mr pecksniff and sends his love and this letter i cannot say poor fellow that he will ever become great in our profession but he has the will to do well which is the next thing to having the power and therefore we must bear with him eh i know he has the will sir said tom pinchs sister and i know how kindly and thoughtfully you cherish it for which neither he nor i can ever be grateful enough as we often say in writing to each other the young ladies too she added glancing gratefully at his two daughters i know how much we owe to them my dears said mr pecksniff turning to them with a smile thomas sister is saying something you will be glad to hear i think we cant take any merit to ourselves papa cried cherry as they both showed tom pinchs sister with a courtesy that they would feel obliged if she would keep her distance mr pinchs being so well provided for is owing to you alone and we can only say how glad we are to hear that he is as grateful as he ought to be oh very well miss pinch thought the pupil again got a grateful brother living on other peoples kindness it was very kind of you said tom pinchs sister with toms own simplicity and toms own smile to come herevery kind indeed though how great a kindness you have done me in gratifying my wish to see you and to thank you with my own lips you who make so light of benefits conferred can scarcely think very grateful very pleasant very proper murmured mr pecksniff it makes me happy too said ruth pinch who now that her first surprise was over had a chatty cheerful way with her and a singlehearted desire to look upon the best side of everything which was the very moral and image of tom very happy to think that you will be able to tell him how more than comfortably i am situated here and how unnecessary it is that he should ever waste a regret on my being cast upon my own resources dear me so long as i heard that he was happy and he heard that i was said toms sister we could both bear without one impatient or complaining thought a great deal more than ever we have had to endure i am certain and if ever the plain truth were spoken on this occasionally false earth toms sister spoke it when she said that ah cried mr pecksniff whose eyes had in the meantime wandered to the pupil certainly and how do you do my very interesting child quite well i thank you sir replied that frosty innocent a sweet face this my dears said mr pecksniff turning to his daughters a charming manner both young ladies had been in delight with the child of a wealthy house through whom the nearest road and shortest cut to her parents might be supposed to lie from the first mrs todgers vowed that anything onequarter so angelic she had never seen she wanted but a pair of wings a dear said that good woman to be a young syrupmeaning possibly young sylph or seraph if you will give that to your distinguished parents my amiable little friend said mr pecksniff producing one of his professional cards and will say that i and my daughters and mrs todgers pa said mercy and mrs todgers of london added mr pecksniff that i and my daughters and mrs todgers of london did not intrude upon them as our object simply was to take some notice of miss pinch whose brother is a young man in my employment but that i could not leave this very noble mansion without adding my humble tribute as an architect to the correctness and elegance of the owners taste and to his just appreciation of that beautiful art to the cultivation of which i have devoted a life and to the promotion of whose glory and advancement i have sacrificed aa fortunei shall be very much obliged to you missis compliments to miss pinch said the footman suddenly appearing and speaking in exactly the same key as before and begs to know wot my young lady is alearning of just now oh said mr pecksniff here is the young man he will take the card with my compliments if you please young man my dears we are interrupting the studies let us go one evening following the visit to miss pinch there was a great bustle at todgers partly owing to some additional domestic preparations for the morrow and partly to the excitement always arising in that house from saturday night when every gentlemans linen arrived at a different hour in his own little bundle with his private account pinned on the outside shrill quarrels from time to time arose between mrs todgers and the girls in remote back kitchens and sounds were occasionally heard indicative of small articles of ironmongery and hardware being thrown at the boy it was the custom of that youth on saturdays to roll up his shirt sleeves to his shoulders and pervade all parts of the house in an apron of coarse green baize moreover he was more strongly tempted on saturdays than on other days it being a busy time to make bolts into the neighboring alleys when he answered the door and there to play at leapfrog and other sports with vagrant lads until pursued and brought back by the hair of his head or the lobe of his ear thus he was quite a conspicuous feature among the peculiar incidents of the last day in the week at todgers he was especially so on this particular saturday evening and honored the misses pecksniff with a deal of notice seldom passing the door of mrs todgers private room where they sat alone before the fire without putting in his head and greeting them with some such compliments as there you are again aint it niceand similar humorous attentions i say he whispered stopping in one of his journeys to and fro young ladies theres soup tomorrow shes amaking it now aint she aputting in the water oh not at all neither in the course of answering another knock he thrust in his head again i saytheres fowls tomorrow not skinny ones oh no presently he called through the keyhole theres a fish tomorrowjust come dont eat none of him and with this spectral warning vanished again byandby he returned to lay the cloth for supper he entertained them on this occasion by thrusting the lighted candle into his mouth after the performance of which feat he went on with his professional duties brightening every knife as he laid it on the table by breathing on the blade and afterwards polishing the same on the apron already mentioned when he had completed his preparations he grinned at the sisters and expressed his belief that the approaching meal would be of rather a spicy sort will it be long before its ready bailey asked mercy no said bailey it is cooked when i come up she was dodging among the tender pieces with a fork and eating of em but he had scarcely achieved the utterance of these words when he received a sudden blow on the head which sent him staggering against the wall and mrs todgers dish in hand stood indignantly before him oh you little villain said that lady oh you bad false boy no worse than yerself retorted bailey guarding his head with his arm ah come now do that agin will yer hes the most dreadful child said mrs todgers setting down the dish i ever had to deal with the gentlemen spoil him to that extent and teach him such things that im afraid nothing but hanging will ever do him any good wont it cried bailey oh yes wot do you go alowerin the tablebeer for then and destroying my constitooshun go downstairs you vicious boy said mrs todgers holding the door open do you hear me go along after two or three skilful dodges he went and was seen no more that night save once when he brought up some tumblers and hot water and much disturbed the two misses pecksniff by squinting hideously behind the back of the unconscious mrs todgers having done this justice to his wounded feelings he retired underground where in company with a swarm of black beetles and a kitchen candle he employed himself in cleaning boots and brushing clothes until the night was far advanced benjamin was supposed to be the real name of this young servant but he was known by a great variety of names benjamin for instance had been converted into uncle ben and that again had been corrupted into uncle the gentlemen at todgers had a merry habit too of bestowing upon him for the time being the name of any notorious criminal or minister and sometimes when current events were flat they even sought the pages of history for these distinctions as mr pitt young brownrigg and the like at the period of which we write he was generally known among the gentlemen as bailey junior a name bestowed upon him in contradistinction perhaps to the old bailey prison and possibly as involving the recollection of an unfortunate lady of the same name who perished by her own hand early in life and has been made famous in a song the usual sunday dinnerhour at todgers was two oclocka suitable time it was considered for all parties convenient to mrs todgers on account of the bakers and convenient to the gentlemen with reference to their afternoon engagements but on the sunday which was to introduce the two misses pecksniff to a full knowledge of todgers and its society the dinner was postponed until five in order that everything might be as genteel as the occasion demanded when the hour drew nigh bailey junior testifying great excitement appeared in a complete suit of castoff clothes several sizes too large for him and in particular mounted a clean shirt of such extraordinary magnitude that one of the gentlemen remarkable for his ready wit called him collars on the spot at about a quarter before five a deputation consisting of mr jinkins and another gentleman whose name was gander knocked at the door of mrs todgers room and being formally introduced to the two misses pecksniff by their parent who was in waiting besought the honor of showing them upstairs here the gentlemen were all assembled there was a general cry of hear hear and bravo jink when mr jinkins appeared with charity on his arm which became quite rapturous as mr gander followed escorting mercy and mr pecksniff brought up the rear with mrs todgers the wittles is up footnote d a roundrobin is a letter signed by all the people of a company with the names written in a circle around the letter so that no name will be first or last xi dick swiveller and the marchioness richard swiveller a goodhearted though somewhat queer young man the clerk of sampson brass a scheming lawyer often found time hanging heavily on his hands and for the better preservation of his cheerfulness therefore and to prevent his faculties from rusting he provided himself with a cribbageboard and pack of cards and accustomed himself to play at cribbage with a dummy for twenty thirty or sometimes even fifty thousand pounds a side besides many hazardous bets to a considerable amount as these games were very silently conducted notwithstanding the greatness of the interests involved mr swiveller began to think that on those evenings when mr and miss brass were out and they often went out now he heard a kind of snorting or hardbreathing sound in the direction of the door which it occurred to him after some thought must proceed from the small servant who always had a cold from damp living looking intently that way one night he plainly distinguished an eye gleaming and glistening at the keyhole and having now no doubt that his suspicions were correct he stole softly to the door and pounced upon her before she was aware of his approach oh i didnt mean any harm indeed upon my word i didnt cried the small servant struggling like a much larger one its so very dull downstairs please dont you tell upon me please dont tell upon you said dick do you mean to say you were looking through the keyhole for company yes upon my word i was replied the small servant how long have you been cooling your eye there said dick oh ever since you first began to play them cards and long before vague recollections of several fantastic exercises such as dancing around the room and bowing to imaginary people with which he had refreshed himself after the fatigues of business all of which no doubt the small servant had seen through the keyhole made mr swiveller feel rather awkward but he was not very sensitive on such points and recovered himself speedily wellcome in he said after a little thought heresit down and ill teach you how to play oh i durstnt do it rejoined the small servant miss sally ud kill me if she knowd i came up here have you got a fire downstairs said dick a very little one replied the small servant miss sally couldnt kill me if she knowd i went down there so ill come said richard putting the cards into his pocket why how thin you are what do you mean by it it aint my fault could you eat any bread and meat said dick taking down his hat yes ah i thought so did you ever taste beer i had a sip of it once said the small servant heres a state of things cried mr swiveller raising his eyes to the ceiling she never tasted itit cant be tasted in a sip why how old are you i dont know mr swiveller opened his eyes very wide and appeared thoughtful for a moment then bidding the child mind the door until he came back vanished straightway presently he returned followed by the boy from the public house who bore in one hand a plate of bread and beef and in the other a great pot filled with some very fragrant compound which sent forth a grateful steam and was indeed choice purl made after a particular rule which mr swiveller had given to the landlord at a period when he was deep in his books and desirous to win his friendship relieving the boy of his burden at the door and charging his little companion to fasten it to prevent surprise mr swiveller followed her into the kitchen there said richard putting the plate before her first of all clear that off and then youll see whats next the small servant needed no second bidding and the plate was soon empty next said dick handing the purl take a pull at that but moderate your delight you know for youre not used to it well is it good oh isnt it said the small servant mr swiveller appeared gratified beyond all expression by this reply and took a long draught himself steadfastly regarding his companion while he did so these matters disposed of he applied himself to teaching her the game which she soon learnt tolerably well being both sharpwitted and cunning now said mr swiveller putting two sixpences into a saucer and trimming the wretched candle when the cards had been cut and dealt those are the stakes if you win you get em all if i win i get em to make it seem more real and pleasant i shall call you the marchioness do you hear the small servant nodded marchioness as the reader knows is a title to a lady of very high rank and such mr swiveller chose to imagine this small servant to be then marchioness said mr swiveller fire away the marchioness holding her cards very tight in both hands considered which to play and mr swiveller assuming the gay and fashionable air which such society required took another pull at the jug and waited for her to lead in the game mr swiveller and his partner played several rubbers with varying success until the loss of three sixpences the gradual sinking of the purl and the striking of ten oclock combined to render that gentleman mindful of the flight of time and the wisdom of withdrawing before mr sampson and miss sally brass returned with which object in view marchioness said mr swiveller gravely i shall ask your ladyships permission to put the board in my pocket and to retire from the presence when i have finished this glass merely observing marchioness that since life like a river is flowing i care not how fast it rolls on maam on while such purl on the bank still is growing and such eyes light the waves as they run marchioness your health you will excuse my wearing my hat but the palace is damp and the marble floor isif i may be allowed the expressionsloppy as a protection against this latter inconvenience mr swiveller had been sitting for some time with his feet on the hob in which attitude he now gave utterance to these apologetic observations and slowly sipped the last choice drops of nectar the baron sampsono brasso and his fair sister are you tell me at the play said mr swiveller leaning his left arm heavily upon the table and raising his voice and his right leg after the manner of a bandit in the theater the marchioness nodded ha said mr swiveller with a portentous frown tis well marchionessbut no matter some wine there ho he illustrated these melodramatic morsels by handing the glass to himself with great humility receiving it haughtily drinking from it thirstily and smacking his lips fiercely the small servant who was not so well acquainted with theatrical customs as mr swiveller having indeed never seen a play or heard one spoken of except by some chance through chinks of doors and in other forbidden places was rather alarmed by demonstrations so strange in their nature and showed her concern so plainly in her looks that mr swiveller felt it necessary to change his brigand manner for one more suitable to private life as he asked do they often go where glory waits em and leave you here oh yes i believe they do returned the small servant miss sallys such a oneer for that she is such a what said dick such a oneer returned the marchioness after a moments reflection mr swiveller determined to forego his responsible duty of setting her right and to suffer her to talk on as it was evident that her tongue was loosened by the purl and her opportunities for conversation were not so frequent as to render a momentary check of little consequence they sometimes go to see mr quilp said the small servant with a shrewd look they go to a good many places bless you is mr brass a wunner said dick not half what miss sally is he isnt replied the small servant shaking her head bless you hed never do anything without her oh he wouldnt wouldnt he said dick miss sally keeps him in such order said the small servant he always asks her advice he does and he catches it sometimes bless you you wouldnt believe how much he catches it i suppose said dick that they consult together a good deal and talk about a great many peopleabout me for instance sometimes eh marchioness the marchioness nodded amazingly do they speak of me in a friendly manner said mr swiveller the marchioness changed the motion of her head which had not yet left off nodding and suddenly began to shake it from side to side so hard as to threaten breaking her neck humph dick muttered would it be any breach of confidence marchioness to relate what they say of the humble individual who has now the honor to miss sally says youre a funny chap replied his friend well marchioness said mr swiveller thats not uncomplimentary merriment marchioness is not a bad or degrading quality old king cole was himself a merry old soul if we may put any faith in the pages of history but she says pursued his companion that you aint to be trusted why really marchioness said mr swiveller thoughtfully several ladies and gentlemennot exactly professional persons but tradespeople maam tradespeoplehave made the same remark the person who keeps the hotel over the way inclined strongly to that opinion tonight when i ordered him to prepare the banquet its a popular prejudice marchioness and yet i am sure i dont know why for i have been trusted in my time to a considerable amount and i can safely say that i never forsook my trust until it deserted menever mr brass is of the same opinion i suppose his friend nodded again with a cunning look which seemed to hint that mr brass held stronger opinions on the subject than his sister and seeming to recollect herself added imploringly but dont you ever tell upon me or i shall be beat to death marchioness said mr swiveller rising the word of a gentleman is as good as his bondsometimes better as in the present case where his bond might prove but a doubtful sort of security i am your friend and i hope we shall play many more rubbers together in the same saloon but marchioness added richard stopping on his way to the door and wheeling slowly round upon the small servant who was following with the candle it occurs to me that you must be in the constant habit of airing your eye at keyholes to know all this i only wanted replied the trembling marchioness to know where the key of the safe was hid that was all and i wouldnt have taken much if i had found itonly enough to squench my hunger you didnt find it then said dick but of course you didnt or youd be plumper goodnight marchioness fare thee well and if forever then forever fare thee welland put up the chain marchioness in case of accidents with this parting word mr swiveller came out from the house and feeling that he had by this time taken quite as much to drink as promised to be good for his constitution purl being a rather strong and heady compound wisely resolved to betake himself to his lodgings and to bed at once homeward he went therefore and his apartments for he still spoke of his one little room as apartments being at no great distance from the office he was soon seated in his own bedchamber where having pulled off one boot and forgotten the other he fell into deep thought this marchioness said mr swiveller folding his arms is a very extraordinary personsurrounded by mysteries ignorant of the taste of beer unacquainted with her own name which is less remarkable and taking a limited view of society through the keyholes of doorscan these things be her destiny or has some unknown person started an opposition to the decrees of fate it is a most amazing staggerer when his meditations had attained this satisfactory point he became aware of his remaining boot of which with great solemnity he proceeded to divest himself shaking his head with exceeding gravity all the time and sighing deeply these rubbers said mr swiveller putting on his nightcap in exactly the same style as he wore his hat remind me of the matrimonial fireside my old girl cheggs wife plays cribbage allfours alike she rings the changes on em now from sport to sport they hurry her to banish her regrets and when they win a smile from her they think that she forgetsbut she dont by this time i should say added richard getting his left cheek into profile and looking complacently at the reflection of a very little scrap of whisker in the lookingglass by this time i should say the iron has entered into her soul it serves her right mr swiveller it must be said had been at one time somewhat in love with a young lady but she had left his love and married a mr cheggs melting from this stern and harsh into the tender and pathetic mood mr swiveller groaned a little walked wildly up and down and even made a show of tearing his hair which however he thought better of and wrenched the tassel from his nightcap instead at last undressing himself with a gloomy resolution he got into bed some men in his blighted position would have taken to drinking but as mr swiveller had taken to that before he only took on receiving the news that this girl was lost to him forever to playing the flute thinking after mature consideration that it was a good sound dismal occupation not only in unison with his own sad thoughts but tending to awaken a fellowfeeling in the bosom of his neighbors following out this resolution he now drew a little table to his bedside and arranging the light and a small oblong musicbook to the best advantage took his flute from its box and began to play most mournfully the air was away with melancholya composition which when it is played very slowly on the flute in bed with the farther disadvantage of being performed by a gentleman not fully acquainted with the instrument who repeats one note a great many times before he can find the next has not a lively effect yet for half the night or more mr swiveller lying sometimes on his back with his eyes upon the ceiling and sometimes half out of bed to correct himself by the book played this unhappy tune over and over again never leaving off save for a minute or two at a time to take breath and talk to himself about the marchioness and then beginning again with renewed vigor it was not until he had quite exhausted his several subjects of meditation and had breathed into the flute the whole sentiment of the purl down to its very dregs and had nearly maddened the people of the house and at both the next doors and over the waythat he shut up the musicbook extinguished the candle and finding himself greatly lightened and relieved in his mind turned round and fell asleep dick continued his friendly relations towards the marchioness and when he fell ill with typhoid fever his little friend nursed him back to health just after this illness an aunt of his died and left him quite a large sum of money a portion of which he used to educate the marchioness whom he afterwards married xii mr wardles servant joe an old country gentleman named wardle had a servant of whom he was very proud not because of the latters diligence but because joe commonly called the fat boy was a character which could not be matched anywhere in the world at the time when our story opens mr pickwick of london and three others of his literary club were traveling in search of adventure with mr pickwick the founder and head of the pickwick club were mr tupman whose great weakness for the ladies brought him frequent troubles mr winkle whose desire to appear as a sport brought much ridicule upon himself and mr snodgrass whose poetic nature induced him to write many romantic verses which amused his friends and all who read them these four pickwickians were introduced one day to mr wardle his aged sister miss rachel wardle and his two daughters emily and isabella as they were looking at some army reviews from their coach mr wardle hospitably asked mr pickwick and his friends to join them in the coach come up here mr pickwick said mr wardle come along sir joe drat that boy hes gone to sleep again joe let down the steps and open the carriage door come ahead room for two of you inside and one outside joe make room for one put this gentleman on the box mr wardle mounted with a little help and the fat boy where he was fell fast asleep one rank of soldiers after another passed firing over the heads of another rank and when the cannon went off the air resounded with the screams of ladies mr snodgrass actually found it necessary to support one of the misses wardle with his arm their maidenly aunt was in such a dreadful state of nervous alarm that mr tupman found that he was obliged to put his arm about her waist to keep her up at all everyone was excited with the exception of the fat boy and he slept as soundly as if the roaring of cannon were his ordinary lullaby joe joe called mr wardle drat that boy hes gone asleep again pinch him in the leg if you please nothing else wakens him thank you get out the lunch joe the fat boy who had been effectually aroused by mr winkle proceeded to unpack the hamper with more quickness than could have been expected from his previous inactivity now joe knives and forks the knives and forks were handed in and each one was furnished with these useful implements now joe the fowls drat that boy hes gone asleep again joe joe numerous taps on the head with a stick and the fat boy with some difficulty was awakened go hand in the eatables there was something in the sound of the last word which aroused him he jumped up with reddened eyes which twinkled behind his mountainous cheeks and feasted upon the food as he unpacked it from the basket now make haste said mr wardle for the fat boy was hanging fondly over a chicken which he seemed wholly unable to part with the boy sighed deeply and casting an ardent gaze upon its plumpness unwillingly handed it to his master a very extraordinary boy that said mr pickwick does he always sleep in this way sleep said the old gentleman hes always sleeping goes on errands fast asleep and snores as he waits at table how very odd said mr pickwick ah odd indeed returned the old gentleman im proud of that boy wouldnt part with him on any account hes a natural curiosity here joe take these things away and open another bottle do you hear the fat boy aroused opened his eyes started and finished the piece of pie he was in the act of eating when he fell fast asleep and slowly obeyed his masters orders looking intently upon the remains of the feast as he removed the plates and stowed them in the hamper at last mr wardle and his party mounted the coach and prepared to drive off now mind he said as he shook hands with mr pickwick we expect to see you all tomorrow you have the address manor farm dingley dell said mr pickwick consulting his pocketbook thats it said the old gentleman you must come for at least a week if you are traveling to get country life come to me and i will give you plenty of it joe drat that boy hes gone to sleep again help put in the horses the horses were put in and the driver mounted and the boy clambered up by his side the farewells were exchanged and the carriage rolled off as the pickwickians turned around to take a last glimpse of it the setting sun cast a red gold upon the faces of their entertainers and fell upon the form of the fat boy his head was sunk upon his bosom and he slumbered again after some amusing difficulties which we have not space to describe here mr pickwick and his friends arrived safely at the country home of mr wardle the time passed very pleasantly one day some of the men decided upon a shooting trip and mr winkle to maintain his reputation as a sport did not admit that he knew nothing about guns mr pickwick early in the morning seeing mr wardle carrying a gun asked what they were going to do why your friend and i are going out rook shooting hes a very good shot isnt he said mr wardle i have heard him say hes a capital one replied mr pickwick but i never saw him aim at anything well said the host i wish mr tupman would join us joe joe the fat boy who under the exciting influences of the morning did not appear to be more than three parts and a fraction asleep emerged from the house go up and call mr tupman and tell him he will find us waiting at last the party started mr tupman having joined them some boys who were with them discovered a tree with a nest in one of the branches and when all was ready mr wardle was persuaded to shoot first the boys shouted and shook a branch with a nest on it and a halfadozen young rooks in violent conversation flew out to ask what the matter was mr wardle leveled his gun and fired down fell one and off flew the others pick him up joe said the old gentleman there was a smile upon the youths face as he advanced for an indistinct vision of rook pie floated through his imagination he laughed as he retired with the bird it was a plump one now mr winkle said the host reloading his own gun fire away mr winkle advanced and raised his gun mr pickwick and his friends crouched involuntarily to escape damage from the heavy fall of birds which they felt quite certain would be caused by their friends skill there was a solemn pause a shout a flapping of wings mr winkle closed his eyes and fired there was a scream from an individual not a rook mr tupman had saved the lives of innumerable birds by receiving a portion of the charge in his left arm though it was a very slight wound mr tupman made a great fuss about it and everyone was horrorstricken he was partly carried to the house the unmarried aunt uttered a piercing scream burst into an hysterical laugh and fell backwards into the arms of her nieces she recovered screamed again laughed again and fainted again calm yourself said mr tupman affected almost to tears by this expression of sympathy dear dear madam calm yourself you are not dead exclaimed the hysterical lady say you are not dead dont be a fool rachel said mr winkle what the mischief is the use of his saying he isnt dead no no i am not said mr tupman i require no assistance but yours let me lean on your arm he added in a whisper miss rachel advanced and offered her arm they turned into the breakfast parlor mr tupman gently pressed her hands to his lips and sunk upon the sofa presently the others left him to her tender mercies that afternoon mr tupman much affected by the extreme tenderness of miss rachel suggested that as he was feeling much better they take a short stroll in the garden there was a bower at the farther end all honeysuckles and creeping plants and somehow they unconsciously wandered in its direction and sat down on a bench within miss wardle said mr tupman you are an angel miss rachel blushed very becomingly much more conversation of this nature followed until finally mr tupman proceeded to do what his enthusiastic emotions prompted and what were for all we know for we are but little acquainted with such matters what people in such circumstances always do she started and he throwing his arms around her neck imprinted upon her lips numerous kisses which after a proper show of struggling and resistance she received so passively that there is no telling how many more mr tupman might have bestowed if the lady had not given a very unaffected start and exclaimed mr tupman we are observed we are discovered mr tupman looked around there was the fat boy perfectly motionless with his large circular eyes staring into the arbor but without the slightest expression on his face mr tupman gazed at the fat boy and the fat boy stared at him but the longer mr tupman observed the utter vacancy of the fat boys face the more convinced he became that he either did not know or did not understand anything that had been happening under this impression he said with great fierceness what do you want here illustration mr tupman we are observed page supper is ready sir was the prompt reply have you just come here inquired mr tupman with a piercing look just replied the fat boy mr tupman looked at him very hard again but there was not a wink of his eye or a movement in his face mr tupman took the arm of the spinster aunt and walked toward the house the fat boy followed behind he knows nothing of what has happened he whispered nothing said the spinster aunt there was a sound behind them as of an imperfectly suppressed chuckle mr tupman turned sharply around no it could not have been the fat boy there was not a gleam of mirth or anything but feeding in his whole visage he must have been fast asleep whispered mr tupman i have not the least doubt of it replied miss rachel and they both laughed heartily mr tupman was wrong the fat boy for once had not been fast asleep he was awake wide awake to everything that had happened the day following joe saw his mistress mr wardles aged mother sitting in the arbor without saying a word he walked up to her stood perfectly still and said nothing the old lady was easily frightened most old ladies are and her first impression was that joe was about to do her some bodily harm with a view of stealing what money she might have with her she therefore watched his motions or rather lack of motions with feelings of intense terror which were in no degree lessened by his finally coming close to her and shouting in her ear for she was very deaf missus well joe said the trembling old lady i am sure i have been a good mistress to you he nodded you have always been treated very kindly he nodded you have never had too much to do he nodded you have always had enough to eat this last was an appeal to the fat boys most sensitive feelings he seemed touched as he replied i know i has then what do you want to do now i wants to make yo flesh creep replied the boy this sounded like a very bloodthirsty method of showing ones gratitude and so the old lady was as much frightened as before what do you think i saw in this very arbor last night inquired the boy mercies what screamed the old lady alarmed at the mysterious manner of the corpulent youth a strange gentleman as had his arm around her a kissin and huggin who joe who none of the servants i hope worser than that roared the fat boy in the old ladys ear none of my granddaughters worser than that said joe worse than that said the old lady who had thought this the extreme limit who was it joe i insist upon knowing the fat boy looked cautiously about and having finished his survey shouted in the old ladys ear miss rachel what said the old lady in a shrill tone speak louder miss rachel roared the fat boy my daughter the succession of nods which the fat boy gave by way of assent could not be doubted and she allowed him exclaimed the old lady a grin stole over the fat boys features as he said i see her a kissin of him agin joes voice of necessity had been so loud that another party in the garden could not help hearing the entire conversation if they could have seen the expression of the old ladys face at this time it is probable that a sudden burst of laughter would have betrayed them fragments of angry sentences drifted to them through the leaves such as without my permission at her time of life might have waited until i was dead etc then they heard the heels of the fat boys foot crunching the gravel as he retired and left the old lady alone mr tupman would probably have found himself in considerable trouble if one of his friends who had overheard the conversation had not told mrs wardle that perhaps joe had dreamed the entire incident which did not seem altogether improbable she watched mr tupman at supper that evening but this gentleman having been warned paid no attention whatever to miss rachel and the old lady was finally persuaded that it was all a mistake finally the visit of mr pickwick and his friends came to an end and it was several months before they again partook of mr wardles hospitality the pickwickians had arrived at the inn near mr wardles place for dinner before completing the rest of their journey to dingley dell mr pickwick had brought with him several barrels of oysters and some special wine as a gift to his host and he stood examining his packages to see that they had all arrived when he felt himself gently pulled by the skirts of his coat looking around he discovered that the individual who used this means of drawing his attention was no other than mr wardles favorite page the fat boy aha said mr pickwick ah said the fat boy and as he said it he glanced from the wine to the oysters and chuckled joyously he was fatter than ever well you look rosy enough my young friend said mr pickwick i have been sitting in front of the fire replied the fat boy who had indeed heated himself to the color of a new chimney pot in the course of an hours nap master sent me over with the cart to carry your luggage over to the house mr pickwick called his man sam weller to him and said help mr wardles servant to put the packages into the cart and then ride on with him we prefer to walk having given this direction mr pickwick and his three friends walked briskly away leaving mr weller and the fat boy face to face for the first time sam looked at the fat boy with great astonishment but without saying a word and began to put the things rapidly upon the cart while joe stood calmly by and seemed to think it a very interesting sort of thing to see mr weller working by himself there said sam everything packed at last there they are yes said the fat boy in a very satisfied tone there they are well young twenty stone said sam youre a nice specimen you are thankee said the fat boy you aint got nothing on your mind as makes you fret yourself have you inquired sam not as i knows of replied the boy i should rather have thought to look at you that you was a laborin under a disappointed love affair with some young woman said sam vell young boaconstrictor said sam im glad to hear it do you ever drink anythin i likes eatin better replied the boy ah said sam i should ha sposed that but i spose you were never cold with all them elastic fixtures was sometimes replied the boy and i likes a drop of something thats good ah you do do you said sam come this way then after a short interruption they got into the cart you can drive can you said the fat boy i should rather think so replied sam well then said the fat boy putting the reins in his hands and pointing up a lane its as straight as you can drive you cant miss it with these words the fat boy laid himself affectionately down by the side of the provisions and placing an oyster barrel under his head for a pillow fell asleep instantly vell said sam of all the boys ever i set my eyes onwake up young dropsy but as young dropsy could not be awakened sam weller set himself down in front of the cart started the old horse with a jerk of the rein and jogged steadily on toward manor farm xiii a brave and honest boy oliver twist little oliver twist was an orphan he never saw his mother or his father he was born at the workhouse the home for paupers where his poor heartbroken mother had been taken just a short time before baby oliver came and the very night he was born she was so sick and weak she said let me see my child and then i will die the old nurse said nonsense my dear you must not think of dying you have something now to live for the good kind doctor said she must be very brave and she might get well they brought her little baby boy to her and she hugged him in her weak arms and she kissed him on the brow many times and cuddled him up as close as her feeble arms could hold him and then she looked at him long and steadily and a sweet smile came over her face and a bright light came into her eyes and before the smile could pass from her lips she died the old nurse wept as she took the little baby from its dead mothers arms and the good doctor had to wipe the tears from his eyes it was so very very sad after wrapping the baby in a blanket and laying him in a warm place the old nurse straightened out the limbs of the young mother and folded her hands on her breast and spreading a white sheet over her still form she called the doctor to look at herfor the nurse and the doctor were all who were there the same sweet smile was on her face and the doctor said as he looked upon her poor poor girl she is so beautiful and so young what strange fate has brought her to this poor place nurse take good care of the baby for his mother must have been at one time a kind and gentle woman the next day they took the unknown woman out to the potters field and buried her and for nine months the old nurse at the workhouse took care of the baby though it is sad to say this old woman kindhearted though she was was at the same time so fond of gin that she often took the money which ought to have bought milk for the baby to buy drink for herself nobody knew what the young mothers name was and so this baby had no name until at last mr bumble who was one of the parish officers who looked after the paupers came and named him oliver twist when little oliver was nine months old they took him away from the workhouse and carried him to the poor farm where there were twentyfive or thirty other poor children who had no parents a woman by the name of mrs mann had charge of this cottage the parish gave her an allowance of enough money to keep the children in plenty of food and clothing but she starved the little ones to keep the money for herself so that many of them died and others came to take their places but young oliver was a tough little fellow and while he looked very pale and thin he was otherwise healthy and hung on to his life mrs mann was also very cruel to the children she would scold and beat them and shut them up in the cellar and treat them meanly in many ways when no visitors were there but when any of the men who had control or visitors came around she would smile and call the children dear and all sorts of pet names she told them if any of them should tell on her she would beat them and furthermore that they should tell visitors that she was very kind and good to them and that they loved her very much mr bumble was a very mean man too as we shall see they called him the beadle which means he was a sort of sheriff or policeman and he was supposed to look after the people at the workhouse and at the poor farm and to wait on the directors who had charge of these places he had the right to punish the boys if they did not mind and they were all afraid of him oliver remained at the cottage on the poor farm until he was nine years old though he was a pale little fellow and did not look to be over seven on the morning of his birthday mrs mann had given oliver and two other boys a bad whipping and put them down in a dark coalcellar presently she saw mr bumble coming and she told her servant to take the boys out and wash them quick for she did not let mr bumble know she ever punished them and was fearful he might hear them crying in the dark damp place mrs mann talked very nicely to mr bumble and made him a toddy a glass of strong liquor and kept him busy with her flattering and kindness until she knew the boys were washed mr bumble told her oliver twist was nine years old that day and the board which meant the men in charge had decided they must take him away from the farm and carry him back to the workhouse mrs mann pretended to be very sorry and she went out and brought oliver in telling him on the way that he must appear very sorry to leave her otherwise she would beat him so when oliver was asked if he wanted to go he said he was sorry to leave there this was not a falsehood for miserable as the place was he dearly loved his little companions they were all the people he knew and he did feel sad and really wept with sorrow as he told them goodby and was led by mr bumble back to the workhouse where he was born and where his mother died nine years ago that very day when he got back there he found the old nurse who remembered his mother and she told him she was a beautiful sweet woman and how she had kissed him and held him in her arms when she died night after night little oliver dreamed about his beautiful mother and she seemed sometimes to stand by his bed and to look down upon him with the same beautiful eyes and the same sweet smile of which the nurse told him every time he had the chance he asked questions about her but the nurse could not tell him anything more she did not even know her name oliver had been at the workhouse only a very short time when mr bumble came in and told him he must appear before the board at once now oliver was puzzled at this he thought a board was a piece of flat wood and he could not imagine why he was to appear before that but he was too much afraid of mr bumble to ask any questions this gentleman had treated him roughly in bringing him to the workhouse and now when he looked a little puzzledfor his expressive face always told what was in his honest little heartmr bumble gave him a sharp crack on the head with his cane and another rap over the back and told him to wake up and not look so sleepy and to mind to be polite when he went before the board oliver could not help tears coming into his eyes as he was pushed along and mr bumble gave him another sharp rap telling him to hush and ushered him into a room where several sternlooking gentlemen sat at a long table one of them in a white waistcoat was particularly hardlooking bow to the board said mr bumble to oliver oliver looked about for a board and seeing none he bowed to the table because it looked more like a board than anything else the men laughed and the man in the white waistcoat said the boy is a fool i thought he was after other ugly remarks they told oliver he was an orphan and they had supported him all his life he ought to be very thankful and he was when he remembered how many had been starved to death now they said you are nine years old and we must put you out to learn a trade they told him he should begin the next morning at six oclock to pick oakum and work at that until they could get him a place oliver was faithful at his work in which several other boys assisted but oh so hungry they got for they were given but one little bowl of gruel at a mealhardly enough for a kitten so one day the boys said they must ask for more and they drew straws to see who should venture to do so it fell to olivers lot to do it and the next meal when they had emptied their bowls oliver walked up to the man who helped them and said very politely please sir may i not have some more i am very hungry this made the man so angry that he hit oliver over the head with his ladle and called for mr bumble he came and when told that oliver had asked for more he grabbed him by the collar and took him before the board and made the complaint that he had been very naughty and rebellious telling the circumstance in an unfair and untruthful way the board was angry at oliver and the man in the white waistcoat told them again as he had said before this boy will be hung sometime we must get rid of him at once so they offered five pounds or twentyfive dollars to anyone who would take him the first man who came was a very mean chimneysweeper who had almost killed other boys with his vile treatment the board agreed to let him have oliver but when they took him before the magistrates oliver fell on his knees and begged them not to let that man have him and they would not so oliver was taken back to the workhouse the next man who came was mr sowerberry an undertaker he was a very good man and the magistrates let him take oliver along but he had a very cross stingy wife and a mean servantgirl by the name of charlotte and a big overbearing boy by the name of noah claypole whom he had taken to raise oliver thought he would like mr sowerberry well enough but his heart fell when the mrs met him and called him boy and a measlylooking little pauper and gave him for supper the scraps she had put for the dog but this was so much better than he got at the workhouse he would not complain about the food and he hoped by faithful work to win kind treatment they made him sleep by himself in the shop among the coffins and he was very much frightened but he would rather sleep there than with the terrible boy noah the first night he dreamed of his beautiful mother and thought again he could see her sitting among those black fearful coffins with the same sweet smile upon her face he was awakened the next morning by noah who told him he had to obey him and hed better lookout or hed wear the life out of him noah kicked and cuffed oliver several times but the poor boy was too much used to that to resent it and determined to do his work well mr sowerberry found oliver so good sensible and polite that he made him his assistant and took him to all the funerals and occasionally gave him a penny oliver went into fine houses and saw people and sights he had never dreamed of before mr sowerberry had told him he might some day be an undertaker himself and oliver worked hard to please his master though noah and mrs sowerberry and charlotte grew more unkind to him all the time because he was put forward they said and noah was kept back this of course made noah meaner than ever to oliverdetermined to endure it all rather than complain and try to win them over after while by being kind he could have borne any insult to himself but noah tried the little fellow too far when he attacked the name of olivers mother and it brought serious trouble as we shall see one day oliver and noah had descended into the kitchen at the usual dinnerhour when charlotte being called out of the way there came a few minutes of time which noah claypole being hungry and vicious considered he could not possibly devote to a worthier purpose than aggravating and tantalizing young oliver twist intent upon this innocent amusement noah put his feet on the tablecloth and pulled olivers hair and twitched his ears and expressed his opinion that he was a sneak and furthermore announced his intention of coming to see him hanged whenever that desirable event should take place and entered upon various other topics of petty annoyance like a malicious and illconditioned charityboy as he was but none of these taunts producing the desired effect of making oliver cry noah began to talk about his mother workus said noah hows your mother noah had given oliver this name because he had come from the workhouse shes dead replied oliver dont you say anything about her to me olivers color rose as he said this he breathed quickly and there was a curious working of the mouth and nostrils which noah thought must be the immediate precursor of a violent fit of crying under this impression he returned to the charge what did she die of workus said noah of a brokenheart some of our old nurses told me replied oliver more as if he were talking to himself than answering noah i think i know what it must be to die of that tol de rol lol lol right fol lairy workus said noah as a tear rolled down olivers check whats set you a sniveling now not you replied oliver hastily brushing the tear away dont think it oh not me eh sneered noah no not you replied oliver sharply there thats enough dont say anything more to me about her youd better not better not exclaimed noah well better not workus dont be impudent your mother too she was a nice un she was oh lor and here noah nodded his head expressively and curled his small red nose yer know workus continued noah emboldened by olivers silence and speaking in a jeering tone of affected pity yer know workus it cant be helped now and of course yer couldnt help it then but yer must know workus yer mother was a regulardown bad un what did you say inquired oliver looking up very quickly a regular rightdown badun workus replied noah coolly and its a great deal better workus that she died when she did or else shed have been hard laboring in the jail or sent out of the country or hung which is more likely than either isnt it crimson with fury oliver started up overthrew the chair and table seized noah by the throat shook him in the violence of his rage till his teeth chattered in his head and collecting his whole force into one heavy blow felled him to the ground a minute ago the boy had looked the quiet mild dejected creature that harsh treatment had made him but his spirit was roused at last the cruel insult to his dead mother had set his blood on fire his breast heaved his form was erect his eye bright and vivid his whole person changed as he stood glaring over the cowardly tormentor who now lay crouching at his feet and defied him with an energy he had never known before hell murder me blubbered noah charlotte missis heres the new boy amurdering of me help help olivers gone mad charlotte noahs shouts were responded to by a loud scream from charlotte and a louder from mrs sowerberry the former of whom rushed into the kitchen by a sidedoor while the latter paused on the staircase till she was quite certain that it was safe to come farther down oh you little wretch screamed charlotte seizing oliver with her utmost force which was about equal to that of a moderately strong man in particularly good training oh you little ungrateful murderous horrid villain and between every syllable charlotte gave oliver a blow with all her might charlottes fist was by no means a light one and mrs sowerberry plunged into the kitchen and assisted to hold him with one hand while she scratched his face with the other in this favorable position of affairs noah rose from the ground and pommeled him behind when they were all wearied out and could tear and beat no longer they dragged oliver struggling and shouting but nothing daunted into the dustcellar and there locked him up this being done mrs sowerberry sunk into a chair and burst into tears oh charlotte said mrs sowerberry oh charlotte what a mercy we have not all been murdered in our beds ah mercy indeed maam was the reply i only hope thisll teach master not to have any more of these dreadful creatures that are born to be murderers and robbers from their very cradle poor noah he was all but killed maam when i come in poor fellow said mrs sowerberry looking piteously on the charityboy whats to be done exclaimed mrs sowerberry your masters not at home theres not a man in the house and hell kick that door down in ten minutes olivers vigorous plunges against the door did seem as if he would break it dear dear i dont know maam said charlotte unless we send for the police officers or the millingtary suggested noah no no said mrs sowerberry bethinking herself of olivers old friend run to mr bumble noah and tell him to come here directly and not to lose a minute never mind your cap make haste noah set off with all his might and paused not once for breath until he reached the workhouse gate why whats the matter with the boy said the people as noah rushed up mr bumble mr bumble cried noah with wellpretended alarm oh mr bumble sir oliver siroliver has what what interposed mr bumble with a gleam of pleasure in his steellike eyes not run away he hasnt run away has he noah no sir no not run away sir but hes turned wicious replied noah he tried to murder me sir and then he tried to murder charlotte and then missis oh what dreadful pain it is such agony please sir and here noah writhed and twisted his body into an extensive variety of eellike positions by which the gentlemans notice was very soon attracted for he had not walked three paces when he turned angrily round and inquired what that young cur was howling for its a poor boy from the freeschool sir replied mr bumble who has been nearly murderedall but murdered sirby young twist by jove exclaimed the gentleman in the white waistcoat stopping short i knew it i felt from the very first that that terrible young savage would come to be hung he has likewise attempted sir to murder the female servant said mr bumble with a face of ashy paleness and his missis interposed noah and his master too i think you said noah added mr bumble no hes out or he would have murdered him replied noah he said he wanted to ah said he wanted to did he my boy inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat yes sir and please sir replied noah missis wants to know whether mr bumble can spare time to step up there directly and flog himcause masters out certainly my boy certainly said the gentleman in the white waistcoat smiling benignly and patting noahs head which was about three inches higher than his own youre a good boya very good boy heres a penny for you bumble just step up to sowerberrys with your cane and see whats to be done dont spare him bumble no i will not sir replied the beadle as he hurried away meantime oliver continued to kick with undiminished vigor at the cellardoor the accounts of his ferocity as related by mrs sowerberry and charlotte were of so startling a nature that mr bumble judged it prudent to parley before opening the door with this view he gave a kick at the outside by way of prelude and then putting his mouth to the keyhole said in a deep and impressive tone oliver come you let me out replied oliver from the inside do you know this here voice oliver said mr bumble yes replied oliver aint you afraid of it sir aint you atrembling while i speak sir said mr bumble no replied oliver boldly an answer so different from the one he had expected to hear and was in the habit of receiving staggered mr bumble not a little oh you know mr bumble he must be mad said mrs sowerberry no boy in half his senses could venture to speak so to you its not madness maam replied mr bumble after a few moments of deep meditation its meat what exclaimed mrs sowerberry meat maam meat replied bumble with stern emphasis youve overfed him maam dear dear ejaculated mrs sowerberry piously raising her eyes to the kitchen ceiling this comes of being liberal the liberality of mrs sowerberry to oliver had consisted in a bestowal upon him of all the dirty odds and ends which nobody else would eat ah said mr bumble when the lady brought her eyes down to earth again the only thing that can be done now that i know of is to leave him in the cellar for a day or so till hes a little starved down and then to take him out and keep him on gruel all through his apprenticeship he comes of a bad family excitable natures mrs sowerberry both the nurse and doctor said that that mother of his made her way here against difficulties and pain that would have killed any welldisposed woman weeks before at this point of mr bumbles discourse oliver just hearing enough to know that some new allusion was being made to his mother recommenced kicking with a violence that rendered every other sound inaudible sowerberry returned at this moment olivers offense having been explained to him with such exaggerations as the ladies thought best calculated to rouse his ire he unlocked the cellardoor in a twinkling and dragged his rebellious apprentice out by the collar olivers clothes had been torn in the beating he had received his face was bruised and scratched and his hair scattered over his forehead the angry flush had not disappeared however and when he was pulled out of his prison he scowled boldly on noah and looked quite undismayed now you are a nice young fellow aint you said sowerberry giving oliver a shake and a box on the ear he called my mother names replied oliver well and what if he did you little ungrateful wretch said mrs sowerberry she deserved what he said and worse she didnt said oliver she did said mrs sowerberry its a lie said oliver mrs sowerberry burst into a flood of tears this flood of tears left mr sowerberry nothing else to do so he at once gave oliver a drubbing which satisfied even mrs sowerberry herself for the rest of the day he was shut up in the backs kitchen in company with a pump and a slice of bread and at night mrs sowerberry after making various remarks outside the door by no means kind to the memory of his mother looked into the room and amidst the jeers and pointings of noah and charlotte ordered him upstairs to his dismal bed it was not until he was left alone in the silence and stillness of the gloomy workshop of the undertaker that oliver gave way to the feelings which the days treatment may be supposed likely to have awakened in a mere child he had listened to their taunts with a look of contempt he had borne the lash without a cry for he felt that pride swelling in his heart which would have kept down a shriek to the last though they had roasted him alive but now when there was none to see or hear him he fell upon his knees on the floor and hiding his face in his hands wept bitter tears and prayed in his bleeding heart that god would help him to get away from these cruel people there upon his knees oliver determined to run away and rising tied up a few clothes in a handkerchief and went to bed with the first ray of light that struggled through the crevices in the shutters oliver arose and unbarred the door one timid look aroundone moments pause of hesitationhe had closed it behind him and was in the open street he looked to the right and to the left uncertain which way to fly he remembered to have seen the wagons as they went out toiling up the hill he took the same route and arriving at a footpath across the fields which he knew after some distance led out again into the road struck into it and walked quickly on along this same footpath oliver well remembered he had trotted beside mr bumble when he first carried him to the workhouse from the farm his heart beat quickly when he bethought himself of this and he half resolved to turn back he had come a long way though and should lose a great deal of time by doing so besides it was so early that there was very little fear of his being seen so he walked on he reached the house there was no appearance of the people inside stirring at that early hour oliver stopped and peeped into the garden a child was weeding one of the little beds as he stopped he raised his pale face and disclosed the features of one of his former companions oliver felt glad to see him before he went for though younger than himself he had been his little friend and playmate they had been beaten and starved and shut up together many and many a time hush dick said oliver as the boy ran to the gate and thrust his thin arm between the rails to greet him is anyone up nobody but me replied the child you mustnt say you saw me dick said oliver i am running away they beat and illuse me dick and i am going to seek my fortune some long way off i dont know where how pale you are i heard the doctor tell them i was dying replied the child with a faint smile i am very glad to see you dear but dont stop dont stop yes yes i will to say goodby to you replied oliver i shall see you again dick i know i shall you will be well and happy i hope so replied the child after i am dead but not before i know the doctor must be right oliver because i dream so much of heaven and angels and kind faces that i never see when i am awake kiss me said the child climbing up the low gate and flinging his little arms around olivers neck goodby dear god bless you the blessing was from a young childs lips but it was the first that oliver had ever heard invoked upon his head and through the struggles and sufferings and troubles and changes of his afterlife he never once forgot it oliver soon got into the highroad it was eight oclock now though he was nearly five miles away from the town he ran and hid behind the hedges by turns till noon fearing that he might be pursued and overtaken then he sat down to rest by the side of the milestone the stone by which he was seated had a sign on it which said that it was just seventy miles from that spot to london the name awakened a new train of ideas in the boys mind londonthat great large placenobodynot even mr bumblecould ever find him there he had often heard the old men in the workhouse too say that no lad of spirit need want in london and that there were ways of living in that vast city which those who had been bred in the country parts had no idea of it was the very place for a homeless boy who must die in the streets unless someone helped him as these things passed through his thoughts he jumped upon his feet and again walked forward he had made the distance between himself and london less by full four miles more before he thought how much he must undergo ere he could hope to reach the place toward which he was going as this consideration forced itself upon him he slackened his pace a little and meditated upon his means of getting there he had a crust of bread a coarse shirt and two pairs of stockings in his bundle he had a penny tooa gift of sowerberrys after some funeral in which he had acquitted himself more than ordinarily wellin his pocket a clean shirt thought oliver is a very comfortable thing and so are two pairs of darned stockings and so is a penny but they are small helps to a sixtyfive miles walk in wintertime thus day after day the weary but plucky little boy walked on and early on the seventh morning after he had left his native place oliver limped slowly into the little town of barnet and sat down on a doorstep to rest some few stopped to gaze at oliver for a moment or two or turned round to stare at him as they hurried by but none helped him or troubled themselves to inquire how he came there he had no heart to beg and there he sat for some time when he was roused by observing that a boy was watching him most earnestly from the opposite side of the way he took little heed of this at first but the boy remained in the same attitude so long that oliver raised his head and returned his steady look upon this the boy crossed over and walking close up to oliver said hullo my covey whats the row the boy who had spoken to the young wayfarer was about his own age but one of the queerestlooking boys that oliver had ever seen he was a snubnosed flatbrowed commonfaced boy enough and as dirty a youth as one would wish to see but he had about him all the airs and manners of a man he was short for his age with rather bowlegs and little sharp ugly eyes his hat was stuck on the top of his head so lightly that it threatened to fall off every moment he wore a mans coat which reached nearly to his heels hullo my covey whats the row said the stranger i am very hungry and tired replied oliver the tears standing in his eyes as he spoke i have walked a long way i have been walking these seven days walking for sivin days said the young gentleman oh i see beaks order eh but he added noticing olivers look of surprise i suppose you dont know what a beak is my flash companion oliver mildly replied that he had always heard a birds mouth described by the word beak my eyes how green exclaimed the young gentleman why a beaks a madgstrate and when you walk by a beaks order its not straight forerd but come said the young gentleman you want grub and you shall have it up with you on your pins there now then assisting oliver to rise the young gentleman took him to a near by grocery store where he bought a supply of readydressed ham and a halfquartern loaf or as he himself expressed it a fourpenny bran taking the bread under his arm the young gentleman turned into a small publichouse and led the way to a taproom in the rear of the premises here a pot of beer was brought in by direction of the mysterious youth and oliver falling to at his new friends bidding made a long and hearty meal during which the strange boy eyed him from time to time with great attention going to london said the strange boy when oliver had at length concluded yes got any lodgings no money no the strange boy whistled and put his arms into his pockets as far as the big coatsleeves would let them go do you live in london inquired oliver yes i do when im at home replied the boy i suppose you want some place to sleep in tonight dont you i do indeed answered oliver i have not slept under a roof since i left the country dont fret your eyelids on that score said the young gentleman ive got to be in london tonight and i know a spectable old genelman as lives there wotll give you lodgings for nothink and never ask for the changethat is if any genelman he knows interduces you and dont he know me oh no not in the least by no means certainly not which was his queer way of saying he and the old gentleman were good friends this unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to be resisted especially as it was immediately followed up by the assurance that the old gentleman referred to would doubtless provide oliver with a comfortable place without loss of time this led to a more friendly and free talk from which oliver learned that his friends name was jack dawkinsamong his intimate friends better known as the artful dodgerand that he was a peculiar pet of the elderly gentleman before mentioned as john dawkins objected to their entering london before nightfall it was nearly eleven oclock when they reached the small city street along which the dodger scudded at a rapid pace directing oliver to follow close at his heels although oliver had enough to occupy his attention in keeping sight of his leader he could not help bestowing a few hasty glances on either side of the way as he passed along a dirtier or more wretched place he had never seen oliver was just considering whether he hadnt better run away when they reached the bottom of the hill his conductor catching him by the arm pushed open the door of a house and drawing him into the passage closed it behind them now then cried a voice from below in reply to a whistle from the dodger plummy and slam was the reply this seemed to be some watchword or signal that all was right for the light of a feeble candle gleamed on the wall at the remote end of the passage and a mans face peeped out from where a balustrade of the old kitchen staircase had been broken away theres two of you said the man thrusting the candle farther out and shading his eyes with his hand whos the tother one a new pal replied jack dawkins pulling oliver forward where did he come from greenland is fagin upstairs yes hes a sortin the wipes up with you the candle was drawn back and the face disappeared oliver groping his way with one hand and having the other firmly grasped by his companion ascended with much difficulty the dark and broken stairs which his conductor mounted with an ease and expedition that showed he was well acquainted with them he threw open the door of a backroom and drew oliver in after him the walls and ceiling of the room were perfectly black with age and dirt there was a deal table before the fire upon which were a candle stuck in a gingerbeer bottle two or three pewterpots a loaf and butter and a plate seated round the table were four or five boys none older than the dodger smoking clay pipes and drinking spirits with the air of middleaged men these all crowded about their friend as he whispered a few words to the jewish proprietor and then turned round and grinned at oliver so did the jew himself toastingfork in hand this is him fagin said jack dawkins my friend oliver twist the jew grinned and making a low bow to oliver took him by the hand and hoped he should have the honor of a closer acquaintance upon this the young gentlemen with the pipes came round him and shook both his hands very hard we are very glad to see you oliver very said the jew dodger take off the sausages and draw a tub near the fire for oliver ah youre astaring at the pockethandkerchiefs eh my dear there are a good many of em aint there weve just looked em out ready for the wash thats all oliverthats all ha ha ha the latter part of this speech was hailed by a noisy shout from all the pupils of the merry old gentleman in the midst of which they went to supper oliver ate his share and the jew then mixed him a glass of hot gin and water telling him he must drink it off directly because another gentleman wanted the tumbler oliver did as he was desired immediately afterward he felt himself gently lifted on to one of the sacks and then he sunk into a deep sleep it was late next morning when oliver awoke from a sound long sleep there was no other person in the room but the old jew who was boiling some coffee in a saucepan for breakfast and whistling softly to himself as he stirred it round and round with an iron spoon he would stop every now and then to listen when there was the least noise below and when he had satisfied himself he would go on whistling and stirring again as before although oliver had roused himself from sleep he was not thoroughly awake oliver was precisely in this condition he saw the jew with his halfclosed eyes heard his low whistling and recognized the sound of the spoon grating against the saucepans sides when the coffee was done the jew drew the saucepan to the hob looked at oliver and called him by his name he did not answer and was to all appearance asleep after satisfying himself upon this head the jew stepped gently to the door which he fastened he then drew forth as it seemed to oliver from some trap in the floor a small box which he placed carefully on the table his eyes glistened as he raised the lid and looked in dragging an old chair to the table he sat down and took from it a magnificent gold watch sparkling with jewels aha said the jew shrugging up his shoulders and distorting every feature with a hideous grin clever dogs clever dogs stanch to the last never told the old parson where they were never peached upon old fagin and why should they it wouldnt have loosened the knot or kept the drop up a minute longer no no no fine fellows fine fellows with these and other muttered remarks of the like nature the jew once more laid the watch in its place of safety at least half a dozen more were severally drawn forth from the same box and looked at with equal pleasure besides rings bracelets and other articles of jewelry of such magnificent materials and costly workmanship that oliver had no idea even of their names as the jew looked up his bright dark eyes which had been staring at the jewelry fell on olivers face the boys eyes were fixed on his in mute curiosity and although the recognition was only for an instant it was enough to show the old man that he had been observed he closed the lid of the box with a loud crash and laying his hand on a breadknife which was on the table started furiously up whats that said the jew what do you watch me for why are you awake what have you seen speak out boy quickquick for your life i wasnt able to sleep any longer sir replied oliver meekly i am very sorry if i have disturbed you sir you were not awake an hour ago said the jew scowling fiercely no no indeed replied oliver are you sure cried the jew with a still fiercer look than before and a threatening attitude upon my word i was not sir replied oliver earnestly tush tush my dear said the jew abruptly resuming his old manner and playing with the knife a little before he laid it down to make oliver think that he had caught it up in mere sport of course i know that my dear i only tried to frighten you youre a brave boy ha ha youre a brave boy oliver the jew rubbed his hands with a chuckle but glanced uneasily at the box notwithstanding did you see any of these pretty things my dear said the jew laying his hand upon it after a short pause yes sir replied oliver ah said the jew turning rather pale theytheyre mine oliver my little property all i have to live upon in my old age the folks call me a miser my dear only a miser thats all oliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser to live in such a dirty place with so many watches but thinking that perhaps his fondness for the dodger and the other boys cost him a good deal of money he only looked kindly at the jew and asked if he might get up certainly my dear certainly replied the old gentleman theres a pitcher of water in the corner by the door bring it here and ill give you a basin to wash in my dear oliver got up walked across the room and stooped for an instant to raise the pitcher when he turned his head the box was gone he had scarcely washed himself and made everything tidy by emptying the basin out of the window agreeably to the jews directions when the dodger returned accompanied by a very sprightly young friend whom oliver had seen smoking on the previous night and who was now formally introduced to him as charley bates the four sat down to breakfast on the coffee and some hot rolls and ham which the dodger had brought home in the crown of his hat well said the jew glancing slyly at oliver and addressing himself to the dodger i hope youve been at work this morning my dears hard replied the dodger as nails added charley bates good boys good boys said the jew what have you dodger a couple of pocketbooks replied that young gentleman lined inquired the jew with eagerness pretty well replied the dodger producing two pocketbooks not so heavy as they might be said the jew after looking at the insides carefully but very neat and nicely made a good workman aint he oliver very indeed sir said oliver at which mr charles bates laughed uproariously very much to the amazement of oliver who saw nothing to laugh at in anything that had passed and what have you got my dear said fagin to charley bates wipes replied master bates at the same time producing four pockethandkerchiefs well said the jew inspecting them closely theyre very good ones very you havent marked them well though charley so the marks shall be picked out with a needle and well teach oliver how to do it shall us oliver eh ha ha ha if you please sir said oliver youd like to be able to make pockethandkerchiefs as easy as charley bates wouldnt you my dear said the jew very much indeed if youll teach me sir replied oliver master bates burst into another laugh he is so jolly green said charley when he recovered as an apology to the company for his impolite behavior the dodger said nothing but he smoothed olivers hair over his eyes and said hed know better byandby when the breakfast was cleared away the merry old gentleman and the two boys played at a very curious and uncommon game which was performed in this way the merry old gentleman placing a snuffbox in one pocket of his trousers a notecase in the other and a watch in his waistcoat pocket with a guardchain round his neck and sticking a mockdiamond pin in his shirt buttoned his coat tight around him and putting his spectaclecase and handkerchief in his pockets trotted up and down the room with a stick in imitation of the manner in which old gentlemen walk about the streets any hour in the day now during all this time the two boys followed him closely about getting out of his sight so nimbly every time he turned round that it was impossible to follow their motions at last the dodger trod upon his toes or ran upon his boot accidentally while charley bates stumbled up against him behind and in that one moment they took from him with the most extraordinary rapidity snuffbox notecase watchguard chain shirtpin pocket handkerchief even the spectaclecase if the old gentleman felt a hand in any one of his pockets he cried out where it was and then the game began all over again when this game had been played a great many times charley bates expressed his opinion that it was time to pad the hoof this it occurred to oliver must be french for going out for directly afterward the dodger and charley went away together having been kindly furnished by the amiable old jew with money to spend there my dear said fagin thats a pleasant life isnt it they have gone out for the day have they done work sir inquired oliver yes said the jew that is unless they should unexpectedly come across any when they are out and they wont neglect it if they do my dear depend upon it make em your models my dear make em your models tapping the fireshovel on the hearth to add force to his words do everything they bid you and take their advice in all mattersespecially the dodgers my dear hell be a great man himself and will make you one too if you take pattern by him is my handkerchief hanging out of my pocket my dear said the jew stopping short yes sir said oliver see if you can take it out without my feeling it as you saw them do when we were at play this morning oliver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand as he had seen the dodger hold it and drew the handkerchief lightly out with the other is it gone cried the jew here it is sir said oliver showing it in his hand youre a clever boy my dear said the playful old gentleman patting oliver on the head approvingly i never saw a sharper lad heres a shilling for you if you go on in this way youll be the greatest man of the time and now come here and ill show you how to take the marks out of the handkerchief oliver wondered what picking the old gentlemans pocket in play had to do with his chances of being a great man but thinking that the jew being so much older must know best he followed him quietly to the table and was soon deeply at work in his new study for many days oliver remained in the jews room picking the marks out of the pockethandkerchiefs of which a great number were brought home and sometimes taking part in the game already described which the two boys and the jew played regularly every morning at length one morning oliver obtained the permission to go out with the boys there had been no handkerchiefs to work upon for two or three days and the dinners had been rather meager perhaps these were reasons for the old gentleman giving his assent but whether they were or no he told oliver he might go and placed him under the joint care of charley bates and his friend the dodger the three boys started out the dodger with his coatsleeves tucked up and his hat cocked as usual master bates sauntering along with his hands in his pockets and oliver between them wondering where they were going and what they would teach him to make first they were just coming from a narrow court not far from an open square which is yet called the green when the dodger made a sudden stop and laying his finger on his lip drew his companions back again with the greatest caution whats the matter demanded oliver hush replied the dodger do you see that old cove at the bookstall the old gentleman over the way said oliver yes i see him hell do said the dodger a prime plant observed master charley bates oliver looked from one to the other with the greatest surprise but he was not permitted to make any inquiries for the two boys walked stealthily across the road and slunk close behind the old gentleman oliver walked a few paces after them and not knowing whether to advance or retire stood looking on in silent amazement the old gentleman was a very respectablelooking personage with a powdered head and gold spectacles as he stood reading a book and what was olivers horror and alarm as he stood a few paces off looking on with his eyelids as wide open as they would possibly go to see the dodger plunge his hand into the old gentlemans pocket and draw from thence a handkerchief to see him hand the same to charley bates and finally to behold them both running away round the corner in an instant the whole mystery of the handkerchiefs and the watches and the jewels and the jew rushed upon the boys mind he stood for a moment with the blood so tingling through all his veins from terror that he felt as if he were in a burning fire then confused and frightened he took to his heels and not knowing what he did made off as fast as he could lay his feet to the ground this was all done in a minutes space in the very instant when oliver began to run the old gentleman putting his hand to his pocket and missing his handkerchief turned sharp round seeing the boy scudding away at such a rapid pace he very naturally concluded him to be the thief and shouting stop thief with all his might made off after him book in hand but the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the hueandcry the dodger and master bates unwilling to attract public attention by running down the open street had merely retired into the very first doorway round the corner they no sooner heard the cry and saw oliver running than guessing exactly how the matter stood they issued forth with great quickness and shouting stop thief too joined in the pursuit like good citizens away they ran pellmell helterskelter slapdash tearing yelling screaming knocking down the passengers as they turn the corners rousing up the dogs and astonishing the fowls and making streets squares and courts reecho with the sound at last a burly fellow struck oliver a terrible blow and he went down upon the pavement and the crowd eagerly gathered round him each newcomer jostling and struggling with the others to catch a glimpse stand aside give him a little air nonsense he dont deserve it wheres the gentleman here he is coming down the street make room there for the gentleman is this the boy sir oliver lay covered with mud and dust and bleeding from the mouth looking wildly round upon the heap of faces that surrounded him when the old gentleman was officiously dragged and pushed into the circle by the foremost of the pursuers yes said the gentleman i am afraid it is the boy afraid murmured the crowd thats a good un poor fellow said the gentleman he has hurt himself i did that sir said a great lubberly fellow stepping forward and preciously i cut my knuckle agin his mouth i stopped him sir the fellow touched his hat with a grin expecting something for his pains but the old gentleman eyeing him with an expression of dislike looked anxiously round as if he contemplated running away himself which it is very possible he might have attempted to do and thus have afforded another chase had not a police officer who is generally the last person to arrive in such cases at that moment made his way through the crowd and seized oliver by the collar come get up said the man roughly it wasnt me indeed sir indeed indeed it was two other boys said oliver clasping his hands passionately and looking round they are here somewhere oh no they aint said the officer he meant this to be ironical but it was true besides for the dodger and charley bates had filed off down the first convenient court they came to come get up dont hurt him said the old gentleman compassionately oh no i wont hurt him replied the officer tearing his jacket half off his back in proof thereof come i know you it wont do will you stand upon your legs you young devil oliver who could hardly stand made a shift to raise himself on his feet and was at once lugged along the streets by the jacketcollar at a rapid pace the gentleman walked on with them by the officers side at last they came to a place called mutton hill here he was led beneath a low archway and up a dirty court where they saw a stout man with a bunch of whiskers on his face and a bunch of keys in his hand whats the matter now said the man carelessly a young foglehunter replied the officer who had oliver in charge are you the party thats been robbed sir inquired the man with the keys yes i am replied the old gentleman but i am not sure that this boy actually took the handkerchief i would rather not press the case must go before the magistrate now sir replied the man his worship will be disengaged in half a minute now young gallows this was an invitation for oliver to enter through a door which he unlocked as he spoke and which led into a stone cell here he was searched and nothing being found upon him locked up the old gentleman looked almost as unhappy as oliver when the key grated in the lock at last this gentleman mr brownlow was summoned before the magistratea very mean man whose name was fang oliver was brought in and the magistrate after using very abusive language to mr brownlow had him sworn but would not let him tell his story he flew into a rage and told the policeman to tell what happened the policeman with becoming humility related how he had taken the boy how he had searched oliver and found nothing on his person and how that was all he knew about it are there any witnesses inquired mr fang none your worship replied the policeman mr fang sat silent for some minutes and then turning round to mr brownlow said in a towering passion do you mean to state what your complaint against this boy is man or do you not you have been sworn now if you stand there refusing to give evidence ill punish you for disrespect to the bench with many interruptions and repeated insults mr brownlow contrived to state his case observing that in the surprise of the moment he had run after the boy because he saw him running away he has been hurt already said the old gentleman in conclusion and i fear he added with great energy looking toward the bar i really fear that he is ill oh yes i dare say said mr fang with a sneer come none of your tricks here you young vagabond they wont do whats your name oliver tried to reply but his tongue failed him he was deadly pale and the whole place seemed turning round and round whats your name you hardened scoundrel demanded mr fang at this point of the inquiry oliver raised his head and looking round with imploring eyes asked feebly for a drink of water stuff and nonsense said fang dont try to make a fool of me i think he really is ill your worship said the officer i know better said mr fang take care of him officer said the old gentleman raising his hands instinctively hell fall down stand away officer cried fang let him if he likes oliver availed himself of the kind permission and fell to the floor in a fainting fit the men in the office looked at each other but no one dared to stir i knew he was shamming said fang as if this were enough proof of the fact let him lie there hell soon be tired of that how do you propose to deal with the case sir inquired the clerk in a low voice summarily replied mr fang he stands committed for three monthshard labor of course clear the office the door was opened for this purpose and a couple of men were preparing to carry the insensible boy to his cell when an elderly man of decent but poor appearance clad in an old suit of black rushed in stop stop dont take him away for heavens sake stop a moment cried the newcomer breathless with haste what is this who is this turn this man out clear the office cried mr fang i will speak cried the man i will not be turned out i saw it all i keep the bookstall i demand to be sworn i will not be put down mr fang you must hear me you must not refuse sir the man was right his manner was determined and the matter was growing rather too serious to be hushed up swear the man growled mr fang with a very ill grace now man what have you to say this said the man i saw three boystwo two others and the prisoner hereloitering on the opposite side of the way when this gentleman was reading the robbery was committed by another boy i saw it done and i saw this boy was perfectly amazed and stupefied by it why didnt you come here before said fang after a pause i hadnt a soul to mind the shop replied the man everybody who could have helped me had joined in the pursuit i could get nobody till five minutes ago and i have run here all the way to speak the truth the boy is discharged clear the office shouted the angry magistrate the command was obeyed and as oliver was taken out he fainted away again in the yard and lay with his face a deadly white and a cold tremble convulsing his frame poor boy poor boy said mr brownlow bending over him call a coach somebody pray directly a coach was obtained and oliver having been carefully laid on one seat the old gentleman got in and sat himself on the other may i go with you said the bookstall keeper looking in bless me yes my dear sir said mr brownlow quickly i forgot you dear dear i have this unhappy book still jump in poor fellow no time to lose the bookstall keeper got into the coach and it rattled away it stopped at length before a neat house in a quiet shady street here a bed was prepared without loss of time in which mr brownlow saw his young charge carefully and comfortably laid and here he was tended with a kindness and solicitude that knew no bounds at last the sick boy began to recover and one day mr brownlow came to see him you may imagine how happy oliver was to see his good friend but he was no more delighted than was mr brownlow the old gentleman came to spend a short time with him every day and when he grew stronger oliver went up to the learned gentlemans study and talked with him by the hour and was astonished at the books he saw and which mr brownlow told him to look at and read as much as he liked oliver was soon well and no thought was in mr brownlows mind but that he should keep him and raise him and educate him to be a splendid man for no father loves his own son better than mr brownlow had come to love oliver now i know you want to ask me what became of oliver twist but i cannot tell you here let us leave him in this beautiful home of good mr brownlow and if you want to read the rest of his wonderful story get dickens big book called oliver twist and read it there there were many surprises

popular writer of boys books is a native of ohio where he was born somewhat more than a halfcentury ago his father was a famous hunter and rifle shot and it was doubtless his exploits and those of his

early age and his work was acceptable from the first his parents removed to new jersey while he was a boy and he was graduated from the state normal school and became a member of the faculty while

entire attention to literature he was an exceptionally successful teacher and wrote a number of textbooks for schools all of which met with high favor for these and his historical productions princeton college conferred upon him the degree of master of arts the high moral character the clean manly tendencies and the admirable literary style of mr ellis stories have made him as popular on the other side of the atlantic as in this country a leading paper remarked some time since that no mother need hesitate to place in the hands of her boy any book written by mr ellis they are found in the leading sundayschool libraries where as may well be believed they are in wide demand and do much good by their sound wholesome lessons which render them as acceptable to parents as to their children nearly all of the ellis books published by the john c winston company are reissued in london and many have been translated into other languages mr ellis is a writer of varied accomplishments
