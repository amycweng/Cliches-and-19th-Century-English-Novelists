stephen's tale my grandfather was a publican and a sinner as you will see his public house was the hole in the wall on the river's edge at wapping and his sins all of them that i know of are recorded in these pages he was a widower of some small substance and the hole in the wall was not the sum of his resources for he owned a little wharf on the river lea i called him grandfather nat not to distinguish him among a multitude of grandfathers for indeed i never knew another of my own but because of affectionate habit a habit perhaps born of the fact that nathaniel kemp was also my father's name my own is stephen to remember grandfather nat is to bethink me of pear drops it is possible that that particular sort of sweetstuff is now obsolete and i cannot remember how many years have passed since last i smelt it for the pear drop was a thing that could be smelt farther than seen and oftener so that its smell a rather fulsome vulgar smell i now believe is almost as distinct to my imagination while i write as it was to my nose thirty years ago for pear drops were an unfailing part of the large bagful of sticky old fashioned lollipops that my grandfather brought on his visits stuffed into his overcoat pocket and hard to get out without a burst and a spill his custom was invariable so that i think i must have come to regard the sweets as some natural production of his coat pocket insomuch that at my mother's funeral my muddled brain scarce realised the full desolation of the circumstances till i discovered that for the first time in my experience my grandfather's pocket was void of pear drops but with this new bereavement the world seemed empty indeed and i cried afresh associated in my memory with my grandfather's bag of sweets almost more than with himself was the gap in the right hand where the middle finger had been for it was commonly the maimed hand that hauled out the paper bag and the gap was plain and singular against the white paper he had lost the finger at sea they told me and as my notion of losing a thing was derived from my noah's ark or dropping a marble through a grating i was long puzzled to guess how anything like that could have happened to a finger withal the circumstance fascinated me and added vastly to the importance and the wonder of my grandfather in my childish eyes he was perhaps a little over the middle height but so broad and so deep of chest and especially so long of arm as to seem squat he had some grey hair but it was all below the line of his hat brim above that it was as the hair of a young man so that i was led to reason that colour must be washed out of hair by exposure to the weather as perhaps in his case it was i think that his face was almost handsome in a rough hard bitten way and he was as hairy a man as i ever saw his short beard was like curled wire but i can remember that long after i had grown to resent being kissed by women being no longer a baby i gladly climbed his knee to kiss my grandfather though his shaven upper lip was like a rasp in these early days i lived with my mother in a little house of a short row that stood on a quay in a place that was not exactly a dock nor a wharf nor a public thoroughfare but where people from the dock trying to find a wharf people from a wharf looking for the dock and people from the public thoroughfare in anxious search of dock and wharves used to meet and ask each other questions it was a detached piece of blackwall which had got adrift among locks and jetties and was liable to be cut off from the rest of the world at any moment by the arrival of a ship and the consequent swinging of a bridge worked by two men at a winch so that it was a commonplace of my early childhood though the sight never lost its interest to observe from a window a ship passing as it were up the street warped into dock by the capstans on the quay and the capstan songs of the dockmen shenandore mexico is covered with snow hurrah for the black ball line and the like were as much my nursery rhymes as little boy blue and sing a song o' sixpence these things are done differently nowadays the cottages on the quay are gone and the neighbourhood is a smokier place where the work is done by engines with no songs my father was so much at sea that i remember little of him at all he was a ship's officer and at the time i am to tell of he was mate of the brig juno owned by viney and marr one of the small shipowning firms that were common enough thirty years ago though rarer now the sort of firm that was made by a pushing skipper and an ambitious shipping clerk beginning with a cheap vessel bought with money raised mainly by pawning the ship such concerns often did well and sometimes grew into great lines perhaps most of them yielded the partners no more than a comfortable subsistence and a good few came to grief or were kept going by questionable practices which have since become illegal sometimes in truth by what the law called crime even then viney had been a ship's officer had indeed served under grandfather nat who was an old skipper marr was the business man who had been a clerk and the firm owned two brigs the juno and another though how much of their value was clear property and how much stood for borrowed money was matter of doubt and disagreement in the conversation of mates and skippers along thames shore what nobody disagreed about however was that the business was run on skinflint principles and that the vessels were so badly found so ill kept and so grievously under manned that the firm ought to be making money these things by the way though they are important to remember as i was saying i remember little of my father because of his long voyages and short spells at home but my mother is so clear and so kind in my recollection that sometimes i dream of her still though she died before i was eight it was while my father was on a long voyage with the juno that there came a time when she took me often upon her knee asking if i should like a little brother or sister to play with a thing which i demanded to have brought instantly there was a fat woman called mrs dann who appeared in the household and became my enemy she slept with my mother and my cot was thrust into another room where i lay at night and brooded sometimes wept with jealousy thus to be supplanted though i drew what consolation i might from the prospect of the promised playmate then i could not go near my mother at all for she was ill and there was a doctor and then i was told that mother and baby brother were gone to heaven together a thing i would not hear of but fought savagely with mrs dann on the landing shouting to my mother that she was not to die for i was coming and when wearied with kicking and screaming for i fought with neighbours as well as with the nurse and the undertaker conceiving them to be all in league to deprive me of my mother when at last the woman from next door took me into the bedroom and i saw the drawn face that could not smile and my tiny brother that could not play lying across the dead breast i so behaved that the good soul with me blubbered aloud and i had an added grief in the reflection that i had kicked her shins not half an hour before i have never seen that good woman since and i am ashamed to write that i cannot even remember her name i have no more to say of my mother and of her funeral only so much as records the least part of my grief some of her relations came whom i cannot distinctly remember seeing at any other time a group of elderly and hard featured women who talked of me as the child very much as they might have talked of some troublesome article of baggage and who turned up their noses at my grandfather who for his part was uneasily respectful calling each of them mum very often i was not attracted by my mother's relations and i kept as near my grandfather as possible feeling a vague fear that some of them might have a design of taking me away though indeed none was in the least ambitious of that responsibility they were not all women for there was one quiet little man in their midst who when not eating cake or drinking wine was sucking the bone handle of a woman's umbrella which he carried with him everywhere indoors and out he was in the custody of the largest and grimmest of ladies whom the others called aunt martha he was so completely in her custody that after some consideration i judged he must be her son though indeed he seemed very old for that i now believe him to have been her husband but i cannot remember to have heard his name and i cannot invent him a better one than uncle martha uncle martha would have behaved quite well i am convinced if he had been left alone and would have acquitted himself with perfect propriety in all the transactions of the day but it seemed to be aunt martha's immovable belief that he was wholly incapable of any action even the simplest and most obvious unless impelled by shoves and jerks consequently he was shoved into the mourning carriage we had two and jerked into the corner opposite to the one he selected shoved out almost on all fours at the cemetery and perceiving him entering the little chapel of his own motion aunt martha overtook him and jerked him in there this example presently impressed the other ladies with the expediency of shoving uncle martha at any convenient opportunity so that he arrived home with us at last in a severely jostled condition faithful to the bone handled umbrella through everything grandfather nat had been liberal in provision for the funeral party and the cake and port wine the gin and water the tea and the watercress occupied the visitors for some time a period illuminated by many moral reflections from a rather fat relation who was no doubt like most of the others an aunt ah well said the fat aunt shaking her head with a deep sigh that suggested repletion ah well it's what we must all come to there had been a deal of other conversation but i remember this remark because the fat aunt had already made it twice ah indeed assented another aunt a thin one so we must sooner or later yes yes as i often say we're all mortal yes indeed we've all got to be born an' we've all got to die that's true rich an' poor just the same ah in the midst of life we're in the middle of it ah yes grandfather nat deeply impressed made haste to refill the fat aunt's glass and to push the cake dish nearer aunt martha jerked uncle martha's elbow toward his glass which he was neglecting with a sudden nod and a frown of pointed significance even command it's a great trial for all of the family i'm sure pursued the fat aunt after applications to glass and cake dish but we must bear up not that we ain't had trials enough neither no indeed replied aunt martha with a snap at my grandfather as though he were the trial chiefly on her mind which grandfather nat took very humbly and tried her with watercress well she's better off poor thing the fat aunt went on some began to say ah again but aunt martha snapped it into well let's hope so in the tone of one convinced that my mother couldn't be much worse off than she had been from which and from sundry other remarks among the aunts i gathered that my mother was held to have hurt the dignity of her family by alliance with grandfather nat's i have never wholly understood why but i put the family pride down to the traditional wedding of an undoubted auctioneer with aunt martha's cousin so aunt martha said let's hope so and with another sudden frown and nod shoved uncle martha toward the cake what a blessing the child was took too was the fat aunt's next observation ah that it is murmured the chorus but i was puzzled and shocked to hear such a thing said of my little brother and it's a good job there's only one left the chorus agreed again i began to feel that i had seriously disobliged my mother's relations by not dying too and him a boy boys can look after themselves this was a thin aunt's opinion ah and that's a blessing sighed the fat aunt a great blessing of course said aunt martha and it's not to be expected that his mother's relations can be burdened with him why no indeed said the fat aunt very decisively i'm sure it wouldn't be poor ellen's wish to cause more trouble to her family than she has and aunt martha with a frown at the watercress gave uncle martha another jolt it seemed to me that he had really eaten all he wanted and would rather leave off and i wondered if she always fed him like that or if it were only when they were visiting and besides it 'ud be standing in the child's way aunt martha resumed with so many openings as there is in the docks here quite handy perhaps it was because i was rather dull in the head that day from one cause and another at any rate i could think of no other openings in the docks but those between the ships and the jetties and at the lock sides which people sometimes fell into in the dark and i gathered a hazy notion that i was expected to make things comfortable by going out and drowning myself yes of course it would said the fat aunt it stands to reason said a thin one anybody can see that said the others and many a boy's gone out to work no older ah and been members o' parliament afterwards too the prospect of an entry into parliament presented so stupefying a contrast with that of an immersion in the dock that for some time the ensuing conversation made little impression on me on the part of my mother's relations it was mainly a repetition of what had gone before very much in the same words and as to my grandfather he had little to say at all but expressed himself so far as he might by furtive pats on my back pats increasing in intensity as the talk of the ladies pointed especially and unpleasingly to myself till at last the food and drink were all gone whereupon the fat aunt sighed her last moral sentiment uncle martha was duly shoved out on the quay and i was left alone with grandfather nat well stevy ol' mate said my grandfather drawing me on his knee us two's left alone left alone ol' mate i had not cried much that day scarce at all in fact since first meeting my grandfather in the passage and discovering his empty pocket for as i have said i was a little dull in the head and trying hard to think of many things but now i cried indeed with my face against my grandfather's shoulder and there was something of solace in the outburst and when at last i looked up i saw two bright drops hanging in the wiry tangle of my grandfather's beard and another lodged in the furrow under one eye 'nough done stevy said my grandfather don't cry no more you'll come home along o' me now won't ye an' to morrow we'll go in the london dock where the sugar is i looked round the room and considered as well as my sodden little head would permit i had never been in the london dock which was a wonderful place as i had gathered from my grandfather's descriptions a paradise where sugar lay about the very ground in lumps and where you might eat it if you would so long as you brought none away but here was my home with nobody else to take care of it and i felt some muddled sense of a new responsibility i'm 'fraid i can't leave the place gran'fa' nat i said with a dismal shake of the head father might come home an' he wouldn't know an' an' so an' so you think you've got to stop an' keep house my grandfather asked bending his face down to mine the prospect had been oppressing my muzzy faculties all day if i escaped being taken away plainly i must keep house and cook and buy things and scrub floors at any rate till my father came home though it seemed a great deal to undertake alone so i answered with a nod and a forlorn sniff good pluck good pluck exclaimed my grandfather exultantly clapping his hand twice on my head and rubbing it vigorously stevy ol' mate me an' you'll get on capital i knowed you'd make a plucked 'un but you won't have to keep house alone jest yet no you an' me'll keep house together stevy at the hole in the wall your father won't be home a while yet an' i'll settle all about this here place but lord what a pluck for a shaver and he brightened wonderfully in truth there had been little enough of courage in my poor little body and grandfather nat's words brought me a deal of relief beyond the vague terrors of loneliness and responsibility i had been troubled by the reflection that housekeeping cost money and i had none for though my mother's half pay note had been sent in the regular way to viney and marr a week before there had been neither reply nor return of the paper the circumstance was unprecedented and unaccountable though the explanation came before very long for the present however the difficulty was put aside i put my hand in my grandfather's and the door being locked behind us and the key in his pocket we went out together on the quay over the bridge and into the life that was to be new for us both chapter ii in blue gate while his mother's relations walked out of stephen's tale and left his grandfather in it the tales of all the world went on each man hero in his own viney and marr were owners of the brig juno away in tropic seas with stephen's father chief mate and at this time the tale of viney and marr had just divided into two inasmuch as the partners were separated and the firm was at a crisis the crisis responsible for the withholding of mrs kemp's half pay no legal form had dissolved the firm indeed and scarce half a mile of streets lay between the two men but in truth marr had left his partner with uncommon secrecy and expedition carrying with him all the loose cash he could get together and a man need travel a very little way to hide in london so it was that mr viney left alone to bear the firm's burdens was loafing sometimes about his house in commercial road stepney sometimes in the back streets and small public houses hard by pondering no doubt the matter contained in a paper that had that afternoon stricken the colour from the face of one crooks ship chandler of shadwell and had hardly less disquieted others in related trades while marr for the few days since his flight no more dressed like the business partner in a shipowning concern nor even like a clerk but in serge and anklejacks like a foremast hand was playing up to his borrowed character by being drunk in blue gate the blue gate is gone now it went with many places of a history only less black when ratcliff highway was put to rout as you left high street shadwell for the highway they made one thoroughfare the blue gate was on your right almost opposite an evil lane that led downhill to the new dock blue gate fields it was more fully called though there was as little of a field as of a gate blue or other about the place which was a street narrow foul and forbidding leading up to back lane it was a bad and a dangerous place the worst in all that neighbourhood worse than frederick street worse than tiger bay the sailor once brought to anchor in blue gate was lucky to get out with clothes to cover him lucky if he saved no more than his life yet sailors were there in plenty hilarious shouting drunk and drugged horrible draggled women pawed them over for whatever their pockets might yield and murderous ruffians were ready at hand whenever a knock on the head could solve a difficulty front doors stood ever open in the blue gate and some houses had no front doors at all at the top of one of the grimy flights of stairs thus made accessible from the street was a noisy and ill smelling room noisy because of the company it held ill smelling partly because of their tobacco but chiefly because of the tobacco and the liquor of many that had been there before and because of the aged foulness of the whole building there were five in the room four men and a woman one of the men was marr though for the present he was not using that name he was noticeable amid the group being cleaner than the rest fair haired and dressed like a sailor ashore though he lacked the sunburn that was proper to the character but sailor or none there he sat where many had sat before him a piece of the familiar prey of blue gate babbling drunk and reasonless the others were watchfully sober enough albeit with a great pretence of jollity they had drunk level with the babbler but had been careful to water his drink with gin as for him he swayed and lolled sometimes on the table before him sometimes on the shoulder of the woman at his side she was no beauty with her coarse features dull eyes and tousled hair her thick voice and her rusty finery but indeed she was the least repulsive of that foul company on the victim's opposite side sat a large framed bony fellow with a thin unhealthy face that seemed to belong to some other body and dress that proclaimed him long shore ruffian the woman called him dan and nods and winks passed between the two over the drooping head between them next dan was an ugly rascal with a broken nose singular in that place as bearing in his dress none of the marks of waterside habits crimpery and the highway but seeming rather the commonplace town rat of shoreditch or whitechapel and last a blind fiddler sat in a corner fiddling a flourish from time to time roaring with foul jest and roiling his single white eye upward no i won'av another the fair haired man said staring about him with uncertain eyes got bishness 'tend to i say wha' pubsh this 'tain' brown bear ish't ish't brown bear no you silly the woman answered playfully 'tain't the brown bear you've come 'ome along of us o come home come home i shay this won' do mus'n' go 'ome yet get collared y'know this with an owlish wink at the bottle before him dan and the woman exchanged a quick look plainly something had gone before that gave the words significance no marr went on mus'n' go 'ome i'm sailor man jus' 'shore from brig juno in from barbadoes no not juno course not dunno juno 'tain' juno d'year 'tain' juno ye know my ship never heard o' juno mine's 'nother ship i say wha'sh name my ship you're a rum sailor man said dan not to know the name of your own ship ten minutes together why you've told us about four different names a'ready the sham seaman chuckled feebly why i don't believe you're a sailor at all mate the woman remarked still playfully you've just bin a kiddin' of us fine the chuckle persisted and turned to a stupid grin ha ha ha ha have it y'r own way this with a clumsily stealthy grope at the breast pocket a movement that the others had seen before and remembered have it y'r own way but i say i say y'know suddenly serious you're all right ain't you eh all right you know eh i s say i hope you're orright awright mate course we are and dan clapped him cordially on the shoulder awright mate shouted the blind man his white eye rolling and blinking horribly at the ceiling right as ninepence an' a 'a'penny over damme we're awright growled the broken nosed man thickly we don't tell no secrets said the woman thash all very well but i was talkin' about the juno y'know was'n i talkin' about juno a look of sleepy alarm was on the fair man's face as he turned his eyes from one to another ay that's so answered the fellow at his side brig juno in from barbadoes ah thash where you're wrong she ain't in see marr wagged his head and leered the profoundest sagacity she ain't in what's more 'ow d'you know she ever will come in eh 'ow d'ye know that thash one for ye ole f'ler whar'll ye bet me she ever gets as far as but i say i say i say y'know you're all right ain't you qui' sure you're orrigh' there was a new and a longer chorus of reassurance which dan at last ended with go on the juno ain't ever to come back is that it marr turned and stared fishily at him for some seconds wha'rr you mean he demanded at length with a drivelling assumption of dignity wha'rr you mean n never come back nishe remark make 'spectable shipowner whassor' firm you take us for eh the blind fiddler stopped midway in a flourish and pursed his lips silently dan looked quickly at the fiddler and as quickly back at the drunken man marr's attitude and the turn of his head being favourable the woman quietly detached his watch whassor' firm you take us for he repeated d'ye think 'cause we're 'cause i come here 'cause i come 'ere an' he stopped foolishly and tailed off into nothing smiling uneasily at one and another the woman held up the watch behind him a silver hunter engraved with marr's chief initial a noticeably large letter m dan saw it shook his head and frowned pointed and tapped his own breast pocket all in a moment and presently the woman slipped the watch back into the pocket it came from 'ere 'ave another drink said dan hospitably 'ave another all round for the last 'fore the fiddler goes 'ere y'are george reach out eh ejaculated the fiddler eh i ain't goin' didn't the genelman ask me to come along come i'll give y' a toon i'll give y' a chant as 'll make yer 'air curl take your drink george dan insisted we don't want our 'air curled the fiddler groped for and took the drink swallowed it and twangled the fiddle strings will y'ave black jack he asked no dan answered with a rising voice we won't 'ave black jack an' what's more we won't 'ave blind george see you cut your lucky soon as ye like awright awright cap'en the fiddler remonstrated rising reluctantly you're 'ard on a pore blind bloke damme ain't i to get nothin' out o' this 'ere i ask ye fair didn't the genelman tell me to come along marr ducking and lolling over the table here looked up and said whassup fiddler won' go gi'm twopence an' kick'm downstairs 'ere y'are and he pulled out some small change between his fingers and spilt it on the table dan and the broken nosed man gathered it up and thrust it into the blind man's hand this ain't the straight game he protested in a hoarse whisper as they pushed him through the doorway i want my reg'lars out o' that lot d'ye 'ear i want my reg'lars but they shut the door on him whereupon he broke into a torrent of curses on the landing and presently having descended several of the stairs reached back to let drive a thump at the door with his stick and so went off swearing into the street marr sniggered feebly chucked out fiddler he said whash we do now i won'ave any more drink i 'ad 'nough think i'll be gett'n' along here what you after eh he clapped his hand again to his breast pocket and turned suspiciously on the woman you keep y'r hands off he said wha' wan' my pocket awright mate the woman answered placidly i ain't a touchin' yer pockets why look there yer watchguard's 'angin' you'll drop that presently an' say it's me i s'pose you'd better get away from the genelman if you can't behave yourself civil interposed dan pushing the woman aside and getting between them 'ere mate you got to 'ave another drink along o' me i'll turn her out arter the fiddler if she ain't civil i won'ave another drink said marr thickly struggling unsteadily to his feet and dropping back instantly to his chair i won'avanother we'll see about that replied dan 'ere you get out he went on addressing the woman as he hauled her up by the shoulders you get out we're goin' to be comf'table together us two an' 'im out ye go he thrust her toward the door and opened it i'm sick o' foolin' about he added in an angry undertone quick's the word o no dan don't the woman pleaded whispering on the landing not that way not again i'll get it from him easy in a minute don't do it dan shut yer mouth i ain't askin' you you shove off a bit don't dan but the door was shut i tell ye i won'avanother came marr's voice from within the woman went down the stairs her gross face drawn as though she wept though her eyes were dry at the door she looked back with something like a shudder and then turned her steps down the street the two partners in viney and marr were separated indeed but now it was by something more than half a mile of streets chapter iii stephen's tale i had never been home with grandfather nat before i fancy that some scruples of my mother's in the matter of the neighbourhood and the character of the company to be seen and heard at the hole in the wall had hitherto kept me from the house and even from the sugary elysium of the london dock now i was going there at last and something of eager anticipation overcame the sorrow of the day we went in an omnibus which we left in commercial road here my grandfather took order to repair my disappointment in the matter of pear drops and we left the shop with such a bagful that it would not go into the accustomed pocket at all a little way from this shop and on the opposite side of the way stood a house which my mother had more than once pointed out to me already and as we came abreast of it now grandfather nat pointed it out also know who lives there stevy he asked yes i said mr viney that father's ship belongs to there was a man sitting on the stone baluster by the landing of the front steps having apparently just desisted from knocking at the door he was pale and agitated and he slapped his leg distractedly with a folded paper why said my grandfather that's crooks the ship chandler he looks bad wonder what's up with that the door opened and a servant girl in bonnet and shawl emerged with her box lifting and dragging it as best she might the man rose and spoke to her and i supposed that he was about to help but at her answer he sank back on the balustrade and she hauled the box to the pavement by herself the man looked worse than ever now and he moved his head from side to side so that it struck me that it might be that his mother also was dead perhaps to day and at the thought all the flavour went from the pear drop in my mouth we turned up a narrow street which led us to a part where the river plainly was nearer at every step for well i knew the curious smell that grew as we went and that had in it something of tar something of rope and junk something of ships' stores and much of a blend of unknown outlandish merchandise we met sailors some with parrots and accordions and many with undecided legs and we saw more of the hang dog fellows who were not sailors though they dressed in the same way and got an inactive living out of sailors somehow they leaned on posts they lurked in foul entries they sat on sills smoking and often one would accost and hang to a passing sailor with a grinning trumped up cordiality that offended and repelled me child as i was and there were big coarse women with flaring clothes and hair that shone with grease though for them i had but a certain wonder as for why they all seemed to live near the docks why they all grew so stout and why they never wore bonnets as we went where the street grew fouler and more crooked and where dark entries and many turnings gave evidence of the complication of courts and alleys about us we heard a hoarse voice crooning a stave of a sea song with the low scrape of a fiddle striking in here and there as it were at random and presently there turned a corner ahead and faced toward us a blind man with his fiddle held low against his chest and his face lifted upward a little aside he checked at the corner to hit the wall a couple of taps with the stick that hung from his wrist and called aloud with fouler words than i can remember or could print now then damn ye ain't there ne'er a christian sailor man as wants a toon o' george who'll 'ave a toon o' george ain't ye got no money damn ye not a brown for pore blind george what a dirty mean lot it is who'll 'ave a 'ornpipe who'll 'ave a song o' pore george o damn y' all and so with a mutter and another tap of the stick he came creeping along six inches at a step the stick dangling loose again and the bow scraping the strings to the song fire on the fore top fire on the bow fire on the main deck fire down below fire fire fire down below fetch a bucket o' water fire down below the man's right eye was closed but the left was horribly wide and white and rolling and it quite unpleasantly reminded me of a large china marble that lay at that moment at the bottom of my breeches pocket under some uniform buttons a key you could whistle on a brass knob from a fender and a tangle of string so much indeed was i possessed with this uncomfortable resemblance in later weeks when i had seen blind george often and knew more of him that at last i had no choice but to fling the marble into the river though indeed it was something of a rarity in marbles and worth four alleys as big as itself my grandfather stopped his talk as we drew within earshot of the fiddler but blind men's ears are keen beyond the common the bow dropped from the fiddle and blind george sang out cheerily why 'ere comes cap'en nat 'ome from the funeral and got 'is little grandson what 'e's goin' to take care of an' bring up so moral in 'is celebrated 'ouse o' call all to my extreme amazement for what should this strange blind man know of me or of my mother's funeral grandfather nat seemed a little angry well well he said your ears are sharp blind george they learn a lot as ain't your business if your eyes was as good as your ears you'd ha' had your head broke 'fore this a dozen times if my eyes was as good as my ears cap'en nat kemp the other retorted there's many as wouldn't find it so easy to talk o' breakin' my 'ed other people's business lord i know enough to 'ang some of 'em that's what i know i could tell you some o' your business if i liked some as you don't know yourself look 'ere you bin to a funeral well it ain't the last funeral as 'll be wanted in your family see the kid's mother's gone don't you be too sure 'is father's safe i bin along o' some one you know an' 'e don't look like lastin' for ever 'e don't 'e ain't in 'ealthy company grandfather nat twitched my sleeve and we walked on awright the blind man called after us in his tone of affable ferocity awright go along you'll see things some day near as well as i can what's blind that's a bad fellow stevy grandfather nat said as we heard the fiddle and the song begin again don't you listen to neither his talk nor his songs somehow it don't seem nat'ral to see a blind man such a bad 'un but a bad 'un he is up an' down i asked how he came to know about the funeral and especially about my coming to wapping a thing i had only learned of myself an hour before my grandfather said that he had probably learned of the funeral from somebody who had been at the hole in the wall during the day and had asked the reason of the landlord's absence and as to myself he had heard my step and guessed its meaning instantly he's a keen sharp rascal stevy an' he makes out all of parties' business he can he knew your father was away an' he jumped the whole thing at once that's his way but i don't stand him he don't corne into my house barrin' he comes a customer which i can't help of the meaning of the blind man's talk i understood little but he shocked me with a sense of insult and more with one of surprise for i had entertained a belief born of sunday school stories that blindness produced saintly piety unless it were the piety that caused the blindness and that in any case a virtuous meekness was an essential condition of the affliction so i walked in doubt and cogitation and so after a dive down a narrower street than any we had yet traversed it could scarce be dirtier and a twist through a steep and serpentine alley we came as it grew dusk to the hole in the wall of odd looking riverside inns i can remember plenty but never before or since have i beheld an odder than this of grandfather nat's it was wooden and clap boarded and like others of its sort it was everywhere larger at top than at bottom but the hole in the wall was not only top heavy but also most alarmingly lopsided by its side and half under it lay a narrow passage through which one saw a strip of the river and its many craft and the passage ended in hole in the wall stairs all of the house that was above the ground floor on this side rested on a row of posts which stood near the middle of the passage and the burden of these posts twisted wavy bulging and shapeless hung still more toward the opposite building while the farther side bounded by a later brick house was vertical as though a great wedge point downward had been cut away to permit the rise of the newer wall and the effect was as of a reeling and toppling of the whole construction away from its neighbour and an imminent downfall into the passage and when later i examined the side looking across the river supported on piles and bulging and toppling over them also i decided that what kept the hole in the wall from crashing into the passage was nothing but its countervailing inclination to tumble into the river painted large over the boards of the front whose lapped edges gave the letters ragged outlines were the words the hole in the wall and below a little smaller nathaniel kemp i felt a certain pride i think in the importance thus given the family name and my esteem of my grandfather increased proportionably with the size of the letters there was a great noise within and grandfather nat with a quick look toward the entrance grunted angrily but we passed up the passage and entered by a private door under the posts this door opened directly into the bar parlour the floor whereof was two steps below the level of the outer paving and the size whereof was about thrice that of a sentry box the din of a quarrel and a scuffle came from the bar and my grandfather thrusting me into a corner and giving me his hat ran out with a roar like that of a wild beast at the sound the quarrel hushed in its height what's this my grandfather blared with a thump on the counter that made the pots jump what sort of a row's this in my house damme i'll break y' in halves every mother's son of ye i peeped through the glass partition and saw first the back of the potman's head for the bar floor took another drop and beyond that and the row of beer pulls a group of rough hulking men one with blood on his face and all with an odd look of sulky guilt out you go pursued grandfather nat every swab o' ye can't leave the place not even to go to not for nothin' without a row like this givin' the house a bad name go on jim crute unless i'm to chuck ye the men had begun filing out awkwardly with nothing but here and there awright guv'nor awright cap'en goin' ain't i and the like but one big ruffian lagged behind scowling and murmuring rebelliously in a flash grandfather nat was through the counter wicket with a dart of his long left arm he had gripped the fellow's ear and spun him round with a wrench that i thought had torn the ear from the head and in the same moment had caught him by the opposite wrist so as to stretch the man's extended arm elbow backward across his own great chest a posture in which the backward pull against the elbow joint brought a yell of agony from the victim only a man with extraordinarily long arms could have done the thing exactly like that the movement was so savagely sudden that my grandfather had kicked open the door and flung jim crute headlong into the street ere i quite understood it when there came a check in my throat and tears in my eyes to see the man so cruelly handled grandfather nat stood a moment at the door but it seemed that his customer was quelled effectually for presently he turned inward again with such a grim scowl as i had never seen before and at that a queer head appeared just above the counter i had supposed the bar to be wholly cleared and a very weak and rather womanish voice said in tones of over inflected indignation serve 'em right cap'en kemp i'm sure lot o' impudent vagabones ought to be ashamed o' theirselves that they ought pity every 'ouse ain't kep' as strict as this one is that's what i say and the queer head looked round the vacant bar with an air of virtuous defiance as though anxious to meet the eye of any so bold as to contradict it was anything but a clean face on the head and it was overshadowed by a very greasy wideawake hat grubbiness and unhealthy redness contended for mastery in the features of which the nose was the most surprising wide and bulbous and knobbed all over so that ever afterward in any attempt to look mr cripps in the face i found myself wholly disregarding his eyes and fixing a fascinated gaze on his nose and i could never recall his face to memory as i recalled another but always as a nose garnished with a fringe of inferior features the face had been shaved apparently about a week before and by the sides hung long hair dirtier to look at than the rest of the apparition my grandfather gave no more than a glance in the direction of this little man passed the counter and re joined me pulling off his coat as he came something of my tingling eyes and screwed mouth was visible i suppose for he stooped as he rolled up his shirt sleeves and said why stevy boy what's amiss you you hurt the man's ear i said with a choke and a sniff for till then grandfather nat had seemed to me the kindest man in the world grandfather nat looked mightily astonished he left his shirt sleeve where it was and thrust his fingers up in his hair behind through the grey and out at the brown on top what he said hurt 'im hurt 'im why s'pose i did he ain't a friend o' yours is he young 'un i shook my head and blinked there was a gleam of amusement in my grandfather's grim face as he sat in a chair and took me between his knees hurt 'im he repeated why lord love ye i'd get hurt if i didn't hurt some of 'em now an' then they're a rough lot a bitter bad lot round here an' it's hurt or be hurt with them stevy i got to frighten 'em my boy an' i do it too i was passing my fingers to and fro in the matted hair on my grandfather's arm and thinking he seemed a very terrible man now and perhaps something of a hero for young as i was i was a boy so presently i said did you ever kill a man gran'fa' nat chapter iv stephen's tale many small matters of my first few hours at the hole in the wall were impressed on me by later events in particular i remember the innocent curiosity with which i asked did you ever kill a man gran'fa' nat there was a twitch and a frown on my grandfather's face and he sat back as one at a moment's disadvantage i thought that perhaps he was trying to remember but he only said gruffly and with a quick sound like a snort very nigh killed myself once or twice stevy in my time and rose hastily from his chair to reach a picture of a ship that was standing on a shelf there he said that's a new 'un just done pretty picter ain't it an' that there pointing to another hanging on the wall that's the juno what your father's on now i had noticed that the walls both of the bar and of the bar parlour were plentifully hung with paintings of ships ships becalmed ships in full sail ships under bare spars all with painful blue skies over them and very even waved seas beneath and ships in storms with torn sails pursued by rumbustious piles of sooty cloud and pelted with lengths of scarlet lightning i fear i should not have recognised my father's ship without help but that was probably because i had only seen it months before lying in dock battered and dingy with a confusion of casks and bales about the deck and naked yards dangling above whereas in the picture which was a mile too small for the brig it was booming along under a flatulent mountain of clean white sail and bulwarks and deck fittings were gay with lively and diversified colour i said something about its being a fine ship or a fine picture and that there were a lot of them ah he said they do mount up one arter another it's one gentleman as did 'em all him out in the bar now with the long hair sometimes i think i'd rather a had money but it's a talent that's what it is the artist beyond the outer bar had been talking to the potman now he coughed and said ha um cap'en kemp sir cap'en kemp no doubt as you've 'eard the noos to day no said grandfather nat finishing the rolling of his shirt sleeves as he stepped down into the bar not as i know on what is it not about viney and marr no what about 'em mr cripps rose on his toes with the importance of his information and his eyes widened to a moment's rivalry with his nose gone wrong he said in a shrill whisper that was as loud as his natural voice gone wrong unsolvent cracked up broke busted in a common way o' speakin' and he gave a violent nod with each synonym no said grandfather nat surely not viney and marr fact cap'en i can assure you on 'igh a'thority it's what i might call the universal topic in neighbourin' circles an' a gen'ral subjick o' local discussion you'd 'a 'eard it 'fore this if you'd bin at 'ome my grandfather whistled and rested a hand on a beer pull not a stiver for nobody they say mr cripps pursued not till they can sell the wessels what there was loose marr's bolted with or as you might put it absconded absconded with the proceeds an' gone abroad it's said i see the servant gal bringin' out her box from viney's just now said grandfather nat an' crooks the ship chandler was on the steps very white in the gills with a paper well well an' you say marr's bolted absconded cap'en kemp absconded with the proceeds 'opped the twig viney says 'e's robbed 'im as well as the creditors but i 'ear some o' the creditors' observation is 'gammon' an' they say the wessels is pawned up to their r'yals up to their r'yals well commented my grandfather i wouldn't ha' thought it the juno was that badly found an' they did everything that cheap i thought they made money hand over fist flyin' too 'igh cap'en kemp flyin' too 'igh you knowed viney long 'fore 'e elevated hisself into a owner didn't you what was he then why 'e was your mate one voy'ge wasn't he ay an' more so i've 'eard tell well arter that surely 'e was flyin' too 'igh an' now marr's absconded with the proceeds the talk in the bar went on being almost entirely the talk of mr cripps who valued himself on the unwonted importance his news gave him and aimed at increasing it by saying the same thing a great many times by saying it too when he could in terms and phrases that had a strong flavour of the sunday paper but as for me i soon ceased to hear for i discovered something of greater interest on the shelf that skirted the bar parlour it was a little model of a ship in a glass case and it was a great marvel to me with all its standing and running rigging complete and a most ingenious and tumultuous sea about it made of stiff calico cockled up into lumps and ridges and painted the proper colour much better than either of the two we had at home for these latter were only half models each nothing but one half of a little ship split from stem to stern and stuck against a board on which were painted sky clouds seagulls and in one case a lighthouse an exasperating make believe that had been my continual disappointment but this was altogether so charming and delightful and real and the little hatches and cuddy houses so thrilled my fancy that i resolved to beg of my grandfather to let me call the model my own and sometimes have the glass case off so i was absorbed while the conversation in the bar ranged from the ships and their owners to my father and from him to me as was plain when my grandfather called me here he is said my grandfather with a deal of pride in his voice putting his foot on a stool and lifting me on his knee here he is an' a plucked 'un ain't ye stevy he rubbed his hand over my head as he was fond of doing plucked ah why he was agoin' to keep house all by hisself with all the pluck in life till his father come home warn't ye stevy boy but he's come along o' me instead an' him an' me's goin' to keep the hole in the wall together ain't we pardners eh stevy i think i never afterwards saw my grandfather talking so familiarly with his customers i perceived now that there was another in the bar in addition to mr cripps a pale quiet and rather ragged man who sat in an obscure corner with an untouched glass of liquor by him come said my grandfather have one with me mr cripps an' drink the new pardner's health what is it an' you you drink up too an' have another this last order grandfather nat flung at the man in the corner just in the tones in which i had heard a skipper on a ship tell a man to get forrard lively with a rope fender opposite our quay at blackwall i'm sure 'ere's wishin' the young master every 'ealth an' 'appiness said mr cripps beaming on me with a grin that rather frightened than pleased me it twisted the nose so every 'ealth and 'appiness i'm sure the pale man in the corner only looked up quickly as if fearful of obtruding himself gulped the drink that had been standing by him and receiving another put it down untasted where the first had stood that ain't drinkin' a health said my grandfather angrily there that's it and he pointed to the new drink with the hand that held his own the pale man lifted it hurriedly stood up looked at me and said something indistinct gulped the liquor and returned the glass to the counter whereupon the potman without orders instantly refilled it and the man carried it back to his corner and put it down beside him as before i began to wonder if the pale man suffered from some complaint that made it dangerous to leave him without a drink close at hand ready to be swallowed at a moment's notice but mr cripps blinked first at his own glass and then at the pale man's and i fancy he thought himself unfairly treated howbeit his affability was unconquerable he grinned and snapped his fingers playfully at me provoking my secret indignation since that was what people did to please babies an' a pretty young gent 'e is too said mr cripps of considerable personal attractions goin' to bring 'im up to the trade i s'pose cap'en kemp why no said grandfather nat with some dignity no something better than that i'm hopin' pardners is all very well for a bit but stevy's goin' to be a cut above his poor old gran'father if i can do it eh boy he rubbed my head again and i was too shy sitting there in the bar to answer eh boy boardin' school an' a gentleman's job for this one if the old man has his way mr cripps shook his head sagaciously and could plainly see that i was cut out for a statesman he also lifted his empty glass looked at it abstractedly and put it down again nothing coming of this he complimented my personal appearance once more and thought that my portrait should certainly be painted as a memorial in my future days of greatness this notion seemed to strike my grandfather rather favourably and he forthwith consulted a slate which dangled by a string during his contemplation of which with its long rows of strokes mr cripps betrayed a certain anxious discomfort well said grandfather nat at length you are pretty deep in you know an' it might as well be that as anything else but what about that sign ain't i ever goin' to get that mr cripps knitted his brows and his nose turned up his eyes and shook his head it ain't come to me yet cap'en kemp he said not yet i'm still waiting for what you might call an inspiration but when it comes cap'en kemp when it comes ah you'll 'ave a sign then sich a sign you'll 'ave sich a sign as'll attract the 'ole artistic feelin' of wapping an' surroundin' districks of the metropolis i assure you an' the signs on the other 'ouses phoo mr cripps made a sweep of the hand which i took to indicate generally that all other publicans overwhelmed with humiliation would have no choice but straightway to tear down their own signs and bury them umph but meanwhile i haven't got one at all objected grandfather nat an' they have ah yes sir some sort o' signs but done by mere jobbers and poor enough too my hart cap'en kemp i respect my hart an' i don't rush at a job like that it wants conception sir a job like that conception the common sort o' sign's easy enough you go at it an' you do it or hexicute it an' when it's done or hexicuted why there it is a ship maybe or a crown or a turk's 'ed or three cats an' a fryin' pan simple enough no plannin' no composition no invention but a 'ole in a wall cap'en kemp it takes a hartist to make a picter o' that an' it takes study an' meditation an' invention simplest thing o' the lot said captain nat a wall an' a hole in it simplest thing o' the lot as you observe cap'en kemp it may seem simple enough that's because you're thinkin' o' subjick instead o' treatment a common jobber if you'll excuse my sayin' it 'ud look at it just in that light a wall with a 'ole in it an' 'e'd give it you an' p'rhaps you'd be satisfied with it but i soar 'igher sir 'igher what i shall give you'll be a 'ole in the wall to charm the heye and delight the intelleck sir a dramatic 'ole in the wall sir a hepic 'ole in the wall a 'ole in the wall as will elevate the mind and stimilate the noblest instinks of the be'older cap'en kemp i don't 'esitate to say that my 'ole in the wall when you get it will be ah it'll be the moral palladium of wapping when i get it my grandfather replied with a chuckle anything might happen without surprisin' me i think p'rhaps i might be so startled as to forget the bit you've had on account an' pay full cash mr cripps's eyes brightened at the hint you're always very 'andsome in matters o' business cap'en kemp he said an' i always say so which reminds me speakin' of 'andsome things this morning goin' to see my friend as keeps the mortuary i see as 'andsome a bit o' panel for to paint a sign as ever i come across a lovely bit o' stuff to be sure enough to stimulate anybody's artistic invention to look at it that it was not dear neither particular moderate in fact i'm afraid it may be gone now but if i'd 'a 'ad the money a noise of trampling and singing without neared the door and with a bang and a stagger a party of fresh customers burst in and swept mr cripps out of his exposition two were sun browned sailors shouting and jovial but the rest men and women sober and villainous in their mock jollity were land sharks plain to see the foremost sailor drove against mr cripps and having almost knocked him down took him by the shoulders and involved him in his flounderings apologising meanwhile at the top of his voice and demanding to know what mr cripps would drink whereupon grandfather nat sent me back to the bar parlour and the little ship and addressed himself to business and the order of the bar and so he was occupied for the most of the evening sometimes he sat with me and taught me the spars and rigging of the model sometimes i peeped through the glass at the business of the house the bar remained pretty full throughout the evening in its main part and my grandfather ruled its frequenters with a strong voice and an iron hand but there was one little space partitioned off as it might be for the better company which space was nearly always empty into this quieter compartment i saw a man come rather late in the evening furtive and a little flustered he was an ugly ruffian with a broken nose and he was noticeable as being the one man i had seen in my grandfather's house who had no marks of seafaring or riverside life about him but seemed merely an ordinary london blackguard from some unmaritime neighbourhood he beckoned silently to grandfather nat who walked across and conferred with him presently my grandfather left the counter and came into the bar parlour he had something in his closed hand which he carried to the lamp to examine so that i could see it was a silver watch while the furtive man waited expectantly in the little compartment the watch interested me for the inward part swung clean out from the case and hung by a single hinge in a way i had never seen before i noticed also that a large capital letter m was engraved on the back grandfather nat shut the watch and strode into the bar here you are he said aloud handing it to the broken nosed man here you are it seems all right good enough watch i should say the man was plainly disconcerted frightened indeed by this public observation and answered with an eager whisper what my grandfather replied louder than ever want me to buy it not me this ain't a pawnshop i don't want a watch an' if i did how do i know where you got it much discomposed by this rebuff the fellow hurried off whereupon i was surprised to see the pale man rise from the corner of the bar put his drink still untasted in a safe place on the counter beyond the edge of the partition and hurry out also cogitating this matter in my grandfather's arm chair presently i fell asleep what woke me at length was the loud voice of grandfather nat and i found that it was late and he was clearing the bar before shutting up i rubbed my eyes and looked out and was interested to see that the pale man had come back and was now swallowing his drink at last before going out after the rest whereat i turned again drowsily enough to the model ship but a little later when grandfather nat and i were at supper in the bar parlour and i was dropping to sleep again i was amazed to see my grandfather pull the broken nosed man's watch out of his pocket and put it in a tin cash box at that i rubbed my eyes and opened them so wide on the cash box that grandfather nat said hullo stevy woke up with a jump time you was in bed chapter v in the highway the hole in the wall being closed its customers went their several ways the sailors shouting and singing drifting off with their retinue along wapping wall toward ratcliff mr cripps fuller than usual of free drinks for the sailors had come a long voyage and were proportionally liberal scuffling off steadily enough on the way that led to limehouse for mr cripps had drunk too much and too long ever to be noticeably drunk and last of all when the most undecided of the stragglers from captain nat kemp's bar had vanished one way or another the pale quiet man moved out from the shadow and went in the wake of the noisy sailors the night was dark and the streets the lamps were few and feeble and angles alleys and entries were shapes of blackness that seemed more solid than the walls about them but instead of the silence that consorts with gloom the air was racked with human sounds sounds of quarrels scuffles and brawls far and near breaking out fitfully amid the general buzz and whoop of discordant singing that came from all wapping and ratcliff where revellers rolled into the open a stone's throw on the pale man's way was a swing bridge with a lock by its side spanning the channel that joined two dock basins the pale man passing along in the shadow of the footpath stopped in an angle three policemen were coming over the bridge in company they went in threes in these parts and the pale man who never made closer acquaintance with the police than he could help slunk down by the bridge foot as though designing to make the crossing by way of the narrow lock no safe passage in the dark but he thought better of it and went by the bridge as soon as the policemen had passed a little farther and he was in ratcliff highway where it joined with shadwell high street and just before him stood paddy's goose the house was known by that name far beyond the neighbourhood among people who were unaware that the actual painted sign was the white swan paddy's goose was still open for its doors never closed till one though there were a few houses later even than this where though the bars were cleared and closed at one in accordance with act of parliament the doors swung wide again ten minutes later there was still dancing within at paddy's goose and the squeak of fiddles and the thump of feet were plain to hear the pale man passed on into the dark beyond its lights and soon the black mouth of blue gate stood on his right blue gate gave its part to the night's noises and more for a sudden burst of loud screams a woman's rent the air from its innermost deeps screams which affected the pale man not at all nor any other passenger for it might be murder or it might be drink or sudden rage or fear or a quarrel and whatever it might be was common enough in blue gate paddy's goose had no monopoly of music and the common plenty of street fiddlers was the greater as the early houses closed scarce eighty yards from blue gate stood blind george fiddling his hardest for a party dancing in the roadway many were looking on drunk or sober with approving shouts and every face was ghastly phosphorescent in the glare of a ship's blue light that a noisy negro flourished among the dancers close by a woman and a man were quarrelling in the middle of a group but the matter had no attention till of a sudden it sprang into a fight and the man and another were punching and wrestling in a heap bare to the waist at this the crowd turned from the dancers and the negro ran yelping to shed his deathly light on the new scene the crowd howled and scrambled and a drunken sailor fell in the mud quick at the chance a ruffian took him under the armpits and dragged him from among the trampling feet to a near entry out of the glare there he propped his prey with many friendly words and dived among his pockets the sailor was dazed and made no difficulty till the thief got to the end of the search in a trouser pocket and thence pulled a handful of silver with that the victim awoke to some sense of affairs and made a move to rise but the other sprang up and laid him over with a kick on the head just as the pale man came along the thief made off leaving a few shillings and sixpences on the ground which the pale man instantly gathered up he looked from the money to the man who lay insensible with blood about his ear and then from the man to the money then he stuffed some few of the shillings into the sailor's nearest pocket and went off with the rest the fight rose and fell the crowd grew and the blue light burned down in twenty seconds the pale man was back again he bent over the bleeding sailor thrust the rest of the silver into the pocket and finally vanished into the night for indeed though the pale man was poor and though he got a living now in a way scarce reputable yet he had once kept a chandler's shop he had kept it till neither sand in the sugar nor holes under the weights would any longer induce it to keep him and then he had fallen wholly from respectability but he had drawn a line he had always drawn a line he had never been a thief and with a little struggle he remembered it now back in blue gate the screams had ceased for on a black stair a large bony man shook a woman by the throat so that she could scream no more he cursed in whispers and threatened her with an end of all noise if she opened her mouth again ye stop out of it all this time he said an' when ye come ye squall enough to bring the slops from arbour square o o the woman gasped i fell on it dan i fell on it i fell on it in the dark there was nothing commoner in the black streets about the highway than the sight of two or three men linked by the arms staggering singing and bawling many such parties went along the highway that night many turned up its foul tributaries some went toward and over the bridge by the lock that was on the way to the hole in the wall but they were become fewer and the night noises of the highway were somewhat abated when a party of three emerged from the mouth of blue gate of them that had gone before the songs were broken and the voices unmelodious enough yet no other song sung that night in the highway was so wild as the song of these men or rather of two of them who sang the louder because of the silence of the man between them and no other voices were so ill governed as theirs the man on the right was large bony and powerful he on the left was shorter and less to be noticed except that under some rare and feeble lamp it might have been perceived that his face was an ugly one with a broken nose but what reveller so drunk what drunkard so insensible what clod so silent as the man they dragged between them his feet trailed in the mire and his head hidden by a ragged hat hung forward on his chest so they went reeling ever where the shadows were thickest toward the bridge but in all their reelings there was a stealthy hasting forward and an anxious outlook that went ill with their song the song itself void alike of tune and jollity fell off altogether as they neared the bridge and here they went the quicker they turned down by the bridge foot though not for the reason the pale man had two hours before for now no policeman was in sight and soon were gone into the black shadow about the lock head it was the deep of the night and as near quiet as the highway ever knew with no more than a cry here or there a distant fiddle and the faint hum of the wind in the rigging of ships off in blue gate the woman sat on the black stair with her face in her hands waiting for company before returning to the room where she had fallen over something in the dark chapter vi stephen's tale high under the tiles of the hole in the wall i had at first a night of disturbed sleep i was in my old familiar cot which had been brought during the evening on a truck but things were strange and in particular my grandfather who slept on the opposite side of the room snored so amazingly and with a sound so unlike anything i had ever heard before that i feared he must be choking to death and climbed out of bed once to see there were noises from without too sometimes of discordant singing sometimes of quarrels and once from a distance a succession of dreadful screams then the old house made curious sounds of its own twice i was convinced of stealthy steps on the stair and all night the very walls creaked aloud so for long sleepy as i was i dozed and started and rolled and lay awake wondering about the little ship in the bar parlour and mr cripps and the pale man and the watch with the m on it also i considered again the matter of my prayers which i had already discussed with grandfather nat to his obvious perplexity by candle light for i was urgent to know if i must now leave my mother out and if i might not put my little dead brother in being very anxious to include them both my grandfather's first opinion was that it was not the usual thing which opinion he expressed with hesitation and a curious look of the eyes that i wondered at but i argued that god could bless them just as well in heaven as here and grandfather nat admitted that no doubt there was something in that whereupon i desired to know if they would hear if i said in my prayers that i was quite safe with him at the hole in the wall or if i should rather ask god to tell them and at that my grandfather stood up and turned away with a rub and a pat on my head toward his own bed telling me to say whatever i pleased and not to forget grandfather nat so that now having said what i pleased and having well remembered grandfather nat and slept and woke and dozed and woke again i took solace from his authority and whispered many things to my little dead brother whom i could never play with of the little ship in the glass case and the pictures and of how i was going to the london dock to morrow and so at last fell asleep soundly till morning grandfather nat was astir early and soon i was looking from the window by his bed at the ships that lay so thick in the pool tier on tier below me i could see the water that washed between the slimy piles on which the house rested and to the left were the narrow stairs that terminated the passage at the side several boats were moored about these stairs and a waterman was already looking out for a fare out in the pool certain other boats caught the eye as they dodged about among the colliers because each carried a bright fire amidships in a brazier beside a man two small barrels of beer and a very large handbell the men were purlmen grandfather nat told me selling liquor hot beer chiefly in the cold mornings to the men on the colliers or on any other craft thereabout it struck me that the one thing lacking for perfect bliss in most rowing boats was just such a brazier of cosy fire as the purl boat carried so that after very little consideration i resolved that when i grew up i would not be a sailor nor an engine driver nor any one of a dozen other things i had thought of but a purlman the staircase would have landed one direct into the bar parlour but for an enclosing door which strangers commonly mistook for that of a cupboard a step as light as mine was possibly a rarity on this staircase for coming down before my grandfather i startled a lady in the bar parlour who had been doing something with a bottle which involved the removal of the cork which cork she snatched hastily from a shelf and replaced with no very favourable regard to myself and straightway dropped on her knees and went to work with a brush and a dustpan she was scarce an attractive woman i thought being rusty and bony slack faced and very red nosed she swept the carpet and dusted the shelves with an air of angry contempt for everything she touched and i got into the bar out of her way as soon as i could the potman was flinging sawdust about the floor and there in the same corner sat the same pale ragged man that was there last night with the same full glass of liquor or one like it by his side like a trade fixture that had been there all night when grandfather nat appeared i learned the slack faced woman's name this here's my little gran'son mrs grimes he said as is goin' to live here a bit 'cordin' as i mentioned yesterday hindeed said mrs grimes with a glance that made me feel more contemptible than the humblest article she had dusted that morning hindeed then it'll be more work more pay cap'en kemp very well mum my grandfather replied if you reckon it out more work ho interjected mrs grimes who could fill a misplaced aspirate with subtle offence reckon or not i s'pose there's another bed to be made an' buttons to be sewed an' plates for to be washed an' dirt an' litter for to be cleared up everywhere to say nothink o' crumbs which the biscuit crumbs in the bar parlour this mornin' was thick an' shameful i had had biscuits and i felt a reprobate very well mum grandfather nat said peaceably we'll make out extry damages mum a few days'll give us an idea shall we leave it a week an' see how things go ham i to consider that a week's notice captain kemp mrs grimes demanded with a distinct rise of voice ham i or ham i not notice my grandfather was puzzled and began to look a trifle angry why damme who said notice what because notice is as easy give as took cap'en kemp as i'd 'ave you remember an' slave i may be though better brought up than slave drivers any day but swore at vulgar i won't be nor trampled like dirt an' litter beneath the feet an' will not endure it neither and with a great toss of the head mrs grimes flounced through the staircase door and sniffed and bridled her way to the upper rooms her exit relieved my mind first because i had a wretched consciousness that i was causing all the trouble and a dire fear that grandfather nat might dislike me for it and second because when he looked angry i had a fearful foreboding vision of mrs grimes being presently whirled round by the ear and flung into the street as jim crute had been but it was not long ere i learned that mrs grimes was one of those persons who grumble and clamour and bully at everything and everybody on principle finding that with a concession here and another there it pays very well on the whole and so nag along very comfortably through life as for herself as i had seen mrs grimes did not lack the cunning to carry away any fit of virtuous indignation that seemed like to push her employer out of his patience my grandfather looked at the bottle that mrs grimes had recorked that rum shrub he said ain't properly mixed it works in the bottle when it's left standing an' mounts to the cork i notice it almost every morning the day was bright and i resigned myself with some impatience to wait for an hour or two till we could set out for the docks it was a matter of business my grandfather explained that he must not leave the bar till a fixed hour ten o'clock and soon i began to make a dim guess at the nature of the business though i guessed in all innocence and suspected not at all contrary to my evening observation at this early hour the larger bar was mostly empty while the obscure compartment at the side was in far greater use than it had been last night four or five visitors must have come there one after another perhaps half a dozen and they all had things to sell two had watches one of them was a woman one had a locket and a boatswain's silver call and i think another had some silver spoons grandfather nat brought each article into the bar parlour to examine and then returned it to its owner which behaviour seemed to surprise none of them as it had surprised the man last night so that doubtless he was a stranger to those with watches my grandfather said nothing but yes that seems all right or yes it's a good enough watch no doubt but to the man with the locket and the silver call he said well if ever you want to sell 'em you might get eight bob no more and much the same to him with the spoons except that he thought the spoons might fetch fifteen shillings each of the visitors went out with no more ado and as each went the pale man in the larger bar rose put his drink safely on the counter just beyond the partition and went out too and presently he came back with no more than a glance at grandfather nat took his drink and sat down again at ten o'clock my grandfather looked out of the bar and said to the pale man all right drink up whereupon the pale man who would have been paler if his face had been washed swallowed his drink at last flat as it must have been and went out and grandfather nat went out also by the door into the passage he was gone scarce two minutes and when he returned he unlocked a drawer below the shelf on which the little ship stood and took from it the cash box i had seen last night his back was turned toward me and himself was interposed between my eyes and the box which he rested on the shelf but i heard a jingling that suggested spoons so i said did the man go to buy the spoons for you gran'fa' nat my grandfather looked round sharply with something as near a frown as he ever directed on me then he locked the box away hastily with a gruff laugh you won't starve stevy he said as long as wits finds victuals but see here he went on becoming grave as he sat and drew me to his knee see here stevy what you see here's my business private business understand you ain't a tell tale are you not a sneak i repudiated the suggestion with pain and scorn for i was at least old enough a boy to see in sneakery the blackest of crimes no no that you ain't i know grandfather nat went on with a pinch of my chin though he still regarded me earnestly a plucked 'un's never a sneak but there's one thing for you to remember stevy afore all your readin' an' writin' an' lessons an' what not you must never tell of anything you see here not to a soul that is not about me buyin' things i'm very careful but things don't always go right an' i might get in trouble i'm a straight man an' i pay for all i have in any line o' trade i never stole nor cheated not so much as a farden all my life nor ever bought anything as i knew was stole see i nodded gravely i was trying hard to understand the reason for all this seriousness and secrecy but at any rate i was resolved to be no tale bearer especially against grandfather nat why he went on justifying himself i fancy more for his own satisfaction than for my information why even when it's on'y just suspicious i won't buy except o' course through another party that's how i guard myself stevy an' every man has a right to buy a thing reasonable an' sell at a profit if he can that's on'y plain trade an' yet nobody can't say truthful as he ever sold me anything over that there counter or anywhere else barrin' what i have reg'lar of the brewer an' what not i may look at a thing or pass an opinion but what's that nothin' at all but we've got to keep our mouths shut stevy for fear o' danger see you wouldn't like poor old grandfather nat to be put in gaol would ye the prospect was terrible and i put my hands about my grandfather's neck and vowed i would never whisper a word that's right stevy the old man answered i know you won't if you don't forget yourself so don't do that don't take no notice not even to me there was a knock at the back door which opened and disclosed one of the purlmen who had left his boat in sight at the stairs and wanted a quart of gin in the large tin can he brought with him he was a short red faced tough looking fellow and he needed the gin as i soon learned to mix with his hot beer to make the purl he had a short conversation with my grandfather when the gin was brought of which i heard no more than the words high water at twelve but as he went down the passage he turned and sang out you got the news cap'en o' course what viney and marr the man nodded with a click and a twitch of the mouth then he snapped his fingers and jerked them expressively upward after which he ejaculated the single word marr and jerked his thumb over his shoulder by which i understood him to repeat with no waste of language the story that it was all up with the firm and the junior partner had bolted that said grandfather nat when the man was gone that's bill stagg an' he's the on'y purlman as don't come ashore to sleep sleeps in his boat winter an' summer does bill stagg how'd you like that stevy i thought i should catch cold and perhaps tumble overboard if i had a bad dream and i said so ah well bill stagg don't mind he was ab aboard o' me when mr viney was my mate many years ago an' a good ab too bill stagg he makes fast somewhere quiet at night an' curls up snug as a weevil mostly under the piles o' this here house when the wind ain't east saves him rent ye see so he does pretty well and with that my grandfather put on his coat and reached the pilot cap that was his everyday wear chapter vii stephen's tale we walked first to the head of the stairs where opened a wide picture of the thames and all its traffic and where the walls were plastered with a dozen little bills each headed found drowned and each with the tale of some nameless corpse under the heading that's my boat stevy said my grandfather pointing to a little dinghy with a pair of sculls in her our boat if you like seeing as we're pardners now you shall do which you like walk along to the dock where the sugar is or come out in our boat it was a hard choice to make the glory and delight of the part ownership of a real boat dazzled me like another sun in the sky but i had promised myself the docks and the sugar for such a long time so we compromised the docks to day and the boat to morrow out in the street everybody seemed to know grandfather nat those who spoke with him commonly called him captain kemp except a few old acquaintances to whom he was captain nat loafers and crimps gazed after him and nodded together and small ship chandlers gave him good morning from their shop doors a hundred yards from the hole in the wall at a turn there was a swing bridge and a lock such as we had by the old house in blackwall at the moment we came in hail the men were at the winch and the bridge began to part in the middle for a ship was about to change berth to the inner dock come stevy said my grandfather we'll take the lock 'fore they open that not afraid if i'm with you are you no i was not afraid with grandfather nat and would not even be carried though the top of the lock was not two feet wide and was knotted broken and treacherous in surface and wholly unguarded on one side where one looked plump down into the foul dock water and though on the other side there was but a slack chain strung through loose iron stanchions that staggered in their sockets grandfather nat gripped me by the collar and walked me before him but relief tempered my triumph when i was safe across my feet never seemed to have twisted and slipped and stumbled so much before in so short a distance perhaps because in that same distance i had never before recollected so many tales of men drowned in the docks by falling off just such locks in fog or by accidental slips a little farther along and we came upon ratcliff highway i saw the street then for the first time and in truth it was very wonderful i think there could never have been another street in this country at once so foul and so picturesque as ratcliff highway at the time i speak of much that i saw i could not understand child as i was and by so much the more was i pleased with it all when perhaps i should have been shocked from end to end of the highway and beyond and through all its tributaries and purlieus everything and everybody was for by and of the sailor ashore every house and shop was devoted to his convenience and inconvenience in the highway it seemed to me that every other house was a tavern and in several places two stood together there were shops full of slops sou'westers pilot coats sea boots tin pannikins and canvas kit bags like giants' bolsters and rows of big knives and daggers often engraved with suggestive maxims a flash of memory recalls the favourite never draw me without cause never sheathe me without honour i have since seen the words cause and honour put to uses less respectable the pawn shops had nothing in them that had not come straight from a ship sextants and boatswain's pipes being the choice of the stock and pawn shops slop shops tobacco shops every shop almost had somewhere in its window a selection of those curiosities that sailors make abroad and bring home little ship models mysteriously erected inside bottles shells albatross heads saw fish snouts and bottles full of sand of different colours ingeniously packed so as to present a figure or a picture when viewed from without men of a dozen nations were coming or going in every score of yards the best dressed and the worst were the negroes for the black cook who was flush went in for adornments that no other sailor man would have dreamed of a white shirt a flaming tie a black coat with satin facings even a white waistcoat and a top hat while the cleaned out and shipless nigger was a sad spectacle indeed then there were spaniards swart long haired bloodshot looking fellows whose entire shore outfit consisted commonly of a red shirt blue trousers anklejacks with the brown feet visible over them a belt a big knife and a pair of large gold ear rings big yellow haired blue eyed swedes who were full pink with sea and sun and not brown or mahogany coloured like the rest slight wicked looking malays lean spitting yankees with stripes and felt hats and sing song oaths sometimes a chinaman petticoated dignified jeered at a lascar a greek a russian and everywhere the english jack rolling of gait sometimes from habit alone sometimes for mixed reasons hard red necked waistcoatless with his knife at his belt like the rest but more commonly a clasp knife than one in a sheath to me all these strangely bedight men were matter of delight and wonder and i guessed my hardest whence each had come last what he had brought in his ship and what strange and desperate adventures he had encountered on the way and wherever i saw bare hairy skin whether an arm or the chest under an open shirt there were blue devices of ships of flags of women of letters and names grandfather nat was tattooed like that as i had discovered in the morning when he washed he had been a fool to have it done he said as he flung the soapy water out of window into the river and he warned me that i must be careful never to make such a mistake myself which made me sorry because it seemed so gallant an embellishment but my grandfather explained that you could be identified by tattoo marks at any length of time which might cause trouble i remembered that my own father was tattooed with an anchor and my mother's name and i hoped he would never be identified if it were as bad as that in the street oyster stalls stood and baked potato cans one or two sailors were buying and one or two fiddlers but mostly the customers were the gaudy women who seemed to make a late breakfast in this way some had not stayed to perform a greater toilet than to fling clothes on themselves unhooked and awry and to make a straggling knot of their hair but the most were brilliant enough in violet or scarlet or blue with hair oiled and crimped and hung in thick nets and with bright handkerchiefs over their shoulders belcher yellows and kingsmen and blue billies and presently we came on one who was dancing with a sailor on the pavement to the music of one of the many fiddlers who picked up a living hereabouts and she wore the regular dancing rig of the highway short skirts and high red morocco boots with brass heels she covered the buckle and grape vined with great precision too a contrast with her partner whose hornpipe was unsteady and vague in the figures for indeed he seemed to have begun early perhaps had not left off all night two more pairs of these red morocco boots we saw at a place next a public house where a shop front had been cleared out to make a dancing room with a sort of buttery hatch communicating with the tavern and where a flushed sailor now stood with a pot in each hand roaring for a fiddler but if the life and the picturesqueness of the highway in some sort disguised its squalor they made the more hideously apparent the abomination of the by streets which opened filthy and menacing at every fifty yards as we went the light seemed greyer the very air thicker and fouler in these passages though indeed they formed the residential part whereof the highway was the market place the children who ran and tumbled in these places the boy of nine equally with the infant crawling from doorstep to gutter were half naked shoeless and disguised in crusted foulness so that i remember them with a certain sickening even in these latter days when i see no such pitiably neglected little wretches though i know the dark parts of london well enough at the mouth of one of these narrow streets almost at the beginning of the highway grandfather nat stopped and pointed it was a forbidding lane with forbidding men and women hanging about the entrance and far up toward the end there appeared to be a crowd and a fight in the midst whereof a half naked man seemed to be rushing from side to side of the street that's the blue gate said my grandfather and resumed his walk it's dangerous he went on the worst place hereabout perhaps anywhere wuss'n tiger bay a mile you must never go near blue gate people get murdered there stevy murdered many's a man sailor men mostly an' nobody never knows pitch them in the dock sometimes sometimes in the river so's they're washed away i've known 'em taken to hole in the wall stairs at night i gripped my grandfather's hand tighter and asked in all innocence if we should see any if we kept watch out of window that night he laughed thought the chance scarce worth a sleepless night and went on to tell me of something else but i overheard later in a bar conversation a ghastly tale of years before of a murdered man's body that had been dragged dripping through the streets at night by two men who supported its arms staggering and shouting and singing as though the three were merely drunk and how it was dropped in panic ere it was brought to the waterside because of a collision with three live sailors who really were drunk one or two crimps' carts came through from the docks as we walked drawn by sorry animals and piled high with shouting sailors and their belongings chief among these the giant bolster bags the victims went to their fate gloriously enough hailing and chaffing the populace on the way and singing each man as he list also we saw a shop with a window full of parrots and monkeys and a very sick kangaroo in a wooden cage being carried in from a van and so we came to the london dock at last and there in the sugar sheds stood more sugar than ever i had dreamed of in my wildest visions thousands of barrels mountains of sacks and so many of the bags were rat bitten or had got a slit by accidentally running up against a jack knife and so many of the barrels were defective or had stove themselves by perverse complications with a crowbar that the heavy brown moist stuff was lying in heaps and lumps everywhere and i supposed that it must be called foot sugar because you couldn't help treading on it it was while i was absorbed in this delectable spectacle that i heard a strained little voice behind me and turned to behold mr cripps greeting my grandfather good mornin' cap'en kemp sir said mr cripps i been a lookin' at the noo blue crosser the emily riggs she ought to be done ye know an' a han'some picter she'd make but the skipper seems busy why an' there's young master stephen i do declare 'ow are ye sir as he bent and the nose neared i was seized with a horrid fear that he was going to kiss me but he only shook hands after all though it was not at all a clean hand that he gave why cap'en kemp he went on this is what i say a phenomenal coincidence rather unique in fact why you'll 'ardly believe as i was a thinkin' o' you not 'arf an hour ago scarcely now you wouldn't 'a' thought that would ye there was a twinkle in grandfather nat's eye all depends he said comin' along from the mortuary i see somethink ah something in the mortuary no doubt my grandfather interrupted quizzically well what was in the mortuary i bet there was a corpse in the mortuary quite correct cap'en kemp so there was three of 'em an' a very sad sight decimated cap'en kemp by the watery element but it wasn't them i was what it wasn't a corpse as reminded you of me that's rum then i expect somebody told you some more about viney and marr come what's the latest about viney an' marr tell us about that grandfather nat was humorously bent on driving mr cripps from his mark and mr cripps deferred well it's certainly a topic he said a universal topic crooks the ship chandler's done for they say unsolvent the minerva's reported off prawle point in to day's list an' they say as she'll be sold up as soon as she's moored but there she's hypotenused cap'en kemp pawned as you might say up the flue it's a matter o' gen'ral information that she's pawned up to 'er r'yals up to 'er main r'yals sir which reminds me speakin' o' r'yals there's a timber shop just along by the mortuary ah no doubt grandfather nat interrupted they must put 'em somewhere any news o' the juno no sir she ain't reported not doo barbadoes yet or mail not in any'ow they'll sell 'er too but the creditors won't get none of it she's hypotenused as deep as the other up to her r'yals an' there's nothin' else to sell so it's the gen'ral opinion there won't be much to divide marr 'avin' absconded with the proceeds an' as regards what i was agoin' to yes you was goin' to tell me some more about marr i expect my grandfather persisted heard where he's gone mr cripps shook his head they don't seem likely to ketch 'im cap'en nat some says 'e's absconded out o' the country others says 'e's 'idin' in it nobody knows 'im much consequence o' viney doin' all the outdoor business i on'y see 'im once myself viney 'e thinks 'e's gone abroad they say an' 'e swears marr's the party as 'as caused the unsolvency 'avin' bin a doin' of 'im all along 'im bein' in charge o' the books an' it's a fact cap'en kemp as you never know what them chaps may get up to with the proceeds as 'as charge o' books the paper's full of 'em every week always absconding with somebody's proceeds an' by the way speakin' o' proceeds this time captain nat made no interruption but listened with an amused resignation speakin' o' proceeds said mr cripps it was bein' temp'ry out o' proceeds as made me think o' you as i come along from the mortuary for i see as 'andsome a bit o' panel for to paint a sign on as ever i come across it was yes i know enough to stimilate you to paint it fine only to look at it wasn't it well yes cap'n kemp so it was not dear neither no not to say dear seein' 'ow prices is up if i'd 'ad well well p'raps prices'll be down a bit soon said grandfather nat grinning and pulling out a sixpence i ain't good for no more than that now anyhow and having passed over the coin he took my hand and turned away laughing and shaking his head seeing that my grandfather wanted his sign it seemed to me that he was losing an opportunity and i said so what he said let him buy the board why he's had half a dozen boards for that sign a'ready half a dozen i said six boards what did he do with them ate 'em said grandfather nat and laughed the louder when i stared chapter viii stephen's tale i found it quite true that one might eat the loose sugar wherever he judged it clean enough as most of it was and nothing but grandfather nat's restraining hand postponed my first bilious attack thus it was that i made acquaintance with the highway and with the london docks in their more picturesque days and saw and delighted in a thousand things more than i can write port was drunk then and hundreds of great pipes lay in rows on a wide quay where men walked with wooden clubs whacking each pipe till the shive or wooden bung sprang into the air to be caught with a dexterity that pleased me like a conjuring trick and many a thirsty dock labourer watching his opportunity would cut a strip of bread from his humble dinner as he strolled near a pipe and absorbed in the contemplation of the indefinite empyrean absently dip his sippet into the shive hole as he passed recovering it in a state so wet and discoloured that its instant consumption was imperative and so at last we came away from the docks by the thoroughfare then called tanglefoot lane not that that name or anything like it was painted at the corner but because it was the road commonly taken by visitors departing from the wine vaults after bringing tasting orders as we passed blue gate on our way home i saw among those standing at the corner a coarse faced untidy woman talking to a big bony looking man with a face so thin and mean that it seemed misplaced on such shoulders the woman was so much like a score of others then in sight that i should scarce have noted her were it not that she and the man stopped their talk as we passed with a quick look first at my grandfather and then one at the other and then the man turned his back and walked away presently the woman came after us walking quickly glancing doubtfully at grandfather nat as she passed and at last after twice looking back she turned and waited for us to come up beg pardon cap'en kemp she said in a low but a very thick voice but might i speak to you a moment sir my grandfather looked at her sharply well he said what is it in regards to a man as sold you a watch las' night no grandfather nat interrupted with angry decision he didn't beg pardon sir jesso sir 'course not which i mean to say 'e sold it to a man near to your 'ouse is it brought true as that party not meanin' you sir 'course not but the party in the street near your 'ouse is it brought true as that party'll buy somethink more somethink as i needn't tell now sir p'raps but somethink spoke of between that party an' the other party i mean the party as sold it an' don't mean you sir 'course not it was plain that the woman who had begun in trepidation was confused and abashed the more by the hard frown with which captain nat regarded her the frown persisted for some moments and then my grandfather said don't know what you mean if somebody bought anything of a friend o' yours an' your friend wants to sell him something else i suppose he can take it to him can't he and if it's any value there's no reason he shouldn't buy it so far as i know and grandfather nat strode on the woman murmured some sort of acknowledgment and fell back and in a moment i had forgotten her though i remembered her afterward for good reason enough in fact it was no later than that evening i was sitting in the bar parlour with grandfather nat who had left the bar to the care of the potman my grandfather was smoking his pipe while i spelled and sought down the narrow columns of lloyd's list for news of my father's ship it was my grandfather's way to excuse himself from reading when he could on the plea of unsuitable eyes though i suspect that apart from his sight he found reading a greater trouble than he was pleased to own there's nothing here about the juno grandfather nat i said nothing anywhere ah said my grandfather la guaira was the last port an' we must keep eyes on the list for barbadoes maybe the mail's late most of lloyd's messages came by mail at that time let's see he went on belize la guaira barbadoes and straightway began to figure out distances and chances of wind grandfather nat had been considering whether or not we should write to my father to tell him that my mother was dead and he judged that there was little chance of any letter reaching the juno on her homeward passage belize la guaira barbadoes said grandfather nat musingly it's the rough reason thereabout an' it's odds she may be blown out of her course but the mail he stopped and turned his head there was a sudden stamp of feet outside the door behind us a low and quick voice a heavy thud against the door and then a cry a dreadful cry that began like a stifled scream and ended with a gurgle grandfather nat reached the door at a bound and as he flung it wide a man came with it and sank heavily at his feet head and one shoulder over the threshold and an arm flung out stiffly so that the old man stumbled across it as he dashed at a dark shadow without i was hard at my grandfather's heels and in a flash of time i saw that another man was rising from over the one on the doorsill but for the stumble grandfather nat would have had him in that moment's check the fellow spun round and dashed off striking one of the great posts with his shoulder and nearly going down with the shock all was dark without and what i saw was merely confused by the light from the bar parlour my grandfather raised a shout and rushed in the wake of the fugitive toward the stairs and i too startled and too excited to be frightened yet skipped over the stiff arm to follow him at the first step i trod on some object which i took to be my grandfather's tobacco pouch snatched it up and stuffed it in my jacket pocket as i ran several men from the bar were running in the passage and down the stairs i could hear captain nat hallooing across the river ahoy came a voice in reply what's up and i could see the fire of a purl boat coming in stop him bill my grandfather shouted stop him stabbed a man he's got my boat and there's no sculls in this damned thing gone round them barges and now i could distinguish my grandfather in a boat paddling desperately with a stretcher his face and his shirt sleeves touched with the light from the purl man's fire the purl boat swung round and shot off and presently other boats came pulling by with shouts and questions then i saw grandfather nat a black form merely climbing on a barge and running and skipping along the tier from one barge to another calling and directing till i could see him no more there were many men on the stairs by this time and others came running and jostling so i made my way back to the bar parlour door it was no easy thing to get in here for a crowd was gathering but a man from the bar who recognised me made a way and as soon as i had pushed through the crowd of men's legs i saw that the injured man was lying on the floor tended by the potman while mr cripps his face pallid under the dirt and his nose a deadly lavender stood by with his mouth open and his hands dangling aimlessly the stabbed man lay with his head on a rolled up coat of my grandfather's and he was bad for a child to look at his face had gone tallowy his eyes which turned and frightened me as i came in were now directed steadily upward he breathed low and quick and though joe the potman pressed cloths to the wound in his chest there was blood about his lips and chin and blood bubbled dreadfully in his mouth but what startled me most and what fixed my regard on his face despite my tremors so that i could scarce take my eyes from it was the fact that paleness and blood and drawn cheeks notwithstanding i saw in him the ugly broken nosed fellow who had been in the private compartment last night with a watch to sell the watch with an initial on the back that now lay in grandfather nat's cash box chapter ix stephen's tale somebody had gone for a doctor it was said but a doctor was not always easy to find in wapping mrs grimes who was at some late work upstairs was not disturbed at first by the noise since excitement was not uncommon in the neighbourhood but now she came to the stairfoot door and peeped and hurried back for myself i squeezed into a far corner and stared a little sick for there was a deal of blood and joe the potman was all dabbled like a slaughterman my grandfather returned almost on the doctor's heels and with my grandfather were some river police in glazed hats and pilot coats the doctor puffed and shook his head called for cold water and cloths and turpentine and milk cold water and cloths were ready enough and turpentine was easy to get but ere the milk came it was useless the doctor shook his head and puffed more than ever wiped his hands and pulled his cuffs down gingerly i could not see the man on the floor now for the doctor was in the way but i heard him just before the doctor stood up the noise sent my neck cold at the back though indeed it was scarce more than the noise made in emptying a large bottle by up ending it the doctor stood up and shook his head gone he said and i couldn't have done more than keep him alive a few minutes at best it was the lung and bad two places have they got the man no said grandfather nat nor ain't very likely i'd say never saw him again once he got behind a tier o' lighters waterside chap certain knows the river well enough an' these stairs i couldn't ha' got that boat o' mine off quicker not myself ah said one of the river policemen he's a waterside chap that's plain enough any other 'ud a bolted up the street never said nothing did he this one he was bending over the dead man while the others cleared the people back from the door and squeezed mr cripps out among them no not a word answered joe the potman couldn't tried to nod once when i spoke to 'im but it seemed to make 'im bleed faster know him cap'en nat asked the sergeant no answered my grandfather i don't know him might ha' seen him hanging about p'raps but then i see a lot doin' that i wondered if grandfather nat had already forgotten about the silver watch with the m on it or if he had merely failed to recognise the man but i remembered what he had said in the morning after he had bought the spoons and i reflected that i had best hold my tongue and now voices without made it known that the shore police were here with a stretcher and presently with a crowding and squeezing in the little bar parlour that drove me deeper into my corner and farther under the shelf the uncomely figure was got from the floor to the stretcher and so out of the house it was plain that my grandfather was held in good regard by the police and i think that his hint that a drop of brandy was at the service of anybody who felt the job unpleasant might have been acted on if there had not been quite as many present at once when at last they were gone and the room clear he kicked into a heap the strip of carpet that the dead man had lain on and as he did it he perceived me in my corner what you here all the time stevy he said i thought you'd gone upstairs here it ain't right for boys in general but you've got a turn drink up this i believe i must have been pale and indeed i felt a little sick now that the excitement was over the thing had been very near and the blood tainted the very air so that i gulped the weak brandy and water without much difficulty and felt better out in the bar mr cripps's thin voice was raised in thrilling description feeling better as i have said and no longer faced with the melancholy alternatives of crying or being ill i bethought me of my grandfather's tobacco pouch you dropped your pouch gran'father nat i said and i picked it up when i ran out and with that i pulled out of my jacket pocket not the pouch at all but a stout buckled pocket book of about the same size that ain't a pouch stevy said grandfather nat an' mine's here in my pocket show me he opened the flap and stood for a moment staring then he looked up hastily turned his back to the bar and sat down whew stevy he said with amazement in his eyes and the pocket book open in his hand you're in luck luck my boy see once more he glanced quickly over his shoulder toward the bar and then took in his fingers a folded bunch of paper and opened it notes he said in a low voice drawing me to his side bank of england notes every one of 'em fifties an' twenties an' tens an' fives where was it i told him how i had run out at his heels had trodden on the thing in the dark and had slipped it into my pocket supposing it to be his old leather tobacco pouch from which he had but just refilled his pipe and how i had forgotten about it in my excitement till the people were gone and the brandy had quelled my faintness well well commented grandfather nat it's a wonderful bit o' luck anyhow this is what the chap was pulling away from him when i opened the door you can lay to that an' he lost it when he hit the post i'll wager unless the other pitched it away but that's neither here nor there what's that he turned his head quickly that stairfoot door ain't latched again stevy made me jump fancied it was the other there was nothing else in the pocket book it would seem except an old photograph it was a faded yellowish thing and it represented a rather stout woman seated with a boy of about fourteen at her side both very respectably dressed in the fashion of twenty years earlier grandfather nat put it back and slipped the pocket book into the same cash box that had held the watch with the m engraved on its back the stairfoot door clicked again and my grandfather sent me to shut it as i did so i almost fancied i could hear soft footsteps ascending but then i concluded i was mistaken for in a few moments mrs grimes was plainly heard coming downstairs with an uncommonly full tread and presently she presented herself good law cap'en kemp exclaimed mrs grimes with a hand clutching at her chest and her breath a tumultuous sigh good law i am that bad what with extry work an' keepin' on late an' murders under my very nose i cannot a bear it no and she sank into a chair by the stairfoot door letting go her brush and dustpan with a clatter grandfather nat turned to get the brandy bottle again mrs grimes's head drooped faintly and her eyelids nearly closed nevertheless i observed that the eyes under the lids were very sharp indeed following my grandfather's back and traversing the shelf where he had left the photograph yet when he brought the brandy he had to rouse her by a shake chapter x stephen's tale i went to bed early that night as soon as mrs grimes was gone in fact my grandfather had resolved that such a late upsitting as last night's must be no more than an indulgence once in a way he came up with me bringing the cash box to put away in the little wall cupboard against his bed head where it always lay at night with a pistol by its side grandfather nat peeped to see the pocket book safe once more and chuckled as he locked it away this done he sat by my side and talked till i began to fall asleep the talk was of the pocket book and what should be done with the money eight hundred pounds was the sum and two five pound notes over and i wondered why a man with so much money should come the evening before to sell his watch looks as though the money wasn't his don't it commented grandfather nat though anyhow it's no good to him now you found it an' it's yours stevy i remembered certain lessons of my mother's as to one's proper behaviour toward lost property and i mentioned them but grandfather nat clearly resolved me that this was no case in point it can't be his because he's dead captain nat argued an' if it's the other chap's well let him come an' ask for it that's fair enough you know stevy an' if he don't come it ain't likely he will is it then it's yours and i'll keep it to help start you in life when you grow up i won't pay it into the bank not for a bit anyhow there's numbers on bank notes an' they lead to trouble often but they're as good one time as another an' easy sent abroad later on or what not so there you are my boy eight hundred odd to start you like a gentleman with as much more as grandfather nat can put to it eh he kissed me and rubbed his hands in my curls and i took the occasion to communicate my decision as to being a purlman grandfather nat laughed and patted my head down on the pillow and for a little i remembered no more i awoke in an agony of nightmare the dead man with blood streaming from mouth and eyes was dragging my grandfather down into the river and my mother with my little dead brother in her arms called me to throw out the pocket book and save him and throw i could not for the thing seemed glued to my fingers so i awoke with a choke and a cry and sat up in bed all was quiet about me and below were the common evening noises of the tavern laughs argumentation and the gurgle of drawn beer though there was less noise now than when i had come up and i judged it not far from closing time out in the street a woman was singing a ballad and i got out of bed and went to the front room window to see and to hear for indeed i was out of sorts and nervous and wished to look at people at the corner of the passage there was a small group who pointed and talked together plainly discussing the murder and as one or two drifted away so one or two more came up to join those remaining no doubt the singing woman had taken this pitch as one suitable to her ware for she sang and fluttered at length in her hand one of the versified last dying confessions that even so late as this were hawked about ratcliff and wapping what murderer's confession the woman was singing i have clean forgotten but they were all the same all set to a doleful tune which with modifications still does duty i believe as an evening hymn and the burden ran thus for every murderer and any murder take warning by my dreadful fate the truth i can't deny this dreadful crime that i are done i are condemned to die the singular grammar of the last two lines i never quite understood not having noticed its like elsewhere but i put it down as a distinguishing characteristic of the speech of murderers i waited till the woman had taken her ballads away and i had grown uncommonly cold in the legs and then crept back to bed but now i had fully awakened myself and sleep was impossible presently i got up again and looked out over the river very black and mysterious it lay the blacker it seemed for the thousand lights that spotted it craft and shore no purlmen's fires were to be seen for work on the colliers was done long ago but once a shout and now a hail came over the water faint or loud far or near and up the wooden wall i leaned on came the steady sound of the lapping against the piles below i wondered where grandfather nat's boat our boat lay now if the murderer were still rowing in it and would row and row right away to sea where my father was in his ship or if he would be caught and make a dying confession with all the haves and ams replaced by ares or if indeed he had already met providential retribution by drowning in which case i doubted for the safety of the boat and grandfather would buy another and my legs growing cold again i retreated once more i heard the customers being turned into the street and the shutters going up and then i got under the bed clothes for i recalled the nightmare and it was not pleasant it grew rather worse indeed for my waking fancy enlarged and embellished it and i longed to hear the tread of grandfather nat ascending the stair but he was late to night i heard joe the potman who slept off the premises shut the door and go off up the street for a few minutes grandfather nat was moving about the bar and the bar parlour and then there was silence save for the noises the clicks and the creaks that the old house made of itself i waited and waited sometimes with my head out of the clothes sometimes with no more than a contrived hole next my ear listening till at last i could wait no longer for the house seemed alive with stealthy movement and i shook with the indefinite terror that comes some night or another to the most unimaginative child i thought at first of calling to my grandfather but that would seem babyish so i said my prayers over again held my breath and faced the terrors of the staircase the boards sang and creaked under my bare feet and the black about me was full of dim coloured faces but i pushed the door and drew breath in the honest lamplight of the bar parlour at last nobody was there and nobody was in the bar could he have gone out was i alone in the house there where the blood was still on the carpet but there was a slight noise from behind the stairs and i turned to look farther behind the bar parlour and the staircase were two rooms that projected immediately over the river with their frames resting on the piles one was sometimes used as a parlour for the reception of mates and skippers though such customers were rare the other held cases bottles and barrels to this latter i turned and mounting the three steps behind the staircase pushed open the door and was mightily astonished at what i saw there was my grandfather kneeling and there was one half of bill stagg the purlman standing waist deep in the floor for a moment it was beyond me to guess what he was standing on seeing that there was nothing below but water but presently i reasoned that the tide was high and he must be standing in his boat he was handing my grandfather some small packages and he saw me at once and pointed grandfather nat turned sharply and stared and for a moment i feared he was angry then he grinned shook his finger at me and brought it back to his lips with a tap all right my pardner he whispered and bill stagg grinned too the business was short enough and in a few seconds bill stagg with another grin at me and something like a wink ducked below my grandfather with noiseless care put back in place a trap door not a square noticeable thing but a clump of boards of divers lengths that fell into place with as innocent an aspect as the rest of the floor this done he rolled a barrel over the place and dropped the contents of the packages into a row of buckets that stood near what's that grandfather nat i ventured to ask when all was safely accomplished my grandfather grinned once more and shook his head go on he said i'll tell you in the bar parlour may as well now as let ye find out he blew out the light of his candle and followed me well he said wrapping my cold feet in my nightgown as i sat on his knee what brought ye down stevy did we make a noise i shook my head i i felt lonely i said lonely well never mind an' so ye came to look for me eh well now this is another one o' the things as you mustn't talk about stevy a little secret between ourselves bein' pardners the stuff in the pail gran'fa' nat the stuff in the pail an' the hole in the floor you're sure you won't get talkin' an' get your poor old gran'father in trouble yes i was quite sure though i could not see as yet what there was to cause trouble the stuff bill stagg brought stevy is 'bacca 'bacca smashed down so hard that a pound ain't bigger than that matchbox an' i pitch it in the water to swell it out again see i still failed to understand the method of its arrival did bill stagg steal it gran'father i asked grandfather nat laughed no my boy he said he bought it an' i buy it it comes off the dutch boats but it comes a deal cheaper takin' it in that way at night time there's a big place i'll show you one day stevy big white house just this side o' london bridge there's a lot o' gentlemen there as wants to see all the 'bacca that comes in from aboard an' they take a lot o' trouble over it and charge too fearful so they're very angry if parties same as you an' me takes any in without lettin' 'em know an' payin' 'em the money an' they can get you locked up this seemed a very unjust world that i had come into in which grandfather nat was in danger of such terrible penalties for such innocent transactions buying a watch or getting his tobacco cheap so i said i think people are very wicked in this place ah said my grandfather i s'pose none of us ain't over good but there i've told you about it now an' that's better than lettin' you wonder an' p'raps go asking other people questions so now you know stevy we've got our little secrets between us an' you've got to keep 'em between us else well you know nothing about anything i buy nor about what i take in there with a jerk of the thumb nor about 'bacca in buckets o' water nor about the pocket book gran'fa' nat lord no 'specially not about that you see stevy pardners is pardners an' they must stick together eh we'll stick together won't we i nodded hard and reached for my grandfather's neck ah that we will what others like to think they can they can't prove nothing nor it wouldn't be their game but we're pardners an' i've told you what well what you might ha' found out in a more awkward way an' it ain't so bad a thing to have a pardner to talk to neither i never had one till now not since your gran'mother died that you never saw stevy an' that was twenty years ago i been alone most o' my life not even a boy same as it might be you 'cause why when your father was your age an' older i was always at sea an' never saw him scarcely same as him an' you now and indeed grandfather nat and i knew each other better than my father knew either of us and so we sat for a few minutes talking of ourselves and once more of the notes in the pocket book upstairs till the tramp of the three policemen on the beat stayed in the street without and we heard one of the three coming down the passage he knocked sharply at the bar parlour door and grandfather nat put me down and opened it good evenin' cap'en kemp said the policeman we knew you was up seein' a bit o' light then he leaned farther in and in a lower voice said he ain't been exactly identified yet but it's thought some of our chaps knows 'im know if anything's been picked up my heart gave a jump as probably did my grandfather's picked up he repeated why what what d'ye mean well there was nothing partic'lar on the body an' our chaps didn't see the knife we thought if anybody about 'ad picked up anything knife or what not you might 'ear so there ain't nothing no grandfather nat answered blankly i've seen no knife nor heard of none all right cap'en kemp if you do hear of anything give us the tip good night grandfather nat looked oddly at me and i at him i think we had a feeling that our partnership was sealed and so with no more words we went to bed chapter xi stephen's tale i had never seen either of the partners in the firm of viney and marr as i may have said already on the day after the man was stabbed at our side door i saw them both that morning the tide was low and hole in the wall stairs ended in a causeway in the midst of a little flat of gravel and mud so since the mud was nowhere dangerous and there was no deep water to fall into i was allowed to go down the steps alone and play on the foreshore while grandfather nat was busy with his morning's affairs the two or three watermen lying by the causeway undertaking to keep an eye on me and there i took my pleasure as i would now raking in the wet pebbles and heaving over big stones that often pulled me on to all fours now climbing the stairs to peep along the alley and once or twice running as far as the bar parlour door to report myself to grandfather nat and inform him of my discoveries the little patch of foreshore soon rendered up all its secrets and its area grew less by reason of the rising tide so that i turned to other matters of interest out in mid stream a cluster of lighters lay moored waiting for the turn of the tide presently a little tug came puffing and fussing from somewhere alongshore and after much shoving and hauling and shouting scuffled off trailing three of the lighters behind it from which i conjectured that their loads were needed in a hurry but the disturbance among the rest of the lighters was not done with when the tug had cleared the three from their midst for a hawser had got foul of a rudder and two or three men were at work with poles and hooks recrimination and forcible words to get things clear though the thing seemed no easy job and it took my attention for some time but presently i tired of it and climbed the steps to read the bills describing the people who had been found drowned there were eleven of the bills altogether fresh and clean and fragments of innumerable others older and dirtier were round about them ten men and one woman had been picked up it would seem and all within a week or two as i learned when i had spelled out the dates i pored at these bills till i had read them through being horribly fascinated by the personal marks and peculiarities so baldly set forth the scars the tattoo marks the colour of the dead eyes the clothes and boots and the contents of the pockets though indeed most of the pockets would seem to have been empty the woman they guessed her age at twenty two wore one earring and i entangled myself in conjectures as to what had become of the other i was disturbed by a shout from the causeway i looked and saw bill stagg in his boat is your gran'father there shouted bill stagg tell him they've found his boat this was joyful news and i rushed to carry it they've found our boat grandfather nat i cried bill stagg says so grandfather nat was busy in the bar and he received the information with calmness ah he said i knew it 'ud turn up somewhere bill stagg there and he came out leisurely in his shirt sleeves and stood at the head of the stairs p'lice galley found your boat cap'en bill stagg reported you'll have to go up to the float for it right know where it was up agin elephant stairs bill stagg pointed across the river turned adrift and jammed among the lighters grandfather nat nodded serenely bill stagg nodded in reply shoved off from the causeway and went about his business the hawser was still foul among the lighters out in the stream and a man had pulled over in a boat to help i had told grandfather of the difficulty and how long it had baffled the lightermen and was asking the third of a string of questions about it all when there was a step behind and a voice good mornin' cap'en nat my grandfather turned quickly mr viney he said well good mornin' i turned also and i was not prepossessed by mr viney his face a face no doubt originally pale and pasty but too long sun burned to revert to anything but yellow in these later years of shore life his yellow face was ever stretched in an uneasy grin a grin that might mean either propitiation or malice and remained the same for both he had the watery eyes and the goatee beard that were not uncommon among seamen and in total i thought he much resembled one of those same hang dog fellows that stood at corners and leaned on posts in the neighbourhood making a mysterious living out of sailors one of them that is to say in a superior suit of clothes that seemed too good for him i suppose he may have been an inch taller than grandfather nat but in the contrast between them he seemed very small and mean he offered his hand with a stealthy gesture rather as though he were trying to pick my grandfather's waistcoat pocket so that the old man stared at the hand for a moment as if to see what he would be at before he shook it down in the world again cap'en nat said viney with a shrug ay i heard answered captain nat i'm very sorry but there perhaps you'll be up again soon i come to ask you about something viney proceeded as they walked away toward the bar parlour door something you'll tell me bein' an old shipmate if you can find out i'm sure can we go into your place no there's a woman there only one as does washin' up an' such i'll send her upstairs if you like no out here's best we'll walk up and down people get hangin' round doors an' keyholes in a place like that here we can see who's near us what secrets ay viney gave an ugly twist to his grin i know some o' yours one big un' at any rate cap'en nat don't i so i can afford to let you into a little 'un o' mine seein' i can't help it now i'd like to know if you've seen anything of marr no haven't seen him for months bolted they tell me an' well you know better'n me i expect i don't know viney replied with emphasis i ought to know but i don't see here now less than a week ago he cleared out an' then i filed my petition he might ha' been gone anywhere bolted might be abroad as would seem most likely in plain fact he was only coming down in these parts to lie low see round about here a man can lie low an' snug an' safer than abroad if he likes and he had money with him all we could get together see and viney frowned and winked and glanced stealthily over his shoulder ah remarked captain nat drily i see an' the creditors damn the creditors see here cap'en nat kemp remember a man called dan webb captain nat paled a little and tightened his lips remember a man called dan webb viney repeated stopping in his walk and facing the other with the uneasy grin unchanged a man called dan webb aboard o' the florence along o' you an' me 'cause i do anyhow that's on'y my little hint we're good friends altogether o' course cap'en nat but you know what it means well marr had money with him as i said he was to come to a quiet anchorage hereabout got up like a seaman an' let me know at once captain nat his mouth still set tight nodded with a grunt well he didn't let me know i heard nothing at all from him an' it struck me rather of a heap to think that p'raps he'd put the double on me an' cleared out in good earnest but yesterday i got news a blind fiddler chap gave me some sort o' news captain nat remembered the meeting at the street corner in the evening after the funeral blind george he queried yes that was all the name he gave me a regular thick 'un that blind chap an' a flow o' language as would curl the sheathing off a ship's bottom he came the evening before it seems but found the place shut up servant gal took her hook well now he'd done all but see marr down here at the blue gate he'd seen him as clear as a blind man could he said with his ears an' he came to me to give me the tip an' earn anything i'd give him for it it amounted to this it was plain enough marr had come along here all right an' pitched on some sort o' quarters but it was clear he wasn't fit to be trusted alone in such a place at all for the blind chap found him drunk an' in tow with as precious a pair o' bully boys as blue gate could show not only drunk neither but drunk with a slack jaw drunk an' gabbling drunk an' talkin' business my business an' lettin' out all there was to let this an' that an' t'other an' lord knows what it was only because of his drunken jabber that the blind man found out who he was and this was the day before yesterday asked captain nat yes captain nat shook his head if he was like that the day before yesterday he said in tow with such chaps as you say well whatever he had on him ain't on him now an' it 'ud puzzle a cleverer man than me to find it you may lay to that viney swore and stamped a foot and swore again but see he said ain't there a chance it was in notes all of it them chaps'll be afraid to pass notes couldn't most of it be got back on an arrangement to cash the rest you can find 'em if you try with all your chances come i'll pay fair for what i get to you an' all see how you've left it remarked captain nat and viney swore again this was all done the day before yesterday well you don't hear of it yourself till yesterday an' now you don't come to me till to day viney swore once more and grinned twice as wide in his rage yes he said that was blind george's doing i sent him back to see what he could do an' ain't seen him since like as not he's standing in with the others ay that's likely the old man answered very likely blind george is as tough a lot as any in blue gate for all he's blind you'd never ha' heard of it at all if they'd ha' greased him a bit at first i expect they shut him out to keep the plant to themselves an' so he came to you for anything he could pick up an' now viney cursed them all and blind george and himself together but most he cursed marr and so talking the two men walked to and fro in the passage i could see that viney was angry and growing angrier still but i gave all my attention to the work at the fouled hawser the man in the boat working patiently with a boat hook succeeded suddenly and without warning so that he almost pitched headlong into the river the rope came up from its entanglement with a spring and a splash flinging some amazing great object up with it half out of water and the men gave a cry as this thing lapsed heavily to the surface the man in the boat snatched his hook again and reached for the thing as it floated somebody threw him a length of line and with this he made it fast to his boat and began pulling toward the stairs towing it i was puzzled to guess what the object might be it was no part of the lighter's rudder for it lay in rather than on the water and it rolled and wallowed and seemed to tug heavily so that the boatman had to pull his best i wondered if he had caught some curious water creature a porpoise perhaps or a seal such as had been flung ashore in a winter storm at blackwall a year before viney and grandfather nat had turned their steps toward the stairs and as they neared my grandfather lifting his eyes saw the boatman and his prize and saw the watermen leaving their boats for the foreshore with a quick word to viney he hastened down the stairs and viney himself less interested followed half way down and waited the boatman brought up alongside the foreshore and he and another hauled at the tow rope the thing in the water came in rolling and bobbing growing more hideously distinct as it came it checked at the mud and stones turned over and with another pull lay ashore staring and grey and streaming a dead man the lips were pulled tight over the teeth and the hair being fair it was the plainer to see that one side of the head and forehead was black and open with a great wound the limbs lay limp and tumbled all but one leg fell aside with so loose a twist that plainly it was broken and i heard afterwards that it was the leg that had caused the difficulty with the hawser grandfather nat down at the waterside had no sooner caught sight of the dead face than with wide eyes he turned to viney and shouted the one word look then he went and took another view longer and closer and straightway came back in six strides to the stairs whereon viney was no longer standing but sitting his face tallowy and his grin faded see him cried grandfather nat in a hushed voice see him it's marr himself if i know him at all come come and see viney pulled his arm from the old man's grasp turned and crawled up a stair or two no he said faintly i i won't now i they'd know me p'raps some of them his breath was short and he gulped good god he said presently it's him it's him sure enough and the clothes he had on but cap'en cap'en nat go an' try his pockets go on there's a pocket book leather pocket book go on what's the good asked captain nat with a lift of the eyebrows and the same low voice what's the good i can't fetch it away with all them witnesses go yourself an' say you're his pardner you'd have a chance then no no i it ain't good enough you know 'em i don't i'll stand in with you give you a hundred if it's all there square 'em you know 'em if they're to be squared you can do it as well as me there'll be an inquest on this an' evidence i ain't going to be asked what i did with the man's pocket book no i don't meddle in this mr viney if it ain't good enough for you to get it for yourself it ain't good enough for me to get it for you kemp i'll go you halves there get it an' there's four hundred for you eight hundred an' odd quid in a pocket book come that's worth it ain't it eight hundred an' odd quid in a leather pocket book an' i'll go you halves captain nat started at the words and stood for a moment staring eight hundred he repeated under his breath eight hundred an' odd quid in a leather pocket book ah and the stare persisted and grew thoughtful yes replied viney now a little more himself now you know and it's worth it ain't it don't waste time they're turning him over themselves you can manage all these chaps go on i'll see if anything's there answered captain nat more i can't an' if there's nothing that's an end of it he went down to where the men were bending over the body to disengage the tow line he looked again at the drawn face under the gaping forehead and said something to the men then he bent and patted the soddened clothes now here now there and at last felt in the breast pocket meantime viney stood feverishly on the stairs watching fidgeting nervously down a step and then down another and then down two more and so till captain nat returned the old man shook his head cleaned out he reported cleaned out o' course hit on the head an' cleaned out like many a score better men before him down these parts not a thing in the pockets anywhere flimped clean viney's eyes were wild nothing at all left he said nothing of his own not a watch nor anything no not a watch nor anything viney stood staring at space for some moments murmuring many oaths then he asked suddenly where's this blind chap where can i find blind george grandfather nat shook his head he's all over the neighbourhood he answered try the highway i can't give you nearer than that and with no more counsel to help him mr viney was fain to depart he went grinning and cursing up the passage and so toward the bridge without another word or look and when i turned to my grandfather i saw him staring fixedly at me lost in thought and rubbing his hand up in his hair behind through the grey and out at the brown on top chapter xii in the club room by the side of the bills stuck at the corner of hole in the wall stairs the bills that had so fascinated stephen a new one appeared with the heading body found it particularised the personal marks and description of the unhappy marr his fresh complexion his brown hair his serge suit and his anklejacks the bill might have stood on every wall in london till it rotted and never have given a soul who knew him a hint to guess the body his except viney who knew the fact already and the body might have been buried unidentified ere viney would have shown himself in the business were it not for the interference of mr cripps for industry of an unprofitable kind was a piece of mr cripps's nature and moreover he was so regular a visitor at the mortuary as to have grown an old friend of the keeper his persistent prying among the ghastly liers in state at first on plea of identifying a friend a contingency likely enough since his long shore acquaintance was wide and later under the name of friendly calls was an indulgence that had helped him to consideration as a news monger and twice had raised him to the elevation of witness at an inquest a distinction very gratifying to his simple vanity he entertained high hopes of being called witness in the case of the man stabbed at the side door of the hole in the wall and was scarce seen at captain nat's all the next day preferring to frequent the mortuary so it happened that he saw the other corpse that was carried thence from hole in the wall stairs there y'are said the mortuary keeper there's a fresh 'un just in from the river unknown you dunno 'im either i expect but mr cripps was quite sure that he did curious and eager he walked up between the two dead men his grimy little body being all that divided them in this their grisly reunion i do know 'im he insisted thoughtfully leastways i've seen 'im somewheres i'm sure the little man gazed at the dreadful head and then at the rafters then shut his eyes with a squeeze that drove his nose into amazing lumps and wrinkles then looked at the head again and squeezed his eyelids together once more and at last started back his eyes rivalling his very nose itself for prominence why he gasped it is it is s'elp me it's mr marr as is pardners with mr viney i on'y see 'im once in my life but i'll swear it's 'im lord what a phenomenal go and with that mr cripps rushed off incontinent to spread the news wherever anybody would listen he told the police he told the loafers he told captain nat and everybody in his bar he told the watermen at the stairs he shouted it to the purlmen in their boats and he wriggled into conversation with perfect strangers to tell them too so that it came to pass that viney being called upon by the coroner's officer was fain to swallow his reluctance and come forward at the inquest that was held at the hole in the wall twenty four hours after the body had been hauled ashore the two inquests were held together in fact marr's and that of the broken nosed man stabbed in the passage two inquests or even three in a day made no uncommon event in those parts where perhaps a dozen might be held in a week mostly ending with the same doubtful verdict found drowned but here one of the inquiries related to an open and witnessed murder and that fact gave some touch of added interest to the proceedings accordingly a drifting group hung about the doors of the hole in the wall at the appointed time just such an idle changing group as had hung there all the evening after the man had been stabbed and in the midst stood blind george with his fiddle his vacant white eye rolling upward his mouth full of noisy ribaldry and his fiddle playing punctuation and chorus to all he said or sang he turned his ear at the sound of many footsteps leaving the door near him there they go he sang out there they go twelve on 'em and indeed it was the jury going off to view the bodies there they go twelve good men an' true an' bloomin' proud they are to fancy it got a copper for blind george gentlemen not a brown for pore george not them not a brass farden among the 'ole dam good an' lawful lot ahoy ain't gubbins there the good an' lawful pork butcher as 'ad to pay forty bob for shovin' a lump o' fat under the scales tell the crowner to mind 'is pockets the idlers laughed and one flung a copper which blind george snatched almost before it had fallen ha ha he cried there's a toff somewhere near i can tell by the sound of his money here goes for a stave and straightway be broke into o they call me hanging johnny with my hang boys hang the mortuary stood at no great distance and soon the jury were back in the club room over the bar and at work on the first case the police had had some difficulty as to identification of the stabbed man the difficulty arose not only because there were no relations in the neighbourhood to feel the loss but as much because the persons able to make the identification kept the most distant possible terms with the police and withheld information from them as a matter of principle albeit a reluctant ruffian was laid hold of who was induced sulkily to admit that he had known the deceased to speak to and lodged near him in blue gate that the deceased was called bob kipps that he was quite lately come into the neighbourhood and that he had no particular occupation as far as witness knew it needed some pressure to extract the information that kipps during the short time he was in blue gate chiefly consorted with one dan ogle and that witness had seen nothing of ogle that day nor the day before there was also a woman called to identify a woman more reluctant than the man a woman of coarse features dull eyes tousled hair and thick voice sluttish with rusty finery name margaret flynn though at the back of the little crowd that had squeezed into the court she was called musky mag it was said there too that mag in no degree one of the fainting sort had nevertheless swooned when taken into the mortuary gone clean off with a flop true she explained it afterward by saying that she had only expected to see one body but found herself brought face to face with two and of course there was the other there marr's but it was held no such odds between one corpse and two that an outer and outer like mag should go on the faint over it this was reasonable enough for the crowd but not for a woman who had sat to drink with three men and in a short hour or so had fallen over the battered corpse of one of them in the dark of her room who had been forced now to view the rent body of a second and in doing it to meet once again the other resurrected bruised sodden and horrible and who knew that all was the work of the last of the three and that man in peril of the rope the man too of all the world in her eye her evidence given with plain anxiety and a nervous unsteadiness of the mouth added nothing to the tale the man was bob kipps he was a stranger till lately came she had heard tell from shoreditch or hoxton saw him last a day or two ago knew nothing of his death beyond what she had heard did not know where dan ogle was this very vehemently with much shaking of the head had not seen him with deceased but here the police inspector handed the coroner a scribbled note and the coroner having read it and passed it back said no more musky mag stood aside while the inspector tore the note into small pieces and put the pieces in his pocket nathaniel kemp landlord of the house told the story of the murder as he saw it and of his chase of the murderer did not know deceased and should be unable to identify the murderer if he met him again having seen no more than his figure in the dark all this time mr cripps had been standing in eager trepidation foremost among the little crowd nodding and lifting his hand anxiously strenuous to catch the coroner's officer's attention at the dismissal of each witness and fearful lest his offer of evidence made a dozen times before the coroner came should be forgotten now at last the coroner's officer condescended to notice him and being beckoned mr cripps swaggered forward his greasy widewake crushed under his arm and his face radiant with delighted importance he bowed to the coroner kissed the book with a flourish and glanced round the court to judge how much of the due impression was yet visible the coroner signified that he was ready to hear whatever mr cripps knew of this matter mr cripps threw a chest stuck an arm akimbo and raised the other with an oratorical sweep so large that his small voice when it came seemed all the smaller hi was in the bar sir he piped the bar sir of this 'ouse bein' long acquainted with an' much respectin' cap'en kemp an' in the 'abit of visitin' 'ere in the intervals of the pursoot of my hart hem hi was in the bar sir when my attention was attracted by a sudden noise be'hind or as i may say in the rear of the bar parlour hi was able to distinguish gentlemen of the jury what might be called in a common way o' speakin' a bump or a bang sich as would be occasioned by an unknown murderer criminally shoving his un'appy victim's 'ed agin the back door of a public 'ouse hi was able to distinguish it sir from a 'uman cry which follered a 'uman cry or as it might be a holler sich as would be occasioned by the un'appy victim 'avin' 'is 'ed shoved agin the back door aforesaid genelmen i 'esitated not a moment i rushed forward mr cripps paused so long to give the statement effect that the coroner lost patience yes he said you rushed forward do you mean you jumped over the bar for a moment mr cripps's countenance fell truly it would have been more imposing to have jumped over the bar but he was on his oath and he must do his best with the facts no sir he explained a little tamely not over the bar but reether the opposite way so to speak towards the door i rushed forward genelmen in a sort of rearwards direction through the door an' round into the alley immediate as i turned the corner genelmen i be'eld with my own eyes the unknown murderer i see 'im a risin' from over 'is un'appy victim an' i see as the criminal tragedy had transpired i i rushed forward the sensation he looked for being slow in coming another rush seemed expedient but it fell flat as the first and mr cripps struggled on desperately conscious that he had nothing else to say i rushed forward sir seein' which the miscreant absconded absconded no doubt with with the proceeds an' seein' cap'en kemp abscondin' after him i turned an' be'eld the un'appy victim the corpse now in custody sir a layin' in the bar parlour 'elpless an' an' decimated i rushed forward it was sad to see how little the coroner was impressed there was even something in his face not unlike a smile and mr cripps was at the end of his resources but if he could have seen the face of musky mag in the little crowd behind him he might have been consoled she alone of all who heard had followed his rhetoric with an agony of attention word by word even as she had followed the earlier evidence now her strained face was the easier merely by contrast with itself when mr cripps was in full cry and a moment later it was tenser than ever yes yes mr cripps the coroner said no doubt you were very active but we don't seem to have increased the evidence you say you saw the man who stabbed the deceased in the passage did you know him at all ever see him before here mayhap was some chance of an effect after all mr cripps could scarce have distinguished the murderer from one of the posts in the alley but he said with all the significance he could give the words well sir i won't go so far as to swear to 'is name sir no sir not to 'is name certainly not and therewith he made his sensation at last bringing upon himself the twenty four eyes of the jury all together the coroner looked up sharply oh he said you know him by sight then does he belong to the neighbourhood now it was not mr cripps who had said he knew the murderer by sight but the coroner far be it from him thought the aspirant for fame to contradict the coroner and so baulk himself of the credit thus thrust upon him so he answered with the same cautious significance and a succession of portentous nods your judgment sir is correct quite correct come then this is important you would be able to recognise him again of course there was no retreat mr cripps was in for it it was an unforeseen consequence of the quibble but since plunge he must he plunged neck and crop i'd know 'im anywhere he said triumphantly there was an odd sound in the crowd behind and a fall captain nat strode across and the crowd wondered for musky mag had fainted again the landlord lifted her and carried her to the stairs when the door had closed behind them and the coroner's officer had shouted the little crowd into silence the inquest took a short course to its end mr cripps in the height of his consequence began to feel serious misgivings as to the issue of his stumble beyond the verities and the coroner's next words were a relief i think that will be enough mr cripps the coroner said no doubt the police will be glad of your assistance and with that he gave the jury the little summing up that the case needed there was the medical evidence and the evidence of the stabbing and that evidence pointed to an unmistakable conclusion nobody was in custody nor had the murderer been positively identified and such evidence as there was in this respect was for the consideration of the police he thought the jury would have no difficulty in arriving at a verdict the jury had none and the verdict was murder by some person or persons unknown the other inquest gave even less trouble mr henry viney shipowner had seen the body and identified it as that of his partner lewis marr marr had suddenly disappeared a week ago and an examination of his accounts showed serious defalcations in consequence of which witness had filed his petition in bankruptcy whether or not marr had taken money with him witness could not say as deceased had entire charge of the accounts but it seemed more likely that embezzlement had been going on for some time past and marr had fled when detection could no longer be averted this might account for his dressing and presumably seeking work as a sailor the divisional surgeon of police had examined the body and found a large wound on the head fully sufficient to have caused death inflicted either by some heavy blunt instrument or by a fall from a height on a hard substance one thigh was fractured and there were other wounds and contusions but these as well as the broken thigh were clearly caused after death the blow on the head might have been caused by an accident on the riverside or it might have been inflicted wilfully by an assailant then there was the evidence of the man who had found the body foul of a rudder and a hawser and of the police who had found nothing on the body and there was no more evidence at all the coroner having sympathised deeply with mr viney gave the jury the proper lead and the jury with perfect propriety returned the open verdict that the doctor's evidence and the coroner's lead suggested the case except for the circumstances of marr's flight was like a hundred others inquired upon thereabout in the course of a few weeks and in an hour it was in a fair way to be forgotten even by the little crowd that clumped downstairs to try both cases all over again in the bar of the hole in the wall to the coroner the jury and the little crowd these were two inquests with nothing to connect them but the accident of time and the convenience of the hole in the wall club room but blind george standing in the street with his fiddle and getting the news from the club room in scraps between song and patter knew more and guessed better chapter xiii stephen's tale i found it a busy morning at the hole in the wall that of the two inquests i perceived that by some occult understanding business in one department was suspended the pale man idled without and nobody came into the little compartment to exhibit valuables grandfather nat had a deal to do in making ready the club room over the bar and then in attending the inquests and it turned out that mrs grimes had settled on this day in particular to perform a vast number of extra feats of housewifery in the upper floors notwithstanding the disturbance of this additional work mrs grimes was most amazingly amiable even to me but she was so persistent in requiring first the key of one place then of another next of a chest of drawers and again of a cupboard that at last my grandfather distractedly gave her the whole bunch and told her not to bother him any more the bunch held all she could require indeed i think it comprised every key my grandfather had except that of his cash box and she went away with it amiable still notwithstanding the hastiness of his expressions so that i was amazed to find mrs grimes so meek and wondered vaguely and childishly if it were because she felt ill and expected to die shortly mr cripps was in the bar as soon as the doors were open in a wonderful state of effervescence he was to make a great figure at the inquest it appeared and the pride and glory of it kept him nervously on the strut till the coroner came and mr cripps mounted to the club room with the jury he was got up for his part as completely as circumstances would allow grease was in his hair his hat stood at an angle and his face exhibited an unfamiliar polish occasioned by a towel for my own part i sat in the bar parlour and amused myself as i might blind george was singing in the street and now and again i could hear the guffaw that signalised some sally that had touched his audience above things were quiet enough for some while and then my grandfather came heavily downstairs carrying a woman who had fainted i had not noticed the woman among the people who went up but now grandfather nat brought her through the bar and into the parlour and as she lay on the floor just as the stabbed man had lain i recognised her face also for she was the coarse faced woman who had stopped my grandfather near blue gate with vague and timid questions when we were on our way from the london dock grandfather nat roared up the little staircase for mrs grimes and presently she descended amiable still till she saw the coarse woman and was asked to help her she looked on the woman with something of surprise and something of confusion but carried it off at once with a toss of the head a high phrase or so likes of 'er respectable woman and a quick retreat upstairs i believe my grandfather would have brought her down again by main force but the woman on the floor stirred and began scrambling up even before she knew where she was she held the shelf and looked dully about her with a hoarse beg pardon sir beg pardon then she went across toward the door which stood ajar stared stupidly with a look of some dawning alarm and said again beg pardon sir i bin queer and with that was gone into the passage it was not long after her departure ere the business above was over and the people came tramping and talking down into the bar filling it close and giving joe the potman all the work he could do the coroner came down by our private stairs into the bar parlour ushered with great respect by my grandfather and at his heels taking occasion by a desperately extemporised conversation with grandfather nat came mr cripps there had never been an inquest at the hole in the wall before and my grandfather had been at some exercise of mind as to the proper entertainment of the coroner he had decided after consideration that the gentleman could scarce be offended at the offer of a little lunch and to that end he had made ready with a cold fowl and a bottle of claret which mrs grimes would presently be putting on the table the coroner was not offended but he would take no lunch he was very pleasantly obliged by the invitation but his lunch had been already ordered at some distance and so he shook hands with grandfather nat and went his way a circumstance that had no small effect on my history for it seemed to mr cripps who saw the coroner go that by dexterous management the vacant place at our dinner table for what the coroner would call lunch we called dinner might fall to himself it had happened once or twice before on special occasions that he had been allowed to share a meal with captain nat and now that he was brushed and oiled for company and had publicly distinguished himself at an inquest he was persuaded that the occasion was special beyond precedent and he set about to improve it with an assiduity and an innocent cunning that were very transparent indeed so he was affectionately admiring with me deferentially loquacious with my grandfather and very friendly with joe the potman and mrs grimes it was a busy morning he observed and he would be glad to do anything to help at that time the houses on wapping wall were not encumbered with dust bins since the river was found a more convenient receptacle for rubbish slops were flung out of a back window and kitchen refuse went the same way or was taken to the river stairs and turned out either into the water or on the foreshore as the tide might chance mrs grimes carried about with her in her dustings and sweepings an old coal scuttle which held hearth bushes shovels ashes cinders potato peelings and the like and at the end of her work when the brushes and shovels had been put away she carried the coal scuttle sometimes to the nearest window but more often to the river stairs and flung what remained into the thames just as mr cripps was at his busiest and politest mrs grimes appeared with the old coal scuttle piled uncommonly high with ashes and dust and half burned pipe lights she set it down by the door gave my grandfather his keys and turned to prepare the table instantly mr cripps watchful in service pounced on the scuttle i'll pitch this 'ere away for you mum he said while you're seein' to cap'en kemp's dinner and straightway started for the stairs mrs grimes's back was turned at the moment and this gave mr cripps the start of a yard or two but she flung round and after him like a maniac so that both grandfather nat and i stared in amazement give me that scuttle she cried snatching at the hinder handle mind your own business an' leave my things alone mr cripps was amazed also and he stuttered i i i on'y on'y drop it you fool the woman hissed so suddenly savage that mr cripps did drop it with a start that sent him backward against a post and the consequence was appalling mr cripps was carrying the coal scuttle by its top handle and mrs grimes reaching after it had seized that at the back so that when mr cripps let go everything in the scuttle shot out on the paving stones first of course the ashes and the pipe lights then on the top of them crowning the heap grandfather nat's cash box i suppose my grandfather must have recovered from his astonishment first for the next thing i remember is that he had mrs grimes back in the bar parlour held fast by the arm while he carried his cash box in the disengaged hand mr cripps followed bewildered but curious and my grandfather pushing his prisoner into a far corner turned and locked the door mrs grimes who had been crimson was now white but more it seemed to me with fury than with fear my grandfather took the key from his watchguard and opened the box holding it where the contents were visible to none but himself he gave no more than a quick glance within and re locked it from which i judged and judged aright that the pocket book was safe there's witnesses enough here said my grandfather for joe the potman was now staring in from the bar to give you a good dose o' gaol mum 'stead o' which i pay your full week's money and send you packin' he pulled out some silver from his pocket grateful or not to me don't matter but i hope you'll be honest where you go next for your own sake grateful honest mrs grimes gasped shaking with passion 'ear 'im talk honest take me to the station now and bring that box an' show 'em inside it go on i felt more than a little alarmed at this challenge having regard to the history of the pocket book and i remembered the night when we first examined it the creaking door and the soft sounds on the stairs but grandfather nat was wholly undisturbed he counted over the money calmly and pushed it across the little table there it is mum he said an' there's your bonnet an' shawl in the corner there's nothing else o' yours in the place i believe so there's no need for you to go out o' my sight till you go out of it altogether that you'd better do quick i'll lay the dinner myself mrs grimes swept up the money and began fixing her bonnet on her head and tying the strings under her chin with savage jerks and a great play of elbow her lips screwing nervously and her eyes blazing with spite ho yus she broke out though her rage was choking her as she snatched her shawl ho yus a nice pusson cap'en nat kemp to talk about honesty an' gratefulness a nice pusson a nice teacher for young master 'opeful i must say an' 'opin' 'e'll do ye credit it ain't the last you'll see o' me captain nat kemp get out o' my way you old lickspittle mr cripps got out of it with something like a bound and mrs grimes was gone with a flounce and a slam of the door scold as she was and furious as she was i was conscious that something in my grandfather's scowl had kept her speech within bounds and shortened her clamour for few cared to face captain nat's anger but with the slam of the door the scowl broke and he laughed come he said that's well over an' i owe you a turn mr cripps though you weren't intending it stop an' have a bit of dinner and if you'd like something on account to buy the board for the sign or say two boards if you like we'll see about it after dinner it will be perceived that grandfather nat had no reason to regret the keeping of his cash box key on his watchguard for had it been with the rest in mrs grimes's hands she need never have troubled to smuggle out the box among the ashes since the pocket book was no such awkward article and would have gone in her pocket mrs grimes had taken her best chance and failed the disorders caused by the inquests had left her unobserved the keys were in her hands and the cash box was left in the cupboard upstairs but the sedulous mr cripps had been her destruction as for that artist he attained his dinner and a few shillings under the name of advance and so was well pleased with his morning's work chapter xiv stephen's tale a policeman brought my grandfather a bill which was stuck against the bar window with gelatines and just such another bill was posted on the wall at the head of hole in the wall stairs above the smaller bills that advertised the found bodies this new bill was six times the size of those below it was headed murder in grim black capitals and it set forth an offer of fifty pounds reward for information which should lead to the apprehension of the murderer of robert kipps the offer gave grandfather nat occasion for much solemn banter of mr cripps banter which seemed to cause mr cripps a curious uneasiness and time and again stopped his eloquence in full flood he had been at the pains to cut from newspapers such reports of the inquest as were printed and though they sadly disappointed him by their brevity and all but two personally affronted him by disregarding his evidence and himself altogether still he made great play with the exceptional two in the bar but he was quick to drop the subject when captain nat urged him in pursuit of the reward come my grandfather would say you're neglecting your fortune you know there's fifty pound waitin' for you to pick up if you'd only go an' collar that murderer an' you'd know him anywhere whereupon mr cripps would look a little frightened and subside i did not learn till later how the little painter's vanity had pushed him over bounds at the inquest so far that he committed himself to an absolute recognition of the murderer the fact alarmed him not a little on his return to calmness and my grandfather who understood his indiscretion as well as himself and enjoyed its consequences in his own grim way amused himself at one vacant moment and another by setting mr cripps's alarm astir again you're throwing away your luck he would say perhaps seein' you know him so well by sight if you're too well off to bother about fifty pound give some of us poor 'uns a run for it an' put us on to him i wish i'd been able to see him so clear for in truth grandfather nat well knew that nobody had had so near a chance of seeing the murderer's face as himself and that mr cripps at the top of the passage perhaps even round the corner had no chance at all it was because of mr cripps's indiscretion in fact this i learned later still that the police were put off the track of the real criminal for after due reflection on the direful complications whereinto his lapse promised to fling him that distinguished witness as i have already hinted fell into a sad funk so though he needs must hold to the tale that he knew the man by sight and could recognise him again he resolved that come what might he would identify nobody and so keep clear of further entanglements now the police suspicions fell shrewdly on dan ogle a notorious ruffian of the neighbourhood he had been much in company of the murdered man of late and now was suddenly gone from his accustomed haunts moreover there was the plain agitation of the woman he consorted with musky mag at the inquest she had fainted indeed when mr cripps had been so positive about identifying the murderer these things were nothing of evidence it was true for that they must depend on the witness who saw the fellow's face knew him by sight and could identify him but when they came to this witness with their inquiries and suggestions the thing went overboard at a breath was the assassin a tall man not at all rather short in fact was he a heavy framed bony fellow on the contrary he was fat rather than bony did mr cripps ever happen to have seen a man called dan ogle and was this man at all like him mr cripps had been familiar with dan ogle's appearance from his youth up this was true for the painter's acquaintance was wide and diverse but the man who killed bob kipps was as unlike him as it was possible for any creature on two legs to be then would mr cripps if the thing came to trial swear that the man he saw was not dan ogle mr cripps was most fervently and desperately ready and anxious to swear that it was not and could not by any possibility be dan ogle or anybody like him this brought the police inquiries to a fault even had their suspicions been stronger and better supported it would have been useless to arrest dan ogle supposing they could find him for this the sole possible witness to identity would swear him innocent so they turned their inquiries to fresh quarters looking among the waterside population across the river since it was plain that the murderer had rowed over for recent immigrants from wapping for a little while mr cripps was vexed and disquieted with invitations to go with a plain clothes policeman and take a quiet look at some doubtful characters but of course with no result beyond the welcome one of an occasional free drink ordered as an excuse for waiting at bars and tavern corners and in time these attentions ceased for the police were reduced to waiting for evidence to turn up and mr cripps breathed freely once more while dan ogle remained undisturbed and justice was balked for a while for it turned out in the end that when the police suspected dan ogle they were right and when they went to other conjectures they were wrong all this was ahead of my knowledge at the moment however as indeed it is somewhat ahead of my story and for the while i did no more than wonder to see mr cripps abashed at an encouragement to earn fifty pounds for he seemed not a penny richer than before and still impetrated odd coppers on account of the signboard of promise once or twice we saw mr viney and on each occasion he borrowed money off grandfather nat the police were about the house a good deal at this time because of the murder or i think he might have come oftener the first time he came i heard him telling my grandfather that he had got hold of blind george that blind george had told him a good deal about the missing money and that with his help he hoped for a chance of saving some of it he added mysteriously that it had been nearer hereabouts than you might think at one time a piece of news that my grandfather received with a proper appearance of surprise but was it safe to confide in blind george viney swore for answer and said that the rascal had stipulated for such a handsome share that it would pay him to play square on the last of these visits i again overheard some scraps of their talk and this time it was angrier i judged that viney wanted more money than my grandfather was disposed to give him they were together in the back room where the boxes and bottles were the room into which i had seen bill stagg's head and shoulders thrust by way of the trap door my grandfather's voice was low and from time to time he seemed to be begging viney to lower his so that i wondered to find grandfather nat so mild since in the bar he never twice told a man to lower his voice but if once were not enough flung him into the street and withal viney paid no heed but talked as he would so that i could catch his phrases again and again let them hush as is afraid i ain't he said and again o am i not me it's little enough for me if it does not the rope anyway and later yes the rope cap'en kemp as you know well enough the rope at newgate gaol dan webb aboard o' the florence the florence that was piled up on the little dingoes in broad day as you was ordered o' course but that don't matter that's what i want now an' no less think it lucky i offer to pay back when i get well be sensible i'm friendly enough very well presently my grandfather blacker than common about brow and eyes but a shade paler in the cheek came into the bar parlour and opened the trade cash box not the one that mrs grimes had hidden among the cinders but a smaller one used for gold and silver he counted out a number of sovereigns twenty i believe put the box away and returned to the back room and in a few minutes with little more talk mr viney was gone grandfather nat came into the bar parlour again and his face cleared when he saw me as it always would no matter how he had been ruffled he stood looking in my face for a little but with the expression of one whose mind is engaged elsewhere then he rubbed his hand on my head and said abstractedly and rather to himself i fancied than to me never mind stevy we got it back beforehand forty times over a remark that i thought over afterward in bed with the reflection that forty times twenty was eight hundred but mr viney's talk in the back room brought most oddly into my mind in a way hard to account for the first question i put to my grandfather after my arrival at the hole in the wall did you ever kill a man grandfather nat chapter xv stephen's tale the repeated multiplication of twenty by forty sent me to sleep that night and i woke with that arithmetical exercise still running in my head a candle was alight in the room ours was one of several houses in wapping wall without gas and i peeped sleepily over the bed clothes grandfather nat was sitting with the cash box on his knees and the pocket book open in his hand he may just have been counting the notes over again or not but now he was staring moodily at the photograph that lay with them once or twice he turned his eyes aside and then back again to the picture as though searching his memory for some old face then i thought he would toss it away as something valueless but when his glance fell on the fireless grate he returned the card to its place and locked the box when the cash box was put away in the little cupboard at his bed head he came across and looked down at me at first i shut my eyes but peeped i found him looking on me with a troubled and thoughtful face so that presently i sat up with a jump and asked him what he was thinking about fox's sleep stevy he said with his hand under my chin well boy i was thinking about you i was thinking it's a good job your father's coming home soon stevy though i don't like parting with you parting with me i did not understand wouldn't father be going away again soon well i dunno stevy i dunno i've been thinking a lot just lately that's a fact this place is good enough for me but it ain't a good place to bring up a boy like you in not to make him the man i want you to be stevy somehow it didn't strike me that way at first though it ought to ha' done it ought to ha' done seein' it struck strangers an' not particular moral strangers at that he was thinking of blind george and mrs grimes though at the moment i wondered if his talk with mr viney had set him doubting no stevy he resumed it ain't giving you a proper chance keeping you here you can't get lavender water out o' the bilge an' this part's the bilge of all london i want you to be a better man than me stevy i could not imagine anybody being a better man than grandfather nat and the prospect of leaving him oppressed me dismally and where was i to go i remembered the terrible group of aunts at my mother's funeral and a shadowy fear that i might be transferred to one of those virtuous females perhaps to aunt martha put a weight on my heart don't send me away gran'fa nat i pleaded with something pulling at the corners of my mouth i haven't been a bad boy yet have i he caught me up and sat me on his fore arm so that my face almost touched his and i could see my little white reflection in his eyes you're the best boy in england stevy he said and kissed me affectionately the best boy in the world an' i wouldn't let go o' you for a minute but for your own good but see now stevy see as to goin' away now you'll have to go to school my boy won't you an' the best school we can manage a gentleman's school boardin' school you know well that'll mean goin' away won't it an' then it wouldn't do for you to go to a school like that not from here you know which you'll understand when you get there among the others my boy my boy an' your father's has got to be as good a gentleman as any of 'em an' not looked down on because o' comin' from a wapping public like this an' sent by a rough old chap like me see i thought very hard over this view of things which was difficult to understand who should look down on me because of grandfather nat of whom i was so fond and so proud grandfather nat who had sailed ships all over the world had seen storms and icebergs and wrecks and who was treated with so much deference by everybody who came to the hole in the wall then i thought again of the aunts at the funeral and remembered how they had tilted their chins at him and i wondered with forebodings if people at a boarding school were like those aunts so i've been thinking stevy i've been thinking my grandfather went on after a pause now there's the wharf on the cop the work's gettin' more and grimes is gettin' older but you don't know about the wharf grimes is the man that manages there for me he's mrs grimes's brother in law an' when his brother died he recommended the widder to me an' that's how she came an' now she's gone but that's neither here nor there years ago grimes himself an' a boy was enough for all the work there was now there's three men reg'lar an' work for more most o' the lime comes off the barges there for the new gas works an' more every week now there's business there an' a respectable business too much for grimes an' if your father'll take on a shore job an' it's a hard life the sea here it is he can have a share have the lot if he likes for your sake stevy an' it'll build up into a good thing grimes'll be all right we can always find a job for him an' you can go an' live with your father somewhere respectable an' convenient not such a place as wapping an' not such people an' you can go to school from there like any other young gentleman we'll see about it when your father comes home but shan't i ever see you gran'fa' nat see me my boy ay that you will if you don't grow too proud that you will an' great times we'll have you an' your father an' me all ashore together in the holidays won't we an' i'll take care of your own little fortune the notes till you're old enough to have it i've been thinking about that too here he stood me on my bed and playfully pushed me back and forward by the shoulders i've been thinking about that an' if it was lyin' loose in the street i'd be puzzled clean to say who'd really lost it what with one thing an' another but it ain't in the street an' it's yours with no puzzle about it but there lie down stevy an' go to sleep your old grandfather's holdin' forth worse'n a parson eh comes o' bein' a lonely man an' havin' nobody to talk to except myself till you come lie down an' don't bother yourself we must wait till your father comes home we'll keep watch for the juno in the list she ought to ha' been reported at barbadoes before this an' we must run down to blackwall too an' see if there's any letters from him so go to sleep now stevy we'll settle it all we'll settle it all when your father comes home so i lay and dozed with words to send me to sleep instead of figures till they made a tune and seemed to dance to it when father comes home when father comes home we'll settle it all when father comes home and presently in some unaccountable way mr cripps came into the dance with his up to their r'yals up to their r'yals the wessels is deep in up to their r'yals and so i fell asleep wholly in the morning i was astir early and watching the boats and the shipping from the bedroom window ere my grandfather had ceased his alarming snore it was half an hour later and grandfather nat was busy with his razor on the upper lip that my cheeks so well remembered when we heard joe the potman at the street door whereat i took the keys and ran down to let him in a feat which i accomplished by aid of a pair of steps much tugging at heavy bolts and a supreme wrench at the big key joe brought lloyd's list in with him every morning from the early newsagent's in cable street i took the familiar journal at once and dived into the midst of its quaint narrow columns crowded with italics in hope of news from barbadoes for i wished to find for myself and run upstairs with a child's importance to tell grandfather nat but there was no news from barbadoes that is there was no news of my father's ship the name barbadoes stood boldly enough with reports below it of arrivals and sailings and one of an empty boat washed ashore but that was all so i sat where i was content to wait and to tell grandfather nat presently offhand from over my paper like a politician in the bar that there was no news thus cutting the leaves with a table knife my mind on my father's voyage it occurred to me that i could not spell la guaira the name of the port his ship was last reported from and i turned the paper to look for it the name was there with only one message attached and while i was slowly conning the letters over for the third time i was suddenly aware of a familiar word beneath the name of the juno herself and this was the notice that i read la guaira sep the juno brig of london beecher from this for barbadoes foundered n of margarita total loss all crew saved except first mate master and crew landed margarita chapter xvi stephen's tale i cannot remember how i reached grandfather nat i must have climbed the stairs and i fancy i ran into him on the landing but i only remember his grim face oddly grey under the eyes as he sat on his bed and took the paper in his hand i do not know even what i said and i doubt if i knew then the only words present to my mind were all crew saved except first mate and very likely that was what i said my grandfather drew me between his knees and i stood with his arm about me and his bowed head against my cheek i noticed bemusedly that with his hair fresh brushed the line between the grey and the brown at the back was more distinct than common and when there was a sudden clatter in the bar below i wondered if joe had smashed something or if it were only a tumble of the pewters so we were for a little and then grandfather nat stood up with a sound between a sigh and a gulp looking strangely askant at me as though it surprised him to find i was not crying for my part i was dimly perplexed to see that neither was he though the grey was still under his eyes and his face seemed pinched and older come stevy he said and his voice was like a groan we'll have the house shut again i cannot remember that he spoke to me any more for an hour except to ask if i would eat any breakfast which i did with no great loss of appetite though indeed i was trying very hard to think hindered by an odd vacancy of mind that made a little machine of me breakfast done my grandfather sent joe for a cab to take us to blackwall i was a little surprised at the unaccustomed conveyance and rather pleased when we were ready to go we found mr cripps and two other regular frequenters of the bar waiting outside i think mr cripps meant to have come forward with some prepared condolence but he stopped short when he saw my grandfather's face and stood back with the others the four wheeler was a wretched vehicle reeking of strong tobacco and stale drink for half the employment of such cabs as the neighbourhood possessed was to carry drunken sailors flush of money who took bottles and pipes with them everywhere whether it was the jolting of the cab wapping streets were paved with cobbles that shook my faculties into place whether it was the association of the cab and the journey to blackwall that reminded me of my mother's funeral or whether it was the mere lapse of a little time i cannot tell but as we went the meaning of the morning's news grew on me and i realised that my father was actually dead drowned in the sea and that i was wholly an orphan and it struck me with a sense of self reproach that the fact afflicted me no more than it did when my mother and my little brother had died i had cried myself sodden and faint but now heavy of heart as i was i felt curiously ashamed that grandfather nat should see me tearless true i had seen very little of my father but when he was at home he was always as kind to me as grandfather nat himself and led me about with him everywhere and last voyage he had brought me a little boomerang and only laughed when i hove it through a window that cost him three shillings thus i pondered blinkingly in the cab and i set down my calmness to the reflection that my mother would have him always with her now and be all the happier in heaven for it for she always cried when he went to sea so at last we came in sight of the old quay and had to wait till the bridge should swing behind a sea beaten ship with her bulwarks patched with white plank and the salt crust thick on her spars i could see across the lock the three little front windows of our house shut close and dumb and i could hear the quick chanty from the quay where the capstan turned o i served my time on the black ball line hurrah for the black ball line from the south sea north to the sixty nine hurrah for the black ball line and somehow with that i cried at last the ship passed in the bridge shut and the foul old cab rattled till it stopped before the well remembered door the house had been closed since my mother was buried grandfather nat paying the rent and keeping the key on my father's behalf and now the door opened with a protesting creak and a shudder and the air within was close and musty there were two letters on the mat where they had fallen from the letter flap and both were from my father as was plain from the writing we carried them into the little parlour where last we had sat with the funeral party and my grandfather lifted the blind and flung open the window then he sat and put one letter on each knee stevy he said and again his voice was like a groan look at them postmarks ain't one belize yes one was belize the other la guaira and both for my mother ah one's been lyin' here the other must ha' come yesterday by the same mail as brought the news he took the two letters again turned them over and over and shook his head then he replaced them on his knees and rested his fists on his thighs just above where they lay i don't know as we ought to open 'em stevy he said wearily i dunno stevy i dunno he turned each over once more and shut his fists again i dunno i dunno man an' wife between 'emselves wouldn't do it living stevy boy we'll take 'em home an' burn 'em but to me the suggestion seemed incomprehensible even shocking i could see no reason for burning my father's last message home perhaps there's a little letter for me gran'father nat i said he used to put one in sometimes can't we look and mother used to read me her letters too my grandfather sat back and rubbed his hand up through his hair behind as he would often do when in perplexity at last he said well well it's hard to tell we should never know what we'd burnt if we did we'll look stevy an' i'll read no further than i need come the belize letter's first send i ain't doin' wrong that's all he tore open the cover and pulled out the sheets of flimsy foreign note paper holding them to the light almost at arm's length as long sighted men do and as he read slowly as always with a leathery forefinger following the line the grey under the old man's eyes grew wet at last and wetter what the letter said is no matter here there was talk of me in it and talk of my little brother or sister as it might have been for all my father could know and again there was the same talk in the second letter the one from la guaira but in this latter another letter was enclosed larger than that for my mother which was in fact uncommonly short and here where the dead spoke to the dead no more but to the living was matter that disturbed my grandfather more than all the rest the enclosure was not for me as i had hoped but for grandfather nat himself and it was not a simple loose sheet folded in with the rest but a letter in its own smaller envelope close shut down with the words capn kemp on the face my grandfather read the first few lines with increasing agitation and then called me to the window see here stevy he said it's wrote small to get it in an' i'm slow with it read it out quick as you can and so i read the letter which i keep still worn at the folds and corners by the old man's pocket where he carried it afterward dear father just a few lines private hoping they find you well this is my hardest trip yet and the queerest and i write in case anything happens and i don't see you again this is for yourself you understand and i have made it all cheerful to the mrs specially as she is still off her health no doubt father the juno was not meant to come home this trip and if ever she rounds blackwall point again it will be in spite of the skipper he had his first try long enough back on the voyage out and it was then she was meant to go for she was worse found than ever i saw a ship even a ship of viney's and not provisioned for more than half the run out proper rations and i say it plain and will say it as plain to anybody that the vessel would have been piled up or dropped under and the insurance paid months before you get this if i had not pretty nigh mutinied more than once he said he would have me in irons but he shan't have the chance if i can help it you know beecher four times i reckon he has tried to pile her up every time in the best weather and near a safe port foreign the men would have backed me right through some of them did but they deserted one after another all round the coast monte video rio and bahia and small blame to them and we filled up with half breeds and such the last of the ten and the boy went at bahia so that now i have no witness but the second mate and he is either in it or a fool i think a fool but perhaps both not a man to back me else i might have tried to report or something at belize though that is a thing best avoided of course no doubt he has got his orders so i am not to blame him perhaps but i have got no orders not to lose the ship i mean and so i am doing my duty twice i have come up and took the helm from him but that was with the english crew aboard he has been quiet lately and perhaps he has given the job up at any rate i expect he won't try to pile her up again more likely a quiet turn below with a big auger he is still mighty particular about the long boat being all right and the falls clear etc if he does it i have a notion it may be some time when i have turned in i can't keep awake all watches and he knows i am about the only man aboard who won't sign whatever he likes before a consul you know what i mean and you know beecher too don't tell the mrs of course say this letter is about a new berth or what not no doubt it is all right but it came in my head to drop you a line on the off chance and a precious long line i have made of it so no more at present from your affectionate son nathaniel ps i am in half a mind to go ashore at barbadoes and report but perhaps best not that sort of thing don't do while i read my grandfather had been sitting with his head between his hands and his eyes directed to the floor so that i could not see his face so he remained for a little while after i had finished while i stood in troubled wonder then he looked up his face stern and hard beyond the common and his was a stern face at best stevy he said do you know what that means that you've been a readin' i looked from his face to the letter and back again it means means i think the skipper sank the ship on purpose it means murder my boy that's what it means murder by the law of england 'feloniously castin' away an' destroyin'' that's what they call the one thing though i'm no lawyer man an' it means prison though why when a man follows orders faithful i can't say but well i know it an' if any man loses his life thereby it's murder whether accidental or not murder an' the rope by the law of england an' bitter well i know that too o bitter well i know it he passed his palm over his forehead and eyes and for a moment was silent then he struck the palm on his knee and broke forth afresh murder by the law of england even if no more than accident in god's truth how much the more then this here when the one man as won't stand and see it done goes down in his berth o i've known that afore too with a gimlet through the door frame an' i know beecher but orders is orders an' it's them as gives them as is to reckon with i've took orders myself lord lord an' i've none but a child to talk to a little child but you're no fool stevy see here now an' remember you know what's come to your father he's killed wilful murdered like what they hang people for at newgate stevy by the law an' do you know who's done it i was distressed and bewildered as well as alarmed by the old man's vehemence the captain i said whimpering again viney my grandfather shouted henry viney as i might ha' served the same way an' i wish i had viney and marr's done it an' marr's paid for it already lord lord he went on with his face down in his hands and his elbows on his knees lord i see a lot of it now it was what they made out o' the insurance that was to save the firm an' when my boy put in an' stopped it all the voyage out an' more they could hold on no longer but plotted to get out with what they could lay hold of lord it's plain as print plain as print stevy he lowered his hands and looked up stevy that money's more yours now than ever if i ever had a doubt if it don't belong to the orphan they've made but there it's sent you boy sent you an' any one 'ud believe in providence after that in a moment more he was back at his earlier excitement but it's viney's done it he said with his fist extended before him remember stevy when you grow up it's viney's done it an' it's murder by the law of england viney has killed your father an' if it was brought against him it 'ud be murder then i said we'll go to the police station and they will catch him my grandfather's hand dropped ah stevy stevy he groaned you don't know you don't know it ain't enough for that an' if it was if it was i can't i can't not with you to look after i might do it an' risk all if it wasn't for that my god it's a judgment on me a cruel judgment my own son an' just the same way just the same way i can't stevy not with you to take care of stevy i must keep myself safe for your sake an' i can't raise a hand to punish viney i can't stevy i can't for i'm a guilty man myself by the law of england an' viney knows it viney knows it though it wasn't wilful as god's my judge grandfather nat ended with a groan and sat still with his head bowed in his hands again i remembered and now with something of awe my innocent question did you ever kill a man grandfather nat still he sat motionless and silent till i could endure it no longer for in some way i felt frightened so i went timidly and put my arm about his neck i fancied though i was not sure that i could feel a tremble from his shoulders but he was silent still nevertheless i was oddly comforted by the contact and presently like a dog anxious for notice ventured to stroke the grey hair soon then he dropped his hands and spoke i shouldn't ha' said it stevy but i'm all shook an' worried an' i talked wild it was no need to say it but there ain't a soul alive to speak to else an' somehow i talk as it might be half to myself but you know what about things i say private things don't you remember he sat erect again and raised a forefinger warningly even sternly remember stevy but come there's things to do give me the letter we'll get together any little things to be kep' papers an' what not an' take 'em home an' i'll have to think about the rest what's best to be done sell 'em or what but i dunno i dunno chapter xvii in blue gate in her den at the black stair top in blue gate musky mag lurked furtive and trembling after the inquests at the hole in the wall where dan ogle might be hiding she could not guess and she was torn between a hundred fears and perplexities dan had been seen and could be identified of that she was convinced and more than convinced since she had heard mr cripps's testimony moreover she well remembered at what point in her own evidence the police inspector had handed the note to the coroner and she was not too stupid to guess the meaning of that how could she warn dan how help or screen him how put to act that simple fidelity that was the sole virtue remaining in her all the greater for the loss of the rest she had no money on the other hand she was confident that dan must have with him the whole pocket book full of notes which had cost two lives already and now seemed like to cost the life she would so gladly buy with her own for they had not been found on kipps's body nor in any way spoken of at the inquest but then he might fear to change them he could scarcely carry a single one to the receivers who knew him for his haunts would be watched more a reward was offered and no receiver would be above making an extra fifty pounds on the transaction for to her tortured mind it seemed every moment more certain that the cry was up and not the police alone but everybody else was on the watch to give the gallows its due she was uneasy at having no message doubtless he needed her help as he had needed it so often before doubtless he would come for it if he could but that would be to put his head in the noose how could she reach him and give it even if she had known where he lay to go to him would be to lead the police after her for she had no doubt that her own movements would be watched she knew that the boat wherein he had escaped had been found on the opposite side of the river and she like others judged from that that he might be lurking in some of the waterside rookeries of the south bank the more as it was the commonest device of those wanted in ratcliff or wapping to go for a change to rotherhithe or bankside and for those in a like predicament on the southern shores to come north in the same way but again to go in search of him were but to share with the police whatever luck might attend the quest so that musky mag feared alike to stay at home and to go abroad longed to find dan and feared it as much wished to aid him yet equally dreaded that he should come to her or that she should go to him and there was nothing to do therefore but to wait and listen anxiously to listen for voices or footsteps even for creaks on the stairs for a whistle without that might be a signal for an uproar or a sudden hush that might announce the coming of the police into blue gate even for a whisper or a scratching at door or window wherewith the fugitive might approach fearful lest the police were there before him but at evening when the place grew dark and the thickest of the gloom drew together to make a monstrous shadow on the floor where once she had fallen over something in the dark then she went and sat on the stair head watching and dozing and waking in terror so went a day and a night and another day the corners of the room grew dusk again and with the afternoon's late light the table flung its shadow on that same place on the floor so that she went and moved it toward the wall as she set it down she started and crouched for now at last there was a step on the stair an unfamiliar step a woman's it would seem and stealthy musky mag held by the table and waited the steps ceased at the landing and there was a pause then with no warning knock the door was pushed open and a head was thrust in covered by an old plaid shawl a glance about the room and the rest of the figure followed closing the door behind it and the shawl being flung back from over the bonnet there stood mrs grimes rusty and bony slack faced and sour mrs grimes screwed her red nose at the woman before her jerked up her crushed bonnet and plucked her rusty skirt across her knees with the proper virtuous twitch then said mrs grimes where's my brother dan for a moment musky mag disbelieved eyes and ears together the visit itself even more than the question amazed and bewildered her she had been prepared for any visitor but this for mrs grimes's relationship to dan ogle was a thing that exemplary lady made as close a secret as she could as in truth was very natural she valued herself on her respectability she was the widow of a decent lighterman of a decent lightering and wharf working family and she called herself house keeper though she might be scarce more than charwoman at the hole in the wall she had never acknowledged her lawless brother when she could in any way avoid it and she had indeed bargained that he should not come near her place of employment lest he compromise her and so far from seeking him out in his lodgings she even had a way of failing to see him in the street what should she want in blue gate at such a time as this asking thus urgently for her brother dan what but the reward for an instant mag's fears revived with a jump though even as it came she put away the fancy that such might be the design of any sister however respectable where's my brother dan repeated mrs grimes abruptly i i don't know mum faltered mag husky and dull i ain't seen 'im for for some time o nonsense i want 'im particular i got somethink to tell 'im important if you won't say where 'e is go an' find 'im i wish i could mum truly but i can't do you mean 'e's left you mrs grimes bridled high and helped it with a haughty sniff no mum not quite in your way of speakin' i think mum but 'e's 'e's just gone away for a bit ho in trouble again you mean eh o no mum not there mag answered readily for with her trouble was merely a genteel name for gaol not there not for a long while where then that's what i dunno mum not at all mrs grimes tightened her lips and glared plainly she believed none of these denials p'raps 'e's wanted she snapped an' keepin' out o' the way just now is that it this was what no torture would have made mag acknowledge but with all her vehemence of denial her discomposure was plain to see no mum not that she declared pleadingly reely 'e ain't mum reely 'e ain't not that pooh exclaimed mrs grimes seating herself with a flop that's a lie plain enough 'e's layin' up somewhere an' you know it what harm d'ye suppose i'm goin' to do 'im 'e ain't robbed me leastways not lately i got a job for 'im i tell you money in 'is pocket if you won't tell me go an' tell 'im go on an' i'll wait it's gawd's truth mum i don't know where 'e is mag protested earnestly 'ark there's someone on the stairs they'll 'ear go away mum do i'll try an' find 'im an' tell 'im s'elp me i will go away they're comin' in truth the footsteps had reached the stair top and now with a thump the door was thrust open and blind george appeared his fiddle under his arm his stick sweeping before him and his white eye rolling at the ceiling hullo he sung out lady visitors or is it on'y one 'tain't polite to tell the lady to go away mag good afternoon mum good afternoon he nodded and grinned at upper vacancy as one might at a descending angel mrs grimes meanwhile close at his elbow preparing to get away as soon as he was clear past her for blind george's keenness of hearing was well known and she had no mind he should guess her identity good afternoon mum the blind man repeated havin' tea he advanced another step and extended his stick what he added suddenly turning what table gone what's this doin' a guy clearin' out no george mag answered i only moved the table over to the wall 'ere it is come an' feel it she made a quick gesture over his shoulder and mrs grimes hurried out on tip toe but at the first movement blind george turned sharply there she goes he said making for the door she don't like me timid little darlin' hullo my dear he roared down the stairs hullo you never give me a kiss i know you won't you say good bye he waited a moment listening intently but mrs grimes scuttled into the passage below without a word and instantly blind george supplemented his endearments with a burst of foul abuse and listened again this expedient succeeded no better than the first and mrs grimes was gone without a sound that might betray her identity blind george shut the door who was that he asked oh nobody partic'lar mag answered with an assumption of indifference on'y a woman i know name o' jane what d'you want ah now you're come to it blind george put his fiddle and bow on the table and groped for a chair fust he went on is there anybody else as can 'ear eh cracks or crannies or peepholes eh 'cause i come as a pal to talk private business i do it's all right george nobody can hear what is it why said the blind man catching her tight by the arm and leaning forward to whisper it's dan that's what it is it's dan she was conscious of a catching of the breath and a thump of the heart and blind george knew it too for he felt it through the arm it's dan he repeated so now you know if it's what you'd like listened to go on she said ah well fust thing all bein' snug 'ere's five bob catch 'old he slid his right hand down to her wrist and with his left pressed the money into hers all right don't be frightened of it it won't 'urt ye lord i bet dan 'ud do the same for me if i wanted it though 'e is a bit rough sometimes i ain't rich but i got a few bob by me an' if a pal ain't to 'ave 'em who is eh who is he grinned under the white eye so ghastly a counterfeit of friendly good will that the woman shrank and pulled at the wrist he held lord love ye he went on holding tight to the wrist i ain't the bloke to round on a pal as is under a cloud see what i might 'a' done if i'd 'a' wanted i might 'a' gone an' let out all sorts o' things as you know very well yerself at the inquest both the inquests but did i not me not a bit of it that ain't my way no i lay low an' said nothing what arter that why there's fifty quid reward offered fifty quid a fortune to a pore bloke like me an' all i got to do is to go and say 'dan ogle' to earn it them two words an' no more ain't that the truth d'y' hear ain't that the truth he tugged at her wrist to extort an answer and the woman's face was drawn with fear but she made a shift to say with elaborate carelessness reward what reward george i dunno nothin' about it gr r r he growled pushing the wrist back but gripping it still that ain't 'andsome not to a pal it ain't not to a faithful pal as comes to do y' a good turn you know all about it well enough an' you needn't think as i don't know too blind ain't i blind from a kid but not a fool you ought to know that by this time not a fool look 'ere with another jerk at the woman's arm look 'ere the last time i was in this 'ere room there was me an' you an' dan an' two men as is dead now an' post mortalled an' inquested an' buried wasn't there well dan chucked me out i ain't bearin' no malice for that mind ye ain't i just give ye five bob an' ain't i come to do ye a turn i was chucked out but ye don't s'pose i dunno what 'appened arter i was gone do ye eh the room was grown darker and though the table was moved the shadow on the floor took its old place and took its old shape and grew but it was no more abhorrent than the shadowy face with its sightless white eye close before hers and the hand that held her wrist and by it seemed to feel the pulse of her very mind she struggled to her feet let go my wrist she said i'll light a candle you can go on don't light no candle on my account he said chuckling as he let her hand drop it's a thing i never treat myself to there's parties as is afraid o' the dark they tell me i'm used to it she lit the candle and set it where it lighted best the place of the shadow then she returned and stood by the chair she had been sitting in go on she said again what's this good turn you want to do me ah he replied that's the pint he caught her wrist again with a sudden snatch and drew her forward sit down my gal sit down an' i'll tell ye comfortable what was i a sayin' oh what 'appened arter i was gone yes well that there visitor was flimped clean clean as a whistle but fust eh fust blind george snapped his jaws and made a quick blow in the air with his stick eh eh ah well never mind but now i'll tell you what the job fetched eight 'undred an' odd quid in a leather pocket book an' a silver watch eh i thought that 'ud make ye jump blind ain't i blind from a kid but not a fool well now he proceeded so far all right if i can tell ye that i can pretty well tell ye all the rest can't i all about bob kipps goin' off to sell the notes an' dan watchin' 'im bein' suspicious an' catchin' 'im makin' a bolt for the river an' eh he raised the stick in his left hand again but now point forward with a little stab toward her breast eh eh like that eh all right don't be frightened i'm a pal i am it served that cove right i say playin' a trick on a pal i don't play a trick on a pal i come 'ere to do 'im a good turn i do don't i well dan got away an' good luck to 'im 'e got away clear over the river with the eight 'undred quid in the leather pocket book an' now 'e's a layin' low an' snug an' more good luck to 'im says i bein' a pal ain't that right mag shuffled uneasily go on she said if you think you know such a lot you ain't come to that good turn yet that you talk so much about right now i'll come to it now you know i know as much as anybody more'n anybody 'cept dan p'rhaps a bit more'n what you know yourself an' i kep' it quiet when i might 'a' made my fortune out of it kep' it quiet bein' a faithful pal an' bein' a faithful pal an' all i come 'ere with five bob for ye bein' all i can afford 'cos i know you're a bit short though dan's got plenty got a fortune why should you be short an' dan got a fortune on'y 'cos you want a pal as you can trust like me that's all 'e can't come to you 'cos o' showin' 'isself you can't go to 'im 'cos of being watched an' follered so i come to do ye both a good turn goin' between one to another where is 'e mag was in some way reassured she feared and distrusted blind george and she was confounded to learn how much he knew but at least he was still ignorant of the essential thing so she said knowin' so much more'n me i wonder you dunno that too any'ow i don't what you dunno dunno where 'e is no i don't no more'n you o that's all right all right for anybody else but not for a pal like me not for a pal as is doin' y' a good turn besides it ain't you on'y it's 'im 'ow'll 'e get on with the stuff 'e won't be able to change it an' 'e'll be as short as you an' p'rhaps get smugged with it on 'im that 'ud never do an' i can get it changed what part o' rotherhithe is it eh i can easy find 'im is it dockhead there or anywhere for all i know i tell ye george i dunno no more'n you let go my arm go on but he gave it another pull an angry one what what he cried if dan knowed as you was keepin' 'is ol' pal george from doin' 'im a good turn what 'ud 'e do eh 'e'd give it you my beauty wouldn't 'e eh eh he twisted the arm ground his teeth and raised his stick menacingly but this was a little too much he was a man and stronger but at any rate he was blind she rose and struggled to twist her arm from his grasp if you don't put down that stick george she said if you don't put it down an' let go my arm i'll give it you same as bob kipps got it s'elp me i will i'll give you the chive i will don't you make me desprit he let go the wrist and laughed whoa beauty he cried don't make a rumpus with a faithful pal if you won't tell me i s'pose you won't bein' a woman whether it's bad for dan or not eh i tell you i can't george i swear solemn i dunno no more'n you p'rhaps not so much 'e ain't bin near nor sent nor nothing since since then that's gospel truth if i do 'ear from 'im i'll well then i'll see will ye tell 'im then 'ere

when i see 'im i s'pose you want to make your bit out of it pal or not there y'are he answered quickly there y'are if you won't believe in a pal look at that if i make a fair deal man to man with them notes an' get money for 'em instead o' smuggin' quids instead o' quod i'll 'ave my proper reg'lars won't i an' proper reg'lars on all that paid square 'ud be more'n i could make playin' the snitch if dan'll be open to reason see you won't forget eh he took her arm again eagerly above the elbow know what to say don't ye best for all of us 'e mustn't show them notes to a soul till 'e sees me i'm a pal i got the little tip 'ow to do it proper see now you know gimme my fiddle 'ere we are where's the door all right don't forget blind george clumped down the black stair and so reached the street of blue gate at the door he paused listening till he was satisfied of musky mag's movements above then he walked a few yards along the dark street and stopped from a black archway across the street a man came skulking out and over the roadway to blind george's side it was viney well he asked eagerly what's your luck blind george swore vehemently but quietly precious little he answered she dunno where 'e is i thought at first it was kid but it ain't she ain't 'eard an' she dunno i couldn't catch hold o' the other woman an' she got away an' never spoke you see 'er again when she came out didn't ye know 'er not me she kept her shawl tighter about her head than ever an' if she hadn't it ain't likely i'd know her what now stand watch again i'm sick of it so am i but it's for good pay if it comes off five minutes might do it you get back an' wait in case i tip the whistle viney crept growling back to his arch and blind george went and listened at mag's front door for a few moments more then he turned into the one next it and there waited invisible listening still five minutes went and did not do it and ten minutes went and five times ten blue gate lay darkling in evening and foul shadows moved about it from one den and another came a drawl and a yaup of drunken singing a fog from the river dulled the lights at the highway end and slowly crept up the narrow way it was near an hour since viney and blind george had parted when there grew visible coming through the mist from the highway the uncertain figure of a stranger drifting dubiously from door to door staring in at one after another and wandering out toward the gutter to peer ahead in the gloom blind george could hear as well as another could see that here was a stranger in doubt seeking somebody or some house soon the man middle sized elderly a trifle bent and all dusty with lime came in turn to the door where he stood and at once blind george stepped full against him with an exclamation and many excuses beg pardon guv'nor pore blind chap 'ope i didn't 'urt ye was ye wantin' anybody in this 'ouse the limy man looked ahead and reckoned the few remaining doors to the end of blue gate well he said i fancy it's 'ere or next door d'ye know a woman o' the name o' mag mag flynn i'm your bloke guv'nor know 'er rather up 'ere i'll show ye lord love ye she's an old friend o' mine come on i should say you'd be in the lime trade guv'nor wouldn't you i smelt it pretty strong an' i'll never forget the smell o' lime why says you why 'cos o' losin' my blessed sight with lime when i was a innocent kid fell on a slakin' bed guv'nor an' blinded me blessed self so i won't forget the smell o' lime easy ain't you in the trade now ain't i right he stopped midway on the stairs to repeat the question ain't i right is it yer own business or a firm ah well i do 'ave to do with lime a good bit said the stranger evasively but go on or else let me come past blind george turned and reaching the landing thumped his stick on the door and pushed it open 'ere y'are he sang out 'ere's a genelman come to see ye as i found an' showed the way to lord love ye 'e'd never 'a' found ye if it wasn't for me but i'm a old pal ain't i a faithful old pal he swung his stick till he found a chair and straightway sat in it like an invited guest lord love ye yes he continued rolling his eye and putting his fiddle across his knees one o' the oldest pals she's got or 'im either the newcomer looked in a puzzled way from blind george to the woman and back again it's private business i come about he said shortly all right guv'nor shouted blind george heartily out with it we're all pals 'ere old pals you ain't my old pal anyhow the limy man observed an' if the room's yours we'll go an' talk somewheres else get out george go along said mag with some asperity but more anxiety you clear out go on o all right if you're goin' to be unsociable said the fiddler rising damme i don't want to stay not me i was on'y doin' the friendly that's all bein' a old pal but i'm off all right i'm off so long he hugged his fiddle once more and clumped down into the street he tapped with his stick till he struck the curb and then crossed the muddy roadway while viney emerged again from the dark arch to meet him all right said blind george whispering huskily it's business now i think business you come on now you'll 'ave to foller 'em if they come out together if they don't well you must look arter the one as does chapter xviii on the cop when the limy man left blue gate he went first to the hole in the wall there to make to captain kemp some small report on the wharf by the lea this did not keep him long and soon he was on his journey home to the wharf itself by way of the crooked lanes and the commercial road he had left blue gate an hour and more when musky mag emerged from her black stairway peering fearfully about the street ere she ventured her foot over the step so she stood for a few seconds and then as one chancing a great risk stepped boldly on the pavement and turning her back to the highway walked toward back lane this was the nearer end of blue gate and the corner turned she stopped short and peeped back satisfied that she had no follower she crossed back lane and taking every corner as she came to it with a like precaution threaded the maze of small ill lighted streets that lay in the angle between the great rope walk and commercial road this wide road she crossed and then entered the dark streets beyond in rear of the george tavern and so keeping to obscure parallel ways sometimes emerging into the glare of the main road more commonly slinking in its darker purlieus but never out of touch with it she travelled east following in the main the later course of the limy man who had left blue gate by its opposite end the fog that had dulled the lights in ratcliff highway met her again near limehouse basin but ere she reached the church she was clear of it once more beyond the shops grew few and the lights fewer for a little while decent houses lined the way the houses of those last merchants who had no shame to live near the docks and the works that brought their money at last amid a cluster of taverns and shops that were all for the sea and them that lived on it the east india dock gates stood dim and tall flanked by vast raking walls so that one might suppose a chinese city to seethe within and away to the left the dark road that the wall overshadowed was lined on the other side by hedge and ditch with meadows and fields beyond that were now no more than a vast murky gulf so that no stranger peering over the hedge could have guessed aright if he looked on land or on water or on mere black vacancy here the woman made a last twist turning down a side street and coming to a moment's stand in an archway this done she passed through the arch into a path before a row of ill kept cottages and so gained the marshy field behind the accident hospital the beginning of the waste called the cop here the great blackness was before her and about her and she stumbled and laboured on the invisible ground groping for pits and ditches and standing breathless again and again to listen the way was so hard as to seem longer than it was and in the darkness she must needs surmount obstacles that in daylight she would have turned often a ditch barred her way and when after long search a means of crossing was found it was commonly a plank to be traversed on hands and knees there were stagnant pools too into which she walked more than once and twice she suffered a greater shock of terror first at a scurry of rats and later at quick footsteps following in the sodden turf the footsteps after all of nothing more terrible than a horse of inquiring disposition out at grass so she went for what seemed miles though there was little more than half a mile in a line from where she had left the lights to where at last she came upon a rough road seamed with deep ruts and made visible by many whitish blotches where lime had fallen and had there been ground into the surface to the left this road stretched away toward the lights of bromley and bow common and to the right it rose by an easy slope over the river wall skirting the lea and there ended at kemp's wharf not a creature was on the road and no sound came from the black space behind her with a breath of relief she set foot on the firmer ground and hurried up the slope from the top of the bank she could see kemp's wharf just below with two dusty lighters moored in the dull river and beyond the river the measureless dim abbey marsh nearer among the sheds a dog barked angrily at the sound of strange feet a bright light came from the window of the little house that made office and dwelling for the wharf keeper and something less of the same light from the open door for there the limy man stood waiting leaning on the door post and smoking his pipe he grunted a greeting as mag came down the bank bit late he said but it ain't easy over the cop for a stranger where the woman whispered eagerly where is he the limy man took three silent pulls at his pipe then he took it from his mouth with some deliberation and said remember what i said i don't want 'im 'ere i dunno what 'e's done an' don't want but if 'e likes to come 'idin' about i ain't goin' to play the informer i dunno why i should promise as much as that just 'cos my brother married 'is sister she ain't done me no credit from what i 'ear now though she 'ad a good master as i can swear 'cos 'e's mine too where is he was all mag's answer again in an anxious whisper unnerstand the limy man went on i'm about done with the pair on 'em now but i ain't goin' to inform 'e come 'ere a day or two back an' claimed shelter an' seein' as i was goin' up to wappin' to night 'e wanted me to tell you where 'e was well i've done that an' i ain't goin' to do no more see 'e ain't none o' mine an' i won't 'ave part nor parcel with 'im nor any of ye i keep myself decent i do i shan't say 'e's 'ere an' i shan't say 'e ain't an' the sooner 'e goes the better 'e'll please me see yes mr grimes sir but tell me where he is the limy man took his pipe from his mouth and pointed with a comprehensive sweep of the stem at the sheds round about you can go an' look in any o' them places as ain't locked he said off handedly the dog's chained up try the end one fust grimes the wharfinger resumed his pipe and mag scuffled off to where the light from the window fell on the white angle of a small wooden shelter the place was dark within dusted about with lime and its door stood inward she stopped and peered all right growled dan ogle from the midst of the dark can't ye see me now y' 'ave come and he thrust his thin face and big shoulders out through the opening o dan the woman cried putting out her hands as though she would take him by the neck but feared repulse o dan thank gawd you're safe dan i bin dyin' o' fear for you dan g r r r he snorted stow that what i want's money got any chapter xix on the cop it was at a bend of the river wall by the lea in sight of kemp's wharf that dan ogle and his sister met at last dan had about as much regard for her as she had for him and the total made something a long way short of affection but common interests brought them together mrs grimes had told mag that she knew of something that would put money in dan's pocket and as money was just what dan wanted in his pocket he was ready to hear what his sister had to tell more especially as it seemed plain that she was unaware exactly of the difficulty that had sent him into hiding so instructed by mag she came to the cop on a windy morning where from the top of the river wall one might look east over the abbey marsh and see an unresting and unceasing press of grey and mottled cloud hurrying up from the flat horizon to pass overhead and vanish in the smoke of london to the west mrs grimes avoided the wharf for she saw no reason why her brother in law her late employer's faithful servant should witness her errand she climbed the river wall at a place where it neared the road at its bromley end and thence she walked along the bank top arrived where it made a sharp bend she descended a little way on the side next the river and there waited dan on the look out from his shed spied her be ribboned bonnet from afar and went quietly and hastily under shelter of the river wall toward where she stood coming below her on the tow path he climbed the bank and brother and sister stood face to face unashamed ruffianism looking shabby respectability in the eyes umph growled dan so 'ere y'are my lady yes the woman answered 'ere i am an' there you are a nice respectable sort of party for a brother ah ain't i if i was as respectable as my sister i might get a job up at the hole in the wall mightn't i 'specially as i 'ear as there's a vacancy through somebody gettin' the sack over a cash box mrs grimes glared and snapped i s'pose you got that from 'im she said jerking her head in the direction of the wharf well i ain't come 'ere to call names i come about that same cash box at any rate i come about what's in it dan there's a pile o' bank notes in that box that don't belong to cap'en nat kemp no more'n they belong to you or me nor as much p'raps if you'll put up a good way o' gettin' at 'em you put up a way as wasn't a good un seemin'ly said dan 'ow d'ye mean they don't belong to kemp there was a murder at the hole in the wall a week ago eh dan's jaw shut with a snap and his eye was full of sharp inquiry a man was stabbed against the bar parlour door an' the one as did it got away over the river one o' the two dropped a leather pocket book full o' notes an' the kid kemp's grandson picked it up in the rush when nobody see it i see it though afterward when the row was over i peeped from the stairs an' i see kemp open it an' take out notes bunches of 'em dozens ah you did did ye dan observed staring hard at his sister bunches o' bank notes dozens see a photo too likeness of a woman an' a boy 'cos it was there mrs grimes stared now why yes she said but but 'ow do you come to know eh dan was you was you never mind whether i was nor where i was if it 'adn't been for you i'd a had them notes now safe an' snug 'stead o' cap'en nat you lost me them i did yes you wouldn't 'ave me come to the hole in the wall in case cap'en nat might guess i was yer brother bein' so much like ye like you g r r r 'ope i ain't got a face like that ho yes you're a beauty dan ogle ain't ye but what's all that to do with the notes mrs grimes's face was blank with wonder and doubt but in her eyes there was a growing and hardening suspicion what's all that to do with the notes it's all to do with 'em 'cos o' that i let another chap bring a watch to sell 'stead o' takin' it myself an' 'e come back with a fine tale about cap'en nat offerin' to pay 'igh for them notes an' so i was fool enough to let 'im take them too 'stead o' goin' myself but i watched 'im though watched 'im close 'e tried to make a bolt an' an' so cap'en nat got the notes after all it seems then dan said mrs grimes retreating a step dan it was you it was you an' you're hiding for it the man stood awkward and sulky like a loutish schoolboy detected and defiant well he said at length s'pose it was you ain't got no proof of it an' if you 'ad what 'a' ye come 'ere for eh she regarded him now with a gaze of odd curiosity which lasted through the rest of their talk much as though she were convinced of some extraordinary change in his appearance which nevertheless eluded her observation i told you what i come for she answered after a pause about gettin' them notes away from kemp the old wretch umph old wretch 'cos 'e wanted to keep 'is cash box eh well what's the game mrs grimes in no way abated her intent gaze but she came a little closer with a sidling step as if turning her back to a possible listener there was two inquests at the hole in the wall she said two on the same day there was kipps as lost the notes when cap'en kemp got 'em an' there was marr the shipowner an' it was 'im as lost 'em first she took a pace back as she said this looking for its effect but dan made no answer albeit his frown grew deeper and his eye sharper and he stood alert ready to treat his sister as friend or enemy according as she might approve herself marr lost 'em first she repeated an' i can very well guess how though when i came here i didn't know you was in it how did i know thinks you that marr lost 'em first i got eyes an' i got ears an' i got common sense an' i see the photo you spoke of marr an' 'is mother most likely anyhow the boy was marr plain whoever the woman was it on'y wanted a bit o' thinkin' to judge what them notes had gone through but i didn't dream you was so deep in it lor no wonder mag was frightened when i see 'er still dan said nothing but his eyes seemed brighter and smaller perhaps dangerous so the woman proceeded quickly it's all right you needn't be frightened of my knowin' things all the more reason for your gettin' the notes now if you lost 'em before but it's halves for me mind ye ain't it halves for me dan was silent for a moment then he growled we ain't got 'em yet no but it's halves when we do get 'em or else i won't say another word ain't it halves dan ogle could afford any number of promises if they would win him information all right he said halves it is then when we get 'em an' how are we goin' to do it mrs grimes sidled closer again marr the shipowner lost 'em first she said an' he was pulled out o' the river dead an' murdered just at the back o' the hole in the wall see well don't see it kemp's got the pocket book yes don't see it yet well there's more there's a room at the back o' the hole in the wall where it stands on piles with a trap door over the water the police don't know there's a trap door there i do dan ogle was puzzled and suspicious what's the good o' that he asked i didn't think you such a fool dan ogle there's a man murdered with notes on him an' a photo an' a watch you said there was a watch he's found in the river just behind the hole in the wall there's a trap door secret at the hole in the wall over the water just the place he might 'a' been dropped down after he was killed an' kemp the landlord's got the notes an' the pocket book an' the photo all complete an' most likely the watch too since you tell me he bought it an' viney could swear to 'em ain't all that enough to hang cap'en nat kemp if the police was to drop in sudden on the whole thing dan's mouth opened and his face cleared a little i s'pose he said you mean you might put it on to the police as it was cap'en nat did it an' when they searched they'd find all the stuff an' the pocket book an' the watch an' the likeness an' the trap door an' that 'ud be evidence enough to put 'im on the string of course i mean it replied mrs grimes with hungry spite in her eyes of course i mean it an' dearly i'd love to see it done too cap'en nat kemp with 'is money an' 'is gran'son 'e's goin' to make a gentleman of an' all ''ope you'll be honest where you go next' says cap'en kemp 'whether you're grateful to me or not' honest an' grateful i'll give 'im honest an' grateful dan ogle grinned silently no he said you won't forgive 'im i bet if it was only 'cos you began by makin' such a pitch to marry 'im a chuckle broke from behind the grin you'd rather hang him than get his cash box now i'll swear mrs grimes was red with anger i would that she cried you're nearer truth than you think dan ogle an' if you say too much you'll lose the money you're after for i'll go an' do it so now dan clicked his tongue derisively thought you'd come to tell me how to get the stuff he said 'stead o' that you tell me how to hang cap'en nat very clever an' lose it i don't see that helps us go an' threaten him threaten cap'en nat exclaimed dan glaring contempt and spitting it oh yes i see myself cap'en nat ain't that sort o' mug i'm as 'ard as most but i ain't 'ard enough for a job like that or soft enough for that's what i'd be to try it on lor' lumme go an' ask any man up the highway to face cap'en nat an' threaten him ask the biggest an' toughest of 'em ask jim crute with his ear like a blue bag that he chucked out o' the bar like a kitten last week 'cap'en nat' says i 'if you don't gimme eight hundred quid i'll hit you a crack' mighty fine plan that that 'ud get it wouldn't it ah it 'ud get something i didn't say that sort of threat you fool you've got no sense for anything but bashing there's the evidence that 'ud hang him go an' tell him that and say he shall swing for it if he doesn't hand over dan stared long and thoughtfully then his lip curled again pooh he said i'm a fool am i o anyhow whether i am or not i'm a fool's brother threaten cap'en nat with the evidence says you what evidence the evidence what he's got in his own hands s'pose i go like a mug an' do it fust thing he does after he's kicked me out is to chuck the pocket book an' the likeness on the fire an' the watch in the river then he changes the notes or sells 'em abroad an' how do we stand then why you're a bigger fool than i thought you was what's that it was nothing but a gun on the marsh where a cockney sportsman was out after anything he could hit but dan ogle's nerves were alert and throughout the conversation he had not relaxed his watch toward london so that the shot behind disturbed him enough to break the talk we've been here long enough he said you hook it i'll see about cap'en nat your way's no good i'll try another an' if that don't come off well then you can hang him if you like an' welcome but now hook it an' shut your mouth till i've had my go 'nough said don't go back the way you come chapter xx stephen's tale my father's death wrought in grandfather nat a change that awed me he looked older and paler even smaller he talked less to me but began i fancied to talk to himself withal his manner was kinder than before if that were possible though it was with a sad kindness that distressed and troubled me more than once i woke at night with candle light on my face and found him gazing down at me with a grave doubt in his eyes whereupon he would say nothing but pat my cheek and turn away early one evening as i sat in the bar parlour and my grandfather stood moodily at the door between that and the bar a man came into the private compartment whom i had seen there frequently before he was in fact the man who had brought the silver spoons on the morning when i first saw ratcliff highway and he was perhaps the most regular visitor to the secluded corner of the bar this time he slipped quietly and silently in at the door and remaining just within it out of sight from the main bar beckoned his manner suggesting business above the common but my grandfather only frowned grimly and stirred not as much as a finger the man beckoned again impatiently but there was no favour in grandfather nat's eye and he answered with a growl at that the man grew more vehement patted his breast pocket jerked his thumb and made dumb words with a great play of mouth you get out said grandfather nat a shade of surprise crossed the man's face and left plain alarm behind it his eyes turned quickly toward the partition which hid the main bar from him and he backed instantly to the door and vanished a little later the swing doors of the main bar were agitated and an eye was visible between them peeping they parted and disclosed the face of that same stealthy visitor but lately sent away from the other door reassured as it seemed by what he saw of the company present he came boldly in and called for a drink with an elaborate air of unconcern but as he took the glass from the potman i could perceive a sidelong glance at my grandfather and presently another captain nat however disregarded him wholly while the pale man aware of he knew not what between them looked alertly from one to the other ready to abandon his long established drink or to remain by it according to circumstances the man of the silver spoons looked indifferently from one occupant of the bar to the next as he took his cold rum there was the pale man and mr cripps and a sailor who had been pretty regular in the bar of late and who though noisy and apt to break into disjointed song was not so much positively drunk as never wholly sober and there were two others regular frequenters both having well satisfied himself of these the man of the silver spoons finished his rum and walked out scarce had the door ceased to swing behind him when he was once more in the private compartment now with a knowing and secure smile a cough and a nod for plainly he supposed there must have been a suspicious customer in the house who was now gone grandfather nat let fall the arm that rested against the door frame out you go he roared if you want another drink the other bar's good enough for you if you don't i don't want you here so out you go the man was dumbfounded he opened his mouth as though to say something but closed it again and slunk backward out you go shouted the unsober sailor in the large bar out you go you 'bey orders see lord you'd better 'bey orders when it's cap'en kemp ah i know i do and he shook his head stupidly sententious but the fellow was gone for good and the pale man was all eyes scratching his cheek feebly and gazing on grandfather nat out he goes the noisy sailor went on that's cap'en's orders cap'en's orders or mate's orders all's one like father like son ah i know' ah piped mr cripps a marvellous fine orficer cap'en kemp must ha' been aboard ship i'm sure might you ever ha' sailed under 'im me cried the sailor with a dull stare me under him well no not under him but cap'en's orders or mate's orders all's one p'raps pursued mr cripps in a lower voice with a glance over the bar p'raps you've been with young mr kemp the late him this with another and a duller stare him um ah well never mind never you mind see you mind your own business my fine feller mr cripps retired within himself with no delay and fixed an abstracted gaze in his half empty glass i think he was having a disappointing evening people were disagreeable and nobody had stood him a drink more captain nat had been quite impracticable of late and for days all approaches to the subject of the sign or the board to paint it on had broken down hopelessly at the start as to the man just sent away mr cripps seemed and no doubt was wholly indifferent captain nat was merely exercising his authority in his own bar as he did every day and that was all but the pale man was clearly uneasy and that with reason for as afterwards grew plain the event was something greater than it seemed indeed it was nothing less than the end of the indirect traffic in watches and silver spoons from that moment every visitor to the private compartment was sent away with the same peremptory incivility every one save perhaps some rare stranger of the better sort who came for nothing but a drink so that in course of a day or two the private compartment went almost out of use and the pale man's face grew paler and longer as the hours went he came punctually every morning as usual and sat his time out with the stagnant drink before him till he received my grandfather's customary order to drink up and then vanished till the time appointed for his next attendance but he made no more excursions into the side court after sellers of miscellaneous valuables from what i know of my grandfather's character i believe that the pale man must have been paid regular wages for grandfather nat was not a man to cast off a faithful servant though plainly the man feared it at any rate there he remained with his perpetual drink and so remained until many things came to an end together there was a certain relief and i think an odd touch of triumph in grandfather nat's face and manner that night as he kissed me and bade me good night as for myself i did not realise the change but i had a vague idea that my grandfather had sent away his customer on my account and for long i lay awake and wondered why chapter xxi in the bar parlour stephen was sound asleep and the hole in the wall had closed its eyes for the night the pale man had shuffled off with his doubts and apprehensions toward the highway and mr cripps was already home in limehouse only the half drunken sailor was within hail groping toward some later tavern and captain nat as he extinguished the lamps in the bar could hear his song in the distance the grub was bad an' the pay was low leave her johnny leave her so hump your duds an' ashore you go for it's time for us to leave her captain nat blew out the last light in the bar and went into the bar parlour he took out the cash box and stood staring thoughtfully at the lid for some seconds he was turning at last to extinguish the lamp at his elbow when there was a soft step without and a cautious tap at the door captain nat's eyes widened and the cash box went back under the shelf the tap was repeated ere the old man could reach the door and shoot back the bolts this done he took the lamp in his left hand and opened the door in the black of the passage a man stood tall and rough just such a figure captain nat had seen there before less distinctly and in a briefer glimpse for indeed it was dan ogle well said captain nat good evenin' cap'en dan answered with an uncouth mixture of respect and familiarity i jist want five minutes with you o you do do you replied the landlord reaching behind himself to set the lamp on the table what is it i've a notion i've seen you before very like cap'en it's all right on'y business then what's the business dan ogle glanced to left and right in the gloom of the alley and edged a step nearer best spoke of indoors he said hoarsely best for you an' me too nothin' to be afraid of on'y business afraid of phoo come in then dan complied with an awkward assumption of jaunty confidence and captain nat closed the door behind him nobody to listen i suppose asked ogle no nobody out with it well cap'en just now you thought you'd seen me before quite right so you have you see me in the same place just outside that there door an' i borrowed your boat umph captain nat's eyes were keen and hard is your name dan ogle that's it cap'en the voice was confident but the eye was shifty now you know a chap tried to do me an' i put his light out you went for me an' chased me but you stuck your hooks in the quids right enough dan ogle tried a grin and a wink but captain nat's frown never changed well well dan went on after a pause it's all right anyhow i outed the chap an' you took care o' the ha'pence so we helped each other an' done it atween us i just come along to night to cut it up cut up what why the stuff eight hundred an' ten quid in notes in a leather pocket book though i ain't particular about the pocket book dan tried another grin four hundred an' five quid'll be good enough for me though it ought to be more seein' i got it first an' the risk an' all captain nat with a foot on a chair and a hand on the raised knee relaxed not a shade of his fierce gaze who told you he asked presently that i had eight hundred an' ten pound in a leather pocket book o a little bird just a pretty little bird cap'en tell me the name o' that pretty little bird lord lumme cap'en don't be bad pals it ain't a little bird what'll do any harm it's all safe an' snug enough between us an' i'm doin' it on the square ain't i i knowed about you an' you didn't know about me but i comes fair an' open an' says it was me as done it an' i on'y want a fair share up between pals in a job together that's all right ain't it was it a pretty little bird in a bonnet an' a plaid shawl a scraggy sort of a little bird with a red beak the sort of little bird as likes to feather its nest with a cash box one as don't belong to it is that your pattern o' pretty little bird well well s'pose it is cap'en lord don't be bad pals i ain't am i make things straight an' i'll take care she don't go a pretty birdin' about with the tale i'll guarantee that honourable you ain't no need be afraid o' that d'ye think i look afraid love ye cap'en why i didn't mean that there ain't many what 'ud try to frighten you that ain't my tack you're too hard a nut for that anybody knows dan ogle fidgeted uneasily with a hand about his neck cloth while the other arm hung straight by his side but look here now cap'en he went on you're a straight man an' you don't round on a chap as trusts you that's right ain't it well truly captain nat's piercing stare his unwavering frown were disconcerting dan ogle had come confidently prepared to claim a share of the plunder just as he would have done from any rascal in blue gate but in presence of the man he knew for his master he had had to begin with no more assurance than he could force on himself and now though he had met not a word of refusal he was reduced well nigh to pleading but he saw the best opening as by a flash of inspiration and beyond that he had another resource if he could but find courage to use it well said captain nat you're the sort as plays the square game with a man as trusts you cap'en very well i've trusted you i come an' put myself in your way an' told you free what i done an' i ask as man to man for my fair whack o' the stuff bein' the straight man you are you'll do the fair thing captain nat brought his foot down from the chair and the knee from under his hand and he clenched the hand on the table but neither movement disturbed his steady gaze so he stood for three seconds then with an instant dart he had dan ogle by the hanging arm just above the wrist dan sprang and struggled but his wrist might have been chained to a post twice he made offer to strike at captain nat's face with the free hand but twice the blow fainted ere it had well begun tall and powerful as he was he knew himself no match for the old skipper pallid and staring he whispered hoarsely no cap'en no drop it don't put me away don't crab the deal d' y' 'ear captain nat grim and silent slowly drew the imprisoned fore arm forward and plucked a bare knife from within the sleeve there was blood on it for his grip had squeezed arm and blade together umph growled captain nat i saw that in time my lad and he stuck the knife in the shelf behind him s'elp me cap'en i wasn't meanin' anythink s'elp me i wasn't the ruffian pleaded cowering but vehement with his neckerchief to his cut arm that's on'y where i carry it s'elp me on'y where i keep it ah i've seen it done before but it's an awkward place if you get a squeeze the skipper remarked drily now you listen to me you say you've come an' put yourself in my power an' trusted me so you have with a knife up your sleeve but never mind that i doubt if you'd ha' had pluck to use it you killed a man at my door because of eight hundred pounds you'd got between you but to get that money you had to kill another man first no cap'en no don't try to deny it man why it's what's saving you i know where that money come from an' it's murder that got it marr was the man's name an' he was a murderer himself him an' another between 'em ha' murdered my boy murdered him on the high seas as much as if it was pistol or poison he was doin' his duty an' it's murder i tell you murder by the law of england that man ought to ha' been hung but he wasn't an' he never would ha' been he'd ha' gone free except for you an' made money of it but you killed that man dan ogle an' you shall go free for it yourself for that an' because i won't sell what you trusted me with about this other captain nat turned and took the knife from the shelf now see he went on you've done justice on a murderer little as you meant it but don't you come tryin' to take away the orphan's compensation not as much as a penny of it don't you touch the compensation or i'll give you up i will that just you remember when you're safe the man lied as spoke to seein' you that night by the door an' now he's gone back on it an' so you've nothing to fear from him an' nothing to fear from the police nothing to fear from anybody but me so you take care dan ogle come enough said captain nat flung wide the door and pitched the knife into the outer darkness there's your knife go after it chapter xxii on the cop when viney followed the limy man from musky mag's door he kept him well in view as far as the hole in the wall and there waited but when grimes emerged and viney took up the chase he had scarce made three quarters of the way through the crooked lanes toward the commercial road when in the confusion and the darkness of the turnings or in some stray rack of fog the man of lime went wholly amissing viney hurried forward doubled and scoured the turnings about him drawing them blank he hastened for the main road and there consumed well nigh an hour in profitless questing to and fro and was fain at last to seek out blind george and confess himself beaten but blind george made a better guess after viney's departure in the wake of grimes he had stood patiently on guard in the black archway and had got his reward for he heard musky mag's feet descend her stairs noted her timid pause at the door and ear watched her progress to the street corner there she paused again as he judged to see that nobody followed and then hurried out of earshot he was no such fool as to attempt to dog a woman with eyes but contented himself with the plain inference that she was on her way to see dan ogle and that the man whom viney was following had brought news of dan's whereabouts and with that he turned to the highway and his fiddling so that when he learned that the limy man had called at the hole in the wall and had gone out of viney's sight on his way east blind george was quick to think of kemp's wharf and to resolve that his next walk abroad should lead him to the lea bank the upshot of this was that after some trouble dan ogle and blind george met on the cop and that dan consented to a business interview with viney he was confident enough in any dealings with either of them so long as he cockered in them the belief that he still had the notes so he said very little except that viney might come and make any proposal he pleased hoping for some chance come expedient whereby he might screw out a little on account and so it followed that on the morning after his unsuccessful negotiation with captain nat dan ogle found himself face to face with henry viney at that self same spot on the bank side where he had talked with blind george dan was surly first because it was policy to say little and to seem intractable and again because after the night's adventure it came natural so you're viney are you he said well i ain't afraid o' you i know about you blind george told me your game who said anything about afraid viney protested the eternal grin twitching nervously in his yellow cheeks we needn't talk about being afraid it seems to me we can work together o does it how well you know you can't change 'em what o damn it you know what i mean the money the notes o that's what you mean is it well s'pose i can't well of course if you can't eh if you can't they might be so much rags eh p'raps they might if i can't but you know you can't retorted the other with a spasm of apprehension else you'd have done it and and got farther off well p'raps i might but that ain't all you come to say go on viney thoughtfully scratched his lank cheek peering sharply into dan's face things bein' what they are he said reflectively they're no more good to you than rags not so much all right s'pose they ain't you don't think i'm a goin' to make you a present of 'em do you why no i didn't think that i'll pay reasonable but you must remember that they're no good to you at all not worth rag price so whatever you got 'ud be clear profit then how much clear profit will you give me viney's forefinger paused on his cheek and his gaze which had sunk to dan ogle's waistcoat shot sharply again at his eyes ten pounds said viney dan chuckled partly at the absurdity of the offer partly because this bargaining for the unproducible began to amuse him ten pound clear profit for me he said an' eight hundred pound clear profit for you that's your idea of a fair bit o' trade but it was mine first and and it's no good to you you say so yourself no nor no good to you neither 'cause why you ain't got it dan's chuckle became a grin if you'd ha' said a hundred now what why then i'd ha' said four hundred that's what i'd ha' said four hundred why you're mad besides i haven't got it i've got nothing till i can change the notes only the ten dan saw the chance he had hoped for i'll make it dirt cheap he said first an' last no less an' no more will you give me fifty down for 'em when you've got 'em changed yes i will viney's voice was almost too eager straight no tricks eh viney was indignant at the suggestion he scorned a trick no hoppin' the twig with the whole lot an' leavin' me in the cart viney was deeply hurt he had never dreamed of such a thing very well i'll trust you give us the tenner on account dan ogle stuck out his hand carelessly but it remained empty i said i'd give fifty when they're changed grinned viney knowingly what well i know that an' not play no tricks an' now when i ask you to pay first the ten you've got you don't want to do it that don't look like a chap that means to part straight and square does it viney put his hand in his pocket all right he said that's fair enough ten now an' forty when the paper's changed where's the paper o i ain't got that about me just now dan replied airily be here to morrow same time but you can give me the ten now viney's teeth showed unamiably through his grin ah he said i'll be here to morrow with that same time what it was dan's honour that smarted now what won't trust me with ten when i offer free an' open to trust you with forty o it's off then i'm done it's enough to make a man sick and he turned loftily away viney's grin waxed and waned and he followed dan with his eyes thinking hard dan stole a look behind and stopped look here viney said at last look here let's cut it short we can't sharp each other and we're wasting time you haven't got those notes dan half turned and answered in a tone between question and retort o haven't i he said no you haven't see here i'll give you five pounds if you'll show 'em to me only show 'em dan was posed i said i hadn't got 'em about me he said rather feebly no nor can't get 'em can you cut it short dan looked up and down and rubbed his cap about his head i know where they are he sulkily concluded you know where they are but you can't get 'em viney retorted with decision can i get 'em dan glanced at him superciliously you he answered lord no can we get 'em together dan took to rubbing his cap about his head again and staring very thoughtfully at the ground then he came a step nearer and looked up two might he said if you'd see it through with nerve viney took him by the upper arm and drew close we're the two he said you know where the stuff is and you say we can get it we'll haggle no more we're partners and we'll divide all we get how's that how about blind george never mind blind george unless you want to make him a present i don't blind george can fish for himself he's shoved out we'll do it and we'll keep what we get now where are the notes who's got them dan ogle stood silent a moment considering he looked over the bank toward the london streets down on the grass at his feet and then up at an adventurous lark that sang nearer and still nearer the town smoke last he looked at viney and make up his mind who's got 'em he repeated cap'en nat kemp's got 'em what cap'en cap'en nat kemp's got 'em viney took a step backward turned his foot on the slope and sat back on the bank staring at dan ogle cap'en nat kemp he said cap'en nat kemp ay cap'en nat kemp the notes an' the leather pocket book an' the photo an' the whole kit marr's photo ain't it with his mother yes viney answered when he was a boy he wasn't a particular dutiful son but he always carried it for luck or something but cap'en kemp where did he get them dan ogle sat on the bank beside viney facing the river and there told him the tale he had heard from mrs grimes also he told him with many suppressions just as much of his own last night's adventure at the hole in the wall as made it plain that captain nat meant to stick to what he had got viney heard it all in silence and sat for a while with his head between his hands thinking and occasionally swearing at last he looked up and dropped one hand to his knee i'd have it out of him by myself he said if it wasn't that i want to lie low a bit dan grunted and nodded i know he replied the juno i know about that viney started what do you know about that he asked pretty well all you could tell me i hear things though i am lyin' up but i heard before too marr chattered like a poll parrot viney swore and dropped his other hand ay so blind george said well there's nothing for me out of the insurance and i'm going to let the creditors scramble for it themselves there'd be awkward questions for me with the books in the receiver's hands and what not so i'm not showing for a bit though he added thoughtfully i don't know that i mightn't try it even now dan's eyes grew sharp we're doin' this together mr viney he said you'd better not go tryin' things without me i mightn't like it i ain't a nice man to try games on with one's tried a game over this a'ready mind i'm trying no games viney protested tell us your way if you don't want to hear about mine dan ogle was sitting with his chin on his doubled fists gazing thoughtfully at the muddy river my way's rough he replied but it's thorough an' it wipes off scores i owe cap'en nat one viney looked curiously at his companion well he said an' there'd be more in it than eight hundred an' ten p'raps a lump more how viney's eyes widened umph dan was silent a moment then he turned and looked viney in the eyes are you game he asked you ain't a faintin' sort are you you oughtn't to be seein' you was a ship's officer viney's mouth closed tight no he said i don't think i am what is it dan ogle looked intently in his face for a few seconds and then said only him an' the kid sleeps in the house viney started you don't mean breaking in he exclaimed i won't do that it's too too ah too risky of course dan replied with a curl of the lip but i don't mean breakin' in nothing like it but tell me first s'pose breakin' in wasn't risky s'pose you knew you'd get away safe with the stuff would you do it then and he peered keenly at viney's face viney frowned that don't matter he said if it ain't the plan s'pose i would ha ha that'll do i know your sort not that i blame you about the busting it 'ud take two pretty tough 'uns to face cap'en nat i can tell you but now see here will you come with me an' knock at his side door to night after the place is shut knock and what then i'll tell you you know the alley down to the stairs yes black as pitch at night with a row o' posts holding up the house now when everybody's gone an' he's putting out the lights you go an' tap at the door well you tap at the door an' he'll come you're alone see i stand back in the dark behind a post he never sees me 'good evenin'' says you 'i just want a word with you if you'll step out' and so he does and what then nothing else not for you that's all your job easy enough ain't it viney turned where he sat and stared fixedly at his confederate's face and then then what then i come on he don't know i'm there behind him viney's mouth opened a little but with no grin and for a minute the two sat each looking in the other's face then said viney with a certain shrinking no no not that it's hanging you know it's hanging for both dan laughed an ugly laugh and short it ain't hanging for that he said it's hanging for gettin' caught an' where's the chance o' that we take our own time and the best place you ever see for a job like that river handy at the end an' all an' everything settled beforehand safe a job as ever i see look at me i ain't hung yet am i but i've took my chances an' took 'em when it wasn't safe like as this is viney stared at vacancy like a man in a brown study and his dry tongue passed slowly along his drier lips as for bein' safe dan went on what little risk there is is for me you're all right we don't know each other not likely how should you know i was hidin' there in the dark when you went to speak to cap'en nat kemp come to that it might ha' been you outed instead o' your friend what you was talkin' so sociable with an' there's more there than what's in the pocket book remember that there's a lump more than that viney rubbed his mouth with the back of his hand how do you know he asked huskily how do i know how did i know about the pocket book an' the notes i ain't been the best o' pals with my sister but she couldn't ha' been there all this time without my hearing a thing or two about cap'en nat to say nothing of what everybody knows as knows anything about him money o' course there's money in the place no telling how much an' watches an' things as he buys p'raps twice that eight hundred an' more viney's eyes were growing sharper growing eager it sounds all right he remarked a little less huskily especially if there's more in it than the eight hundred but but are you you know sure about it you leave that to me i'll see after my department an' yours is easy enough come it's a go ain't it but perhaps he'll make a row call out or something he ain't the sort o' chap to squeal an' if he was he wouldn't not the way i'm goin' to do it you'll see an' there's the boy what about him o the kid upstairs he's no account after we've outed cap'en nat no more'n a tame rabbit an' we'll have all night to turn the place over if we want it though we shan't we'll be split out before the potman comes fifty mile apart with full pockets an' nobody a ha'porth the wiser viney bit at his fingers and his eyes lifted and sank quick and keen from the ground to ogle's face and back again but it was enough and he asked for no more persuasion willing murderers both they set to planning details what viney should say if it were necessary to carry the talk with captain nat beyond the first sentence or so where they must meet and the like and here on viney's motion a change was made as regarded time not this immediate night but the night following was resolved on for the stroke that should beggar the hole in the wall of money and of life for to viney it seemed desirable first to get his belongings away from his present lodgings for plain reasons so as to throw off blind george and so as to avoid flight from a place where he was known on the very night of the crime this it were well to do at once yet all unprepared as he was he could not guess what delays might intervene and so for all reasons captain nat and the child were reprieved for twenty four hours thus in full terms the treaty was made dan ogle shrink as he might from captain nat face to face as any ruffian in blue gate would was as ready to stab him in the back for vengeance as for gain for he was conscious that never in all his years of bullying and scoundrelism had he cut quite so poor a figure in face of any man as last night in face of captain nat as to the gain it promised to be large and easy in the getting and for his sister now that she could help no more she could as readily be flung out of the business as blind george the opportunity was undeniable a better place for the purpose than the alley leading to the head of hole in the wall stairs could never have been planned once the house was shut and the potman gone no more was needed than to see the next police patrol go by and the thing was done here was the proper accomplice too a man known to captain nat and one with whom he would readily speak and in ogle's eyes the business was no more than a common stroke of his trade with an uncommon prospect of profit as for viney money was what he wanted and here it could be made as it seemed with no great risk it was surer far than going direct to captain nat and demanding the money under the old threat that was a little outworn and indeed was not so substantial a bogey as it might seem in the eyes of captain nat for years remorseful and now apprehensive for his grandchild's sake for the matter was old and evidence scarce except viney's own which it would worse than inconvenience him to give so that a large demand might break down while here as he was persuaded was the certainty of a greater gain which was the main thing and if any shadow of scruple against direct and simple murder remained it vanished in the reflection that not he but ogle would be the perpetrator as well as the contriver for himself he would but be opening an innocent conversation with kemp so viney told himself and so desire and conscience are made to run coupled all the world over and all time through all being appointed the two men separated they stood up they looked about them over the lea and over the ragged field and they shook hands chapter xxiii on the cop it was morning still as viney went away over the cop and when he had vanished beyond the distant group of little houses dan ogle turned and crept lazily into his shelter there to make what dinner he might from the remnant of the food that mag had brought him the evening before and to doze away the time on his bed of dusty sacks till she should bring more in the evening to come he would have given much for a drink for since his retreat to kemp's wharf the lime had penetrated clothes and skin and had invaded his very vitals more particularly it had invaded his throat and the pint or so of beer that mag brought in a bottle was not enough to do more than aggravate the trouble but no drink was there and no money to buy one else he might well have ventured out to a public house now that the police sought him no more as for grimes of the wharf who had been growing daily more impatient of dan's stay he offered no better relief than a surly reference to the pump so there was nothing for it but to sit and swear with the consolation that this night should be his last at kemp's wharf sunlight came with the afternoon and speckled the sluggish lea then the shadow of the river wall fell on the water and it was dull again and the sun itself grew duller and lower and larger in the haze of the town if dan ogle had climbed the bank and had looked across the cop now he would have seen blind george stick in hand feeling his way painfully among hummocks and ditches in the distance dan however was expecting nobody and he no longer kept watch on all comers so that blind george neared unnoted he gained the lime strewn road at last and walked with more confidence up and over the bank and down on the side next the river he went so boldly that one at a distance would never have guessed him blind for on any plain road he had once traversed he was never at fault and he turned with such readiness at the proper spot and so easily picked his way to the shed that dan had scarce more warning than could bring him as far as the door where they met dan the blind man said dan old pal it's you i can hear i'll bet ain't it where are ye and he groped for a friendly grip dan ogle was taken by surprise and a little puzzled still he could do no harm by hearing what blind george had to say so he answered all right what is it guided by the sound blind george straightway seized dan's arm for this was his way of feeling a speaker's thoughts while he heard his words he's gone he said gone clean do you know where dan glared into the sightless eye and shook his captured arm roughly who he asked viney did you let him have the stuff what stuff when what stuff that's a rum thing to ask unless o george dropped his voice and put his face closer anybody to hear he whispered no then why ask what stuff you didn't let him have it this morning did you dunno what you mean never seen him this morning blind george retracted his head with a jerk and a strange look grew on his face a look of anger and suspicion strange because the great colourless eye had no part in it dan he said slowly them ain't the words of a pal not of a faithful pal they ain't it's a damn lie lie yourself retorted dan thrusting him away let go my arm go on i knew he was coming blind george went on an' i follered up an' waited behind them houses other side the cop i want my whack i do i heared him coming away an' i called to him but he scuttled off i know his step as well as what another man 'ud know his face i'm a poor blind bloke but i ain't a fool what's your game telling me a lie like that he was standing off from the door now angry and nervously alert dan growled and then said you clear out of it you come to me first from viney didn't you very well you're his pal in this go and talk to him about it i've been that's where i've come from i've been to his lodgings in chapman street an' he's gone said he'd got a berth aboard ship a lie took his bag an' cleared soon as ever he could get back from here he's on for doing me out o' my whack arter i put it all straight for him that's about it you won't put me in the cart dan arter all i done where's he gone i dunno nothing about him i tell you dan answered angrily you sling your hook or i'll make ye dan said the blind man in a voice between appeal and threat dan i didn't put you away when i found you was here put me away you you can go an' try it now if you like i ain't wanted they won't have me an' if they would how long 'ud you last next time you went into blue gate or even if you didn't go eh how long would a man last that had both his eyes to see with eh and indeed blind george knew as well as dan himself that london was unhealthy for any traitor to the state and liberty of blue gate how long would he last you try it who wants to try it i on'y want to know shut your mouth blind george an' get out o' this place ogle cried fast losing patience and making a quick step forward go or you'll be lame as well as blind if i get hold o' ye blind george backed involuntarily but his blank face darkened and twisted devilishly and he gripped his stick like a cudgel ah i'm blind ain't i mighty bold with a blind man ain't ye if my eyes was like yours or you was blind as me you'd go roared dan furiously with two quick steps go the blind man backed as quickly fiercely brandishing his stick i'll go just as far as suits me dan ogle he cried i ain't goin' to be done out o' what's mine one of ye's got away but i'll stick to the other keep off i'll stick to ye till keep off as dan advanced the stick flourished at random fell on his wrist with a crack and in a burst of rage he rushed at the blind man and smote him down with blow on blow blind george beaten to a heap but cowed not at all howled like a wild beast and struck madly with his stick the stick reached its mark more than once and goaded ogle to a greater fury he punched and kicked at the plunging wretch at his feet who desperate and unflinching with his mouth spluttering blood and curses never ceased to strike back as best he might at the noise grimes came hurrying from his office for a moment he stood astonished and then he ran and caught dan by the arm i won't have it he cried if you want to fight you go somewhere else you why why damme the man's blind favoured by the interruption blind george crawled a little off smearing his hand through the blood on his face breathless and battered but facing his enemy still with unabashed malevolence for a moment ogle turned angrily on grimes but checked himself and let fall his hands blind he snarled he'll be dead too if he don't keep that stick to hisself that's what he'll be the blind man got on his feet and backed away smearing the grisly face as he went ah hold him back he cried with a double mouthful of oaths hold him hack for his own sake i ain't done with you dan ogle not yet fight ah i'll fight you an' fight you level i mean it i do i'll fight you level afore i've done with you dead i'll be will i not afore you an' not afore i've paid you so he passed over the bank threatening fiercely look here said grimes to ogle this ends this business i've had enough o' you you find some other lodgings all right ogle growled i'm going after to night i dunno why i was fool enough to let you come grimes pursued an' when i did i never said your pals was to come too i remember that blind chap now i see him in blue gate an' i don't think much of him an' there was another chap this morning up to no good none of ye an' like as not to lose me my job so i'll find another use for that shed see all right the other sulkily repeated i tell ye i'm going after to night chapter xxiv on the cop once he had cut clear from his lodgings without delay and trouble viney fell into an insupportable nervous impatience which grew with every minute his reasons for the day's postponement now seemed wholly insufficient it must have been he debated with himself that the first shock of the suggestion had driven him to the nearest excuse to put the job off as it were a dose of bitter physic but now that the thing was resolved upon and nothing remained to do in preparation the suspense of inactivity became intolerable and grew to torment it was no matter of scruple or compunction of that he never dreamed but the enterprise was dangerous and novel and as the vacant hours passed he imagined new perils and dreamed a dozen hangings till at last as night came on he began to fear that his courage could not hold out the time and since there was now no reason for delay he ended with a resolve to get the thing over and the money in his pockets that same night if it were possible and with that view he set out for the cop meantime no nervousness troubled his confederate for him it was but a good stroke of trade with a turn of revenge in it and the penniless interval mattered nothing could be slept off in fact more or less since there was nothing else to do the sun sank below london and night came slow and black over the marshes and the cop grimes rising from the doorstep of his office knocked the last ashes from his pipe and passed indoors dan ogle sitting under the lee of his shed found no comfort in his own empty pipe and no tobacco in his empty pocket he rose stretched his arms and looked across the lea and the cop he could see little or nothing for the dark was closing on him fast blind man's holiday muttered dan ogle and he turned in for a nap on his bed of sacks a sulky red grew up into the darkening western sky as though the extinguished sun were singeing all the world's edge so one saw london's nimbus from this point every night and saw below it the scattered spangle of lights that were the suburban sentries of the myriads beyond the cop and the marshes lay pitch black and nothing but the faint lap of water hinted that a river divided them here where an hour's habit blotted the great hum of london from the consciousness sounds were few the perseverance of the lapping water forced a groan now and again from the moorings of an invisible barge lying by the wharf and as often a ghostly rustle rose on the wind from an old willow on the farther bank and presently more distinct than either came a steady snore from the shed where dan ogle lay a rustle that was not of any tree began when the snore was at its steadiest a gentle rustle indeed where something some moving shadow in the black about it crept over the river wall clearer against a faint patch which had been white with lime in daylight the figure grew to that of a man a man moving in that murky darkness with an amazing facility address and quietness down toward the riverside he went and there stooping dipped into the water some small coarse bag of cloth that hung in his hand then he rose and after a listening pause turned toward the shed whence came the snore with three steps and a pause and three steps more he neared the door the stick he carried silently skimming the ground before him his face turned upward his single eye rolling blankly at the sky that was the same for him at night or noon and the dripping cloth he carried diffused a pungent smell as of wetted quick lime so creeping and listening he reached the door within the snore was regular and deep nothing held the door but a latch such as is lifted by a finger thrust through a hole he listened for a moment with his ear at this hole and then with infinite precaution inserted his finger and lifted the latch up by the george tavern beyond stepney henry viney was hastening along the commercial road to call dan ogle to immediate business ahead of him by a good distance musky mag hurried in the same direction bearing food in a saucer and handkerchief and beer in a bottle but hurry as they might here was a visitor well ahead of both the door opened with something of a jar and with that there was a little choke in the snore and a moment's silence then the snore began again deep as before down on his knees went dan ogle's visitor and so crawled into the deep of the shed he had been gone no more than a few seconds when the snore stopped it stopped with a thump and a gasp and a sudden buffeting of legs and arms and in the midst arose a cry a cry of so hideous an agony that grimes the wharf keeper snug in his first sleep fifty yards away sprang erect and staring in bed and so sat motionless for half a minute ere he remembered his legs and thrust them out to carry him to the window and the dog on the wharf leapt the length of its chain answering the cry with a torrent of wild barks floundering and tumbling against the frail boards of the shed the two men came out at the door in a struggling knot ogle wrestling and striking at random while the other cunning with a life's blindness kept his own head safe and hung as a dog hangs to a bull his hands gripped his victim by ear and hair while the thumbs still drove at the eyes the mess of smoking lime that clung and dripped about ogle's head it trickled burning through his hair and it blistered lips and tongue as he yelled and yelled again in the extremity of his anguish over they rolled before the doorway and ogle snatching now at last instead of striking tore away the hands from his face fight you level dan ogle fight you level now blind george gasped between quick breaths hit me now you're blind as me hit me knock me down eh quickly he climbed to his feet and aimed a parting blow with the stick that hung from his wrist dead he whispered hoarsely not afore i've paid you no he might have stayed to strike again but his own hands were blistered in the struggle and he hastened off toward the bank there to wash them clear of the slaking lime away on the wharf the dog was yelping and choking on its chain like a mad thing screaming still with a growing hoarseness and writhing where he lay the blinded wretch scratched helplessly at the reeking lime that scorched his skin and seared his eyes almost to the brain grimes came running in shirt and trousers and as soon as he could find how matters stood turned and ran again for oil good god he said lime in his eyes slaking lime why why it must be the blind chap it must fight him level he said an' he's blinded him there was a group of people staring at the patients' door of the accident hospital when viney reached the spot he was busy enough with his own thoughts but he stopped and stared also involuntarily the door was an uninteresting object however after all and he turned to find himself face to face with one he well remembered it was the limy man he had followed from blue gate to the hole in the wall and then lost sight of grimes recognised viney at once as ogle's visitor of the morning that's a pal o' yourn just gone in there he said viney was taken aback a pal he asked what pal ogle dan ogle he's got lime in his eyes an' blinded lime blinded how i ain't goin' to say nothing about how i dunno an' 'tain't my business he's got it anyhow there's a woman in there along of him his wife i b'lieve or something you can talk to her about it if you like when she comes out i've got nothing to do with it grimes had all the reluctance of his class to be mixed up in any matter likely to involve trouble at a police court and what was more he saw himself possibly compromised in the matter of ogle's stay at the wharf but viney was so visibly concerned by the news that soon the wharf keeper relented a little thinking him maybe no such bad fellow after all since he was so anxious about his friend i've heard said he added presently in a lower tone i've heard said it was a blind chap done it out o' spite but of course i dunno not to say myself on'y what i heard you see i don't think they'll let you in but you might see the woman they won't let her stop long 'specially takin' on as she was indeed it was not long ere musky mag emerged reluctant and pallid trembling at the mouth staring but seeing nothing grimes took her by the arm and led her aside with viney here's a friend o' dan's grimes said not unkindly giving the woman a shake of the arm he wants to know how he's gettin' on what's 'nucleate she asked hoarsely with a dull look in viney's face what's 'nucleate i heard a doctor say to let 'im rest to night an' 'nucleate in the mornin' what's 'nucleate some sort o' operation grimes hazarded did they say anything else blinded the woman answered weakly blinded but the pain's eased with the oil what did he say interposed viney fullest of his own concerns did he say someone did it he told me about it whispered but i shan't say nothing nor him not till he comes out i say he mustn't get talkin' about it viney said anxiously it it'll upset things tell him when you see him here listen he took her aside out of grimes's hearing it wouldn't do he said it wouldn't do to have anybody charged or anything just now we've got something big to pull off i say i ought to see him you know can't i see him but there someone might know me no but you must tell him he mustn't go informing or anything like that not yet tell him won't you chargin' infornin' mag answered with contempt in her shaking voice 'course 'e wouldn't go informin' not dan dan ain't that sort 'e looks arter hisself 'e does 'e don't go chargin' people not if 'e was dyin' indeed viney did not sufficiently understand the morals of blue gate where to call in the aid of the common enemy the police was a foul trick to which none would stoop in blue gate a man inflicted his own punishments and to ask aid of the police was worse than mean and scandalous it was weak and that in a place where the weak did not last as the phrase went it was the one restraint the sole virtue of the place enduring to death and like some other virtues in some other places it had its admixture of necessity for everybody was wanted in turn and to call for the help of a policeman who might as likely as not begin by seizing oneself by the collar would even have been poor policy bad equally for the individual and for the community so that to resort to the law's help in any form was classed with narking as the unpardonable sin you're sure o' that are you asked viney apprehensively sure 'course i'm sure dunno what sort o' chap you take 'im for 'e's no nark an' besides 'e can't there's other things an' she turned away with a sigh that was near a sob and her momentary indignation lapsed once more into anxious grief viney went off with his head confused and his plans in the melting pot ogle's scheme was gone by the board and alone he could scarce trust himself in any enterprise so desperate what should he do now make what terms he might with captain nat need was pressing but he must think chapter xxv stephen's tale i have said something of the change in my grandfather's habits after the news of the loss of the juno and my father's death something but not all not only was he abstracted in manner and aged in look but he grew listless in matters of daily life and even doubtful and infirm of purpose an amazing thing in him whose decision of character had made his a corner of the world in which his will was instant law and with it and through it all i could feel that i was the cause it ain't the place for you stevy never the place for you he would say wistful and moody wholly disregarding my protests which i doubt he even heard i've put one thing right he said once thinking aloud as i sat on his knee but it ain't enough it ain't enough and i was sure that he was thinking of the watches and spoons as to that matter people with valuables had wholly ceased from coming to the private compartment but the pale man still sat in his corner and joe the potman still supplied the drink he neglected his uneasiness grew less apparent in a day or so but he remained puzzled and curious though no doubt well enough content with this the most patent example of grandfather nat's irresolution as for mr cripps that deliberate artist's whole practice of life was disorganised by captain nat's indifference and he was driven to depend for the barest necessaries on the casual generosity of the bar in particular he became the client of the unsober sailor i have spoken of already the disciplinarian who had roared confirmation of my grandfather's orders when the man of the silver spoons got his dismissal this sailor was old in the ways of wapping as in the practice of soaking it would seem and he gave himself over to no crimp being ashore with money to spend he preferred to come alone to the bar of the hole in the wall and spend it on himself getting full measure for every penny beyond his talent of ceaselessly absorbing liquor without becoming wholly drunk and a shrewd eye for his correct change he exhibited the single personal characteristic of a very demonstrative respect for captain nat kemp he would confirm my grandfather's slightest order with shouts and threats which as often as not were only to be quelled by a shout or a threat from my grandfather himself a thing of instant effect however ay ay sir the man would answer and humbly return to his pot cap'en's orders he would sometimes add with a wink and a hoarse whisper to a chance neighbour always 'bey cap'en's orders knowed 'em both father an' son so that mr cripps's ready acquiescence in whatever was said loudly and in particular his own habit of blandiloquence led to a sort of agreement between the two and an occasional drink at the sailor's expense but meantime his chief patron was grown so abstracted from considerations of the necessities of genius so impervious to hints so deaf to all suggestion of grant in aid that mr cripps was driven to a desperate and dramatic stroke one morning he appeared in the bar carrying the board for the sign no tale of a board no description or account of a board no estimate or admeasurement of a board but the actual solid material board itself by what expedient he had acquired it did not fully appear and indeed with him cash and credit were about equally scarce but upon one thing he most vehemently insisted that he dared not return home without the money to pay for it the ravening creditor would be lying in wait at the corner of his street mr cripps's device for breaking through captain nat's abstraction succeeded beyond all calculation for my grandfather laid hands on mr cripps and the board together and hauled both straightway into the skippers' parlour at the back there's the board he said with decision an' there's you where's the paints an' brushes mr cripps's stock of paints was low it seemed or exhausted his brushes were at home and his creditor was at the corner of the street if i could take the proceeds mr cripps began but grandfather nat interrupted here's you an' here's the board an' we'll soon get the tools i'll send for 'em or buy new here joe joe'll get 'em you say what you want an' he'll fetch 'em here you are an' here you stick an' do my signboard mr cripps dared not struggle for his liberty and indeed a promise of his meals at the proper hours reconciled him to my grandfather's defiance of magna charta so the skipper's parlour became his studio and there he was left in company with his materials a pot of beer and a screw of tobacco i much desired to see the painting but it was ruled that mr cripps must not be disturbed i think i must have restrained my curiosity for an hour at least ere i ventured on tip toe to peep through a little window used for the passing in and out of drinks and empty glasses here my view was somewhat obstructed by mr cripps's pot which being empty he had placed upside down in the opening as a polite intimation to whomsoever it might concern but i could see that mr cripps's labours having proceeded so far as the selection of a convenient chair he was now taking relaxation in profound slumber so i went away and said nothing when at last he was disturbed by the arrival of his dinner mr cripps regained consciousness with a sudden bounce that almost deposited him on the floor conception he gasped rubbing his eyes conception an' meditation an' invention is what you want in a job like this ah replied my grandfather grimly that's all is it then common things like dinner don't matter perhaps joe'd better take it away but it seemed that mr cripps wanted his dinner too he had it but grandfather nat made it clear that he should consider meditation wholly inconsistent with tea so that in course of the afternoon mr cripps was fain to paint the board white and so earn a liberal interval of rest while it dried and at night he went away home without the price of the board but instead a note to the effect that the amount was payable on application to captain kemp at the hole in the wall wapping this note was the production after three successive failures of my own pen and to me a matter of great pride and delight so that i was sadly disappointed to observe that mr cripps received it with emotions of a wholly different character next morning mr cripps returned to durance with another pot and another screw of tobacco grandfather nat had business in the minories in the matter of a distiller's account and for this reason divers injunctions stipulations and warnings were entered into and laid upon mr cripps before his departure as for instance it was agreed that mr cripps should remain in the skipper's parlour also after some trouble that no exception should be made to the foregoing stipulation even in the event of mr cripps feeling it necessary to go out somewhere to study a brick wall or the hole in it from nature nor even if he felt overcome by the smell of paint agreed however that an exception be granted in the event of the house being on fire further this with more trouble that one pot of beer before dinner is enough for any man seriously bent on the pursuit of art moreover that the board must not be painted white again lastly that the period of invention and meditation be considered at an end and that sleep on mr cripps's part be regarded as an acknowledgment that meals are over for the day these articles being at length agreed and confirmed and mr cripps having been duly witnessed to make certain marks with charcoal on the white board as a guarantee of good faith grandfather nat and i set out for the minories his moodiness notwithstanding it was part of his new habit to keep me near him as much as possible day and night with a sort of wistful jealousy so we walked hand in hand over the swing bridge past paddy's goose into the highway and on through that same pageant of romance and squalor the tradesmen at their doors saluted grandfather nat with a subdued regard as i had observed most people to do since the news of juno's wreck indeed that disaster was very freely spoken of all along the waterside as a deliberate scuttling and it was felt that captain nat could lay his bereavement to something worse than the fair chance of the seas such things were a part of the daily talk by the docks and here all the familiar features were present while it was especially noted that nothing had been seen of viney since the news came he meant to lie safe said the gossips since as a bankrupt he stood to gain nothing by the insurance one tradesman alone a publican just beyond blue gate greeted my grandfather noisily but he was thoughtless with the pride of commercial achievement for he was enlarging his bar a large one already by the demolition of the adjoining shop and he was anxious to exhibit and explain his designs why good mornin' cap'en cried the publican from amid scaffold poles and brick dust you're a stranger lately see what i'm doin' here come in here an' look how's this eh another pair o' doors just over there an' the bar brought round like so an' that for bottle an' jug and throw the rest into public bar eh the party wall had already been removed and the structure above rested on baulks and beams the bar was screened off now from the place of its enlargement by nothing but canvas and tarpaulin and my grandfather and his acquaintance stood with their backs to this to survey the work of the builders waiting by my grandfather's side while he talked i was soon aware that business was brisk in the bar beyond the canvas and i listened idly to the hum of custom and debate suddenly i grew aware of a voice i knew an acrid voice just within the canvas then if you're useless i ain't said the voice an' i shan't let it drop and indeed it was mrs grimes who spoke i looked up quickly at grandfather nat but he was interested in his discussion and plainly had not heard mrs grimes's declaration drew a growling answer in a man's voice wholly indistinct and i found a patch in the canvas with a loose corner which afforded a peep hole mrs grimes was nearest with her back to the canvas so that her skirts threatened to close my view opposite her were two persons in the nearest of whom i was surprised to recognise the coarse faced woman i had seen twice before once when she came asking confused questions to grandfather nat about the man who sold a watch and once when she fainted at the inquest and mrs grimes was too respectable to stay near her the woman looked sorrowful and drawn about the eyes and cheeks and she held to the arm of a tall raw boned man his face was seamed with ragged and blistered skin and he wore a shade over the hollows where now peeping upward i could see no eyes but shut and sunken lids so that at first it was hard to recognise the fellow who had been talking to this same coarse faced woman by blue gate when she left him to ask those questions of my grandfather and indeed i should never have remembered him but that the woman brought him to my mind it was this man whose growling answer i had heard now mrs grimes spoke again all my fault from the beginning she said o yes i like that because i wanted to keep myself respectable my fault or not i shan't wait any longer for you if i ain't to have it you shan't an' if i can't get the money i can get something else the man growled again and swore and beat his stick impotently on the floor you're a fool he said can't you wait till i'm a bit straight you an' your revenge pah when there's money to be had not much to be had your way it seems the mess you've made of it an' precious likely to do any better now ain't you an' as to money well there's rewards given grandfather nat's hand fell on my cap and startled me he had congratulated his friend approved his plans made a few suggestions and now was ready to resume the walk he talked still as he took my hand and stood thus for a few minutes by the door exchanging views with the publican on the weather the last ships in and the state of trade i heard one more growl louder and angrier than the others from beyond the screen and a sharper answer and then there was a movement and the slam of a door and i got over the step and stretched my grandfather's arm and my own to see mrs grimes go walking up the street when we were free of the publican i told grandfather nat that i had seen mrs grimes in the bar he made so indifferent a reply that i said nothing of the conversation i had overheard for indeed i knew nothing of its significance and so we went about our business chapter xxvi stephen's tale on our way home we were brought to a stand at the swing bridge which lay open to let through a ship we were too late for the perilous lock for already the capstans were going and the ship's fenders were squeaking and groaning against the masonry so we stood and waited till fore main and mizzen had crawled by and then i was surprised to observe foremost and most impatient among the passengers on the opposite side mr cripps the winches turned and the bridge swung and my surprise grew when i perceived that mr cripps made no effort to avoid grandfather nat but hurried forward to meet him well said my grandfather gruffly house on fire no sir no but i thought sign done no cap'en not done exactly but i just got curious noos an' so i come to meet you what's the news not p'raps exactly as you might say noos sir but information information that's been transpired to me this mornin' more or less unique information so to say uncommon unique much uniquer than usual with these repetitions mr cripps looked hard in my grandfather's eyes as one does who wishes to break news or lead up to a painful subject what's it all about asked grandfather nat the juno well she was scuttled wilful cap'en kemp scuttled wilful by beecher it's more'n rumour or scandal it's plain evidence my grandfather looked fixedly at mr cripps what's the plain evidence he asked that chap that's been so much in the bar lately mr cripps answered his eyes wide with the importance of his discovery the chap that soaks so heavy an' shouts at any one you order out he was aboard the juno on the voyage out an' he deserted at monte video to a homeward bound ship then he doesn't know about the wreck i thought my grandfather made this objection almost eagerly no cap'en but he deserted 'cos he said he preferred bein' on a ship as was meant to come back an' one as had some grub aboard him an' others beecher tried to pile 'em up time an' again an' says the chap conolly's his name says he anything as went wrong aboard the juno was beecher's doin' which was prophesied in the fo'c'sle a score o' times 'fore she got to monte video an' an' conolly said more mr cripps stole another sidelong glance at grandfather nat confidential to me this mornin' conolly said more what he said it was the first officer your son cap'en as prevented the ship bein' piled up on the voyage out an' all but knocked beecher down once an' he said they was near fightin' half the time he was with 'em an' he said surprisin' solemn too solemn as a man could as was half drunk that after what he'd seen an' heard anything as happened to the first mate was no accident or anything like it that's what he said cap'en confidential to me this mornin' we were walking along together now and mr cripps seemed puzzled that his information produced no more startling effect on my grandfather the old man's face was pale and hard but there was no sign of surprise which was natural seeing that this was no news as mr cripps supposed but merely confirmation he said there was never any skipper so partic'ler about the boats an' davits bein' kep' in order as beecher was that trip mr cripps proceeded an' he kep' his own life belt wonderful handy as for the crew they kep' their kit bags packed all the time they could see enough for that an' he said there was some as could say more'n he could we came in view of the hole in the wall and mr cripps stopped short he don't know i'm tellin' you this he said he came in the skipper's room with a drink an' got talkin' confidential he's very close about it you know what sailors are grandfather nat frowned and nodded indeed nobody knew better the common sailor man's horror of complications and land shark troubles ashore of anything that might lead to his being asked for responsible evidence even for his own protection it gave impunity to three quarters of the iniquity practised on the high seas an' then o' course he's a deserter mr cripps proceeded so i don't think you'd better say i told you cap'en not to him you can give information or i can an' then they'll make him talk at the old bailey an' they'll bring others grandfather nat winced and turned away then he stopped again and said angrily damn you don't meddle keep your mouth shut an' don't meddle mr cripps's jaw dropped and his very nose paled but but he stammered but cap'en it's murder murder agin beecher an' viney too you'll do something when it's your own son your own son an' it's murder cap'en my grandfather went two steps on his way with a stifled groan murder he muttered murder it is by the law of england mr cripps came at his heels very blank in the face suddenly my grandfather turned on him again pale and fierce shut your mouth d'ye hear stow your slack jaw an' mind your own business or i'll grandfather nat lifted his hand and i believe nothing but a paralysis of terror kept mr cripps from a bolt several people stopped to stare and the old man saw it so he checked his wrath and walked on i'll see that man he said presently flinging the words at mr cripps over his shoulder and so we reached the hole in the wall mr cripps sat speechless in the bar and trembled while grandfather nat remained for an hour in the skipper's parlour with conolly the half drunken what they said one to another i never learned nor even if my grandfather persuaded the man to tell him anything though there can be no doubt he did for myself i moved uneasily about the bar parlour and presently i slipped out into the alley to gaze at the river from the stair head i was troubled vaguely as a child often is who strives to analyse the behaviour of his elders i stared some while at the barges and the tugs and at bill stagg's boat with its cage of fire as it went in and about among the shipping i looked at the bills on the wall where new tales of men and women found drowned displaced those of a week ago and i fell again into the wonderment and conjecture they always prompted and last i turned up the alley though whether to look out on the street or to stop at the bar parlour door i had not determined as i went i grew aware of a tall florid man with thick boots and very large whiskers who stood at the entry and regarded me with a wide and ingratiating smile i had some cloudy remembrance of having seen him before walking in the street of wapping wall and as he seemed to be coming to meet me i went on past the bar parlour door to meet him ah he said with a slight glance toward the door you're a smart fellow i can see and he patted my head and stooped now i've got something to show you see there he pulled a watch from his pocket and opened it i was much interested to see that the inward part swung clear out from the case on a hinge exactly as i had seen happen with another watch on my first evening at the hole in the wall that's a rum trick ain't it observed the stranger smiling wider than ever i assented and thanked him for the demonstration ah he replied you're as clever a lad as ever i see but i lay you never see a watch like that before yes i did i answered heartily i saw one once no no said the florid man still toying with the watch i don't believe that it's your gammon why where did you see one he shot another stealthy glance toward the bar parlour door as he said it and the glance was so unlike the smile that my sleeping caution was alarmed i remembered how my grandfather had come by the watch with the m on the back and i remember his repeated warnings that i must not talk why where did you see one asked the stranger in a man's hand i said with stolid truth he looked at me so sharply through his grin that i had an uncomfortable feeling that i had somehow let out the secret after all but i resolved to hold on tight ha ha he laughed in a man's hand of course i knew you was a smart one mine hasn't got any letter on the back you see no i answered with elaborate indifference no letter and as i spoke i found more matter of surprise for if i had eyes in my head and indeed i had sharp ones there was mrs grimes in a dark entry across the street watching this grinning questioner and me some have letters on the back said the questioner mine ain't that sort what sort here joe the potman dropped or knocked over something in the bar parlour and the stranger started i think i'm wanted indoors i said moving off glad of the interruption good bye the florid stranger rose and walked off at once with a parting smile he turned at the corner and went straight away without so much as a look toward the entry where mrs grimes was i fancied he walked rather like a policeman chapter xxvii in the bar parlour dan ogle blinded and broken but silent and saving his revenge musky mag stricken and pitiable but faithful even if to death henry viney desperate but fearful and urgently needy these three skulked at bay in dark holes by blue gate sullen and silent to doggedness ogle would give no word to the hospital doctors of how his injury had befallen and in three days he would brook confinement no longer but rose and broke away defiant of persuasion to grope into the outer world by aid of mag's arm blind george was about still but had scarcely been near the highway except at night when as he had been wont to boast he was as good as most men with sound eyes it was thought that he spent his days over the water as would be the way of one feeling the need of temporary caution it did not matter that could rest a bit blind george should be paid and paid bitter measure but first the job in hand first the scheme he had interrupted first the money here were doubt and difficulty dan ogle's plan of murder and comprehensive pillage was gone by the board he was next to helpless it was plain that whatever plan was followed viney must bear the active part dan ogle raved and cursed to find his partner so unpractised a ruffian so cautious and doubtful a confederate mrs grimes made the matter harder and it was plain that the thing must be either brought to a head or wholly abandoned if only on her account for she had her own idea with her certain revenge on captain nat and a contingent reward furthermore she saw her brother useless and things were brought to a head when she would wait no more but carried her intrigue to the police nothing but a sudden move would do now desperate as it might be and the fact screwed viney to the sticking place and gave new vigour to ogle's shaken frame after all the delay had not been great no more than a few days captain nat suspected nothing and the chances lay that the notes were still in hand as they had been when ogle's sister last saw them for he could afford to hold them and dispose of them at a later and safer time the one danger was from this manoeuvre of mrs grimes if the police thought well enough of her tale to act without preliminary inquiry they might be at the hole in the wall with a search warrant at any moment the thing must be done at once that very night musky mag had never left dan's side a moment since she had brought him from the hospital now she was thrust aside and bidden to keep to herself viney took to pen ink and paper and the two men waited impatiently for midnight it was then that viney with ogle at his elbow awaited the closing of the hole in the wall hidden in the dark entry whence mrs grimes had watched the plain clothes policeman fishing for information a few hours earlier the customers grew noisier as the hour neared and captain nat's voice was heard enjoining order once or twice ere at last it was raised to clear the bar then the company came out straggling and staggering wrangling and singing and melted away into the dark this way and that mr cripps went east the pale pensioner west each like a man who has all night to get home in and the potman having fastened the shutters took his coat and hat and went his way also there was but one other tavern in sight and that closed at the same time as the hole in the wall and since none nearer than paddy's goose remained open till one wapping wall was soon dark and empty there were diamond shaped holes near the top of the shutters at the hole in the wall and light was visible through these a sign that captain nat was still engaged in the bar presently the light dulled and then disappeared he had extinguished the lamps now was the time while he was in the bar parlour viney came out from the entry pulling ogle by the arm and crossed the street he brought him to the court entrance and placed his hand on the end post this is the first post in the court viney whispered wait here while i go we both know what's to do viney tip toed to the bar parlour door and tapped there was a heavy footstep within and the door was flung open there stood captain nat with the table lamp in his hand who's that said captain nat come into the light viney took a deep breath me he answered i'll come in i've got something to say he went in side foremost with his back against the door post and captain nat turned slowly each man watching the other then the landlord put the lamp on the table and shut the door well he said i'll hear you say it there was something odd about captain nat's eyes something new and something that viney did not like hard and quiet not anger it would seem but some thing indefinable and worse viney braced himself with another inspiration of breath first he said i'm alone here but i've left word there's a friend o' mine not far off waiting he's waiting where he can hear the clock strike on shadwell church just as you can hear it here an' if i'm not back with him safe an' sound when it strikes one he's going to the police with some papers i've given him in an envelope ah an' what papers papers i've written myself papers with a sort of private log in them not much like the one they showed 'em at lloyd's of the loss of the florence years enough ago when a man named dan webb was killed papers with the names of most of the men aboard an' hints as to where to find some of 'em bill stagg for instance a b they may not want to talk but they can be made captain nat's fixed look was oddly impassive have you got it on the papers he said in a curiously even voice as though he recited a lesson learned by rote have you got it on the papers that dan webb had got at the rum an' was lost through bein' drunk no i haven't an' much good it 'ud do ye if i had drunk or sober he died in that wreck an' not a man aboard but knew all about that i've told you before what it is by law murder murder an' the rope ay said captain nat in the same even voice though the tones grew in significance as he went on ay you have an' you made me pay for the information murder it is an' the rope by the law of england well i want none of your money now i want my own i'll go back an' burn those papers or give 'em to you if you like an' you'll never see me again if you'll do one thing not with your money what give me my partner's leather pocket book and my eight hundred and ten pounds that was in it that's first an' last of my business here to night an' all i've got to say for a moment captain nat's impassibility was disturbed and he looked sharply at viney ha he said what's this partner's pocket book notes what i've said it plain an' you understand me time's passing cap'en kemp an' you'd better not waste it arguing one o'clock'll strike before long the money i came an' spoke about when they found marr in the river you had it all the time an' you knew it that's what i want nothing o' yours but my own money give me my own money an' save your neck captain nat compressed his lips and folded his arms there was a woman knew about this he said slowly after a pause a woman an' a man they each took a try at that money in different ways they must be friends o' yours time's going cap'en kemp time's going listen to reason an' give me what's my own i want nothing o' yours nothing but my own to save you and and that boy you've got a boy to remember think o' the boy captain nat stood for a little silent and thoughtful his eyes directed absently on viney as though he saw him not and as he stood so the darkness cleared from his face not that moment's darkness only but all the hardness of years seemed to abate in the old skipper's features so that presently captain nat stood transfigured ay he said at last the boy i'll think o' the boy god bless him you shall have your money viney though whether it ought to be yours i don't know viney when you came in i was ready to break you in pieces with my bare hands which i could do easy as you know well enough he stretched forth the great knotted hands and viney shrank before them i was ready to kill you with my hands an' would ha' done it for a reason i'll tell you of afterwards but i've done evil enough an' i'll do no more you shall have your money wait here an' i'll fetch it now no no tricks you know said viney a little nervously as the old man turned toward the staircase door tricks came the answer no an end of all tricks and captain nat tramped heavily up the stair chapter xxviii stephen's tale my grandfather was uncommonly silent all that day after his interview with conolly he bade me good night when i went to bed and kissed me but he said no more though he sat by my bed till i fell asleep while joe attended the bar i had a way now and again of waking when the bar was closed perhaps because of the noise and commonly at these times i lay awake till grandfather nat came to bed to bid him good night once more it was so this night the night of nights i woke at the shouting and the stumbling into the street and lay while the bar was cleared and the doors banged and fastened my grandfather seemed to stay uncommonly long and presently as the night grew stiller i was aware of voices joined in conversation below i wondered greatly who could be talking with grandfather nat at this hour and i got out of bed to listen at the stair head it could not be bill stagg for the voices were in the bar parlour and not in the store place behind and it was not joe the potman for i had heard him go and i knew his step well i wondered if grandfather nat would mind if i went down to see i was doubtful and i temporised i began to put on some clothes listening from time to time at the stair head in hope that i might recognise the other voice but indeed both voices were indistinct and i could not distinguish one from the other and then of a sudden the stairfoot door opened and my grandfather came upstairs heavy and slow i doubted what he might say when he saw my clothes on but he seemed not to notice it he brought a candle in from the landing and he looked strangely grave grave with a curious composure he went to the little wall cupboard at his bed head and took out the cash box which had not been downstairs since the pale man had ceased work stevy my boy he said have you said your prayers yes grandfather an' didn't forget gran'father nat no grandfather i never forget you good boy stevy he took the leather pocket book from the box and knelt by my side with his arm about me stevy he said here's this money it ain't ours stevy neither yours nor mine an' we've no right to it i kept it for you but i did wrong an' worse i was leadin' you wrong will you give it up stevy why yes grandfather truly that was an easy enough thing to say and in fact i was in some way pleased to know that my mother had been right after all right stevy be an honest boy always and an honest man better than me since i was a boy like you i've gone a long way wrong an' i've been a bad man stevy a bad man some ways at least an' now stevy i'm goin' away for a bit presently when i'm gone you can go to the stairs an' call bill stagg he'll come at once call bill stagg he'll stay with you to night you don't mind bill stagg do you bill stagg was an excellent friend of mine and i liked his company but i could not understand grandfather nat's going away where was he going and why so late at night never mind that just now stevy i'm going away for a bit an' whatever happens you'll always say prayers night an' mornin' for gran'father nat won't you an' be a good boy there was something piteous now in my grandfather's hard grave face don't go grandfather i pleaded with my arm at his neck don't go grandfather nat you're not not going to die are you that's as god wills my boy we must all die some day i think he was near breaking down here but at the moment a voice called up the stairs are you coming said the voice time's nearly up and it frightened me more than i can say to know this second voice at last for viney's but my grandfather was firm again at once yes he cried i'm coming no more to do stevy snivelling's no good and then grandfather nat put his hands clumsily together and shut his eyes like a little child god bless an' save this boy whatever happens amen said grandfather nat then he rose and took from the cash box the watch that the broken nosed man had sold there's that too he said musingly i dunno why i kep' it so long and with that he shut the cash box and strode across to the landing he looked back at me for a moment but said nothing and then descended the stairs bewildered and miserably frightened i followed him i could neither reason nor cry out and i had an agonised hope that i was not really awake and that this was just such a nightmare as had afflicted me on the night of the murder at our door i crouched on the lower stairs and listened yes i've got it said my grandfather answering an eager question there it is look at that count the notes i heard a hasty scrabbling of paper right asked my grandfather quite right viney answered and there was exultation in his voice pack 'em up put 'em safe in your pocket quite safe there's the watch too i paid for that oh the watch well all right i don't mind having that too since you're pressing you might ha' saved a deal of trouble yours an' mine too if you'd done all this before yes you're right but i clear up all now you've got the notes all quite safe have you all safe there was the sound of a slap on a breast pocket and the watch ay and the watch good i heard a bounce and a gasp of terror and then my grandfather's voice again come come viney we'll be quits to the end we're bad men both an' we'll go to the police together bring your papers viney tell 'em about the florence an' dan webb an' i'll tell 'em about the juno an' my boy i've got my witnesses an' i'll find more a dozen to your one come viney i'll have justice done now on both of us i could stay no longer viney was struggling desperately reasoning entreating i pushed open the staircase door but neither seemed to note me my grandfather had viney by arm and collar and was shaking him face downward i'll go halves kemp i'll go halves viney gasped hoarsely divide how you like but don't don't be a fool take five hundred think o' the boy i've thought of the boy an' i've thought of his father god'll mind the boy you've made an orphan come my grandfather flung wide the door and tumbled viney up the steps into the court the little table with the lamp on it rocked from a kick and i saved it by sheer instinct for i was sick with terror i followed into the court and saw my grandfather now nearly at the street corner hustling and dragging his prisoner dan dan viney was crying struggling wildly dan i've got it draw him off me dan go for the kid an' draw him off go for the kid on the stairs and i could see a man come groping between the wall and the posts a hand feeling from one post to the next and the stick in the other hand scraping the wall i ran out to the farther side of the alley viney's shout distracted my grandfather's attention and i saw him looking anxiously back with that viney took his chance and flung himself desperately round the end post his collar went with a rip and he ran for a moment my grandfather stood irresolute and i ran toward him i am safe here i cried come away grandfather but when he saw me clear of the groping man he turned and dashed after viney while from the bar parlour i heard a curse and a crash of broken glass i vaguely wondered if viney's confederate were smashing windows in the partition and then i ran my hardest after grandfather nat viney had made up the street toward the bridge and ratcliff highway and captain nat pursued with shouts of stop him breathless and unsteady i made slow progress with my smaller legs over the rough cobble stones which twisted my feet all ways as i ran but i was conscious of a gathering of other cries ahead and i struggled on with throbbing head and bursting heart plainly there were more shouts as i neared the corner and a running of more men than two and when the corner was turned and the bridge and the lock before me i saw that the chase was over three bull's eye lanterns were flashing to and fro pointing their long rays down on the black dock water and the policemen who directed them were calling to dockmen on the dark quay who cried back and ran and called again man in cried one and another hurrying in from the highway fell off the lock no he cut his lucky an' headered in he didn't i tell ye yes he did why i see 'im i could not see my grandfather and for a moment my thumping heart stood still and sick with the fear that it was he who was drowning in the dock then a policeman swung his lantern across to the opposite side and in the passing flash grandfather nat's figure stood hard and clear for an instant and no more he was standing midway on the lock staring and panting and leaning on a stanchion with a dozen risks of being knocked into the dock by excited onlookers i scrambled down to the lock and seized the first stanchion it creaked and tottered in my hand but i went forward gripping at the swaying chain and keeping foothold on the slippery uneven timbers i knew not how sometimes the sagging chain would give till i felt myself pitching headlong only to be saved by the check of the stanchion against the side of the socket and once the chain hung so low where it had slipped through the next stanchion eye that i had no choice but to let go and plunged in the dark for the next upright it might have been to plunge into space grandfather nat grandfather nat i reached him somehow at last and caught tight at his wrist he was leaning on the stanchion still and staring at the dark water here i am grandfather i said but i am frightened stay with me please for a little while he still peered into the gloom then he turned and said quietly i've lost him stevy he went over here by the sweep of his hand i saw what had happened though i could scarce realise the whole matter then and there as i presently learnt however viney was running full for the bridge with captain nat shouting behind him when he saw the lanterns of the three policemen barring the bridge as they came on their beat from the highway to avoid them he swung aside and made for the lock with his pursuer hard at his heels now a lock of that sort joins in an angle or mitre at the middle where the two sides meet like a valve pointing to resist the tide so that the hazardous path along the top turns off sharply midway flying headlong with thought of nothing but the avenger behind him viney overran the angle meeting the low chain full under his knees and so was gone with a yell and a splash grandfather nat took me by the collar and turned me round we'll get back stevy he said go on i'll hold you tight and so in the pitchy dark i went back along the way i had come walking before my grandfather as i had done when first i saw that lock the dockmen had flung random life buoys and now were groping with drags and hooks some judged that the man must have gone under like a stone others thought it quite likely that a good swimmer might have got away quietly and everybody wished to know who the man was and why he was running to all such questions my grandfather made the same answer it was a man i wanted wanted bad for the police you find him dead or alive an' i'll identify him an' say the rest in the proper place that's all only once he amplified this answer and then he said you can judge he was as much afraid o' the police as he was o' me or more look where he went when he saw 'em on the bridge and again he repeated i'll say the rest when he's found not before an' nobody can make me he was calm and cool enough now as i could feel as well as hear for my hand was buried in his while he pushed his way stolidly through the little crowd as for myself i could neither think nor speak nor laugh nor cry though dizzily conscious of an impulse to do all four at once i had grandfather nat again and now he would not go away that i could realise and i clung with all my might to as much of his hand as i could grip chapter xxix stephen's tale but i was to have neither time to gather my wits nor quiet to assort my emotions for the full issue of that night was not yet even as we were pushing through the little crowd and even as my grandfather parried question with answer a new cry rose and at the sound the crowd began to melt for it was the cry of fire a single shout at first and then another and then a clamour of three together and a beat of running feet men about us started off and as we rounded the corner one came running back on his tracks cap'en kemp it's your house he cried your house cap'en kemp the hole in the wall the hole in the wall then was dire confusion i was caught in a whir of running men and i galloped and stumbled along as i might dragging dependent from my grandfather's hand somewhere ahead a wavering light danced before my eyes and there was a sudden outburst of loud cracks as of a hundred carters' whips and then screams screams without a doubt confusedly my mind went back to viney's confederate groping in at the bar parlour door what had he done smashed glass glass it must have been the lamp the lamp on the little table by the door the lamp i had myself saved but ten minutes earlier now we were opposite the hole in the wall and the loud cracks were joined with a roar of flame out it came gushing at the crevices of doors and shutters and the corners of doors and shutters shrivelled and curled to let out more as though that bulging old wooden house were a bursting reservoir of long pent fire that could be held in no more and still there were the screams hoarser and hoarser from what part within was not to be guessed my grandfather stood me in a doorway up two steps and ran toward the court but that was impassable with such fearful swiftness had the fire sprung up and over the dry old timber on this side where it had made its beginning that already a painted board on the brick wall opposite was black and smoking and glowering red at the edges and where i stood across the road the air was hot and painful to the eyes grandfather nat ran along the front of the house to the main door but it was blazing and bursting and he turned and ran into the road with his arm across his eyes then with a suddenly increased roar flames burst tenfold in volume and number from all the ground floor and where a shutter fell all within glowed a sheer red furnace the spirit was caught at last and now i saw a sight that would come again in sleep months afterwards and set me screaming in my bed the cries which had lately died down sprang out anew amid the roar nearer and clearer with a keener agony and up in the club room the room of the inquests there at a window appeared the groping man a dreadful figure in no darkness now but ringed about with bright flame i saw him the man whose empty sightless eye pits i had seen scarce twelve hours before through a hole in a canvas screen the shade was gone from over the place of the eyes and down the seared face and among the rags of blistered skin rolled streams of horrible great tears forced from the raw lids by scorching smoke his clothes smoked about him as he stood groping groping still he knew not whither and his mouth opened and closed with sounds scarce human grandfather nat roared distractedly for a ladder called to the man to jump ran forward twice to the face of the house as though to catch him and twice came staggering back with his hands over his face and flying embers singeing his hair and his coat the blind man's blackened hands came down on the blazing sill and leapt from the touch then came a great crash with a single second's dulling of the whole blaze for an instant the screaming sightless weeping face remained and then was gone for ever the floor had fallen the flames went up with a redoubled roar and now i could hold my place no longer for the heat people were flinging water over the shutters and doors of the houses facing the fire and from the houses adjoining furniture was being dragged in hot haste my grandfather came and carried me a few doors farther along the street and left me with a chandler's wife who was out in a shawl and a man's overcoat over a huddle of flannel petticoats now the fire engines came dashing through the narrow lanes with a clamour of hoarse cries and scattering the crowd this way and that the hole in the wall was past aid and all the work was given to save its neighbours for some while i could distinguish my grandfather among the firemen heaving and hauling and doing the work of three the police were grown in numbers now and they had cleared the street to beyond where i stood so that i could see well enough and in every break in the flames in every changing shadow i saw again the face of the groping man even as i can see it now as i write floor went upon floor till at last the poor old shell fell in a heap amid a roar of shouts and a last leap of fire leaving the brick wall of the next house cracking and black and smoking and tagged with specks of dying flame and then at last my grandfather black and scorched came and sat by me on a step and put the breast of his coat about me and that was the end of the hole in the wall the end of its landlord's doubts and embarrassments and dangers and the beginning of another chapter in his history his history and mine chapter xxx stephen's tale little remains to say for with the smoking sticks of the hole in the wall the tale of my early days burns itself out viney's body was either never found or never identified whether it was discovered by some person who flung it adrift after possessing himself of the notes and watch whether it was held unto dissolution by mud or chains or waterside gear or whether indeed as was scarce possible it escaped with the life in it to walk the world in some place that knew it not i at any rate cannot tell the fate of his confederate at least was no matter of doubt he must have been driven to the bar by the fire he had raised and there bewildered and helpless and cut off from the way he had come even if he could find it he must have scrambled desperately till he found the one open exit the club room stairs but of these enough faint by contrast with the vivid scenes of the night divers disconnected impressions of the next morning remain with me all the fainter for the sleep that clutched at my eyelids spite of my anxious resolution to see all to the very end of a coarse draggled woman of streaming face and exceeding bitter cry who sat inconsolable while men raked the ruins for a thing unrecognisable when it was found of the pale man who came staring and choking and paler than ever gasping piteously of his long and honest service and sitting down on the curb at last to meditate on my grandfather's promise that he should not want if he would work and of mr cripps at first blank and speechless and then mighty loquacious in the matter of insurance for works of art would be included of course up to twenty pounds apiece at which amount of proceeds with a discount to captain kemp he would cheerfully undertake to replace the lot and throw the signboard in mrs grimes was heard of though not seen but this was later she was long understood to have some bitter grievance against the police whom she charged with plots and conspiracies to defeat the ends of justice and i think she ended with a savage assault on a plain clothes constable's very large whiskers and twenty one days' imprisonment the hole in the wall was rebuilt in brick with another name as i think you may see it still or could till lately there was also another landlord for captain nat kemp turned to enlarging and improving his wharf and he bought lighters and wapping saw him no more as for me i went to school at last
