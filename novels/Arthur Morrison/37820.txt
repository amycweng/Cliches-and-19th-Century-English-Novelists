the missing hand the case of laker absconded the case of the lost foreigner chronicles of martin hewitt the ivy cottage mystery i had been working double tides for a month at night on my morning paper as usual and in the morning on an evening paper as locum tenens for another man who was taking a holiday this was an exhausting plan of work although it only actually involved some six hours attendance a day or less at the two offices i turned up at the headquarters of my own paper at ten in the evening and by the time i had seen the editor selected a subject written my leader corrected the slips chatted smoked and so on and cleared off it was very usually one oclock this meant bed at two or even three after supper at the club this was all very well at ordinary periods when any time in the morning would do for rising but when i had to be up again soon after seven and round at the evening paper office by eight i naturally felt a little worn and disgusted with things by midday after a sharp couple of hours leaderette scribbling and paragraphing with attendant sundries but the strain was over and on the first day of comparative comfort i indulged in a midday breakfast and the first undisgusted glance at a morning paper for a month i felt rather interested in an inquest begun the day before on the body of a man whom i had known very slightly before i took to living in chambers his name was gavin kingscote and he was an artist of a casual and desultory sort having i believe some small private means of his own as a matter of fact he had boarded in the same house in which i had lodged myself for a while but as i was at the time a late homer and a fairly early riser taking no regular board in the house we never became much acquainted he had since i understood made some judicious stock exchange speculations and had set up house in finchley now the news was that he had been found one morning murdered in his smokingroom while the room itself with others was in a state of confusion his pockets had been rifled and his watch and chain were gone with one or two other small articles of value on the night of the tragedy a friend had sat smoking with him in the room where the murder took place and he had been the last person to see mr kingscote alive a jobbing gardener who kept the garden in order by casual work from time to time had been arrested in consequence of footprints exactly corresponding with his boots having been found on the garden beds near the french window of the smokingroom i finished my breakfast and my paper and mrs clayton the housekeeper came to clear my table she was sister of my late landlady of the house where kingscote had lodged and it was by this connection that i had found my chambers i had not seen the housekeeper since the crime was first reported so i now said this is shocking news of mr kingscote mrs clayton did you know him yourself she had apparently only been waiting for some such remark to burst out with whatever information she possessed yes sir she exclaimed shocking indeed pore young feller i see him often when i was at my sisters and he was always a nice quiet gentleman so different from some my sister shes awful cut up sir i assure you and what dyou think appened sir only last tuesday you remember mr kingscotes room where he painted the woodwork so beautiful with gold flowers and blue and pink he used to tell my sister shed always have something to remember him by well two young fellers gentlemen i cant call them come and took that room it being to let and went and scratched off all the paint in mere wicked mischief and then chopped up all the panels into sticks and bits nice sort o gentlemen them and then they bolted in the morning being afraid i spose of being made to pay after treating a pore widders property like that that was only tuesday and the very next day the pore young gentleman himselfs dead murdered in his own ouse and him going to be married an all dear dear i remember once he said mrs clayton was a good soul but once she began to talk some one else had to stop her i let her run on for a reasonable time and then rose and prepared to go out i remembered very well the panels that had been so mischievously destroyed they made the room the showroom of the house which was an old one they were indeed less than half finished when i came away and mrs lamb the landlady had shown them to me one day when kingscote was out all the walls of the room were panelled and painted white and kingscote had put upon them an eccentric but charming decoration obviously suggested by some of the work of mr whistler tendrils flowers and butterflies in a quaint convention wandered thinly from panel to panel giving the otherwise rather uninteresting room an unwonted atmosphere of richness and elegance the lamentable jackasses who had destroyed this had certainly selected the best feature of the room whereon to inflict their senseless mischief i strolled idly downstairs with no particular plan for the afternoon in my mind and looked in at hewitts offices hewitt was reading a note and after a little chat he informed me that it had been left an hour ago in his absence by the brother of the man i had just been speaking of he isnt quite satisfied hewitt said with the way the police are investigating the case and asks me to run down to finchley and look round yesterday i should have refused because i have five cases in progress already but today i find that circumstances have given me a day or two didnt you say you knew the man scarcely more than by sight he was a boarder in the house at chelsea where i stayed before i started chambers ah well i think i shall look into the thing do you feel particularly interested in the case i mean if youve nothing better to do would you come with me i shall be very glad i said i was in some doubt what to do with myself shall you start at once i think so kerrett just call a cab by the way brett which paper has the fullest report of the inquest yesterday ill run over it as we go down as i had only seen one paper that morning i could not answer hewitts question so we bought various papers as we went along in the cab and i found the reports while martin hewitt studied them summarised this was the evidence given sarah dodson general servant deposed that she had been in service at ivy cottage the residence of the deceased for five months the only other regular servant being the housekeeper and cook on the evening of the previous tuesday both servants retired a little before eleven leaving mr kingscote with a friend in the smoking or sitting room she never saw her master again alive on coming downstairs the following morning and going to open the smokingroom windows she was horrified to discover the body of mr kingscote lying on the floor of the room with blood about the head she at once raised an alarm and on the instructions of the housekeeper fetched a doctor and gave information to the police in answer to questions witness stated she had heard no noise of any sort during the night nor had anything suspicious occurred hannah carr housekeeper and cook deposed that she had been in the late mr kingscotes service since he had first taken ivy cottagea period of rather more than a year she had last seen the deceased alive on the evening of the previous tuesday at halfpast ten when she knocked at the door of the smokingroom where mr kingscote was sitting with a friend to ask if he would require anything more nothing was required so witness shortly after went to bed in the morning she was called by the previous witness who had just gone downstairs and found the body of deceased lying as described deceaseds watch and chain were gone as also was a ring he usually wore and his pockets appeared to have been turned out all the ground floor of the house was in confusion and a bureau a writingtable and various drawers were opena bunch of keys usually carried by deceased being left hanging at one keyhole deceased had drawn some money from the bank on the tuesday for current expenses how much she did not know she had not heard or seen anything suspicious during the night besides dodson and herself there were no regular servants there was a charwoman who came occasionally and a jobbing gardener living near who was called in as required mr james vidler surgeon had been called by the first witness between seven and eight on wednesday morning he found the deceased lying on his face on the floor of the smokingroom his feet being about eighteen inches from the window and his head lying in the direction of the fireplace he found three large contused wounds on the head any one of which would probably have caused death the wounds had all been inflicted apparently with the same blunt instrumentprobably a club or life preserver or other similar weapon they could not have been done with the poker death was due to concussion of the brain and deceased had probably been dead seven or eight hours when witness saw him he had since examined the body more closely but found no marks at all indicative of a struggle having taken place indeed from the position of the wounds and their severity he should judge that the deceased had been attacked unawares from behind and had died at once the body appeared to be perfectly healthy then there was police evidence which showed that all the doors and windows were found shut and completely fastened except the front door which although shut was not bolted there were shutters behind the french windows in the smokingroom and these were found fastened no money was found in the bureau nor in any of the opened drawers so that if any had been there it had been stolen the pockets were entirely empty except for a small pair of nail scissors and there was no watch upon the body nor a ring certain footprints were found on the garden beds which had led the police to take certain steps no footprints were to be seen on the garden path which was hard gravel mr alexander campbell stockbroker stated that he had known deceased for some few years and had done business for him he and mr kingscote frequently called on one another and on tuesday evening they dined together at ivy cottage they sat smoking and chatting till nearly twelve oclock when mr kingscote himself let him out the servants having gone to bed here the witness proceeded rather excitedly that is all i know of this horrible business and i can say nothing else what the police mean by following and watching me the coroner pray be calm mr campbell the police must do what seems best to them in a case of this sort i am sure you would not have them neglect any means of getting at the truth witness certainly not but if they suspect me why dont they say so it is intolerable that i should be the coroner order order mr campbell you are here to give evidence the witness then in answer to questions stated that the french windows of the smokingroom had been left open during the evening the weather being very warm he could not recollect whether or not deceased closed them before he left but he certainly did not close the shutters witness saw nobody near the house when he left mr douglas kingscote architect said deceased was his brother he had not seen him for some months living as he did in another part of the country he believed his brother was fairly well off and he knew that he had made a good amount by speculation in the last year or two knew of no person who would be likely to owe his brother a grudge and could suggest no motive for the crime except ordinary robbery his brother was to have been married in a few weeks questioned further on this point witness said that the marriage was to have taken place a year ago and it was with that view that ivy cottage deceaseds residence was taken the lady however sustained a domestic bereavement and afterwards went abroad with her family she was witness believed shortly expected back to england william bates jobbing gardener who was brought up in custody was cautioned but elected to give evidence witness who appeared to be much agitated admitted having been in the garden of ivy cottage at four in the morning but said that he had only gone to attend to certain plants and knew absolutely nothing of the murder he however admitted that he had no order for work beyond what he had done the day before being further pressed witness made various contradictory statements and finally said that he had gone to take certain plants away the inquest was then adjourned this was the case as it stoodapparently not a case presenting any very striking feature although there seemed to me to be doubtful peculiarities in many parts of it i asked hewitt what he thought quite impossible to think anything my boy just yet wait till we see the place there are any number of possibilities kingscotes friend campbell may have come in again you know by way of the windowor he may not campbell may have owed him money or somethingor he may not the anticipated wedding may have something to do with itor again that may not there is no limit to the possibilities as far as we can see from this reporta mere dry husk of the affair when we get closer we shall examine the possibilities by the light of more detailed information one probability is that the wretched gardener is innocent it seems to me that his was only a comparatively blameless manoeuvre not unheard of at other times in his trade he came at four in the morning to steal away the flowers he had planted the day before and felt rather bashful when questioned on the point why should he trample on the beds else i wonder if the police thought to examine the beds for traces of rooting up or questioned the housekeeper as to any plants being missing but we shall see we chatted at random as the train drew near finchley and i mentioned inter alia the wanton piece of destruction perpetrated at kingscotes late lodgings hewitt was interested that was curious he said very curious was anything else damaged furniture and so forth i dont know mrs clayton said nothing of it and i didnt ask her but it was quite bad enough as it was the decoration was really good and i cant conceive a meaner piece of tomfoolery than such an attack on a decent womans property then hewitt talked of other cases of similar stupid damage by creatures inspired by a defective sense of humour or mere love of mischief he had several curious and sometimes funny anecdotes of such affairs at museums and picture exhibitions where the damage had been so great as to induce the authorities to call him in to discover the offender the work was not always easy chiefly from the mere absence of intelligible motive nor indeed always successful one of the anecdotes related to a case of malicious damage to a picturethe outcome of blind artistic jealousya case which had been hushed up by a large expenditure in compensation it would considerably startle most people could it be printed here with the actual names of the parties concerned ivy cottage finchley was a compact little house standing in a compact little square of garden little more than a third of an acre or perhaps no more at all the front door was but a dozen yards or so back from the road but the intervening space was well treed and shrubbed mr douglas kingscote had not yet returned from town but the housekeeper an intelligent matronly woman who knew of his intention to call in martin hewitt was ready to show us the house first hewitt said when we stood in the smokingroom i observe that somebody has shut the drawers and the bureau that is unfortunate also the floor has been washed and the carpet taken up which is much worse that i suppose was because the police had finished their examination but it doesnt help me to make one at all has anythinganything at allbeen left as it was on tuesday morning well sir you see everything was in such a muddle the housekeeper began and when the police had done just so i know you set it to rights eh oh that setting to rights it has lost me a fortune at one time and another as to the other rooms now have they been set to rights such as was disturbed have been put right sir of course which were disturbed let me see them but wait a moment he opened the french windows and closely examined the catch and bolts he knelt and inspected the holes whereinto the bolts fell and then glanced casually at the folding shutters he opened a drawer or two and tried the working of the locks with the keys the housekeeper carried they were the housekeeper explained mr kingscotes own keys all through the lower floors hewitt examined some things attentively and closely and others with scarcely a glance on a system unaccountable to me presently he asked to be shown mr kingscotes bedroom which had not been disturbed set to rights or slept in since the crime here the housekeeper said all drawers were kept unlocked but twoone in the wardrobe and one in the dressingtable which mr kingscote had always been careful to keep locked hewitt immediately pulled both drawers open without difficulty within in addition to a few odds and ends were papers all the contents of these drawers had been turned over confusedly while those of the unlocked drawers were in perfect order the police hewitt remarked may not have observed these matters any more than such an ordinary thing as this he added picking up a bent nail lying at the edge of a rug the housekeeper doubtless took the remark as a reference to the entire unimportance of a bent nail but i noticed that hewitt dropped the article quietly into his pocket we came away at the front gate we met mr douglas kingscote who had just returned from town he introduced himself and expressed surprise at our promptitude both of coming and going you cant have got anything like a clue in this short time mr hewitt he asked well no hewitt replied with a certain dryness perhaps not but i doubt whether a months visit would have helped me to get anything very striking out of a washed floor and a houseful of carefully cleanedup and settorights rooms candidly i dont think you can reasonably expect much of me the police have a much better chancethey had the scene of the crime to examine i have seen just such a few rooms as any one might see in the first wellfurnished house he might enter the trail of the housemaid has overlaid all the others im very sorry for that the fact was i expected rather more of the police and indeed i wasnt here in time entirely to prevent the clearing up but still i thought your wellknown powers my dear sir my wellknown powers are nothing but common sense assiduously applied and made quick by habit that wont enable me to see the invisible but cant we have the rooms put back into something of the state they were in the cook will remember no no that would be worse and worse that would only be the housemaids trail in turn overlaid by the cooks you must leave things with me for a little i think then you dont give the case up mr kingscote asked anxiously oh no i dont give it up just yet do you know anything of your brothers private papersas they were before his death i never knew anything till after that i have gone over them but they are all very ordinary letters do you suspect a theft of papers martin hewitt with his hands on his stick behind him looked sharply at the other and shook his head no he said i cant quite say that we bade mr douglas kingscote goodday and walked towards the station great nuisance that setting to rights hewitt observed on the way if the place had been left alone the job might have been settled one way or another by this time as it is we shall have to run over to your old lodgings my old lodgings i repeated amazed why my old lodgings hewitt turned to me with a chuckle and a wide smile because we cant see the broken panelwork anywhere else he said lets seechelsea isnt it yes chelsea but whyyou dont suppose the people who defaced the panels also murdered the man who painted them well hewitt replied with another smile that would be carrying a practical joke rather far wouldnt it even for the ordinary picture damager you mean you dont think they did it then but what do you mean my dear fellow i dont mean anything but what i say come now this is rather an interesting case despite appearances and it has interested me so much in fact that i really think i forgot to offer mr douglas kingscote my condolence on his bereavement you see a problem is a problem whether of theft assassination intrigue or anything else and i only think of it as one the work very often makes me forget merely human sympathies now you have often been good enough to express a very flattering interest in my work and you shall have an opportunity of exercising your own common sense in the way i am always having to exercise mine you shall see all my evidence if im lucky enough to get any as i collect it and you shall make your own inferences that will be a little exercise for you the sort of exercise i should give a pupil if i had one but i will give you what information i have and you shall start fairly from this moment you know the inquest evidence such as it was and you saw everything i did in ivy cottage yes i think so but im not much the wiser very well now i will tell you what does the whole case look like how would you class the crime i suppose as the police do an ordinary case of murder with the object of robbery it is not an ordinary case if it were i shouldnt know as much as i do little as that is the ordinary cases are always difficult the assailant did not come to commit a burglary although he was a skilled burglar or one of them was if more than one were concerned the affair has i think nothing to do with the expected wedding nor had mr campbell anything to do in itat any rate personallynor the gardener the criminal or one of them was known personally to the dead man and was welldressed he or again one of them and i think there were two even had a chat with mr kingscote before the murder took place he came to ask for something which mr kingscote was unwilling to part withperhaps hadnt got it was not a bulky thing now you have all my materials before you but all this doesnt look like the result of the blind spite that would ruin a mans work first and attack him bodily afterwards spite isnt always blind and there are other blind things besides spite people with good eyes in their heads are blind sometimes even detectives but where did you get all this information what makes you suppose that this was a burglar who didnt want to burgle and a welldressed man and so on hewitt chuckled and smiled again i saw itsaw it my boy thats all he said but here comes the train on the way back to town after i had rather minutely described kingscotes work on the boardinghouse panels hewitt asked me for the names and professions of such fellow lodgers in that house as i might remember when did you leave yourself he ended three years ago or rather more i can remember kingscote himself turner a medical studentjames turner i think harvey challitt diamond merchants articled pupilhe was a bad egg entirely hes doing five years for forgery now by the bye he had the room we are going to see till he was marched off and kingscote took ita year before i left there was nortondont know what he was something in the city i think and carter paget in the admiralty office i dont remember any more at this moment there were pretty frequent changes but you can get it all from mrs lamb of course of course and mrs lambs exact address iswhat i gave him the address and the conversation became disjointed at farringdon station where we alighted hewitt called two hansoms preparing to enter one he motioned me to the other saying you get straight away to mrs lambs at once she may be going to burn that splintered wood or to set things to rights after the manner of her kind and you can stop her i must make one or two small inquiries but i shall be there half an hour after you shall i tell her our object only that i may be able to catch her mischievous lodgersnothing else yet he jumped into the hansom and was gone i found mrs lamb still in a state of indignant perturbation over the trick served her four days before fortunately she had left everything in the panelled room exactly as she had found it with an idea of the being better able to demand or enforce reparation should her lodgers return the rooms theirs you see sir she said till the end of the week since they paid in advance and they may come back and offer to make amends although i doubt it as pleasantspoken a young chap as you might wish he seemed him as come to take the rooms my cousin says he is rather an invalid havin only just got over congestion of the lungs and he wont be in london till this evening late hes comin up from birmingham he ses and i hope he wont catch a fresh cold on the way although of course weve got him muffled up plenty he took the rooms sir like a gentleman and mentioned several gentlemens names i knew well as had lodged here before and then he put down on that there very table sirmrs lamb indicated the exact spot with her hand as though that made the whole thing much more wonderfulhe put down on that very table a weeks rent in advance and ses thats always the best sort of reference mrs lamb i think as kindmannered as anythingand never aggled about the amount nor nothing he only had a little black bag but he said his cousin had all the luggage coming in the train and as there was so much praps they wouldnt get it here till next day then he went out and came in with his cousin at eleven that nightsarah let em in her own selfand in the morning they was goneand this poor mrs lamb plaintively indignant stretched her arm towards the wrecked panels if the gentleman as you say is comin on sir she pursued can do anything to find em ill prosecute em that i will if it costs me ten pound i spoke to the constable on the beat but he only looked like a fool and said if i knew where they were i might charge em with wilful damage or county court em of course i know i can do that if i knew where they were but how can i find em mr jones he said his name was but how many joneses is there in london sir i couldnt imagine any answer to a question like this but i condoled with mrs lamb as well as i could she afterwards went on to express herself much as her sister had done with regard to kingscotes death only as the destruction of her panels loomed larger in her mind she dwelt primarily on that it might almost seem she said that somebody had a deadly spite on the pore young gentleman and went breakin up his paintin one night and murderin him the next i examined the broken panels with some care having half a notion to attempt to deduce something from them myself if possible but i could deduce nothing the beading had been taken out and the panels which were thick in the centre but bevelled at the edges had been removed and split up literally into thin firewood which lay in a tumbled heap on the hearth and about the floor every panel in the room had been treated in the same way and the result was a pretty large heap of sticks with nothing whatever about them to distinguish them from other sticks except the paint on one face which i observed in many cases had been scratched and scraped away the rug was drawn half across the hearth and had evidently been used to deaden the sound of chopping but mischiefwanton and stupid mischiefwas all i could deduce from it all mr joness cousin it seemed only sarah had seen as she admitted him in the evening and then he was so heavily muffled that she could not distinguish his features and would never be able to identify him but as for the other one mrs lamb was ready to swear to him anywhere hewitt was long in coming and internal symptoms of the approach of dinnertime we had had no lunch had made themselves felt before a sharp ring at the doorbell foretold his arrival i have had to wait for answers to a telegram he said in explanation but at any rate i have the information i wanted and these are the mysterious panels are they mrs lambs true opinion of martin hewitts behaviour as it proceeded would have been amusing to know she watched in amazement the antics of a man who purposed finding out who had been splitting sticks by dint of picking up each separate stick and staring at it in the end he collected a small handful of sticks by themselves and handed them to me saying just put these together on the table brett and see what you make of them i turned the pieces painted side up and fitted them together into a complete panel joining up the painted design accurately it is an entire panel i said good now look at the sticks a little more closely and tell me if you notice anything peculiar about themany particular in which they differ from all the others i looked two adjoining sticks i said have each a small semicircular cavity stuffed with what seems to be putty put together it would mean a small circular hole perhaps a knothole half an inch or so in diameter in the panel filled in with putty or whatever it is a knothole hewitt asked with particular emphasis well no not a knothole of course because that would go right through and this doesnt it is probably less than half an inch deep from the front surface anything else look at the whole appearance of the wood itself colour for instance it is certainly darker than the rest so it is he took the two pieces carrying the puttied hole threw the rest on the heap and addressed the landlady the mr harvey challitt who occupied this room before mr kingscote and who got into trouble for forgery was the mr harvey challitt who was himself robbed of diamonds a few months before on a staircase wasnt he yes sir mrs lamb replied in some bewilderment he certainly was that on his own office stairs chloroformed just so and when they marched him away because of the forgery mr kingscote changed into his rooms yes and very glad i was it was bad enough to have the disgrace brought into the house without the trouble of trying to get people to take his very rooms and i thought yes yes very awkward very awkward hewitt interrupted rather impatiently the man who took the rooms on monday nowyoud never seen him before had you no sir then is that anything like him hewitt held a cabinet photograph before her whywhylaw yes thats him hewitt dropped the photograph back into his breast pocket with a contented um and picked up his hat i think we may soon be able to find that young gentleman for you mrs lamb he is not a very respectable young gentleman and perhaps you are well rid of him even as it is come brett he added the day hasnt been wasted after all we made towards the nearest telegraph office on the way i said that puttiedup hole in the piece of wood seems to have influenced you is it an important link wellyes hewitt answered it is but all those other pieces are important too but why because there are no holes in them he looked quizzically at my wondering face and laughed aloud come he said i wont puzzle you much longer here is the postoffice ill send my wire and then well go and dine at luzattis he sent his telegram and we cabbed it to luzattis among actors journalists and others who know town and like a good dinner luzattis is well known we went upstairs for the sake of quietness and took a table standing alone in a recess just inside the door we ordered our dinner and then hewitt began now tell me what your conclusion is in this matter of the ivy cottage murder mine i havent one im sorry im so very dull but i really havent come ill give you a point here is the newspaper account torn sacrilegiously from my scrapbook for your benefit of the robbery perpetrated on harvey challitt a few months before his forgery read it oh but i remember the circumstances very well he was carrying two packets of diamonds belonging to his firm downstairs to the office of another firm of diamond merchants on the groundfloor it was a quiet time in the day and halfway down he was seized on a dark landing made insensible by chloroform and robbed of the diamondsfive or six thousand pounds worth altogether of stones of various smallish individual values up to thirty pounds or so he lay unconscious on the landing till one of the partners noticing that he had been rather long gone followed and found him thats all i think yes thats all well what do you make of it im afraid i dont quite see the connection with this case well then ill give you another point the telegram ive just sent releases information to the police in consequence of which they will probably apprehend harvey challitt and his confederate henry gillard alias jones for the murder of gavin kingscote now then challitt but hes in gaol already tut tut consider five years penal was his dose although for the first offence because the forgery was of an extremely dangerous sort you left chelsea over three years ago yourself and you told me that his difficulty occurred a year before that makes four years at least good conduct in prison brings a man out of a five years sentence in that time or a little less and as a matter of fact challitt was released rather more than a week ago still im afraid i dont see what you are driving at whose story is this about the diamond robbery from harvey challitt his own exactly his own does his subsequent record make him look like a person whose stories are to be accepted without doubt or question why no i think i seeno i dont you mean he stole them himself ive a sort of dim perception of your drift now but still i cant fix it the whole things too complicated it is a little complicated for a first effort i admit so i will tell you this is the story harvey challitt is an artful young man and decides on a theft of his firms diamonds he first prepares a hidingplace somewhere near the stairs of his office and when the opportunity arrives he puts the stones away spills his chloroform and makes a smellpossibly sniffs some and actually goes off on the stairs and the whole things done he is carried into the officethe diamonds are gone he tells of the attack on the stairs as we have heard and he is believed at a suitable opportunity he takes his plunder from the hidingplace and goes home to his lodgings what is he to do with those diamonds he cant sell them yet because the robbery is publicly notorious and all the regular jewel buyers know him being a criminal novice he doesnt know any regular receiver of stolen goods and if he did would prefer to wait and get full value by an ordinary sale there will always be a danger of detection so long as the stones are not securely hidden so he proceeds to hide them he knows that if any suspicion were aroused his rooms would be searched in every likely place so he looks for an unlikely place of course he thinks of taking out a panel and hiding them behind that but the idea is so obvious that it wont do the police would certainly take those panels out to look behind them therefore he determines to hide them in the panels see herehe took the two pieces of wood with the filled hole from his tail pocket and opened his penknifethe putty near the surface is softer than that near the bottom of the hole two different lots of putty differently mixed perhaps have been used therefore presumably at different times but to return to challitt he makes holes with a centrebit in different places on the panels and in each hole he places a diamond embedding it carefully in putty he smooths the surface carefully flush with the wood and then very carefully paints the place over shading off the paint at the edges so as to leave no signs of a patch he doesnt do the whole job at once creating a noise and a smell of paint but keeps on steadily a few holes at a time till in a little while the whole wainscoting is set with hidden diamonds and every panel is apparently sound and whole but thenthere was only one such hole in the whole lot just so and that very circumstance tells us the whole truth let me tell the story firstill explain the clue after the diamonds lie hidden for a few monthshe grows impatient he wants the money and he cant see a way of getting it at last he determines to make a bolt and go abroad to sell his plunder he knows he will want money for expenses and that he may not be able to get rid of his diamonds at once he also expects that his suddenly going abroad while the robbery is still in peoples minds will bring suspicion on him in any case so in for a penny in for a pound he commits a bold forgery which had it been successful would have put him in funds and enabled him to leave the country with the stones but the forgery is detected and he is haled to prison leaving the diamonds in their wainscot setting now we come to gavin kingscote he must have been a shrewd fellowthe sort of man that good detectives are made of also he must have been pretty unscrupulous he had his suspicions about the genuineness of the diamond robbery and kept his eyes open what indications he had to guide him we dont know but living in the same house a sharp fellow on the lookout would probably see enough at any rate they led him to the belief that the diamonds were in the thiefs rooms but not among his movables or they would have been found after the arrest here was his chance challitt was out of the way for years and there was plenty of time to take the house to pieces if it were necessary so he changed into challitts rooms how long it took him to find the stones we shall never know he probably tried many other places first and i expect found the diamonds at last by pricking over the panels with a needle then came the problem of getting them out without attracting attention he decided not to trust to the needle which might possibly leave a stone or two undiscovered but to split up each panel carefully into splinters so as to leave no part unexamined therefore he took measurements and had a number of panels made by a joiner of the exact size and pattern of those in the room and announced to his landlady his intention of painting her panels with a pretty design this to account for the wet paint and even for the fact of a panel being out of the wall should she chance to bounce into the room at an awkward moment all very clever eh very ah he was a smart man no doubt well he went to work taking out a panel substituting a new one painting it over and chopping up the old one on the quiet getting rid of the splinters out of doors when the booty had been extracted the decoration progressed and the little heap of diamonds grew finally he came to the last panel but found that he had used all his new panels and hadnt one left for a substitute it must have been at some time when it was difficult to get hold of the joinerbank holiday perhaps or sunday and he was impatient so he scraped the paint off and went carefully over every part of the surfaceexperience had taught him by this that all the holes were of the same sortand found one diamond he took it out refilled the hole with putty painted the old panel and put it back these are pieces of that old panelthe only old one of the lot nine men out of ten would have got out of the house as soon as possible after the thing was done but he was a cool hand and stayed that made the whole thing look a deal more genuine than if he had unaccountably cleared out as soon as he had got his room nicely decorated i expect the original capital for those stock exchange operations we heard of came out of those diamonds he stayed as long as suited him and left when he set up housekeeping with a view to his wedding the rest of the story is pretty plain you guess it of course yes i said i think i can guess the rest in a general sort of wayexcept as to one or two points its all plainperfectly see here challitt in gaol determines to get those diamonds when he comes out to do that without being suspected it will be necessary to hire the room but he knows that he wont be able to do that himself because the landlady of course knows him and wont have an exconvict in the house there is no help for it he must have a confederate and share the spoil so he makes the acquaintance of another convict who seems a likely man for the job and whose sentence expires about the same time as his own when they come out he arranges the matter with this confederate who is a wellmannered and pretty wellknown housebreaker and the latter calls at mrs lambs house to look for rooms the very room itself happens to be to let and of course it is taken and challitt who is the invalid cousin comes in at night muffled and unrecognisable the decoration on the panel does not alarm them because of course they suppose it to have been done on the old panels and over the old paint challitt tries the spots where diamonds were leftthere are nonethere is no putty even perhaps think they the panels have been shifted and interchanged in the painting so they set to work and split them all up as we have seen getting more desperate as they go on finally they realize that they are done and clear out leaving mrs lamb to mourn over their mischief they know that kingscote is the man who has forestalled them because gillard or jones in his chat with the landlady has heard all about him and his painting of the panels so the next night they set off for finchley they get into kingscotes garden and watch him let campbell out while he is gone challitt quietly steps through the french window into the smokingroom and waits for him gillard remaining outside kingscote returns and challitt accuses him of taking the stones kingscote is contemptuousdoesnt care for challitt because he knows he is powerless being the original thief himself besides knows there is no evidence since the diamonds are sold and dispersed long ago challitt offers to divide the plunder with himkingscote laughs and tells him to go probably threatens to throw him out challitt being the smaller man gillard at the open window hears this steps in behind and quietly knocks him on the head the rest follows as a matter of course they fasten the window and shutters to exclude observation turn over all the drawers etc in case the jewels are there go to the best bedroom and try there and so on failing and possibly being disturbed after a few hours search by the noise of the acquisitive gardener gillard with the instinct of an old thief determines they shant go away with nothing so empties kingscotes pockets and takes his watch and chain and so on they go out by the front door and shut it after them voila tout i was filled with wonder at the prompt ingenuity of the man who in these few hours of hurried inquiry could piece together so accurately all the materials of an intricate and mysterious affair such as this but more i wondered where and how he had collected those materials there is no doubt hewitt i said that the accurate and minute application of what you are pleased to call your common sense has become something very like an instinct with you what did you deduce from you told me your conclusions from the examination of ivy cottage but not how you arrived at them they didnt leave me much material downstairs did they but in the bedroom the two drawers which the thieves found locked were ransackedopened probably with keys taken from the dead man on the floor i saw a bent french nail here it is you see it is twice bent at right angles near the head and near the point and there is the faint mark of the pliers that were used to bend it it is a very usual burglars tool and handy in experienced hands to open ordinary drawer locks therefore i knew that a professional burglar had been at work he had probably fiddled at the drawers with the nail first and then had thrown it down to try the dead mans keys but i knew this professional burglar didnt come for a burglary from several indications there was no attempt to take plate the first thing a burglar looks for valuable clocks were left on mantelpieces and other things that usually go in an ordinary burglary were not disturbed notably it was to be observed that no doors or windows were broken or had been forcibly opened therefore it was plain that the thieves had come in by the french window of the smokingroom the only entrance left open at the last thing therefore they came in or one did knowing that mr kingscote was up and being quite willingpresumably anxiousto see him ordinary burglars would have waited till he had retired and then could have got through the closed french window as easily almost as if it were open notwithstanding the thin wooden shutters which would never stop a burglar for more than five minutes being anxious to see him theyor again one of thempresumably knew him that they had come to get something was plain from the ransacking as in the end they did steal his money and watch but did not take larger valuables it was plain that they had no bag with themwhich proves not only that they had not come to burgle for every burglar takes his bag but that the thing they came to get was not bulky still they could easily have removed plate or clocks by rolling them up in a tablecover or other wrapper but such a bundle carried by welldressed men would attract attentiontherefore it was probable that they were well dressed do i make it clear quitenothing seems simpler now it is explainedthats the way with difficult puzzles there was nothing more to be got at the house i had already in my mind the curious coincidence that the panels at chelsea had been broken the very night before that of the murder and determined to look at them in any case i got from you the name of the man who had lived in the panelled room before kingscote and at once remembered it although i said nothing about it as that of the young man who had been chloroformed for his employers diamonds i keep things of that sort in my mind you seeand indeed in my scrapbook you told me yourself about his imprisonment and there i was with what seemed now a hopeful case getting into a promising shape you went on to prevent any setting to rights at chelsea and i made enquiries as to challitt i found he had been released only a few days before all this trouble arose and i also found the name of another man who was released from the same establishment only a few days earlier i knew this man gillard well and knew that nobody was a more likely rascal for such a crime as that at finchley on my way to chelsea i called at my office gave my clerk certain instructions and looked up my scrapbook i found the newspaper account of the chloroform business and also a photograph of gillardi keep as many of these things as i can collect what i did at chelsea you know i saw that one panel was of old wood and the rest new i saw the hole in the old panel and i asked one or two questions the case was complete we proceeded with our dinner presently i said it all rests with the police now of course of course i should think it very probable that challitt and gillard will be caught gillard at any rate is pretty well known it will be rather hard on the surviving kingscote after engaging me to have his dead brothers diamond transactions publicly exposed as a result wont it but it cant be helped fiat justitia of course how will the police feel over this i asked youve rather cut them out eh oh the police are all right they had not the information i had you see they knew nothing of the panel business if mrs lamb had gone to scotland yard instead of to the policeman on the beat perhaps i should never have been sent for the same quality that caused martin hewitt to rank as mere commonsense his extraordinary power of almost instinctive deduction kept his respect for the abilities of the police at perhaps a higher level than some might have considered justified we sat some little while over our dessert talking as we sat when there occurred one of those curious conjunctions of circumstances that we notice again and again in ordinary life and forget as often unless the importance of the occasion fixes the matter in the memory a young man had entered the diningroom and had taken his seat at a corner table near the back window he had been sitting there for some little time before i particularly observed him at last he happened to turn his thin pale face in my direction and our eyes met it was challittthe man we had been talking of i sprang to my feet in some excitement thats the man i cried challitt hewitt rose at my words and at first attempted to pull me back challitt in guilty terror saw that we were between him and the door and turning leaped upon the sill of the open window and dropped out there was a fearful crash of broken glass below and everybody rushed to the window hewitt drew me through the door and we ran downstairs pity you let out like that he said as he went if youd kept quiet we could have sent out for the police with no trouble never mindcant help it below challitt was lying in a broken heap in the midst of a crowd of waiters he had crashed through a thick glass skylight and fallen back downward across the back of a lounge he was taken away on a stretcher unconscious and in fact died in a week in hospital from injuries to the spine during his periods of consciousness he made a detailed statement bearing out the conclusions of martin hewitt with the most surprising exactness down to the smallest particulars he and gillard had parted immediately after the crime judging it safer not to be seen together he had he affirmed endured agonies of fear and remorse in the few days since the fatal night at finchley and had even once or twice thought of giving himself up when i so excitedly pointed him out he knew at once that the game was up and took the one desperate chance of escape that offered but to the end he persistently denied that he had himself committed the murder or had even thought of it till he saw it accomplished that had been wholly the work of gillard who listening at the window and perceiving the drift of the conversation suddenly beat down kingscote from behind with a lifepreserver and so harvey challitt ended his life at the age of twentysix gillard was never taken he doubtless left the country and has probably since that time become known to the police under another name abroad perhaps he has even been hanged and if he has been there was no miscarriage of justice no matter what the charge against him may have been the nicobar bullion case i the whole voyage was an unpleasant one and captain mackrie of the anglomalay companys steamship nicobar had at last some excuse for the illtemper that had made him notorious and unpopular in the companys marine staff although the fourth and fifth mates in the seclusion of their berth ventured deeper in their search for motives and opined that the old man had made a deal less out of this voyage than usual the company having lately taken to providing its own stores so that makings were gone clean and cumshaw which means commission in the trading lingo of the china seas had shrunk small indeed in confirmation they adduced the uncommonly long face of the steward the only man in the ship satisfied with the skipper whom the new regulations hit with the same blow but indeed the stewards dolor might well be credited to the short passenger list and the unpromising aspect of the few passengers in the eyes of a man accustomed to gauge ones tipyielding capacity a month in advance for the steward it was altogether the wrong time of year the wrong sort of voyage and certainly the wrong sort of passengers so that doubtless the confidential talk of the fourth and fifth officers was mere youthful scandal at any rate the captain had prospect of a good deal in private trade home for he had been taking curiosities and japanese oddments aboard plainly for sale in london in a way that a third steward would have been ashamed of and which for a captain was a scandal and an ignominy and he had taken pains to insure well for the lot these things the fourth and fifth mates often spoke of and more than once made a winking allusion to in the presence of the third mate and the chief engineer who laughed and winked too and sometimes said as much to the second mate who winked without laughing for of such is the tittletattle of shipboard the nicobar was bound home with few passengers as i have said a small general cargo and gold bullion to the value of lthe bullion to be landed at plymouth as usual the presence of this bullion was a source of much conspicuous worry on the part of the second officer who had charge of the bullionroom for this was his first voyage on his promotion from third officer and the charge of l worth of gold bars was a thing he had not been accustomed to the placid first officer pointed out to him that this wasnt the first shipment of bullion the world had ever known by a long way nor the largest also that every usual precaution was taken and the keys were in the captains cabin so that he might reasonably be as easy in his mind as the few thousand other second officers who had had charge of hatches and special cargo since the world began but this did not comfort brasyer he fidgeted about when off watch considering and puzzling out the various means by which the bullionroom might be got at and fidgeted more when on watch lest somebody might be at that moment putting into practice the ingenious dodges he had thought of and he didnt keep his fears and speculations to himself he bothered the first officer with them and when the first officer escaped he explained the whole thing at length to the third officer cant think what the companys about he said on one such occasion to the first mate calling a tinpot bunker like that a bullionroom skittles responded the first mate and went on smoking oh thats all very well for you who arent responsible brasyer went on but im pretty sure something will happen some day if not on this voyage on some other talk about a strong room why whats it made of threeeighths boiler plate yes threeeighths boiler plateabout as good as a sixpenny tin money box why id get through that with my grandmothers scissors all right borrow em and get through i would if i had a grandmother there it is down below there out of sight and hearing nice and handy for anybody who likes to put in a quiet hour at plate cutting from the coal bunker next dooralways empty because its only a seventon bunker not worth trimming and the other sides against the stewards pantry whats to prevent a man shipping as steward getting quietly through while hes supposed to be bucketing about among his slops and his crockery and strolling away with the plunder at the next port and then theres the carpenter hes always messing about somewhere below with a bag full of tools nothing easier than for him to make a job in a quiet corner and get through the plates but then whats he to do with the stuff when hes got it you cant take gold ashore by the hundredweight in your boots do with it why dump it of course dump it overboard in a quiet port and mark the spot come to that he could desert clean at port saidwhat easier placeand take all he wanted you know what port saids like then there are the firemenoh anybody can do it and brasyer moved off to take another peep under the hatchway the door of the bullionroom was fastened by one central patent lock and two padlocks one above and one below the other lock a day or two after the conversation recorded above brasyer was carefully examining and trying the lower of the padlocks with a key when a voice immediately behind him asked sharply well sir and what are you up to with that padlock brasyer started violently and looked round it was captain mackrie theresthat isim afraid these are the same sort of padlocks as those in the carpenters stores the second mate replied in a hurry of explanation ii was just trying thats all im afraid the keys fit just you let the carpenter take care of his own stores will you mr brasyer theres a chubbs lock there as well as the padlocks and the key of thats in my cabin and ill take care doesnt go out of it without my knowledge so perhaps youd best leave off experiments till youre asked to make em for your own sake thats enough now the captain added as brasyer appeared to be ready to reply and he turned on his heel and made for the stewards quarters brasyer stared after him ragefully wonder what you want down here he muttered under his breath seems to me one doesnt often see a skipper as thick with the steward as that and he turned off growling towards the deck above hanged if i like that stewards pantry stuck against the side of the bullionroom he said later in the day to the first officer and what does a steward want with a lot of boilermakers tools aboard you know hes got them in the name of the prophet rats answered the first mate who was of a less fussy disposition what a fatiguing creature you are brasyer dont you know the mans a boilermaker by regular trade and has only taken to stewardship for the last year or two that sort of man doesnt like parting with his tools and as hes a widower with no home ashore of course he has to carry all his traps aboard do shut up and take your proper rest like a christian here ill give you a cigar its all rightburman stick it in your mouth and keep your jaw tight on it but there was no soothing the second officer still he prowled about the after orlop deck and talked at large of his anxiety for the contents of the bullionroom once again a few days later as he approached the iron door he was startled by the appearance of the captain coming this time from the stewards pantry he fancied he had heard tapping brasyer explained and had come to investigate but the captain turned him back with even less ceremony than before swearing he would give charge of the bullionroom to another officer if brasyer persisted in his eccentricities on the first deck the second officer was met by the carpenter a quiet sleek softspoken man who asked him for the padlock and key he had borrowed from the stores during the week but brasyer put him off promising to send it back later and the carpenter trotted away to a job he happened to have singularly enough in the hold just under the after orlop deck and below the floor of the bullionroom as i have said the voyage was in no way a pleasant one everywhere the weather was at its worst and scarce was gibraltar passed before the lascars were shivering in their cotton trousers and the seedee boys were buttoning tight such old tweed jackets as they might muster from their scanty kits it was january in the bay the weather was tremendous and the nicobar banged and shook and pitched distractedly across in a howling world of thunderous green sea washed within and without above and below then in the chops as night fell something went and there was no more steerageway nor indeed anything else but an aimless wallowing the screw had broken the high sea had abated in some degree but it was still bad such sail as the steamer carried inadequate enough was set and shift was made somehow to worry along to plymouthor to falmouth if occasion better servedby that means and so the nicobar beat across the channel on a rather better though anything but smooth sea in a black night made thicker by a storm of sleet which turned gradually to snow as the hours advanced the ship laboured slowly ahead through a universal blackness that seemed to stifle nothing but a black void above below and around and the sound of wind and sea so that one coming before a decklight was startled by the quiet advent of the large snowflakes that came like moths as it seemed from nowhere at four bellstwo in the morninga foggy light appeared away on the starboard bowit was the eddystone lightand an hour or two later the exact whereabouts of the ship being a thing of much uncertainty it was judged best to lay her to till daylight no order had yet been given however when suddenly there were dim lights over the port quarter with a more solid blackness beneath them then a shout and a thunderous crash and the whole ship shuddered and in ten seconds had belched up every living soul from below the nicobars voyage was overit was a collision the stranger backed off into the dark and the two vessels drifted apart though not till some from the nicobar had jumped aboard the other captain mackries presence of mind was wonderful and never for a moment did he lose absolute command of every soul on board the ship had already begun to settle down by the stern and list to port lifebelts were served out promptly fortunately there were but two women among the passengers and no children the boats were lowered without a mishap and presently two strange boats came as near as they dare from the ship a large coasting steamer it afterwards appeared that had cut into the nicobar the last of the passengers were being got off safely when brasyer running anxiously to the captain said cant do anything with that bullion can we sir perhaps a box or two oh damn the bullion shouted captain mackrie look after the boat sir and get the passengers off the insurance companies can find the bullion for themselves but brasyer had vanished at the skippers first sentence the skipper turned aside to the steward as the crew and engineroom staff made for the remaining boats and the two spoke quietly together presently the steward turned away as if to execute an order and the skipper continued in a louder tone theyre the likeliest stuff and we can but drop em at worst but be slippyshe wont last ten minutes she lasted nearly a quarter of an hour by that time however everybody was clear of her and the captain in the last boat was only just near enough to see the last of her lights as she went down ii the day broke in a sulky grey and there lay the nicobar in ten fathoms not a mile from the shore her topmasts forlornly visible above the boisterous water the sea was rough all that day but the snow had ceased and during the night the weather calmed considerably next day lloyds agent was steaming about in a launch from plymouth and soon a salvage companys tug came up and lay to by the emerging masts there was every chance of raising the ship as far as could be seen and a diver went down from the salvage tug to measure the breach made in the nicobars side in order that the necessary oak planking or sheeting might be got ready for covering the hole preparatory to pumping and raising this was done in a very short time and the necessary telegrams having been sent the tug remained in its place through the night and prepared for the sending down of several divers on the morrow to get out the bullion as a commencement just at this time martin hewitt happened to be engaged on a case of some importance and delicacy on behalf of lloyds committee and was staying for a few days at plymouth he heard the story of the wreck of course and speaking casually with lloyds agent as to the salvage work just beginning he was told the name of the salvage companys representative on the tug mr percy merricka name he immediately recognised as that of an old acquaintance of his own so that on the day when the divers were at work in the bullionroom of the sunken nicobar hewitt gave himself a holiday and went aboard the tug about noon here he found merrick a big pleasant man of thirtyeight or so he was very glad to see hewitt but was a great deal puzzled as to the results of the mornings work on the wreck two cases of gold bars were missing there was l worth of bullion on board he said thats plain and certain it was packed in forty cases each of l value but now there are only thirtyeight cases two are gone clearly i wonder whats happened i suppose your men dont know anything about it asked hewitt no theyre all right you see its impossible for them to bring anything up without its being observed especially as they have to be unscrewed from their divingdresses here on deck besides bless you i was down with them oh do you dive yourself then well i put the dress on sometimes you know for any such special occasion as this i went down this morning there was no difficulty in getting about on the vessel below and i found the keys of the bullionroom just where the captain said i would in his cabin but the locks were useless of course after being a couple of days in salt water so we just burgled the door with crowbars and then we saw that we might have done it a bit more easily from outside for that coastingsteamer cut clean into the bunker next the bullionroom and ripped open the sheet of boilerplate dividing them the two missing cases couldnt have dropped out that way of course oh no we looked of course but it would have been impossible the vessel has a list the other wayto starboardand the piled cases didnt reach as high as the torn part well as i said we burgled the door and there they were thirtyeight sealed bullion cases neither more nor less and theyre down below in the aftercabin at this moment come and see thirtyeight they were pine cases bound with hoopiron and sealed at every joint each case about eighteen inches by a foot and six inches deep they were corded together two and two apparently for convenience of transport did you cord them like this yourself asked hewitt no thats how we found em we just hooked em on a block and tackle the pair at a time and they hauled em up here aboard the tug what have you done about the missing twoanything wired off to headquarters of course at once and ive sent for captain mackriehes still in the neighbourhood i believeand brasyer the second officer who had charge of the bullionroom they may possibly know something anyway one things plain there were forty cases at the beginning of the voyage and now there are only thirtyeight there was a pause and then merrick added by the bye hewitt this is rather your line isnt it you ought to look up these two cases hewitt laughed all right he said ill begin this minute if youll commission me well merrick replied slowly of course i cant do that without authority from headquarters but if youve nothing to do for an hour or so there is no harm in putting on your considering cap is there although of course theres nothing to go upon as yet but you might listen to what mackrie and brasyer have to say of course i dont know but as its a l question probably it might pay you and if you do see your way to anything id wire and get you commissioned at once there was a tap at the door and captain mackrie entered mr merrick he said interrogatively looking from one to another thats myself sir answered merrick im captain mackrie of the nicobar you sent for me i believe something wrong with the bullion im told isnt it merrick explained matters fully i thought perhaps you might be able to help us captain mackrie perhaps i have been wrongly informed as to the number of cases that should have been there no there were forty right enough i think thoughperhaps i might be able to give you a sort of hintand captain mackrie looked hard at hewitt this is mr hewitt captain mackrie merrick interposed you may speak as freely as you please before him in fact hes sort of working on the business so to speak well mackrie said if thats so speaking between ourselves i should advise you to turn your attention to brasyer he was my second officer you know and had charge of the stuff do you mean hewitt asked that mr brasyer might give us some useful information mackrie gave an ugly grin very likely he might he said if he were fool enough but i dont think youd get much out of him direct i meant you might watch him what do you suppose he was concerned in any way with the disappearance of this gold i should thinkspeaking as i said before in confidence and between ourselvesthat its very likely indeed i didnt like his manner all through the voyage why well he was so eternally cracking on about his responsibility and pretending to suspect the stokers and the carpenter and one person and another of trying to get at the bullion casesthat that alone was almost enough to make one suspicious he protested so much you see he was so conscientious and diligent himself and all the rest of it and everybody else was such a desperate thief and he was so sure there would be some of that bullion missing some day thatthatwell i dont know if i express his manner clearly but i tell you i didnt like it a bit but there was something more than that he was eternally smelling about the place and peeping in at the stewards pantrywhich adjoins the bullionroom on one side you knowand nosing about in the bunker on the other side and once i actually caught him fitting keys to the padlockskeys hed borrowed from the carpenters stores and every time his excuse was that he fancied he heard somebody else trying to get in to the gold or something of that sort every time i caught him below on the orlop deck that was his excusehappened to have heard something or suspected something or somebody every time whether or not i succeed in conveying my impressions to you gentlemen i can assure you that i regarded his whole manner and actions as very suspicious throughout the voyage and i made up my mind i wouldnt forget it if by chance anything did turn out wrong well it has and now ive told you what ive observed its for you to see if it will lead you anywhere just so hewitt answered but let me fully understand captain mackrie you say that mr brasyer had charge of the bullionroom but that he was trying keys on it from the carpenters stores where were the legitimate keys then in my cabin they were only handed out when i knew what they were wanted for there was a chubbs lock between the two padlocks but a duplicate wouldnt have been hard for brasyer to get he could easily have taken a wax impression of my key when he used it at the port where we took the bullion aboard well and suppose he had taken these boxes where do you think he would keep them mackrie shrugged his shoulders and smiled impossible to say he replied he might have hidden em somewhere on board though i dont think thats likely hed have had a deuce of a job to land them at plymouth and would have had to leave them somewhere while he came on to london bullion is always landed at plymouth you know and if any were found to be missing then the ship would be overhauled at once every inch of her so that hed have to get his plunder ashore somehow before the rest of the gold was unloadedalmost impossible of course if hes done that its somewhere below there now but that isnt likely hed be much more likely to have dumped itdropped it overboard at some wellknown spot in a foreign port where he could go later on and get it so that youve a deal of scope for search you see anywhere under water from here to yokohama and captain mackrie laughed soon afterward he left and as he was leaving a man knocked at the cabin door and looked in to say that mr brasyer was on board youll be able to have a go at him now said the captain goodday theres the steward of the nicobar there too sir said the man after the captain had gone and the carpenter very well well see mr brasyer first said merrick and the man vanished it seems to have got about a bit merrick went on to hewitt i only sent for brasyer but as these others have come perhaps theyve got something to tell us brasyer made his appearance overflowing with information he required little assurance to encourage him to speak openly before hewitt and he said again all he had so often said before on board the nicobar the bullionroom was a mere tin box the whole thing was as easy to get at as anything could be he didnt wonder in the least at the losshe had prophesied it all along the men whose movements should be carefully watched he said were the captain and the steward nobody ever heard of a captain and a steward being so thick together before he said the stewards pantry was next against the bullionroom you know with nothing but that wretched bit of threeeighths boiler plate between you wouldnt often expect to find the captain down in the stewards pantry would you thick as they might be well thats where i used to find him time and again and the steward kept boilermakers tools there that i can swear to and hes been a boilermaker so that likely as not he could open a joint somewhere and patch it up again neatly so that it wouldnt be noticed he was always messing about down there in his pantry and once i distinctly heard knocking there and when i went down to see whom should i meet why the skipper coming away from the place himself and he bullyragged me for being there and sent me on deck but before that he bullyragged me because i had found out that there were other keys knocking about the place that fitted the padlocks on the bullionroom door why should he slang and threaten me for looking after these things and keeping my eye on the bullionroom as was my duty but that was the very thing that he didnt like it was enough for him to see me anxious about the gold to make him furious of course his character for meanness and greed is known all through the companys servicehell do anything to make a bit but have you any positive idea as to what has become of the gold well brasyer replied with a rather knowing air i dont think theyve dumped it do you mean you think its still in the vesselhidden somewhere no i dont i believe the captain and the steward took it ashore one case each when we came off in the boats but wouldnt that be noticed it neednt be on a black night like that you see the parcels are not so biglook at them a foot by a foot and a half by six inches or so roughly easily slipped under a big coat or covered up with anything of course theyre a bit heavyeighty or ninety pounds apiece altogetherbut thats not much for a strong man to carryespecially in such a handy parcel on a black night with no end of confusion on now you just look hereill tell you something the skipper went ashore last in a boat that was sent out by the coasting steamer that ran into us that ships put into dock for repairs and her crew are mostly having an easy time ashore now i havent been asleep this last day or two and i had a sort of notion there might be some game of this sort on because when i left the ship that night i thought we might save a little at least of the stuff but the skipper wouldnt let me go near the bullionroom and that seemed odd so i got hold of one of the boats crew that fetched the skipper ashore and questioned him quietlypumped him you knowand he assures me that the skipper did have a rather small heavy sort of parcel with him what do you think of that of course in the circumstances the man couldnt remember any very distinct particulars but he thought it was a sort of square wooden case about the size ive mentioned but theres something more brasyer lifted his forefinger and then brought it down on the table before himsomething more ive made inquiries at the railway station and i find that two heavy parcels were sent off yesterday to londondeal boxes wrapped in brown paper of just about the right size and the paper got torn before the things were sent off and the clerk could see that the boxes inside were fastened with hoopironlike those and the second officer pointed triumphantly to the boxes piled at one side of the cabin well done said hewitt youre quite a smart detective did you find out who brought the parcels and who they were addressed to no i couldnt get quite as far as that of course the clerk didnt know the names of the senders and not knowing me wouldnt tell me exactly where the parcels were going but i got quite chummy with him after a bit and im going to meet him presentlyhe has the afternoon off and were going for a stroll ill find something more ill bet you certainly replied hewitt find all you canit may be very important if you get any valuable information youll let us know at once of course anything else now no i dont think so but i think what ive told you is pretty well enough for the present eh ill let you know some more soon brasyer went and norton the steward of the old ship was brought into the cabin he was a sharpeyed rather cadaverouslooking man and he spoke with sepulchral hollowness he had heard he said that there was something wrong with the chests of bullion and came on board to give any information he could it wasnt much he went on to say but the smallest thing might help if he might speak strictly confidentially he would suggest that observation be kept on wickens the carpenter he norton didnt want to be uncharitable but his pantry happened to be next the bullionroom and he had heard wickens at work for a very long time just belowon the under side of the floor of the bullionroom it seemed to him although of course he might have been mistaken still it was very odd that the carpenter always seemed to have a job just at that spot more it had been saidand he norton believed it to be truethat wickens the carpenter had in his possession and kept among his stores keys that fitted the padlocks on the bullionroom door that it seemed to him was a very suspicious circumstance he didnt know anything more definite but offered his ideas for what they were worth and if his suspicions proved unfounded nobody would be more pleased than himself butbutand the steward shook his head doubtfully thank you mr norton said merrick with a twinkle in his eye we wont forget what you say of course if the stuff is found in consequence of any of your information you wont lose by it the steward said he hoped not and he wouldnt fail to keep his eye on the carpenter he had noticed wickens was in the tug and he trusted that if they were going to question him they would do it cautiously so as not to put him on his guard merrick promised they would by the bye mr norton asked hewitt supposing your suspicions to be justified what do you suppose the carpenter would do with the bullion well sir replied norton i dont think hed keep it on the ship hed probably dump it somewhere the steward left and merrick lay back in his chair and guffawed aloud this grows farcical he said simply farcical what a happy family they must have been aboard the nicobar and now heres the captain watching the second officer and the second officer watching the captain and the steward and the steward watching the carpenter its immense and now were going to see the carpenter wonder whom he suspects hewitt said nothing but his eyes twinkled with intense merriment and presently the carpenter was brought into the cabin goodday to you gentlemen said the carpenter in a soft and deferential voice looking from one to the other might i ave the honour of addressin the salvage gentlemen thats right merrick answered motioning him to a seat this is the salvage shop mr wickens what can we do for you the carpenter coughed gently behind his hand i took the liberty of comin gentlemen consekins o earin as there was some bullion missin praps im wrong not at all we havent found as much as we expected and i suppose by this time nearly everybody knows it there are two cases wanting you cant tell us where they are i suppose well sir as to thatno i fear i cant exactly go as far as that but if i am able to give vallable information as may lead to recovery of same i presoom i may without offence look for some reasonable small recognition of my services oh yes answered merrick thatll be all right i promise you the company will do the handsome thing of course and no doubt so will the underwriters presoomin i may take that as a promiseamong gentlementhis with an emphasisim willing to tell something its a promise at any rate as far as the companys concerned returned merrick ill see its made worth your whileof course providing it leads to anything purvidin that sir o course well gentlemen my story aint a long one all ive to say was what i eard on board just before she went down the passengers was off and the crew was gettin into the other boats when the skipper turns to the steward an speaks to him quietlike not observin gentlemen as i was agin is elbow so for to say ere norton e sez or words to that effeck why shouldnt we try gettin them things ashore with usyou know the caseseh ive a notion were pretty close inshore e sez and theres nothink of a sea now you take one anyway and ill try the other e says but dont make a flourish then he sez louder cos o the steward goin off theyre the likeliest stuff and at worst we can but drop em but look sharp e says so then i gets into the nearest boat and thats all i eard that was all asked hewitt watching the mans face sharply all the carpenter answered with some surprise yes that was all but i think its pretty well enough dont you its plain enough what was meanthim and the steward was to take two cases one apiece on the quiet and they was the likeliest stuff aboard as he said himself and now theres two cases o bullion missin aint that enough the carpenter was not satisfied till an exact note had been made of the captains words then after merricks promise on behalf of the company had been renewed wickens took himself off well said merrick grinning across the table at hewitt this is a queer go isnt it what that man says makes the skippers case look pretty fishy doesnt it what he says and what brasyer says taken together makes a pretty strong casei should say makes the thing a certainty but what a business its likely to be a bit serious for some one but its a rare joke in a way wonder if brasyer will find out anything more pity the skipper and steward didnt agree as to whom they should pretend to suspect thats a mistake on their part not at all hewitt replied if they are conspiring and know what theyre about they will avoid seeming to be both in a tale the bullion is in bars i understand yes five bars in each case weight i believe sixteen pounds to a bar let me see hewitt went on as he looked at his watch it is now nearly two oclock i must think over these things if i am to do anything in the case in the meantime if it could be managed i should like enormously to have a turn under water in a divingdress i have always had a curiosity to see under the sea could it be managed now well merrick responded theres not much fun in it i can assure you and its none the pleasanter in this weather youd better have a try later in the year if you really want tounless you think you can learn anything about this business by smelling about on the nicobar down below hewitt raised his eyebrows and pursed his lips i might spot something he said one never knows and if i do anything in a case i always make it a rule to see and hear everything that can possibly be seen or heard important or not clues lie where least expected but beyond that probably i may never have another chance of a little experience in a divingdress so if it can be managed id be glad very well you shall go if you say so and since its your first venture ill come down with you myself the men are all ashore i think or most of them come along hewitt was put in woollens and then in indiarubbers a leadensoled boot of twenty pounds weight was strapped on each foot and weights were hung on his back and chest thats the dress that gullen usually has merrick remarked hes a very smart fellow we usually send him first to make measurements and so on an excellent man but a bit too fond of the divers lotion whats that asked hewitt oh you shall try some if you like afterwards its a bit too heavy for me rum and gin mixed i think a red nightcap was placed on martin hewitts head and after that a copper helmet secured by a short turn in the segmental screw joint at the neck in the end he felt a vast difficulty in moving at all merrick had been meantime invested with a similar rigout and then each was provided with a communication cord and an incandescent electric lamp finally the front window was screwed on each helmet and all was ready merrick went first over the ladder at the side and hewitt with much difficulty followed as the water closed over his head his sensations altered considerably there was less weight to carry his arms in particular felt light though slow in motion down down they went slowly and all round about it was fairly light but once on the sunken vessel and among the lower decks the electric lamps were necessary enough once or twice merrick spoke laying his helmet against hewitts for the purpose and instructing him to keep his airpipe lifeline and lamp connection from fouling something at every step here and there shadowy swimming shapes came out of the gloom attracted by their lamps to dart into obscurity again with a twist of the tail the fishes were exploring the nicobar the hatchway of the lower deck was open and down this they passed to the orlop deck a little way along this they came to a door standing open with a broken lock hanging to it it was the door of the bullionroom which had been forced by the divers in the morning merrick indicated by signs how the cases had been found piled on the floor one of the sides of the room of thin steel was torn and thrust in the length of its whole upper half and when they backed out of the room and passed the open door they stood in the great breach made by the bow of the strange coasting vessel steel iron wood and everything stood in rents and splinters and through the great gap they looked out into the immeasurable ocean hewitt put up his hand and felt the edge of the bullionroom partition where it had been torn it was just such a tear as might have been made in cardboard they regained the upper deck and hewitt placing his helmet against his companions told him that he meant to have a short walk on the ocean bed he took to the ladder again where it lay over the side and merrick followed him the bottom was of that tough slimy sort of clayrock that is found in many places about our coasts and was dotted here and there with lumps of harder rock and clumps of curious weed the two divers turned at the bottom of the ladder walked a few steps and looked up at the great hole in the nicobars side seen from here it was a fearful chasm laying open hold orlop and lower deck hewitt turned away and began walking about once or twice he stood and looked thoughtfully at the ground he stood on which was fairly flat he turned over with his foot a whitish cleanlooking stone about as large as a loaf then he wandered on slowly once or twice stopping to examine the rock beneath him and presently stooped to look at another stone nearly as large as the other weedy on one side only standing on the edge of a cavity in the claystone he pushed the stone into the hole which it filled and then he stood up merrick put his helmet against hewitts and shouted satisfied now seen enough of the bottom in a moment hewitt shouted back and he straightway began striding out in the direction of the ship arrived at the bows he turned back to the point he started from striding off again from there to the white stone he had kicked over and from there to the vessels side again merrick watched him in intense amazement and hurried as well as he might after the light of hewitts lamp arrived for the second time at the bows of the ship hewitt turned and made his way along the side to the ladder and forthwith ascended followed by merrick there was no halt at the deck this time and the two made there way up and up into the lighter water above and so to the world of air on the tug as the men were unscrewing them from there waterproof prisons merrick asked hewitt will you try the lotion now no hewitt replied i wont go quite so far as that but i will have a little whisky if youve any in the cabin and give me a pencil and a piece of paper these things were brought and on the paper martin hewitt immediately wrote a few figures and kept it in his hand i might easily forget those figures he observed merrick wondered but said nothing once more comfortably in the cabin and clad in his usual garments hewitt asked if merrick could produce a chart of the parts thereabout here you are was the reply coast and all big enough isnt it ive already marked the position of the wreck on it in pencil she lies pointing north by east as nearly exact as anything as youve begun it said hewitt i shall take the liberty of making a few more pencil marks on this and with that he spread out the crumpled note of figures and began much ciphering and measuring presently he marked certain points on a spare piece of paper and drew through them two lines forming an angle this angle he transferred to the chart and placing a ruler over one leg of the angle lengthened it out till it met the coastline there we are he said musingly and the nearest village to that is lostellaindeed the only coast village in that neighbourhood he rose bring me the sharpesteyed person on board he said that is if he were here all day yesterday but whats up whats all this mathematical business over going to find that bullion by rule of three hewitt laughed yes perhaps he said but wheres your sharp lookout i want somebody who can tell me everything that was visible from the deck of this tug all day yesterday well really i believe the very sharpest chap is the boy hes most annoyingly observant sometimes ill send for him he camea bright snubnosed impudentlooking young ruffian see here my boy said merrick polish up your wits and tell this gentleman what he asks yesterday said hewitt no doubt you saw various pieces of wreckage floating about yessir what were they hatchgratings mostlynothin much else theres some knockin about now i saw them now remember did you see a hatchgrating floating yesterday that was different from the others a painted one for instancethose out there now are not painted you know yessir i see a little white un painted bobbin about away beyond the foremast of the nicobar youre sure of that certain sure sirit was the only painted thing floatin and today its washed away somewheres so i noticed youre a smart lad heres a shilling for youkeep your eyes open and perhaps youll find a good many more shillings before youre an old man thats all the boy disappeared and hewitt turned to merrick and said i think you may as well send that wire you spoke of if i get the commission i think i may recover that bullion it may take some little time or on the other hand it may not if youll write the telegram at once ill go in the same boat as the messenger im going to take a walk down to lostella nowits only two or three miles along the coast but it will soon be getting dark but what sort of a clue have you got i didnt never mind replied hewitt with a chuckle officially you know ive no right to a clue just yetim not commissioned when i am ill tell you everything hewitt was scarcely ashore when he was seized by the excited brasyer here you are he said i was coming aboard the tug again ive got more news you remember i said i was going out with that railway clerk this afternoon and meant pumping him well ive done it and rushed awaydont know what hell thinks up as we were going along we saw norton the steward on the other side of the way and the clerk recognised him as one of the men who brought the cases to be sent off the other was the skipper ive no doubt from his description i played him artfully you know and then he let out that both the cases were addressed to mackrie at his address in london he looked up the entry he said after i left when i first questioned him feeling curious thats about enough i think eh im off to london nowi believe mackries going tonight ill have him keep it dark and the zealous second officer dashed off without waiting for a reply hewitt looked after him with an amused smile and turned off towards lostella iii it was about eleven the next morning when merrick received the following note brought by a boatman dear merrickam i commissioned if not dont trouble but if i am be just outside lostella at the turning before you come to the smack inn at two oclock bring with you a light cart a policemanor two perhaps will be betterand a man with a spade there will probably be a little cabbagedigging are you fond of the sportyours martin hewitt pskeep all your men aboard bring the spade artist from the town merrick was off in a boat at once his principals had replied to his telegram after hewitts departure the day before giving him a free hand to do whatever seemed best with some little difficulty he got the policemen and with none at all he got a light cart and a jobbing man with a spade together they drove off to the meetingplace it was before the time but martin hewitt was there waiting youre quick he said but the sooner the better i gave you the earliest appointment i thought you could keep considering what you had to do have you got the stuff then merrick asked anxiously no not exactly yet but ive got this and hewitt held up the point of his walkingstick protruding half an inch or so from it was the sharp end of a small gimlet and in the groove thereof was a little white wood such as commonly remains after a gimlet has been used why whats that never mind let us move alongill walk i think were about at the end of the jobits been a fairly lucky one and quite simple but ill explain after just beyond the smack inn hewitt halted the cart and all got down they looped the horses reins round a hedgestake and proceeded the small remaining distance on foot with the policemen behind to avoid a premature scare they turned up a lane behind a few small and rather dirty cottages facing the sea each with its patch of kitchen garden behind hewitt led the way to the second garden pushed open the small wicket gate and walked boldly in followed by the others cabbages covered most of the patch and seemed pretty healthy in their situation with the exception of half a dozensingularly enough all together in a group these were drooping yellow and wilted and towards these hewitt straightway walked dig up those wilted cabbages he said to the jobbing man theyre really useless now youll probably find something else six inches down or so the man struck his spade into the soft earth wherein it stopped suddenly with a thud but at this moment a gaunt slatternly woman with a black eye a handkerchief over her head and her skirt pinned up in front observing the invasion from the back door of the cottage rushed out like a maniac and attacked the party valiantly with a broom she upset the jobbing man over his spade knocked off one policemans helmet lunged into the others face with her broom and was making her second attempt to hit hewitt who had dodged when merrick caught her firmly by the elbows from behind pressed them together and held her she screamed and people came from other cottages and looked on peter peter the woman screamed come ee comeee here davey theyre come a grimy child came to the cottage door and seeing the woman thus held and strangers in the garden set up a piteous howl meantime the digger had uncovered two wooden boxes each eighteen inches long or so bound with hoopiron and sealed one had been torn partly open at the top and the broken wood roughly replaced when this was lifted bars of yellow metal were visible within the woman still screamed vehemently and struggled the grimy child retreated and then there appeared at the door staggering hazily and rubbing his eyes a shaggy unkempt man in shirt and trousers he looked stupidly at the scene before him and his jaw dropped take that man cried hewitt hes one and the policeman promptly took him so that he had handcuffs on his wrists before he had collected his faculties sufficiently to begin swearing hewitt and the other policeman entered the cottage in the lower two rooms there was nobody they climbed the few narrow stairs and in the front room above they found another man younger and fast asleep hes the other said hewitt take him and this one was handcuffed before he woke then the recovered gold was put into the cart and with the help of the village constable who brought his own handcuffs for the benefit and adornment of the lady with the broom such a procession marched out of lostella as had never been dreamed of by the oldest inhabitant in his worst nightmare nor recorded in the whole history of cornwall now said hewitt turning to merrick we must have that fellow of yourswhats his namegullen isnt it the one that went down to measure the hole in the ship youve kept him aboard of course what gullen exclaimed merrick gullen well as a matter of fact he went ashore last night and hasnt come back but you dont mean to say i do replied hewitt and now youve lost him iv but tell me all about it now weve a little time to ourselves asked merrick an hour or two later as they sat and smoked in the aftercabin of the salvage tug weve got the stuff thanks to you but i dont in the least see how they got it nor how you found it out well there didnt seem to be a great deal either way in the tales told by the men from the nicobar they cancelled one another out so to speak though it seemed likely that there might be something in them in one or two respects brasyer i could see tried to prove too much if the captain and the steward were conspiring to rob the bullionroom why should the steward trouble to cut through the boilerplate walls when the captain kept the keys in his cabin and if the captain had been stealing the bullion why should he stop at two cases when he had all the voyage to operate in and forty cases to help himself to of course the evidence of the carpenter gave some colour to the theory but i think i can imagine a very reasonable explanation of that you told me of course that you were down with the men yourself when they opened the bullionroom door and got out the cases so that there could be no suspicion of them but at the same time you told me that the breach in the nicobars side had laid open the bullionroom partition and that you might more easily have got the cases out that way you told me of course that the cases couldnt have fallen out that way because of the list of the vessel the position of the rent in the boilerplate and so on but i reflected that the day before a diver had been down alonein fact that his business had been with the very hole that extended partly to the bullionroom he had to measure it that diver might easily have got at the cases through the breach but then as you told me a diver cant bring things up from below unobserved this diver would know this and might therefore hide the booty below so that i made up my mind to have a look under water before i jumped to any conclusion i didnt think it likely that he had hidden the cases mind you because he would have had to dive again to get them and would have been just as awkwardly placed in fetching them to the light of day then as ever besides he couldnt come diving here again in the companys dress without some explanation so what more likely than that he would make some ingenious arrangement with an accomplice whereby he might make the gold in some way accessible to him we went under water i kept my eyes open and observed among other things that the vessel was one of those wellkept swell ones on which all the hatch gratings and so on are in plain oak or teak kept holystoned this with the other things i put by in my mind in case it should be useful when we went over the side and looked at the great gap i saw that it would have been quite easy to get at the broken bullionroom partition from outside yes remarked merrick it would be no trouble at all the ladder goes down just by the side of the breach and any one descending by that might just step off at one side on to the jagged plating at the level of the after orlop and reach over into the bullion safe just so well next i turned my attention to the seabed which i was extremely pleased to see was of soft slimy claystone i walked about a little getting farther and farther away from the vessel as i went till i came across that clean stone which i turned over with my foot do you remember yes well that was noticeable it was the only clean bare stone to be seen every other was covered with a green growth and to most clumps of weed clung the obvious explanation of this was that the stone was a newcomerlately brought from dry landfrom the shingle on the seashore probably since it was washed so clean such a stone could not have come a mile out to sea by itself somebody had brought it in a boat and thrown it over and whoever did it didnt take all that trouble for nothing then its shape told a tale it was something of the form rather exaggerated of a loafthe sort that is called a cottagethe most convenient possible shape for attaching to a line and lowering but the line had gone so somebody must have been down there to detach it also it wasnt unreasonable to suppose that there might have been a hook on the end of that line this then was a theory your man had gone down alone to take his measurement had stepped into the broken side as you have explained he could reached into the bullionroom and lifted the two cases probably he unfastened the cord and brought them out one at a time for convenience in carrying then he carried the cases one at a time as i have said over to that white stone which lay there sunk with the hook and line attached by previous arrangement with some confederate he detached the rope from the stoneit was probably fixed by an attached piece of cord tightened round the stone with what you call a timberhitch easily loosenedreplaced the cord round the two cases passed the hook under the cord and left it to be pulled up from above but then it could not have been pulled up there in broad daylight under your very noses the confederates would wait till night that meant that the other end of the rope was attached to some floating object so that it might be readily recovered the whole arrangement was set one night to be carried away the next but why didnt gullen take more than two cases he couldnt afford to waste the time in the first place each case removed meant another journey to and from the vessel and you were waiting above for his measurements then he was probably doubtful as to weight too much at once wouldnt easily be drawn up and might upset a small boat well so much for the white stone but there was more close by the stone i noticed although i think you didnt a mark in the claystone it was a triangular depression or pit sharp at the bottomjust the hole that would be made by the sharp impact of the square corner of a heavy box if shod with iron as the bullion cases are this was one important thing it seemed to indicate that the boxes had not been lifted directly up from the seabed but had been dragged sidewaysat all events at firstso that a sharp corner had turned over and dug into the claystone i walked a little farther and found more indicationsslight scratches small stones displaced and so on that convinced me of this and also pointed out the direction in which the cases had been dragged i followed the direction and presently arrived at another stone rather smaller than the clean one the cases had evidently caught against this and it had been displaced by their momentum and perhaps by a possible wrench from above the green growth covered the part which had been exposed to the water and the rest of the stone fitted the hole beside it from which it had been pulled clearly these things were done recently or the sea would have wiped out all the traces in the soft claystone the rest of what i did under water of course you understood i suppose so you took the bearings of the two stones in relation to the ship by pacing the distances that is so i kept the figures in my head till i could make a note of them as you saw on paper the rest was mere calculation what i judged had happened was this gullen had arranged with somebody identity unknown but certainly somebody with a boat at his disposal to lay the line and take it up the following night now anything larger than a rowing boat could not have got up quite so close to you in the night although your tug was at the other end of the wreck without a risk of being seen but no rowing boat could have dragged those cases forcibly along the bottom they would act as an anchor to it therefore this was what had happened the thieves had come in a large boata fishing smack lugger or something of that sortwith a small boat in tow the sailing boat had lain to at a convenient distance in the direction in which it was afterwards to go so as to save time if observed and a man had put off quietly in the small boat to pick up the float whatever it was there must have been a lot of slack line on this for the purpose as also for the purpose of allowing the float to drift about fairly freely and not attract attention by remaining in one place the man pulled off to the sailing boat and took the float and line aboard then the sailing boat swung off in the direction of home and the line was hauled in with the plunder at the end of it one would think you had seen it allor done it merrick remarked with a laugh nothing else could have happened you see that chain of events is the only one that will explain the circumstances a rapid grasp of the whole circumstances and a perfect appreciation of each is more than half the battle in such work as this well you know i got the exact bearings of the wreck on the chart worked out from that the lay of the two stones with the scratch marks between and then it was obvious that a straight line drawn through these and carried ahead would indicate approximately at any rate the direction the thieves vessel had taken the line fell on the coast close by the village of lostellaindeed that was the only village for some few miles either way the indication was not certain but it was likely and the only one available therefore it must be followed up and what about the painted hatch how did you guess that well i saw there were hatchgratings belonging to the nicobar floating about and it seemed probable that the thieves would use for a float something similar to the other wreckage in the vicinity so as not to attract attention nothing would be more likely than a hatchgrating but then in small vessels such as fishingluggers and so on fittings are almost always paintedthey cant afford to be such holystoning swells as those on the nicobar so i judged the grating might be painted and this would possibly have been noticed by some sharp person i made the shot and hit the boy remembered the white grating which had gonewashed away as he thought that was useful to me as you shall see i made off toward lostella the tide was low and it was getting dusk when i arrived a number of boats and smacks were lying anchored on the beach but there were few people to be seen i began looking out for smacks with whitepainted fittings in them there are not so many of these among fishing vesselsbrown or red is more likely or sheer colourless dirt over paint unrecognisable there were only two that i saw last night the first might have been the one i wanted but there was nothing to show it the second was the one she was halfdecked and had a small whitepainted hatch i shifted the hatch and found a long line attached to the grating at one end and carrying a hook at the other they had neglected to unfasten their apparatusperhaps had an idea that there might be a chance of using it again in a few days i went to the transom and read the inscription rebecca peter and david garthew lostella then my business was to find the garthews i wandered about the village for some little time and presently got hold of a boy i made a simple excuse for asking about the garthewswanted to go for a sail tomorrow the boy with many grins confided to me that both of the garthews were on the booze i should find them at the smack inn where they had been all day drunk as fiddlers this seemed a likely sort of thing after the haul they had made i went to the smack inn determined to claim old friendship with the garthews although i didnt know peter from david there they wereone sleepy drunk and the other loving and crying drunk i got as friendly as possible with them under the circumstances and at closing time stood another gallon of beer and carried it home for them while they carried each other i took care to have a good look round in the cottage i even helped peters old womanthe lady with the broomto carry them up to bed but nowhere could i see anything that looked like a bullioncase or a hidingplace for one so i came away determined to renew my acquaintance in the morning and to carry it on as long as might be necessary also to look at the garden in the daylight for signs of burying with that view i fixed that little gimlet in my walkingstick as you saw this morning i was at lostella before ten and took a look at the garthews cabbages it seemed odd that half a dozen all in a clump together looked withered and limp as though they had been dug up hastily the roots broken perhaps and then replanted and altogether these particular cabbages had a dissipated leaningdifferentways look as though they had been on the loose with the garthews so seeing a grubby child near the back door of the cottage i went towards him walking rather unsteadily so as if i were observed to favour the delusion that i was not yet quite got over last nights diversions hullo my bboy i said hullo lil bboy look here and i plunged my hand into my trousers pocket and brought it out full of small change then making a great business of selecting him a penny i managed to spill it all over the dissipated cabbages it was easy then in stooping to pick up the change to lean heavily on my stick and drive it through the loose earth as i had expected there was a box below so i gouged away with my walkingstick while i collected my coppers and finally swaggered off after a few civil words with the old woman carrying with me evident proof that it was white wood recently buried there the rest you saw for yourself i think you and i may congratulate each other on having dodged that broom it hit all the others what im wild about said merrick is having let that scoundrel gullen get off hes an artful chap without a doubt he saw us go over the side you know and after you had gone he came into the cabin for some instructions your pencil notes and the chart were on the table and no doubt he put two and two together which was more than i could not knowing what had happened and concluded to make himself safe for a bit he had no leave that nighthe just pulled away on the quiet why didnt you give me the tip to keep him that wouldnt have done in the first place there was no legal evidence to warrant his arrest and ordering him to keep aboard would have aroused his suspicions i didnt know at the time how many days or weeks it would take me to find the bullion if i ever found it and in that time gullen might have communicated in some way with his accomplices and so spoilt the whole thing yes certainly he seems to have been fairly smart in his way he knew he would probably be sent down first as usual alone to make measurements and conceived his plan and made his arrangements forthwith but now what i want to know is what about all those nicobar people watching and suspecting one another more especially what about the cases the captain and the steward are said to have fetched ashore hewitt laughed well he said as to that the presence of the bullion seems to have bred all sorts of mutual suspicion on board the ship brasyer was overfussy and his continual chatter started it probably so that it spread like an infection as to the captain and the steward of course i dont know anything but that their rescued cases were not bullion cases probably they were doing a little private tradingits generally the case when captain and steward seem unduly friendly for their relative positionsand perhaps the cases contained something specially valuable vases or bronzes from japan for instance possibly the most valuable things of the size they had aboard then if they had insured their things captain mackrie who has the reputation of a sharp and not very scrupulous man might possibly think it rather a stroke of business to get the goods and the insurance money too which would lead him to keep his parcels as quiet as possible but thats as it may be the case was much as hewitt had surmised the zealous brasyer posting to london in hot haste after mackrie spent some days in watching him at last the captain and the steward with their two boxes took a cab and went to bond street with brasyer in another cab behind them the two entered a shop the window of which was set out with rare curiosities and much old silver and gold brasyer could restrain himself no longer he grabbed a passing policeman and rushed with him into the shop there they found the captain and the steward with two small packing cases opened before them trying to sella couple of very ancientlooking japanese bronze figures of that curious old workmanship and varied colour of metal that in genuine examples mean nowadays high money value brasyer vanished there was too much chaff for him to live through in the british mercantile marine after this adventure the fact was the steward had come across the bargain but had not sufficient spare cash to buy so he called in the aid of the captain and they speculated in the bronzes as partners there was much anxious inspection of the prizes on the way home and much discussion as to the proper price to ask finally it was said they got three hundred pounds for the pair now and again hewitt meets merrick still sometimes merrick says now i wonder after all whether or not some of those nicobar men who were continually dodging suspiciously about that bullionroom did mean having a dash at the gold if there were a chance and hewitt replies i wonder the holford will case at one time in common perhaps with most people i took a sort of languid amateur interest in questions of psychology and was impelled thereby to plunge into the pages of the many curious and rather abstruse books which attempt to deal with phenomena of mind soul and sense three things of the real nature of which i am convinced no man will ever learn more than we know at presentwhich is nothing from these i strayed into the many volumes of transactions of the psychical research society with an occasional byexcursion into mental telepathy and theosophy the last a thing whereof my philistine intelligence obstinately refused to make head or tail it was while these things were occupying part of my attention that i chanced to ask hewitt whether in the course of his divers odd and outoftheway experiences he had met with any such weird adventures as were detailed in such profusion in the books of authenticated spooks doppelgangers poltergeists clairvoyance and so forth well hewitt answered with reflection i havent been such a wallower in the uncanny as some of the worthy people who talk at large in those books of yours and as a matter of fact my little adventures curious as some of them may seem have been on the whole of the most solid and matteroffact description one or two things have happened that perhaps your psychical people might be interested in but theyve mostly been found to be capable of a disappointingly simple explanation one case of some genuine psychological interest however i have had although theres nothing even in that which isnt a matter of wellknown scientific possibility and he proceeded to tell me the story that i have set down here as well as i can from recollection i think i have already said in another place that hewitts professional start as a private investigator dated from his connection with the famous will case of bartley v bartley and others in which his then principals messrs crellan hunt crellan chiefly through his exertions established their extremely high reputation as solicitors it was ten years or so after this case that mr crellan seniorthe head of the firmretired into private life and by an odd chance hewitts first meeting with him after that event was occasioned by another will difficulty these were the terms of the telegram that brought hewitt again into personal relations with his old principal can you run down at once on a matter of private business i will be at guildford to meet eleven thirtyfive from waterloo if later or prevented please wire crellan the day and the state of hewitts engagements suited and there was full half an hour to catch the train taking therefore the small travellingbag that always stood ready packed in case of any sudden excursion that presented the possibility of a night from home he got early to waterloo and by halfpast twelve was alighting at guildford station mr crellan a hale whitehaired old gentleman wearing goldrimmed spectacles was waiting with a covered carriage how dye do mr hewitt how dye do the old gentleman exclaimed as soon as they met grasping hewitts hand and hurrying him toward the carriage im glad youve come very glad it isnt raining and you might have preferred something more open but i brought the brougham because i want to talk privately ive been vegetating to such an extent for the last few years down here that any little occurrence out of the ordinary excites me and im sure i couldnt have kept quiet till we had got indoors its been bad enough keeping the thing to myself already the door shut and the brougham started mr crellan laid his hand on hewitts knee i hope he said i havent dragged you away from any important business no hewitt replied you have chosen a most excellent time indeed i did think of making a small holiday today but your telegram yes yes do you know i was almost ashamed of having sent it after it had gone because after all the matter is probably really a very simple sort of affair that you cant possibly help me in a few years ago i should have thought nothing of it nothing at all but as i have told you ive got into such a dull vegetable state of mind since i retired and have nothing to do that a little thing upsets me and i havent mental energy enough to make up my mind to go to dinner sometimes but youre an old friend and im sure youll forgive my dragging you all down here on a matter that will perhaps seem ridiculously simple to you a man in the thick of active business if i hadnt known you so well i wouldnt have had the impudence to bother you but never mind all that ill tell you do you ever remember my speaking of an intimate friend a mr holford no well its a long time ago and perhaps i never happened to mention him he was a most excellent manold fellow like me you know two or three years older as a matter of fact we were chums many years ago in fact we lodged in the same house when i was an articled clerk and he was a student at guys he retired from the medical profession early having come into a fortune and came down here to live at the house were going to as a matter of fact wedbury hall when i retired i came down and took up my quarters not far off and we were a very excellent pair of old chums till last mondaythe day before yesterdaywhen my poor old friend died he was pretty well in yearsseventythreeand a man cant live for ever but i assure you it has upset me terribly made a greater fool of me than ever in fact just when i ought to have my wits about me the reason i particularly want my wits just now and the reason i have requisitioned yours is this that i cant find poor old holfords will i drew it up for him years ago and by it i was appointed his sole executor i am perfectly convinced that he cannot have destroyed it because he told me everything concerning his affairs i have always been his only adviser in fact and im sure he would have consulted me as to any change in his testamentary intentions before he made it moreover there are reasons why i know he could not have wished to die intestate which are queried hewitt as mr crellan paused in his statement which are these holford was a widower with no children of his own his wife who has been dead nearly fifteen years now was a most excellent woman a model wife and would have been a model mother if she had been one at all as it was she adopted a little girl a poor little soul who was left an orphan at two years of age the childs father an unsuccessful man of business of the name of garth maddened by a sudden and ruinous loss committed suicide and his wife died of the shock occasioned by the calamity the child as i have said was taken by mrs holford and made a daughter of and my old friends daughter she has been ever since practically speaking the poor old fellow couldnt possibly have been more attached to a daughter of his own and on her part she couldnt possibly have been a better daughter than she was she stuck by him night and day during his last illness until she became rather ill herself although of course there was a regular nurse always in attendance now in his will mr holford bequeathed rather more than half of his very large property to this miss garth that is to say as residuary legatee her interest in the will came to about that the rest was distributed in various ways holford had largely spent the leisure of his retirement in scientific pursuits so there were a few legacies to learned societies all his servants were remembered he left me a certain number of his books and there was a very fair sum of money for his nephew mr cranley mellis the only near relation of mr holfords still living so that you see what the loss of this will may mean miss garth who was to have taken the greater part of her adoptive fathers property will not have one shillings worth of claim on the estate and will be turned out into the world without a cent one or two very old servants will be very awkwardly placed too with nothing to live on and very little prospect of doing more work everything will go to this nephew said hewitt of course of course that is unless i attempt to prove a rough copy of the will which i may possibly have by me but even if i have such a thing and find it long and costly litigation would be called for and the result would probably be all against us you say you feel sure mr holford did not destroy the will himself i am quite sure he would never have done so without telling me of it indeed i am sure he would have consulted me first moreover it can never have been his intention to leave miss garth utterly unprovided for it would be the same thing as disinheriting his only daughter did you see him frequently theres scarcely been a day when i havent seen him since i have lived down here during his illnessit lasted a monthi saw him every day and he said nothing of destroying his will nothing at all on the contrary soon after his first seizureindeed on the first visit at which i found him in bedhe said after telling me how he felt everythings as i want it you know in case i go under that seemed to me to mean his will was still as he desired it to be well yes it would seem so but counsel on the other side supposing there were another side might quite as plausibly argue that he meant to die intestate and had destroyed his will so that everything should be as he wanted it in that sense but what do you want me to dofind the will certainly if you can it seemed to me that you with your clever head might be able to form a better judgment than i as to what has happened and who is responsible for it because if the will has been taken away some one has taken it it seems probable have you told any one of your difficulty not a soul i came over as soon as i could after mr holfords death and miss garth gave me all the keys because as executor the case being a peculiar one i wished to see that all was in order and as you know the estate is legally vested in the executor from the death of the testator so that i was responsible for everything although of course if there is no will im not executor but i thought it best to keep the difficulty to myself till i saw you quite right is this wedbury hall the brougham had passed a lodge gate and approached by a wide drive a fine old red brick mansion carrying the heavy stone dressings and copings distinctive of early eighteenth century domestic architecture yes said mr crellan this is the place we will go straight to the study i think and then i can explain details the study told the tale of the late mr holfords habits and interests it was half a library half a scientific laboratorypathological curiosities in spirits a retort or two test tubes on the writingtable and a fossilized lizard mounted in a case balanced the many shelves and cases of books disposed about the walls in a recess between two bookcases stood a heavy oldfashioned mahogany bureau now it was in that bureau mr crellan explained indicating it with his finger that mr holford kept every document that was in the smallest degree important or valuable i have seen him at it a hundred times and he always maintained it was as secure as any iron safe that may not have been altogether the fact but the bureau is certainly a tremendously heavy and strong one feel it hewitt took down the front and pulled out a drawer that mr crellan unlocked for the purpose solid spanish mahogany an inch thick was his verdict heavy hard and seasoned not the sort of thing you can buy nowadays locks chubbs patent early pattern but not easily to be picked by anything short of a blast of gunpowder if there are no marks on this bureau it hasnt been tampered with well mr crellan pursued as i say that was where mr holford kept his will i have often seen it when we have been here together and this was the drawer the top on the right that he kept it in the will was a mere single sheet of foolscap and was kept folded of course in a blue envelope when did you yourself last actually see the will i saw it in my friends hand two days before he took to his bed he merely lifted it in his hand to get at something else in the drawer replaced it and locked the drawer again of course there are other drawers bureaux and so on about the place you have examined them carefully i take it ive turned out ever possible receptacle for that will in the house i positively assure you and there isnt a trace of it youve thought of secret drawers i suppose yes there are two in the bureau which i always knew of here they are mr crellan pressed his thumb against a partition of the pigeonholes at the back of the bureau and a strip of mahogany flew out from below revealing two shallow drawers with small ivory catches in lieu of knobs nothing there at all and this other as i have said was the drawer where the will was kept the other papers kept in the same drawer are here as usual did anybody else know where mr holford kept his will everybody in the house i should think he was a frank aboveboard sort of man his adopted daughter knew and the butler knew and there was absolutely no reason why all the other servants shouldnt know probably they did first said hewitt we will make quite sure there are no more secret drawers about this bureau lock the door in case anybody comes hewitt took out every drawer of the bureau and examined every part of each before he laid it aside then he produced a small pair of silver callipers and an ivory pocketrule and went over every inch of the heavy framework measuring comparing tapping adding and subtracting dimensions in the end he rose to his feet satisfied there is most certainly nothing concealed there he said the drawers were put back and mr crellan suggested lunch at hewitts suggestion it was brought to the study so far hewitt said we arrive at this either mr holford has destroyed his will or he has most effectually concealed it or somebody has stolen it the first of these possibilities you dont favour i dont believe it is a possibility for a moment i have told you why and i knew holford so well you know for the same reasons i am sure he never concealed it very well then somebody has stolen it the question is who that is so it seems to me that every one in this house had a direct and personal interest in preserving that will the servants have all something left them you say and without the will that goes of course miss garth has the greatest possible interest in the will the only person i have heard of as yet who would benefit by its loss or destruction would be the nephew mr mellis there are no other relatives you say who would benefit by intestacy not one well what do you think yourself now have you any suspicions mr crellan shrugged his shoulders ive no more right to suspicions than you have i suppose he said of course if there are to be suspicions they can only point one way mr mellis is the only person who can gain by the disappearance of this will just so now what do you know of him i dont know much of the young man mr crellan said slowly i must say i never particularly took to him he is rather a clever fellow i believe he was called to the bar some time ago and afterwards studied medicine i believe with the idea of priming himself for a practice in medical jurisprudence he took a good deal of interest in my old friends researches i am toldat any rate he said he did he may have been thinking of his uncles fortune but they had a small tiff on some medical question i dont know exactly what it was but mr holford objected to somethinga method of research or something of that kindas being dangerous and unprofessional there was no actual rupture between them you understand but melliss visits slacked off and there was a coolness where is mr mellis now in london i believe has he been in this house between the day you last saw the will in that drawer and yesterday when you failed to find it only once he came to see his uncle two days before his deathlast saturday in fact he didnt stay long did you see him yes what did he do merely came into the room for a few minutesvisitors werent allowed to stay longspoke a little to his uncle and went back to town did he do nothing else or see anybody else miss garth went out of the room with him as he left and i should think they talked for a little before he went away to judge by the time she was gone but i dont know you are sure he went then i saw him in the drive as i looked from the window miss garth you say has kept all the keys since the beginning of mr holfords illness yes until she gave them up to me yesterday indeed the nurse who is rather a peppery customer and was jealous of miss garths presence in the sick room all along made several difficulties about having to go to her for everything and there is no doubt of the bureau having been kept locked all the time none at all i have asked miss garth thatand indeed a good many other thingswithout saying why i wanted the information how are mr mellis and miss garth affected toward one anotherare they friendly oh yes indeed some while ago i rather fancied that mellis was disposed to pay serious addresses in that quarter he may have had a fancy that way or he may have been attracted by the young ladys expectations at any rate nothing definite seems to have come of it as yet but i must saybetween ourselves of coursei have more than once noticed a decided air of agitation shyness perhaps in miss garth when mr mellis has been present but at any rate that scarcely matters she is twentyfour years of age now and can do as she likes although if i had anything to say in the matterwell never mind you i take it have known miss garth a long time bless you yes danced her on my knee twenty years ago ive been her uncle leonard all her life well i think we must at least let miss garth know of the loss of the will perhaps when they have cleared away these plates she will come here for a few minutes ill go and ask her mr crellan answered and having rung the bell proceeded to find miss garth presently he returned with the lady she was a slight very pale young woman no doubt rather pretty in ordinary but now not looking her best she was evidently worn and nervous from anxiety and want of sleep and her eyes were sadly inflamed as the wind slammed a loose casement behind her she started nervously and placed her hand to her head sit down at once my dear mr crellan said sit down this is mr martin hewitt whom i have taken the liberty of inviting down here to help me in a very important matter the fact is my dear mr crellan added gravely i cant find your poor fathers will miss garth was not surprised i thought so she said mildly when you asked me about the bureau yesterday of course i need not say my dear what a serious thing it may be for you if that will cannot be found so i hope youll try and tell mr hewitt here anything he wants to know as well as you can without forgetting a single thing im pretty sure that he will find it for us if it is to be found i understand miss garth hewitt asked that the keys of that bureau never left your possession during the whole time of mr holfords last illness and that the bureau was kept locked yes that is so did you ever have occasion to go to the bureau yourself no i have not touched it then you can answer for it i presume that the bureau was never unlocked by any one from the time mr holford placed the keys in your hands till you gave them to mr crellan yes i am sure of that very good now is there any place on the whole premises that you can suggest where this will may possibly be hidden there is no place that mr crellan doesnt know of im sure it is an old house i observe hewitt pursued do you know of any place of concealment in the structureany secret doors i mean you know or sliding panels or hollow door frames and so forth miss garth shook her head there is not a single place of the sort you speak of in the whole building so far as i know she said and i have lived here almost all my life you knew the purport of mr holfords will i take it and understand what its loss may mean to yourself perfectly now i must ask you to consider carefully take your mind back to two or three days before mr holfords illness began and tell me if you can remember any single fact occurrence word or hint from that day to this in any way bearing on the will or anything connected with it miss garth shook her head thoughtfully i cant remember the thing being mentioned by anybody except perhaps by the nurse who is rather a touchy sort of woman and once or twice took it upon herself to hint that my recent anxiety was chiefly about my poor fathers money and that once when i had done some small thing for him my fatheri have always called him father you knowsaid that he wouldnt forget it or that i should be rewarded or something of that sort nothing else that i can remember in the remotest degree concerned the will mr mellis said nothing about it then miss garth changed colour slightly but answered no i only saw him to the door thank you miss garth i wont trouble you any further just now but if you can remember anything more in the course of the next few hours it may turn out to be of great service miss garth bowed and withdrew mr crellan shut the door behind her and returned to hewitt that doesnt carry us much further he said the more certain it seems that the will cannot have been got at the more difficult our position is from a legal point of view what shall we do now is the nurse still about the place yes i believe so then ill speak to her the nurse came in response to mr crellans summons a sharpfeatured pragmatical woman of fortyfive she took the seat offered her and waited for hewitts questions you were in attendance on mr holford i believe mrs turton since the beginning of his last illness since october th were you present when mr mellis came to see his uncle last saturday yes can you tell me what took place as to what the gentleman said to mr holford the nurse replied bridling slightly of course i dont know anything it not being my business and not intended for my ears mr crellan was there and knows as much as i do and so does miss garth i only know that mr mellis stayed for a few minutes and then went out of the room with miss garth how long was miss garth gone i dont know ten minutes or a quarter of an hour perhaps now mrs turton i want you to tell me in confidenceit is very importantwhether you at any time heard mr holford during his illness say anything of his wishes as to how his property was to be left in case of his death the nurse started and looked keenly from hewitt to mr crellan and back again is it the will you mean she asked sharply yes did he mention it you mean you cant find the will isnt that it well suppose it is what then suppose wont do the nurse answered shortly i do know something about the will and i believe you cant find it im sure mrs turton that if you know anything about the will you will tell mr crellan in the interests of right and justice and whos to protect me against the spite of those i shall offend if i tell you mr crellan interposed whatever you tell us mrs turton he said will be held in the strictest confidence and the source of our information shall not be divulged for that i give you my word of honour and i need scarcely add i will see that you come to no harm by anything you may say then the will is lost i may understand that hewitts features were impassive and impenetrable but in mr crellans disturbed face the nurse saw a plain answer in the affirmative yes she said i see thats the trouble well i know who took it then who was it miss garth miss garth nonsense cried mr crellan starting upright nonsense it may be nonsense the nurse replied slowly with a monotonous emphasis on each word it may be nonsense but its a fact i saw her take it mr crellan simply gasped hewitt drew his chair a little nearer if you saw her take it he said gently closely watching the womans face the while then of course theres no doubt i tell you i saw her take it the nurse repeated what was in it and what her game was in taking it i dont know but it was in that bureau wasnt it yesprobably in the right hand top drawer yes a white paper in a blue envelope yes then i saw her take it as i said before she unlocked that drawer before my eyes took it out and locked the drawer again mr crellan turned blankly to hewitt but hewitt kept his eyes on the nurses face when did this occur he asked and how it was on saturday night rather late everybody was in bed but miss garth and myself and she had been down to the diningroom for something mr holford was asleep so as i wanted to refill the waterbottle i took it up and went as i was passing the door of this room that we are in now i heard a noise and looked in at the door which was open there was a candle on the table which had been left there earlier in the evening miss garth was opening the top right hand drawer of that bureaumrs turton stabbed her finger spitefully toward the piece of furniture as though she owed it a personal grudgeand i saw her take out a blue foolscap envelope and as the flap was open i could see the enclosed paper was white she shut the drawer locked it and came out of the room with the envelope in her hand and what did you do i hurried on and she came away without seeing me and went in the opposite directiontoward the small staircase perhaps mr crellan ventured at a blurt perhaps she was walking in her sleep that she wasnt the nurse replied for she came back to mr holfords room almost as soon as i returned there and asked some questions about the medicinewhich was nothing new for i must say she was very fond of interfering in things that were part of my business that is quite certain i suppose hewitt remarkedthat she could not have been asleep quite certain she talked for about a quarter of an hour and wanted to kiss mr holford which might have wakened him before she went to bed in fact i may say we had a disagreement hewitt did not take his steady gaze from the nurses face for some seconds after she had finished speaking then he only said thank you mrs turton i need scarcely assure you after what mr crellan has said that your confidence shall not be betrayed i think that is all unless you have more to tell us mrs turton bowed and rose there is nothing more she said and left the room as soon as she had gone is mrs turton at all interested in the will hewitt asked no there is nothing for her she is a newcomer you see perhaps mr crellan went on struck by an idea she may be jealous or something she seems a spiteful womanand really i cant believe her story for a moment why well you see its absurd why should miss garth go to all this secret trouble to do herself an injuryto make a beggar of herself and besides shes not in the habit of telling barefaced lies she distinctly assured us you remember that she had never been to the bureau for any purpose whatever but the nurse has an honest character hasnt she yes her character is excellent indeed from all accounts she is a very excellent woman except for a desire to govern everybody and a habit of spite if she is thwarted but of course that sort of thing sometimes leads people rather far so it does hewitt replied but consider now is it not possible that miss garth completely infatuated with mr mellis thinks she is doing a noble thing for him by destroying the will and giving up her whole claim to his uncles property devoted women do just such things you know mr crellan stared bent his head to his hand and considered so they do so they do he said insane foolery really its the sort of thing i can imagine her doingshes honour and generosity itself but then those lies he resumed sitting up and slapping his leg i cant believe shed tell such tremendous lies as that for anybody and with such a calm face tooim sure she couldnt well thats as it may be you can scarcely set a limit to the lengths a woman will go on behalf of a man she loves i suppose by the bye miss garth is not exactly what you would call a strongminded woman no shes not that shed never get on in the world by herself shes a good little soul but nervousvery and her month of anxiety grief and want of sleep seems to have broken her up mr mellis knows of the death i suppose i telegraphed to him at his chambers in london the first thing yesterdaytuesdaymorning as soon as the telegraph office was open he came here as ive forgotten to tell you as yet the first thing this morningbefore i was over here myself in fact he had been staying not far offat ockham i thinkand the telegram had been sent on he saw miss garth but couldnt stay having to get back to london i met him going away as i came about eleven oclock of course i said nothing about the fact that i couldnt find the will but he will probably be down again soon and may ask questions yes hewitt replied and speaking of that matter you can no doubt talk with miss garth on very intimate and familiar terms oh yesyes ive told you what old friends we are i wish you could manage at some favourable opportunity today to speak to her alone and without referring to the will in any way get to know as circumspectly and delicately as you can how she stands in regard to mr mellis whether he is an accepted lover or likely to be one you know whatever answer you may get you may judge i expect by her manner how things really are very goodill seize the first chance meanwhile what to do nothing im afraid except perhaps to examine other pieces of furniture as closely as we have examined this bureau other bureaux desks tables and chests were examined fruitlessly it was not until after dinner that mr crellan saw a favourable opportunity of sounding miss garth as he had promised half an hour later he came to hewitt in the study more puzzled than ever theres no engagement between them he reported secret or open nor ever has been it seems from what i can make out going to work as diplomatically as possible that mellis did propose to her or something very near it a time ago and was pointblank refused altogether miss garths sentiment for him appears to be rather dislike than otherwise that rather knocks a hole in the theory of selfsacrifice doesnt it hewitt remarked i shall have to think over this and sleep on it its possible that it may be necessary tomorrow for you to tax miss garth pointblank with having taken away the will still i hope not i hope not too mr crellan said rather dubious as to the result of such an experiment she has been quite upset enough already and by the bye she didnt seem any the better or more composed after mellis visit this morning still then the will was gone yes and so hewitt and mr crellan talked on late into the evening turning over every apparent possibility and finding reason in none the household went to bed at ten and soon after miss garth came to bid mr crellan goodnight it had been settled that both martin hewitt and mr crellan should stay the night at wedbury hall soon all was still and the ticking of the tall clock in the hall below could be heard as distinctly as though it were in the study while the rain without dropped from eaves and sills in regular splashes twelve oclock struck and mr crellan was about to suggest retirement when the sound of a light footstep startled hewitts alert ear he raised his hand to enjoin silence and stepped to the door of the room mr crellan following him there was a light over the staircase seven or eight yards away and down the stairs came miss garth in dressing gown and slippers she turned at the landing and vanished in a passage leading to the right where does that lead to hewitt whispered hurriedly toward the small staircaseother end of house mr crellan replied in the same tones come quietly said hewitt and stepped lightly after miss garth mr crellan at his heels she was nearing the opposite end of the passage walking at a fair pace and looking neither to right nor left there was another light over the smaller staircase at the end without hesitation miss garth turned down the stairs till about half down the flight and then stopped and pressed her hand against the oak wainscot immediately the vertical piece of framing against which she had placed her hand turned on central pivots top and bottom revealing a small recess three feet high and little more than six inches wide miss garth stooped and felt about at the bottom of this recess for several seconds then with every sign of extreme agitation and horror she withdrew her hand empty and sank on the stairs her head rolled from side to side on her shoulders and beads of perspiration stood on her forehead hewitt with difficulty restrained mr crellan from going to her assistance presently with a sort of shuddering sigh miss garth rose and after standing irresolute for a moment descended the flight of stairs to the bottom there she stopped again and pressing her hand to her forehead turned and began to reascend the stairs hewitt touched his companions arm and the two hastily but noiselessly made their way back along the passage to the study miss garth left the open framing as it was reached the top of the landing and without stopping proceeded along the passage and turned up the main staircase while hewitt and mr crellan still watched her from the study door at the top of the flight she turned to the right and up three or four more steps toward her own room there she stopped and leaned thoughtfully on the handrail go up whispered hewitt to mr crellan as though you were going to bed appear surprised to see her ask if she isnt well and if you can manage to repeat that question of mine about secret hidingplaces in the house mr crellan nodded and started quickly up the stairs halfway up he turned his head and as he went on why nelly my dear he said whats the matter arent you well mr crellan acted his part well and waiting below hewitt heard this dialogue no uncle i dont feel very well but its nothing i think my room seems close i can scarcely breathe oh it isnt close tonight youll be catching cold my dear go and have a good sleep you mustnt worry that wise little head of yours you know mr hewitt and i have been making quite a night of it but im off to bed now i hope theyve made you both quite comfortable uncle oh yes capital capital weve been talking over business and no doubt we shall put that matter all in order soon by the bye i suppose since you saw mr hewitt you havent happened to remember anything more to tell him no you still cant remember any hidingplaces or panels or that sort of thing in the wainscot or anywhere no im sure i dont know of any and i dont believe for a moment that any exist quite sure of that i suppose oh yes all right now go to bed youll catch such a cold in these draughty landings come i wont move a step till i see your door shut behind you goodnight goodnight uncle mr crellan came downstairs again with a face of blank puzzlement i wouldnt have believed it he assured martin hewitt positively i wouldnt have believed shed have told such a lie and with such confidence too theres something deep and horrible here im afraid what does it mean well talk of that afterwards hewitt replied come now and take a look at that recess they went quietly still to the small staircase and there with a candle closely examined the recess it was a mere box three feet high a foot or a little more deep and six or seven inches wide the piece of oak framing pivoted to the stair at the bottom and to a horizontal piece of framing at the top stood edge forward dividing the opening down the centre there was nothing whatever in the recess hewitt ascertained that there was no catch the plank simply remaining shut by virtue of fitting tightly so that nothing but pressure on the proper part was requisite to open it he had closed the plank and turned to speak to mr crellan when another interruption occurred on each floor the two staircases were joined by passages and the groundfloor passage from the foot of the flight they were on led to the entrance hall distinct amid the loud clicking of the hall clock hewitt now heard a sound as of a persons foot shifting on a stone step mr crellan heard it too and each glanced at the other then hewitt shading the candle with his hand led the way to the hall there they listened for several secondsalmost an hourit seemedand then the noise was repeated there was no doubt of it it was at the other side of the front door in answer to hewitts hurried whispers mr crellan assured him that there was no window from which in the dark a view could be got of a person standing outside the door also that any other way out would be equally noisy and would entail the circuit of the house the front door was fastened by three heavy bolts an immense oldfashioned lock and a bar it would take nearly a minute to open at least even if everything went easily but as there was no other way hewitt determined to try it handing the candle to his companion he first lifted the bar conceiving that it might be done with the least noise it went easily and handling it carefully hewitt let it hang from its rivet without a sound just then glancing at mr crellan he saw that he was forgetting to shade the candle whose rays extended through the fanlight above the door and probably through the wide crack under it but it was too late at the same moment the light was evidently perceived from outside there was a hurried jump from the steps and for an instant a sound of running on gravel hewitt tore back the bolts flung the door open and dashed out into the darkness leaving mr crellan on the doorstep with the candle hewitt was gone perhaps five or ten minutes although to mr crellanstanding there at the open door in a state of high nervous tension and with no notion of what was happening or what it all meantthe time seemed an eternity when at last hewitt reached the door again what was it asked mr crellan much agitated did you see have you caught them hewitt shook his head i hadnt a chance he said the wall is low over there and theres a plantation of trees at the other side but i thinkyes i begin to thinkthat i may possibly be able to see my way through this business in a little while see this on the top step in the sheltered porch there remained the wet prints of two feet hewitt took a letter from his pocket opened it out spread it carefully over the more perfect of the two marks pressed it lightly and lifted it then when the door was shut he produced his pocket scissors and with great care cut away the paper round the wet part leaving a piece of course the shape of a boot sole come said hewitt we may get at something after all dont ask me to tell you anything now i dont know anything as a matter of fact i hope this is the end of the nights entertainment but im afraid the case is rather an unpleasant business there is nothing for us to do now but to go to bed i think i suppose theres a handy man kept about the place yes hes gardener and carpenter and carpetbeater and so on good wheres his sanctum where does he keep his shovels and carpet sticks in the shed by the coach house i believe i think its generally unlocked very good weve earned a nights rest and now well have it the next morning after breakfast hewitt took mr crellan into the study can you manage he said to send miss garth out for a walk this morningwith somebody i can send her out for a ride with the groomunless she thinks it wouldnt be the thing to go riding so soon after her bereavement never mind that will do send her at once and see that she goes call it doctors orders say she must go for her healths sakeanything mr crellan departed used his influence and in half an hour miss garth had gone i was up pretty early this morning hewitt remarked on mr crellans return to the study and among other things i sent a telegram to london unless my eyes deceive me a boy with a peaked capa telegraph boy in factis coming up the drive this moment yes he is it is probably my answer in a few minutes a telegram was brought in hewitt read it and then asked your friend mr mellis i understand was going straight to town yesterday morning yes read that then mr crellan took the telegram and read mellis did not sleep at chambers last night been out of town for some days past kerrett mr crellan looked up whos kerrett he asked lad in my office sharp fellow you see mellis didnt go to town after all as a matter of fact i believe he was nearer this place than we thought you said he had a disagreement with his uncle because of scientific practices which the old gentleman considered dangerous and unprofessional i think yes that was the case ah then the key to all the mystery of the will is in this room where there hewitt pointed to the bookcases read bernheims suggestive therapeutics and one or two books of heidenhains and bjoernstroems and youll see the thing more clearly than you can without them but that would be rather a long sort of job sobut why whos this somebody coming up the drive in a fly isnt it yes mr crellan replied looking out of the window presently he added its cranley mellis ah said hewitt he wont trouble us for a little ill bet you a penny cake he goes first by himself to the small staircase and tries that secret recess if you get a little way along the passage you will be able to see him but that will scarcely matteri can see you dont guess now what i am driving at i dont in the least i told you the names of the books in which you could read the matter up but that would be too long for the present purpose the thing is fairly well summarised i see in that encyclopaedia there in the corner i have put a marker in volume seven do you mind opening it at that place and seeing for yourself mr crellan doubtful and bewildered reached the volume it opened readily and in the place where it opened lay a blue foolscap envelope the old gentleman took the envelope drew from it a white paper stared first at the paper then at hewitt then at the paper again let the volume slide from his lap and gasped whywhyits the will ah so i thought said hewitt catching the book as it fell but dont lose this place in the encyclopaedia read the name of the article what is it mr crellan looked absentmindedly at the title holding the will before him all the time then mechanically he read aloud the word hypnotism hypnotism it is hewitt answered a dangerous and terrible power in the hands of an unscrupulous man butbut how i dont understand it thisthis is the real will i suppose look at it you know best mr crellan looked yes he said this certainly is the will but where did it come from it hasnt been in this book all the time has it no didnt i tell you i put it there myself as a marker but come youll understand my explanation better if i first read you a few lines from this article see here now although hypnotism has power for good when properly used by medical men it is an exceedingly dangerous weapon in the hands of the unskilful or unscrupulous crimes have been committed by persons who have been hypnotised just as a person when hypnotised is rendered extremely impressionable and therefore capable of receiving beneficial suggestions so he is nearly as liable to receive suggestions for evil and it is quite possible for an hypnotic subject while under hypnotic influence to be impressed with the belief that he is to commit some act after the influence is removed and that act he is safe to commit acting at the time as an automaton suggestions may be thus made of which the subject in his subsequent uninfluenced moments has no idea but which he will proceed to carry out automatically at the time appointed in the case of a complete state of hypnotism the subject has subsequently no recollection whatever of what has happened persons whose will or nerve power has been weakened by fear or other similar causes can be hypnotised without consent on their part there now what do you make of that why do you mean that miss garth has been hypnotised bybycranley mellis i think that is the case indeed i am pretty sure of it notice on the occasion of each of his last two visits he was alone with miss garth for some little time on the evening following each of those visits she does something which she afterwards knows nothing aboutsomething connected with the disappearance of this will the only thing standing between mr mellis and the whole of his uncles property who could have been in a weaker nervous state than miss garth has been lately remember too on the visit of last saturday while miss garth says she only showed mellis to the door both you and the nurse speak of their being gone some little time miss garth must have forgotten what took place then when mellis hypnotised her and impressed on her the suggestion that she should take mr holfords will that night long after hemellishad gone and when he could not be suspected of knowing anything of it further that she should at that time when her movements would be less likely to be observed secrete that will in a place of hiding known only to himself dear dear what a rascal do you really think he did that not only that but i believe he came here yesterday morning while you were out to get the will from the recess the recess by the bye i expect he discovered by accident on one of his visits he has been here pretty often i suppose altogether and kept the secret in case it might be useful yesterday not finding the will there he hypnotised miss garth once again and conveyed the suggestion that at midnight last night she should take the will from wherever she had put it and pass it to him under the front door what do you mean it was he you chased across the grounds last night that is a thing i am pretty certain of if we had mr melliss boot here we could make sure by comparing it with the piece of paper i cut out as you will remember in the entrance hall as we have the will though that will scarcely be necessary what he will do now i expect will be to go to the recess again on the vague chance of the will being there now after all assuming that his second dose of mesmerism has somehow miscarried if miss garth were here he might try his tricks again and that is why i got you to send her out and where did you find the will now you come to practical details you will remember that i asked about the handymans toolhouse well i paid it a visit at six oclock this morning and found therein some very excellent carpenters tools in a chest i took a selection of them to the small staircase and took out the tread of a stairthe one that the pivoted framingplank rested on and you found the will there the will as i rather expected when i examined the recess last night had slipped down a rather wide crack at the end of the stair timber which you know formed so to speak the floor of the recess the fact was the stairtread didnt quite reach as far as the back of the recess the opening wasnt very distinct to see but i soon felt it with my fingers when miss garth in her hypnotic condition on saturday night dropped the will into the recess it shot straight to the back corner and fell down the slit that was why mellis found it empty and why miss garth also found it empty on returning there last night under hypnotic influence you observed her terrible state of nervous agitation when she failed to carry out the command that haunted her it was frightful something like what happens to a suddenly awakened somnambulist perhaps anyway that is all over i found the will under the end of the stairtread and here it is if you will come to the small staircase now you shall see where the paper slipped out of sight perhaps we shall meet mr mellis hes a scoundrel said mr crellan its a pity we cant punish him thats impossible of course wheres your proof and if you had any im not sure that a hypnotist is responsible at law for what his subject does even if he were moving a will from one part of the house to another is scarcely a legal crime the explanation i have given you accounts entirely for the disturbed manner of miss garth in the presence of mellis she merely felt an indefinite sense of his power over her indeed there is all the possibility that finding her an easy subject he had already practised his influence by way of experiment a hypnotist as you will see in the books has always an easier task with a person he has hypnotised before as hewitt had guessed in the corridor they met mr mellis he was a thin dark man of about thirtyfive with large bony features and a slight stoop mr crellan glared at him ferociously well sir and what do you want he asked mr mellis looked surprised really thats a very extraordinary remark mr crellan he said this is my late uncles house i might with at least as much reason ask you what you want im here sir as mr holfords executor appointed by will yes and is the will in existence wellthe fact iswe couldnt find it then what do you mean sir by calling yourself an executor with no will to warrant you interrupted mellis get out of this house if theres no will i administrate but there is a will roared mr crellan shaking it in his face there is a will i didnt say we hadnt found it yet did i there is a will and here it is in spite of all your diabolical tricks with your scoundrelly hypnotism and secret holes and the rest of it get out of this place sir or ill have you thrown out of the window mr mellis shrugged his shoulders with an appearance of perfect indifference if youve a will appointing you executor its all right i suppose although i shall take care to hold you responsible for any irregularities as i dont in the least understand your conduct unless it is due to drink ill leave you and with that he went mr crellan boiled with indignation for a minute and then turning to hewitt i say i hope its all right he said connecting him with all this queer business we shall soon see replied hewitt if youll come and look at the pivoted plank they went to the small staircase and hewitt once again opened the recess within lay a blue foolscap envelope which hewitt picked up see he said it is torn at the corner he has been here and opened it its a fresh envelope and i left it for him this morning with the corner gummed down a little so that he would have to tear it in opening this is what was inside hewitt added and laughed aloud as he drew forth a rather crumpled piece of white paper it was only a childish trick after all he concluded but i always liked a small practical joke on occasion he held out the crumpled paper on which was inscribed in large capital letters the single wordsold the case of the missing hand i think i have recorded in another place hewitts frequent aphorism that there is nothing in this world that is at all possible that has not happened or is not happening in london but there are many strange happenings in this matteroffact country and in these matteroffact times that occur far enough from london fantastic crimes savage revenges mediaeval superstitions horrible cruelty though less in sight have been no more extinguished by the advent of the nineteenth century than have the ancient races who practised them in the dark ages some of the races have become civilized and some of the savageries are heard of no more but there are survivals in both cases i say these things having in my mind a particular case that came under the personal notice of both hewitt and myselfan affair that brought one up standing with a gasp and a doubt of ones era my good uncle the colonel was not in the habit of gathering large house parties at his place at ratherby partly because the place was not a great one and partly because the colonels gout was but there was an excellent bit of shooting for two or three guns and even when he was unable to leave the house himself my uncle was always pleased if some good friend were enjoying a good days sport in his territory as to myself the good old soul was in a perpetual state of offence because i visited him so seldom though whenever my scant holidays fell in a convenient time of the year i was never insensible to the attractions of the ratherby stubble more than once had i sat by the old gentleman when his foot was exceptionally troublesome amusing him with accounts of some of the doings of martin hewitt and more than once had my uncle expressed his desire to meet hewitt himself and commissioned me with an invitation to be presented to hewitt at the first likely opportunity for a joint excursion to ratherby at length i persuaded hewitt to take a fortnights rest coincident with a little vacation of my own and we got down to ratherby within a few days past september the st and before a gun had been fired at the colonels bit of shooting the colonel himself we found confined to the house with his foot on the familiar rest and though ourselves were the only guests we managed to do pretty well together it was during this short holiday that the case i have mentioned arose when first i began to record some of the more interesting of hewitts operations i think i explained that such cases as i myself had not witnessed i should set down in impersonal narrative form without intruding myself the present case so far as hewitts work was concerned i saw but there were circumstances which led up to it that we only fully learned afterwards these circumstances however i shall put in their proper placeat the beginning the fosters were a fairly old ratherby family of whom mr john foster had died by an accident at the age of about forty leaving a wife twelve years younger than himself and three children two boys and one girl who was the youngest the boys grew up strong healthy outofdoor young ruffians with all the tastes of sportsmen and all the qualities good and bad natural to lads of fairly welldisposed character allowed a great deal too much of their own way from the beginning their only real bad quality was an unfortunate knack of bearing malice and a certain savage vindictiveness towards such persons as they chose to consider their enemies with the louts of the village they were at unceasing war and indeed once got into serious trouble for peppering the butchers son who certainly was a great blackguard with sparrowshot at the usual time they went to oxford together and were fraternally sent down together in their second year after enjoying a spell of rustication in their first the offence was never specifically mentioned about ratherby but was rumoured of as something particularly outrageous it was at this time sixteen years or thereabout after the death of their father that henry and robert foster first saw and disliked mr jonas sneathy a director of penny banks and small insurance offices he visited ranworth the fosters home a great deal more than the brothers thought necessary and indeed it was not for lack of rudeness on their part that mr sneathy failed to understand as far as they were concerned his room was preferred to his company but their mother welcomed him and in the end it was announced that mrs foster was to marry again and that after that her name would be mrs sneathy hereupon there were violent scenes at ranworth henry and robert foster denounced their prospective fatherinlaw as a fortunehunter a snuffler a hypocrite they did not stop at broad hints as to the honesty of his penny banks and insurance offices and the house straightway became a house of bitter strife the marriage took place and it was not long before mr sneathys real character became generally obvious for months he was a model if somewhat sanctimonious husband and his influence over his wife was complete then he discovered that her property had been strictly secured by her first husbands will and that willing as she might be she was unable to raise money for her new husbands benefit and was quite powerless to pass to him any of her property by deed of gift hereupon the mans nature showed itself foolish woman as mrs sneathy might be she was a loving indeed an infatuated wife but sneathy repaid her devotion by vulgar derision never hesitating to state plainly that he had married her for his own profit and that he considered himself swindled in the result more he even proceeded to blows and other practical brutality of a sort only devisable by a mean and ugly nature this treatment at first secret became open and in the midst of it mr sneathys penny banks and insurance offices came to a grievous smash all at once and everybody wondered how mr sneathy kept out of gaol keep out of gaol he did however for he had taken care to remain on the safe side of the law though some of his codirectors learnt the taste of penal servitude but he was beggared and lived as it were a mere pensioner in his wifes house here his brutality increased to a frightful extent till his wife already broken in health in consequence went in constant fear of her life and miss foster passed a life of weeping misery all her friends entreaties however could not persuade mrs sneathy to obtain a legal separation from her husband she clung to him with the excusefor it was no morethat she hoped to win him to kindness by submission and with a pathetic infatuation that seemed to increase as her bodily strength diminished henry and robert as may be supposed were anything but silent in these circumstances indeed they broke out violently again and again and more than once went near permanently injuring their worthy fatherinlaw once especially when sneathy absolutely without provocation made a motion to strike his wife in their presence there was a fearful scene the two sprang at him like wild beasts knocked him down and dragged him to the balcony with the intention of throwing him out of the window but mrs sneathy impeded them hysterically imploring them to desist if you lift your hand to my mother roared henry gripping sneathy by the throat till his fat face turned blue and banging his head against the wall if you lift your hand to my mother again ill chop it offi will ill chop it off and drive it down your throat well do worse said robert white and frantic with passion well hang youhang you to the door youre a proved liar and thief and youre worse than a common murderer id hang you to the front door for twopence for a few days sneathy was comparatively quiet cowed by their violence then he took to venting redoubled spite on his unfortunate wife always in the absence of her sons well aware that she would never inform them on their part finding him apparently better behaved in consequence of their attack they thought to maintain his wholesome terror and scarcely passed him without a menace taking a fiendish delight in repeating the threats they had used during the scene by way of keeping it present to his mind take care of your hands sir they would say keep them to yourself or by george well take em off with a billhook but his revenge for all this sneathy took unobserved on their mother truly a miserable household soon however the brothers left home and went to london by way of looking for a profession henry began a belated study of medicine and robert made a pretence of reading for the bar indeed their departure was as much as anything a consequence of the earnest entreaty of their sister who saw that their presence at home was an exasperation to sneathy and aggravated her mothers secret sufferings they went therefore but at ranworth things became worse little was allowed to be known outside the house but it was broadly said that mr sneathys behaviour had now become outrageous beyond description servants left faster than new ones could be found and gave their late employer the character of a raving maniac once indeed he committed himself in the village attacking with his walkingstick an inoffensive tradesman who had accidentally brushed against him and immediately running home this assault had to be compounded for by a payment of fifty pounds and then henry and robert foster received a most urgent letter from their sister requesting their immediate presence at home they went at once of course and the servants account of what occurred was this when the brothers arrived mr sneathy had just left the house the brothers were shut up with their mother and sister for about a quarter of an hour and then left them and came out to the stable yard together the coachman he was a new man who had only arrived the day before overheard a little of their talk as they stood by the door mr henry said that the thing must be done and at once there are two of us so that it ought to be easy enough and afterwards mr robert said youll know best how to go about it as a doctor after which mr henry came towards the coachman and asked in what direction mr sneathy had gone the coachman replied that it was in the direction of ratherby wood by the winding footpath that led through it but as he spoke he distinctly with the corner of his eye saw the other brother take a halter from a hook by the stable door and put it into his coat pocket so far for the earlier events whereof i learned later bit by bit it was on the day of the arrival of the brothers foster at their old home and indeed little more than two hours after the incident last set down that news of mr sneathy came to colonel bretts place where hewitt and i were sitting and chatting with the colonel the news was that mr sneathy had committed suicidehad been found hanging in fact to a tree in ratherby wood just by the side of the footpath hewitt and i had of course at this time never heard of sneathy and the colonel told us what little he knew he had never spoken to the man he saidindeed nobody in the place outside ranworth would have anything to do with him hes certainly been an unholy scoundrel over those poor peoples banks said my uncle and if what they says true hes been about as bad as possible to his wretched wife he must have been pretty miserable too with all his scoundrelism for he was a completely ruined man without a chance of retrieving his position and detested by everybody indeed some of his recent doings if what i have heard is to be relied on have been very much those of a madman so that on the whole im not much surprised suicides about the only crime i suppose that he has never experimented with till now and indeed its rather a service to the world at largehis only service i expect the colonel sent a man to make further inquiries and presently this man returned with the news that now it was said that mr sneathy had not committed suicide but had been murdered and hard on the mans heels came mr hardwick a neighbour of my uncles and a fellow j p he had had the case reported to him it seemed as soon as the body had been found and had at once gone to the spot he had found the body hangingand with the right hand cut off its a murder brett he said without doubta most horrible case of murder and mutilation the hand is cut off and taken away but whether the atrocity was committed before or after the hanging of course i cant say but the missing hand makes it plainly a case of murder and not suicide ive come to consult you about issuing a warrant for i think theres no doubt as to the identity of the murderers thats a good job said the colonel else we should have had some work for mr martin hewitt here which wouldnt be fair as hes taking a rest whom do you think of having arrested the two young fosters its plain as it can beand a most revolting crime too bad as sneathy may have been they came down from london today and went out deliberately to it its clear they were heard talking of it asked as to the direction in which he had gone and followed himand with a rope isnt that rather an unusual form of murderhanging hewitt remarked perhaps it is mr hardwick replied but its the case here plain enough it seems in fact that they had a way of threatening to hang him and even to cut off his hand if he used it to strike their mother so that they appear to have carried out what might have seemed mere idle threats in a diabolically savage way of course they may have strangled him first and hanged him after by way of carrying out their threat and venting their spite on the mutilated body but that they did it is plain enough for me ive spent an hour or two over it and feel i am certainly more than justified in ordering their apprehension indeed they were with him at the time as i have found by their tracks on the footpath through the wood the colonel turned to martin hewitt mr hardwick you must know he said is by way of being an amateur in your particular lineand a very good amateur too i should say judging by a case or two i have known in this county hewitt bowed and laughingly expressed a fear lest mr hardwick should come to london and supplant him altogether this seems a curious case he added if you dont mind i think i should like to take a glance at the tracks and whatever other traces there may be just by way of keeping my hand in certainly mr hardwick replied brightening i should of all things like to have mr hewitts opinions on the observations i have madejust for my own gratification as to his opinionthere can be no room for doubt the thing is plain with many promises not to be late for dinner we left my uncle and walked with mr hardwick in the direction of ratherby wood it was an unfrequented part he told us and by particular care he had managed he hoped to prevent the rumour spreading to the village yet so that we might hope to find the trails not yet overlaid it was a man of his own he said who making a short cut through the wood had come upon the body hanging and had run immediately to inform him with this man he had gone back cut down the body and made his observations he had followed the trail backward to ranworth and there had found the new coachman who had once been in his own service from him he had learned the doings of the brothers foster as they left the place and from him he had ascertained that they had not then returned then leaving his man by the body he had come straight to my uncles presently we came on the footpath leading from ranworth across the field to ratherby wood it was a mere trail of bare earth worn by successive feet amid the grass it was damp and we all stooped and examined the footmarks that were to be seen on it they all pointed one waytowards the wood in the distance fortunately its not a greatly frequented path mr hardwick said you see there are the marks of three pairs of feet only and as first sneathy and then both of the brothers came this way these footmarks must be theirs which are sneathys is plainthey are these large flat ones if you notice they are all distinctly visible in the centre of the track showing plainly that they belong to the man who walked alone which was sneathy of the others the marks of the outside feetthe left on the left side and the right on the rightare often not visible clearly they belong to two men walking side by side and more often than not treading with their outer feet on the grass at the side and where these happen to drop on the same spot as the marks in the middle they cover them plainly they are the footmarks of henry and robert foster made as they followed sneathy dont you agree with me mr hewitt oh yes thats very plain you have a better pair of eyes than most people mr hardwick and a good idea of using them too we will go into the wood now as a matter of fact i can pretty clearly distinguish most of the other footmarksthose on the grass but thats a matter of much training we followed the footpath keeping on the grass at its side in case it should be desirable to refer again to the foottracks for some little distance into the wood the tracks continued as before those of the brothers overlaying those of sneathy then there was a difference the path here was broader and muddy because of the proximity of trees and suddenly the outer footprints separated and no more overlay the larger ones in the centre but proceeded at an equal distance on either side of them see there cried mr hardwick pointing triumphantly to the spot this is where they overtook him and walked on either side the body was found only a little farther onyou could see the place now if the path didnt zigzag about so hewitt said nothing but stooped and examined the tracks at the sides with great care and evident thought spanning the distances between them comparatively with his arms then he rose and stepped lightly from one mark to another taking care not to tread on the mark itself very good he said shortly on finishing his examination well go on we went on and presently came to the place where the body lay here the ground sloped from the left down towards the right and a tiny streamlet a mere trickle of a foot or two wide ran across the path in rainy seasons it was probably wider for all the earth and clay had been washed away for some feet on each side leaving flat bare and very coarse gravel on which the trail was lost just beyond this and to the left the body lay on a grassy knoll under the limb of a tree from which still depended a part of the cut rope it was not a pleasant sight the man was a soft fleshy creature probably rather under than over the medium height and he lay there with his stretched neck and protruding tongue a revolting object his right arm lay by his side and the stump of the wrist was clotted with black blood mr hardwicks man was still in charge seemingly little pleased with his job and a few yards off stood a couple of countrymen looking on hewitt asked from which direction these men had come and having ascertained and noticed their footmarks he asked them to stay exactly where they were to avoid confusing such other tracks as might be seen then he addressed himself to his examination first he said glancing up at the branch that was scarce a yard above his head this rope has been here for some time yes mr hardwick replied its an old swing rope some children used it in the summer but it got partly cut away and the odd couple of yards has been hanging since ah said hewitt then if the fosters did this they were saved some trouble by the chance and were able to take their halter back with themand so avoid one chance of detection he very closely scrutinised the top of a tree stump probably the relic of a tree that had been cut down long before and then addressed himself to the body when you cut it down he said did it fall in a heap no my man eased it down to some extent not on to its face oh no on to its back just as it is now mr hardwick saw that hewitt was looking at muddy marks on each of the corpses knees to one of which a small leaf clung and at one or two other marks of the same sort on the fore part of the dress that seems to show pretty plainly he said that he must have struggled with them and was thrown forward doesnt it hewitt did not reply but gingerly lifted the right arm by its sleeve is either of the brothers foster lefthanded he asked no i think not here bennett you have seen plenty of their doingscricket shooting and so ondo you remember if either is lefthanded nayther sir mr hardwicks man answered both on ems righthanded hewitt lifted the lapel of the coat and attentively regarded a small rent in it the dead mans hat lay near and after a few glances at that hewitt dropped it and turned his attention to the hair this was coarse and dark and long and brushed straight back with no parting this doesnt look very symmetrical does it hewitt remarked pointing to the locks over the right ear they were shorter just there than on the other side and apparently very clumsily cut whereas in every other part the hair appeared to be rather well and carefully trimmed mr hardwick said nothing but fidgeted a little as though he considered that valuable time was being wasted over irrelevant trivialities presently however he spoke theres very little to be learned from the body is there he said i think im quite justified in ordering their arrest ehindeed ive wasted too much time already hewitt was groping about among some bushes behind the tree from which the corpse had been taken when he answered he said i dont think i should do anything of the sort just now mr hardwick as a matter of fact i fancythis word with an emphasisthat the brothers foster may not have seen this man sneathy at all today not seen him why my dear sir theres no question of it its certain absolutely the evidence is positive the fact of the threats and of the body being found treated so is pretty well enough i should think but thats nothinglook at those footmarks theyve walked along with him one each side without a possible doubt plainly they were the last people with him in any case and you dont mean to ask anybody to believe that the dead man even if he hanged himself cut off his own hand first even if you do wheres the hand and even putting aside all these considerations each a complete case in itself the fosters must at least have seen the body as they came past and yet nothing has been heard of them yet why didnt they spread the alarm they went straight away in the opposite direction from homethere are their footmarks which youve not seen yet beyond the gravel hewitt stepped over to where the patch of clean gravel ceased at the opposite side to that from which we had approached the brook and there sure enough were the now familiar footmarks of the brothers leading away from the scene of sneathys end yes hewitt said i see them of course mr hardwick youll do what seems right in your own eyes and in any case not much harm will be done by the arrest beyond a terrible fright for that unfortunate family nevertheless if you care for my impression it is as i have said that the fosters have not seen sneathy today but what about the hand as to that i have a conjecture but as yet it is only a conjecture and if i told it you would probably call it absurdcertainly youd disregard it and perhaps quite excusably the case is a complicated one and if there is anything at all in my conjecture one of the most remarkable i have ever had to do with it interests me intensely and i shall devote a little time now to following up the theory i have formed you have i suppose already communicated with the police i wired to shopperton at once as soon as i heard of the matter its a twelve miles drive but i wonder the police have not arrived yet they cant be long i dont know where the village constable has got to but in any case he wouldnt be much good but as to your idea that the fosters cant be suspectedwell nobody could respect your opinion mr hewitt more than myself but really just think the notions impossiblefiftyfold impossible as soon as the police arrive i shall have that trail followed and the fosters apprehended i should be a fool if i didnt very well mr hardwick hewitt replied youll do what you consider your duty of course and quite properly though i would recommend you to take another glance at those three trails in the path i shall take a look in this direction and he turned up by the side of the streamlet keeping on the gravel at its side i followed we climbed the rising ground and presently among the trees came to the place where the little rill emerged from the broken ground in the highest part of the wood here the clean ground ceased and there was a large patch of wet clayey earth several marks left by the feet of cattle were there and one or two human footmarks two of these a pair the newest and the most distinct hewitt studied carefully and measured each direction notice these marks he said they may be of importance or they may notthat we shall see fortunately they are very distinctivethe right boot is a badly worn one and a small tag of leather where the soul is damaged is doubled over and trodden into the soft earth nothing could be luckier clearly they are the most recent footsteps in this directionfrom the main road which lies right ahead through the rest of the wood then you think somebody else has been on the scene of the tragedy beside the victim and the brothers i said yes i do but hark there is a vehicle in the road can you see between the trees yes it is the police cart we shall be able to report its arrival to mr hardwick as we go down we turned and walked rapidly down the incline to where we had come from mr hardwick and his man were still there and another rustic had arrived to gape we told mr hardwick that he might expect the police presently and proceeded along the gravel skirting the stream toward the lower part of the wood here hewitt proceeded very cautiously keeping a sharp lookout on either side for footprints on the neighbouring soft ground there were none however for the gravel margin of the stream made a sort of footpath of itself and the trees and undergrowth were close and thick on each side at the bottom we emerged from the wood on a small piece of open ground skirting a lane and here just by the side of the lane where the stream fell into a trench hewitt suddenly pounced on another footmark he was unusually excited see he said here it isthe right foot with its broken leather and the corresponding left foot on the damp edge of the lane itself hethe man with the broken shoehas walked on the hard gravel all the way down from the source of the stream and his is the only trail unaccounted for near the body come brett weve an adventure on foot do you care to let your uncles dinner go by the board and follow cant we go back and tell him notheres no time to lose we must follow up this manor at least i must you go or stay of course as you think best i hesitated a moment picturing to myself the excellent colonel as he would appear after waiting dinner an hour or two for us but decided to go at any rate i said if the way lies along the roads we shall probably meet somebody going in the direction of ratherby who will take a message but what is your theory i dont understand at all i must say everything hardwick said seemed to me to be beyond question there were the tracks to prove that the three had walked together to the spot and that the brothers had gone on alone and every other circumstance pointed the same way then what possible motive could anybody else about here have for such a crime unless indeed it were one of the people defrauded by sneathys late companies the motive said hewitt is i fancy a most extraordinaryindeed a weird one a thing as of centuries ago ask me no questionsi think you will be a little surprised before very long but come we must move and we mended our pace along the lane the lane by the bye was hard and firm with scarcely a spot where a track might be left except in places at the sides and at these places hewitt never gave a glance at the end the lane turned into a byroad and at the turning hewitt stopped and scrutinised the ground closely there was nothing like a recognisable footmark to be seen but almost immediately hewitt turned off to the right and we continued our brisk march without a glance at the road how did you judge which way to turn then i asked didnt you see replied hewitt ill show you at the next turning half a mile farther on the road forked and here hewitt stooped and pointed silently to a couple of small twigs placed crosswise with the longer twig of the two pointing down the branch of the road to the left we took the branch to the left and went on our mans making a mistake hewitt observed he leaves his friends messages lying about for his enemies to read we hurried forward with scarcely a word i was almost too bewildered by what hewitt had said and done to formulate anything like a reasonable guess as to what our expedition tended or even to make an effective inquirythough after what hewitt had said i knew that would be useless who was this mysterious man with the broken shoe what had he to do with the murder of sneathy what did the mutilation mean and who were his friends who left him signs and messages by means of crossed twigs we met a man by whom i sent a short note to my uncle and soon after we turned into a main road here again at the corner was the curious message of twigs a cartwheel had passed over and crushed them but it had not so far displaced them as to cause any doubt that the direction to take was to the right at an inn a little farther along we entered and hewitt bought a pint of irish whisky and a flat bottle to hold it in as well as a loaf of bread and some cheese which we carried away wrapped in paper this will have to do for our dinner hewitt said as we emerged but were not going to drink a pint of common whisky between us i asked in some astonishment never mind hewitt answered with a smile perhaps well find somebody to help ussomebody not so fastidious as yourself as to quality now we hurriedhurried more than ever for it was beginning to get dusk and hewitt feared a difficulty in finding and reading the twig signs in the dark two more turnings we made each with its silent directionthe crossed twigs to me there was something almost weird and creepy in this curious hunt for the invisible and incomprehensible guided faithfully and persistently at every turn by this now unmistakable signal after the second turning we broke into a trot along a long winding lane but presently hewitts hand fell on my shoulder and we stopped he pointed ahead where some large object round a bend of the hedge was illuminated as though by a light from below we will walk now hewitt said remember that we are on a walking tour and have come along here entirely by accident we proceeded at a swinging walk hewitt whistling gaily soon we turned the bend and saw that the large object was a travelling van drawn up with two others on a space of grass by the side of the lane it was a gipsy encampment the caravan having apparently only lately stopped for a man was still engaged in tugging at the rope of a tent that stood near the vans two or three sullenlooking ruffians lay about a fire which burned in the space left in the middle of the encampment a woman stood at the door of one van with a large kettle in her hand and at the foot of the steps below her a more pleasantlooking old man sat on an inverted pail hewitt swung towards the fire from the road and with an indescribable mixture of slouch bow and smile addressed the company generally with kooshto bock pals good luck brothers the men on the ground took no notice but continued to stare doggedly before them the man working at the tent looked round quickly for a moment and the old man on the bucket looked up and nodded quick to see the most likely friend hewitt at once went up to the old man extending his hand sarshin daddo he said dell mandy tootys varst how do you do father give me your hand the old man smiled and shook hands though without speaking then hewitt proceeded producing the flat bottle of whisky tatty for pawny chals dell mandy the pawny and lell posh the tatty spirits for water lads give me the water and take your share of the spirits the whisky did it we were romany ryes in twenty minutes or less and had already been taking tea with the gipsies for half the time the two or three we had found about the fire were still reserved but these i found were only halfgipsies and understood very little romany one or two others however including the old man were of purer breed and talked freely as did one of the women they were lees they said and expected to be on wirksby racecourse in three days time we too were pirimengroes or travellers hewitt explained and might look to see them on the course then he fell to telling gipsy stories and they to telling others back to my intense mystification hewitt explained afterwards that they were mostly stories of poaching with now and again a horsecoping anecdote thrown in since then i have learned enough of romany to take my part in such a conversation but at the time a word or two here and there was all i could understand in all this talk the man we had first noticed stretching the tentrope took very little interest but lay with his head away from the fire smoking his pipe he was a much darker man than any other presenthad in fact the appearance of a man of even a swarthier race than that of the others about us presently in the middle of a long and of course to me unintelligible story by the old man i caught hewitts eye he lifted one eyebrow almost imperceptibly and glanced for a single moment at his walkingstick then i saw that it was pointed toward the feet of the very dark man who had not yet spoken one leg was thrown over the others as he lay with the soles of his shoes presented toward the fire and in its glare i sawthat the right sole was worn and broken and that a small triangular tag of leather was doubled over beneath in just the place we knew of from the prints in ratherby wood i could not take my eyes off that man with his broken shoe there lay the secret the whole mystery of the fantastic crime in ratherby wood centred in that shabby ruffian what was it but hewitt went on talking and joking furiously the men who were not speaking mostly smoked gloomily but whenever one spoke he became animated and lively i had attempted once or twice to join in though my efforts were not particularly successful except in inducing one man to offer me tobacco from his boxtobacco that almost made me giddy in the smell he tried some of mine in exchange and though he praised it with native politeness and smoked the pipe through i could see that my hignett mixture was poor stuff in his estimation compared with the awful tobacco in his own box presently the man with the broken shoe got up slouched over to his tent and disappeared then said hewitt i translate youre not all lees here i see yes pal all lees but hes not a lee and hewitt jerked his head towards the tent why not a lee pal we be lees and he is with us thus he is a lee oh yes of course but i know he is from over the pawny come ill guess the tem he comes fromits from roumania eh perhaps the wallachian part country the men looked at one another and then the old lee said youre right pal youre cleverer than we took you for that is what they calls his tem he is a petulengroand he comes with us to shoe the gries and mend the vardoes but he is with us and so he is a lee smith horses vans the talk and the smoke went on and presently the man with the broken shoe returned and lay down again then when the whisky had all gone and hewitt with some excuse that i did not understand had begged a piece of cord from one of the men we left in a chorus of kooshto rardies goodnight by this time it was nearly ten oclock we walked briskly till we came back again to the inn where we had bought the whisky here hewitt after some little trouble succeeded in hiring a village cart and while the driver was harnessing the horse cut a couple of short sticks from the hedge these being each divided into two made four short stout pieces of something less than six inches long apiece then hewitt joined them together in pairs each pair being connected from centre to centre by about nine or ten inches of the cord he had brought from the gipsies camp these done he handed one pair to me handcuffs he explained and no bad ones either seeyou use them so and he passed the cord round my wrist gripping the two handles and giving them a slight twist that sufficiently convinced me of the excruciating pain that might be inflicted by a vigorous turn and the utter helplessness of a prisoner thus secured in the hands of captors prepared to use their instruments whom are these for i asked the man with the broken shoe hewitt nodded yes he said i expect we shall find him out alone about midnight you know how to use these now it was fully eleven before the cart was ready and we started a quarter of a mile or so from the gipsy encampment hewitt stopped the cart and gave the driver instructions to wait we got through the hedge and made our way on the soft ground behind it in the direction of the vans and the tent roll up your handkerchief hewitt whispered into a tight pad the moment i grab him ram it into his mouthwell in mind so that it doesnt easily fall out probably he will be stoopingthat will make it easier we can pull him suddenly backward now be quiet we kept on till nothing but the hedge divided us from the space whereon stood the encampment it was now nearer twelve oclock than eleven but the time we waited seemed endless but time is not eternity after all and at last we heard a move in the tent a minute after the man we sought was standing before us he made straight for a gap in the hedge which we had passed on our way and we crouched low and waited he emerged on our side of the hedge with his back towards us and began walking as we had walked behind the hedge but in the opposite direction we followed he carried something in his hand that looked like a large bundle of sticks and twigs and he appeared to be as anxious to be secret as we ourselves from time to time he stopped and listened fortunately there was no moon or in turning about as he did once or twice he would probably have observed us the field sloped downward just before us and there was another hedge at right angles leading down to a slight hollow to this hollow the man made his way and in the shade of the new hedge we followed presently he stopped suddenly stooped and deposited his bundle on the ground before him crouching before it he produced matches from his pocket struck one and in a moment had a fire of twigs and small branches that sent up a heavy white smoke what all this portended i could not imagine but a sense of the weirdness of the whole adventure came upon me unchecked the horrible corpse in the wood with its severed wrist hewitts enigmatical forebodings the mysterious tracking of the man with the broken shoe the scene round the gipsies fire and now the strange behaviour of this man whose connection with the tragedy was so intimate and yet so inexplicableall these things contributed to make up a tale of but a few hours duration but of an inscrutable impressiveness that i began to feel in my nerves the man bent a thin stick double and using it as a pair of tongs held some indistinguishable object over the flames before him excited as i was i could not help noticing that he bent and held the stick with his left hand we crept stealthily nearer and as i stood scarcely three yards behind him and looked over his shoulder the form of the object stood out clear and black against the dull red of the flame it was a human hand i suppose i may have somehow betrayed my amazement and horror to my companions sharp eyes for suddenly i felt his hand tightly grip my arm just above the elbow i turned and found his face close by mine and his finger raised warningly then i saw him produce his wristgrip and make a motion with his palm toward his mouth which i understood to be intended to remind me of the gag we stepped forward the man turned his horrible cookery over and over above the crackling sticks as though to smoke and dry it in every part i saw hewitts hand reach out toward him and in a flash we had pulled him back over his heels and i had driven the gag between his teeth as he opened his mouth we seized his wrists in the cords at once and i shall never forget the mans look of ghastly frantic terror as he lay on the ground when i knew more i understood the reason of this hewitt took both wristholds in one hand and drove the gag entirely into the mans mouth so that he almost choked a piece of sacking lay near the fire and by hewitts request i dropped that awful hand from the wooden twigs upon it and rolled it up in a parcelit was no doubt what the sacking had been brought for then we lifted the man to his feet and hurried him in the direction of the cart the whole capture could not have occupied thirty seconds and as i stumbled over the rough field at the mans left elbow i could only think of the thing as one thinks of a dream that one knows all the time is a dream but presently the man who had been walking quietly though gasping sniffing and choking because of the tightly rolled handkerchief in his mouthpresently he made a sudden dive thinking doubtless to get his wrists free by surprise but hewitt was alert and gave them a twist that made him roll his head with a dismal stifled yell and with the opening of his mouth by some chance the gag fell away immediately the man roared aloud for help quick said hewitt drag him alongtheyll hear in the vans bring the hand i seized the fallen handkerchief and crammed it over the mans mouth as well as i might and together we made as much of a trot as we could dragging the man between us while hewitt checked any reluctance on his part by a timely wrench of the wristholds it was a hard two hundred and fifty yards to the lane even for usfor the gipsy it must have been a bad minute and a half indeed once more as we went over the uneven ground he managed to get out a shout and we thought we heard a distinct reply from somewhere in the direction of the encampment we pulled him over a stile in a tangle and dragged and pushed him through a small hedgegap all in a heap here we were but a short distance from the cart and into that we flung him without wasting time or tenderness to the intense consternation of the driver who i believe very nearly set up a cry for help on his own account once in the cart however i seized the reins and the whip myself and leaving hewitt to take care of the prisoner put the turnout along toward ratherby at as near ten miles an hour as it could go we made first for mr hardwicks but he we found was with my uncle so we followed him the arrest of the fosters had been effected we learned not very long after we had left the wood as they returned by another route to ranworth we brought our prisoner into the colonels library where he and mr hardwick were sitting im not quite sure what we can charge him with unless its anatomical robbery hewitt remarked but heres the criminal the man only looked down with a sulkily impenetrable countenance hewitt spoke to him once or twice and at last he said in a strange accent something that sounded like kekin jinnavvy keck jin asked hewitt in the loud clear tone one instinctively adopts in talking to a foreigner keckeno jinny not understand the man understood and shook his head but not another word would he say or another question answer hes a foreign gipsy hewitt explained just as i thoughta wallachian in fact theirs is an older and purer dialect than that of the english gipsies and only some of the rootwords are alike but i think we can make him explain tomorrow that the fosters at least had nothing to do with at any rate cutting off sneathys hand here it is i think and he gingerly lifted the folds of sacking from the ghastly object as it lay on the table and then covered it up again but whatwhat does it all mean mr hardwick said in bewildered astonishment do you mean this man was an accomplice not at allthe case was one of suicide as i think youll agree when ive explained this man simply found the body hanging and stole the hand but what in the world for for the hand of glory eh he turned to the gipsy and pointed to the hand on the table yagvarst eh firehand there was a quick gleam of intelligence in the mans eye but he said nothing as for myself i was more than astounded could it be possible that the old superstition of the hand of glory remained alive in a practical shape at this day you know the superstition of course hewitt said it did exist in this country in the last century when there were plenty of dead men hanging at crossroads and so on on the continent in some places it has survived later among the wallachian gipsies it has always been a great article of belief and the superstition is quite active still the belief is that the right hand of a hanged man cut off and dried over the smoke of certain wood and herbs and then provided with wicks at each finger made of the dead mans hair becomes when lighted at each wick the wicks are greased of course a charm whereby a thief may walk without hinderance where he pleases in a strange house push open all doors and take what he likes nobody can stop him for everybody the hand of glory approaches is made helpless and can neither move nor speak you may remember there was some talk of thieves candles in connection with the horrible series of whitechapel murders not long ago that is only one form of the cult of the hand of glory yes my uncle said i remember reading so there is a story about it in the ingoldsby legends too i believe there isit is called the hand of glory in fact you remember the spell open lock to the dead mans knock and so on but i think youd better have the constable up and get this man into safe quarters for the night he should be searched of course i expect they will find on him the hair i noticed to have been cut from sneathys head the village constable arrived with his iron handcuffs in substitution for those of cord which had so sorely vexed the wrists of our prisoner and marched him away to the little lockup on the green then my uncle and mr hardwick turned on martin hewitt with doubts and many questions why do you call it suicide mr hardwick asked it is plain the fosters were with him at the time from the tracks do you mean to say that they stood there and watched sneathy hang himself without interfering no i dont hewitt replied lighting a cigar i think i told you that they never saw sneathy yes you did and of course thats what they said themselves when they were arrested but the things impossible look at the tracks the tracks are exactly what revealed to me that it was not impossible hewitt returned ill tell you how the case unfolded itself to me from the beginning as to the information you gathered from the ranworth coachman to begin with the conversation between the fosters which he overheard might well mean something less serious than murder what did they say they had been sent for in a hurry and had just had a short consultation with their mother and sister henry said that the thing must be done at once also that as there were two of them it should be easy robert said that henry as a doctor would know best what to do now you colonel brett had been sayingbefore we learned these things from mr hardwickthat sneathys behaviour of late had become so bad as to seem that of a madman then there was the story of his sudden attack on a tradesman in the village and equally sudden running awayexactly the sort of impulsive wild thing that madmen do why then might it not be reasonable to suppose that sneathy had become madmore especially considering all the circumstances of the case his commercial ruin and disgrace and his horrible life with his wife and her familyhad become suddenly much worse and quite uncontrollable so that the two wretched women left alone with him were driven to send in haste for henry and robert to help them that would account for all the brothers arrive just after sneathy had gone out they are told in a hurried interview how affairs stand and it is decided that sneathy must be at once secured and confined in an asylum before something serious happens he has just gone outsomething terrible may be happening at this moment the brothers determine to follow at once and secure him wherever he may be then the meaning of their conversation is plain the thing that must be done and at once is the capture of sneathy and his confinement in an asylum henry as a doctor would know what to do in regard to the necessary formalities and they took a halter in case a struggle should ensue and it were found necessary to bind him very likely wasnt it well yes mr hardwick replied it certainly is it never struck me in that light at all that was because you believed to begin with that a murder had been committed and looked at the preliminary circumstances which you learned after in the light of your conviction but now to come to my actual observations i saw the footmarks across the fields and agreed with you it was indeed obvious that sneathy had gone that way first and that the brothers had followed walking over his tracks this state of the tracks continued until well into the wood when suddenly the tracks of the brothers opened out and proceeded on each side of sneathys the simple inference would seem to be of course the one you madethat the fosters had here overtaken sneathy and walked one at each side of him but of this i felt by no means certain another very simple explanation was available which might chance to be the true one it was just at the spot where the brothers tracks separated that the path became suddenly much muddier because of the closer overhanging of the trees at the spot the path was as was to be expected wettest in the middle it would be the most natural thing in the world for two welldressed young men on arriving here to separate so as to walk one on each side of the mud in the middle on the other hand a man in sneathys state assuming him for the moment to be mad and contemplating suicide would walk straight along the centre of the path taking no note of mud or anything else i examined all the tracks very carefully and my theory was confirmed the feet of the brothers had everywhere alighted in the driest spots and the steps were of irregular lengthswhich meant of course that they were picking their way while sneathys footmarks had never turned aside even for the dirtiest puddle here then were the rudiments of a theory at the watercourse of course the footmarks ceased because of the hard gravel the body lay on a knoll at the lefta knoll covered with grass on this the signs of footmarks were almost undiscoverable although i am often able to discover tracks in grass that are invisible to others here however it was almost useless to spend much time in examination for you and your man had been there and what slight marks there might be would be indistinguishable one from another under the branch from which the man had hung there was an old tree stump with a flat top where the tree had been sawn off i examined this and it became fairly apparent that sneathy had stood on it when the rope was about his neckhis muddy footprint was plain to see the mud was not smeared about you see as it probably would have been if he had been stood there forcibly and pushed off it was a simple clear footprintanother hint at suicide but then arose the objection that you mentioned yourself plainly the brothers foster were following sneathy and came this way therefore if he hanged himself before they arrived it would seem that they must have come across the body but now i examined the body itself there was mud on the knees and clinging to one knee was a small leaf it was a leaf corresponding to those on the bush behind the tree and it was not a dead leaf so must have been just detached after my examination of the body i went to the bush and there in the thick of it were for me sufficiently distinct kneemarks in one of which the knee had crushed a spray of the bush against the ground and from that spray a leaf was missing behind the kneemarks were the indentations of boottoes in the soft bare earth under the bush and thus the thing was plain the poor lunatic had come in sight of the dangling rope and the temptation to suicide was irresistible to people in a deranged state of mind the mere sight of the means of selfdestruction is often a temptation impossible to withstand but at that moment he must have heard the stepsprobably the voicesof the brothers behind him on the winding path he immediately hid in the bush till they had passed it is probable that seeing who the men were and conjecturing that they were following himthinking also perhaps of things that had occurred between them and himselfhis inclination to selfdestruction became completely ungovernable with the result that you saw but before i inspected the bush i noticed one or two more things about the body you remember i inquired if either of the brothers foster was lefthanded and was assured that neither was but clearly the hand had been cut off by a lefthanded man with a large sharply pointed knife for well away to the right of where the wrist had hung the knifepoint had made a tiny triangular rent in the coat so that the hand must have been held in the mutilators right hand while he used the knife with his leftclearly a lefthanded man but most important of all about the body was the jagged hair over the right ear everywhere else the hair was well cut and orderlyhere it seemed as though a good piece had been so to speak sawn off what could anybody want with a dead mans right hand and certain locks of his hair then it struck me suddenlythe man was hanged it was the hand of glory then you will remember i went at your request to see the footprints of the fosters on the part of the path past the watercourse here again it was muddy in the middle and the two brothers had walked as far apart as before although nobody had walked between them a final proof if one were needed of my theory as to the three lines of footprints now i was to consider how to get at the man who had taken his hand he should be punished for the mutilation but beyond that he would be required as a witness now all the foottracks in the vicinity had been accounted for there were those of the brothers and of sneathy which we have been speaking of those of the rustics looking on which however stopped a little way off and did not interfere with our sphere of observation those of your man who had cut straight through the wood when he first saw the body and had come back the same way with you and our own which we had been careful to keep away from the others consequently there was no track of the man who had cut off the hand therefore it was certain that he must have come along the hard gravel by the watercourse for that was the only possible path which would not tell the tale indeed it seemed quite a likely path through the wood for a passenger to take coming from the high ground by the shopperton road brett and i left you and traversed the watercourse both up and down we found a footprint at the top left lately by a man with a broken shoe right down to the bottom of the watercourse where it emerged from the wood there was no sign on either side of this man having left the gravel where the body was as you will remember he would simply have stepped off the gravel on to the grass which i thought it useless to examine as i have explained but at the bottom by the lane the footprint appeared again this then was the direction in which i was to search for a lefthanded man with a brokensoled shoe probably a gipsyand most probably a foreign gipsybecause a foreign gipsy would be the most likely still to hold the belief in the hand of glory i conjectured the man to be a straggler from a band of gipsiesone who probably had got behind the caravan and had made a short cut across the wood after it so at the end of the lane i looked for a patrin this is a sign that gipsies leave to guide stragglers following up sometimes it is a heap of dead leaves sometimes a few stones sometimes a mark on the ground but more usually a couple of twigs crossed with the longer twig pointing the road guided by these patrins we came in the end on the gipsy camp just as it was settling down for the night we made ourselves agreeable as brett will probably describe to you better than i can we left them and after they had got to sleep we came back and watched for the gentleman who is now in the lockup he would of course seize the first opportunity of treating his ghastly trophy in the prescribed way and i guessed he would choose midnight for that is the time the superstition teaches that the hand should be prepared we made a few small preparations collared him and now youve got him and i should think the sooner you let the brothers foster go the better but why didnt you tell me all the conclusions you had arrived at at the time asked mr hardwick well really hewitt replied with a quiet smile you were so positive and some of the traces i relied on were so small that it would probably have meant a long argument and a loss of time but more than that confess if i had told you bluntly that sneathys hand had been taken away to make a mediaeval charm to enable a thief to pass through a locked door and steal plate calmly under the owners nose what would you have said well well perhaps i should have been a little sceptical appearances combined so completely to point to the fosters as murderers that any other explanation almost would have seemed unlikely to me and thatwell no i confess i shouldnt have believed in it but it is a startling thing to find such superstitions alive nowadays yes perhaps it is yet we find survivals of the sort very frequently the wallachians however are horribly superstitious stillthe gipsies among them are of course worse dont you remember the case reported a few months ago in which a child was drowned as a sacrifice in wallachia in order to bring rain and that was not done by gipsies either even in england as late as a poor paralysed frenchman was killed by being swum for witchcraftthat was in essex and less atrocious cases of belief in wizardry occur again and again even now then mr hardwick and my uncle fell into a discussion as to how the gipsy in the lockup could be legally punished mr hardwick thought it should be treated as a theft of a portion of a dead body but my uncle fancied there was a penalty for mutilation of a dead body per se though he could not point to the statute as it happened however they were saved the trouble of arriving at a decision for in the morning he was discovered to have escaped he had been left of course with free hands and had occupied the night in wrenching out the bars at the top of the back wall of the little prisonshed it had stood on the green for a hundred and fifty years and climbing out he was not found again and a month or two later the foster family left the district entirely the case of laker absconded there were several of the larger london banks and insurance offices from which hewitt held a sort of general retainer as detective adviser in fulfilment of which he was regularly consulted as to the measures to be taken in different cases of fraud forgery theft and so forth which it might be the misfortune of the particular firms to encounter the more important and intricate of these cases were placed in his hands entirely with separate commissions in the usual way one of the most important companies of the sort was the general guarantee society an insurance corporation which among other risks took those of the integrity of secretaries clerks and cashiers in the case of a cashbox elopement on the part of any person guaranteed by the society the directors were naturally anxious for a speedy capture of the culprit and more especially of the booty before too much of it was spent in order to lighten the claim upon their funds and in work of this sort hewitt was at times engaged either in general advice and direction or in the actual pursuit of the plunder and the plunderer arriving at his office a little later than usual one morning hewitt found an urgent message awaiting him from the general guarantee society requesting his attention to a robbery which had taken place on the previous day he had gleaned some hint of the case from the morning paper wherein appeared a short paragraph which ran thus serious bank robberyin the course of yesterday a clerk employed by messrs liddle neal liddle the wellknown bankers disappeared having in his possession a large sum of money the property of his employersa sum reported to be rather over l it would seem that he had been entrusted to collect the money in his capacity of walkclerk from various other banks and trading concerns during the morning but failed to return at the usual time a large number of the notes which he received had been cashed at the bank of england before suspicion was aroused we understand that detectiveinspector plummer of scotland yard has the case in hand the clerk whose name was charles william laker had it appeared from the message been guaranteed in the usual way by the general guarantee society and hewitts presence at the office was at once desired in order that steps might quickly be taken for the mans apprehension and in the recovery at any rate of as much of the booty as possible a smart hansom brought hewitt to threadneedle street in a bare quarter of an hour and there a few minutes talk with the manager mr lyster put him in possession of the main facts of the case which appeared to be simple charles william laker was twentyfive years of age and had been in the employ of messrs liddle neal liddle for something more than seven yearssince he left school in factand until the previous day there had been nothing in his conduct to complain of his duties as walkclerk consisted in making a certain round beginning at about halfpast ten each morning there were a certain number of the more important banks between which and messrs liddle neal liddle there were daily transactions and a few smaller semiprivate banks and merchant firms acting as financial agents with whom there was business intercourse of less importance and regularity and each of these as necessary he visited in turn collecting cash due on bills and other instruments of a like nature he carried a wallet fastened securely to his person by a chain and this wallet contained the bills and the cash usually at the end of his round when all his bills had been converted into cash the wallet held very large sums his work and responsibilities in fine were those common to walkclerks in all banks on the day of the robbery he had started out as usualpossibly a little earlier than was customaryand the bills and other securities in his possession represented considerably more than l it had been ascertained that he had called in the usual way at each establishment on the round and had transacted his business at the last place by about a quarterpast one being then without doubt in possession of cash to the full value of the bills negotiated after that mr lyster said yesterdays report was that nothing more had been heard of him but this morning there had been a message to the effect that he had been traced out of the countryto calais at least it was thought the directors of the society wished hewitt to take the case in hand personally and at once with a view of recovering what was possible from the plunder by way of salvage also of course of finding laker for it is an important moral gain to guarantee societies as an example if a thief is caught and punished therefore hewitt and mr lyster as soon as might be made for messrs liddle neal liddles that the investigation might be begun the bank premises were quite nearin leadenhall street having arrived there hewitt and mr lyster made their way to the firms private rooms as they were passing an outer waitingroom hewitt noticed two women one the elder in widows weeds was sitting with her head bowed in her hand over a small writingtable her face was not visible but her whole attitude was that of a person overcome with unbearable grief and she sobbed quietly the other was a young woman of twentytwo or twentythree her thick black veil revealed no more than that her features were small and regular and that her face was pale and drawn she stood with a hand on the elder womans shoulder and she quickly turned her head away as the two men entered mr neal one of the partners received them in his own room goodmorning mr hewitt he said when mr lyster had introduced the detective this is a serious businessvery i think i am sorrier for laker himself than for anybody else ourselves includedor at any rate i am sorrier for his mother she is waiting now to see mr liddle as soon as he arrivesmr liddle has known the family for a long time miss shaw is with her too poor girl she is a governess or something of that sort and i believe she and laker were engaged to be married its all very sad inspector plummer i understand hewitt remarked has the affair in hand on behalf of the police yes mr neal replied in fact hes here now going through the contents of lakers desk and so forth he thinks it possible laker may have had accomplices will you see him presently inspector plummer and i are old friends we met last i think in the case of the stanway cameo some months ago but first will you tell me how long laker has been a walkclerk barely four months although he has been with us altogether seven years he was promoted to the walk soon after the beginning of the year do you know anything of his habitswhat he used to do in his spare time and so forth not a great deal he went in for boating i believe though i have heard it whispered that he had one or two more expensive tastesexpensive that is for a young man in his position mr neal explained with a dignified wave of the hand that he peculiarly affected he was a stout old gentleman and the gesture suited him you have had no reason to suspect him of dishonesty before i take it oh no he made a wrong return once i believe that went for some time undetected but it turned out after all to be a clerical errora mere clerical error do you know anything of his associates out of the office no how should i i believe inspector plummer has been making inquiries as to that however of the other clerks here he is by the bye i expect come in it was plummer who had knocked and he came in at mr neals call he was a middlesized smalleyed impenetrablelooking man as yet of no great reputation in the force some of my readers may remember his connection with that case so long a public mystery that i have elsewhere fully set forth and explained under the title of the stanway cameo mystery plummer carried his billycock hat in one hand and a few papers in the other he gave hewitt goodmorning placed his hat on a chair and spread the papers on the table theres not a great deal here he said but one things plainlaker had been betting see here and here and herehe took a few letters from the bundle in his handtwo letters from a bookmaker about settlingwonder he trusted a clerkseveral telegrams from tipsters and a letter from some friendonly signed by initialsasking laker to put a sovereign on a horse for the friend with his own ill keep these i think it may be worth while to see that friend if we can find him ah we often find its betting dont we mr hewitt meanwhile theres no news from france yet you are sure that is where he is gone asked hewitt well ill tell you what weve done as yet first of course i went round to all the banks there was nothing to be got from that the cashiers all knew him by sight and one was a personal friend of his he had called as usual said nothing in particular cashed his bills in the ordinary way and finished up at the eastern consolidated bank at about a quarterpast one so far there was nothing whatever but i had started two or three men meanwhile making inquiries at the railway stations and so on i had scarcely left the eastern consolidated when one of them came after me with news he had tried palmers tourist office although that seemed an unlikely place and there struck the track had he been there not only had he been there but he had taken a tourist ticket for france it was quite a smart move in a way you see it was the sort of ticket that lets you do pretty well what you like you have the choice of two or three different routes to begin with and you can break your journey where you please and make all sorts of variations so that a man with a ticket like that and a few hours start could twist about on some remote branch route and strike off in another direction altogether with a new ticket from some outoftheway place while we were carefully sorting out and inquiring along the different routes he might have taken not half a bad move for a new hand but he made one bad mistake as new hands always doas old hands do in fact very often he was fool enough to give his own name c laker although that didnt matter much as the description was enough to fix him there he was wallet and all just as he had come from the eastern consolidated bank he went straight from there to palmers by the bye and probably in a cab we judge that by the time he left the eastern consolidated at a quarterpast one and was at palmers by twentyfivepastten minutes the clerk at palmers remembered the time because he was anxious to get out to his lunch and kept looking at the clock expecting another clerk in to relieve him laker didnt take much in the way of luggage i fancy we inquired carefully at the stations and got the porters to remember the passengers for whom they had been carrying luggage but none appeared to have had any dealings with our man that of course is as one would expect hed take as little as possible with him and buy what he wanted on the way or when hed reached his hidingplace of course i wired to calais it was a dover to calais route ticket and sent a couple of smart men off by the mail from charing cross i expect we shall hear from them in the course of the day i am being kept in london in view of something expected at headquarters or i should have been off myself that is all then up to the present have you anything else in view thats all ive absolutely ascertained at present as for what im going to doa slight smile curled plummers lipwell i shall see ive a thing or two in my mind hewitt smiled slightly himself he recognised plummers touch of professional jealousy very well he said rising ill make an inquiry or two for myself at once perhaps mr neal youll allow one of your clerks to show me the banks in their regular order at which laker called yesterday i think ill begin at the beginning mr neal offered to place at hewitts disposal anything or anybody the bank contained and the conference broke up as hewitt with the clerk came through the rooms separating mr neals sanctum from the outer office he fancied he saw the two veiled women leaving by a side door the first bank was quite close to liddle neal liddles there the cashier who had dealt with laker the day before remembered nothing in particular about the interview many other walkclerks had called during the morning as they did every morning and the only circumstances of the visit that he could say anything definite about were those recorded in figures in the books he did not know lakers name till plummer had mentioned it in making inquiries on the previous afternoon as far as he could remember laker behaved much as usual though really he did not notice much he looked chiefly at the bills he described laker in a way that corresponded with the photograph that hewitt had borrowed from the bank a young man with a brown moustache and ordinarylooking fairly regular face dressing much as other clerks dressedtall hat black cutaway coat and so on the numbers of the notes handed over had already been given to inspector plummer and these hewitt did not trouble about the next bank was in cornhill and here the cashier was a personal friend of lakersat any rate an acquaintanceand he remembered a little more lakers manner had been quite as usual he said certainly he did not seem preoccupied or excited in his manner he spoke for a moment or twoof being on the river on sunday and so onand left in his usual way can you remember everything he said hewitt asked if you can tell me i should like to know exactly what he did and said to the smallest particular well he saw me a little distance offi was behind there at one of the desksand raised his hand to me and said how dye do i came across and took his bills and dealt with them in the usual way he had a new umbrella lying on the counterrather a handsome umbrellaand i made a remark about the handle he took it up to show me and told me it was a present he had just received from a friend it was a gorseroot handle with two silver bands one with his monogram cwl i said it was a very nice handle and asked him whether it was fine in his district on sunday he said he had been up the river and it was very fine there and i think that was all thank you now about this umbrella did he carry it rolled can you describe it in detail well ive told you about the handle and the rest was much as usual i think it wasnt rolledjust flapping loosely you know it was rather an oddshaped handle though ill try and sketch it if you like as well as i can remember he did so and hewitt saw in the result rough indications of a gnarled crook with one silver band near the end and another with the monogram a few inches down the handle hewitt put the sketch in his pocket and bade the cashier goodday at the next bank the story was the same as at the firstthere was nothing remembered but the usual routine hewitt and the clerk turned down a narrow paved court and through into lombard street for the next visit the bankthat of buller clayton ladds cowas just at the corner at the end of the court and the imposing stone entranceporch was being made larger and more imposing still the way being almost blocked by ladders and scaffoldpoles here there was only the usual tale and so on through the whole walk the cashiers knew laker only by sight and that not always very distinctly the calls of walkclerks were such matters of routine that little note was taken of the persons of the clerks themselves who were called by the names of their firms if they were called by any names at all laker had behaved much as usual so far as the cashiers could remember and when finally the eastern consolidated was left behind nothing more had been learnt than the chat about lakers new umbrella hewitt had taken leave of mr neals clerk and was stepping into a hansom when he noticed a veiled woman in widows weeds hailing another hansom a little way behind he recognised the figure again and said to the driver drive fast to palmers tourist office but keep your eye on that cab behind and tell me presently if it is following us the cabman drove off and after passing one or two turnings opened the lid above hewitts head and said that there other keb is afollerin us sir an keepin about even distance all along all right thats what i wanted to know palmers now at palmers the clerk who had attended to laker remembered him very well and described him he also remembered the wallet and thought he remembered the umbrellawas practically sure of it in fact upon reflection he had no record of the name given but remembered it distinctly to be laker as a matter of fact names were never asked in such a transaction but in this case laker appeared to be ignorant of the usual procedure as well as in a great hurry and asked for the ticket and gave his name all in one breath probably assuming that the name would be required hewitt got back to his cab and started for charing cross the cabman once more lifted the lid and informed him that the hansom with the veiled woman in it was again following having waited while hewitt had visited palmers at charing cross hewitt discharged his cab and walked straight to the lost property office the man in charge knew him very well for his business had carried him there frequently before i fancy an umbrella was lost in the station yesterday hewitt said it was a new umbrella silk with a gnarled gorseroot handle and two silver bands something like this sketch there was a monogram on the lower bandc w l were the letters has it been brought here there was two or three yesterday the man said lets see he took the sketch and retired to a corner of his room oh yeshere it is i think isnt this it do you claim it well not exactly that but i think ill take a look at it if youll let me by the way i see its rolled up was it found like that no the chap rolled it up what found itporter he was its a fad of his rolling up umbrellas close and neat and hes rather proud of it he often looks as though hed like to take a mans umbrella away and roll it up for him when its a bit clumsy done rum fad eh yes everybody has his little fad though where was this foundclose by here yes sir just there almost opposite this window in the little corner about two oclock ah about that time more or less hewitt took the umbrella up unfastened the band and shook the silk out loose then he opened it and as he did so a small scrap of paper fell from inside it hewitt pounced on it like lightning then after examining the umbrella thoroughly inside and out he handed it back to the man who had not observed the incident of the scrap of paper that will do thanks he said i only wanted to take a peep at itjust a small matter connected with a little case of mine goodmorning he turned suddenly and saw gazing at him with a terrified expression from a door behind the face of the woman who had followed him in the cab the veil was lifted and he caught but a mere glance of the face ere it was suddenly withdrawn he stood for a moment to allow the woman time to retreat and then left the station and walked toward his office close by scarcely thirty yards along the strand he met plummer im going to make some much closer inquiries all down the line as far as dover plummer said they wire from calais that they have no clue as yet and i mean to make quite sure if i can that laker hasnt quietly slipped off the line somewhere between here and dover theres one very peculiar thing plummer added confidentially did you see the two women who were waiting to see a member of the firm at liddle neal liddles yes lakers mother and his fiancee i was told thats right well do you know that girlshaw her name ishas been shadowing me ever since i left the bank of course i spotted it from the beginningthese amateurs dont know how to follow anybodyand as a matter of fact shes just inside that jewellers shop door behind me now pretending to look at the things in the window but its odd isnt it well hewitt replied of course its not a thing to be neglected if youll look very carefully at the corner of villiers street without appearing to stare i think you will possibly observe some signs of lakers mother shes shadowing me plummer looked casually in the direction indicated and then immediately turned his eyes in another direction i see her he said shes just taking a look round the corner thats a thing not to be ignored of course the lakers house is being watchedwe set a man on it at once yesterday but ill put some one on now to watch miss shaws place too ill telephone through to liddlesprobably theyll be able to say where it is and the women themselves must be watched too as a matter of fact i had a notion that laker wasnt alone in it and its just possible you know that he has sent an accomplice off with his tourist ticket to lead us a dance while he looks after himself in another direction have you done anything well hewitt replied with a faint reproduction of the secretive smile with which plummer had met an inquiry of his earlier in the morning ive been to the station here and ive found lakers umbrella in the lost property office oh then probably he has gone ill bear that in mind and perhaps have a word with the lost property man plummer made for the station and hewitt for his office he mounted the stairs and reached his door just as i myself who had been disappointed in not finding him in was leaving i had called with the idea of taking hewitt to lunch with me at my club but he declined lunch i have an important case in hand he said look here brett see this scrap of paper you know the types of the different newspaperswhich is this he handed me a small piece of paper it was part of a cutting containing an advertisement which had been torn in half illustration i think i said this is from the daily chronicle judging by the paper it is plainly from the agony column but all the papers use pretty much the same type for these advertisements except the times if it were not torn i could tell you at once because the chronicle columns are rather narrow never mindill send for them all he rang and sent kerrett for a copy of each morning paper of the previous day then he took from a large wardrobe cupboard a decent but wellworn and rather roughened tall hat also a coat a little worn and shiny on the collar he exchanged these for his own hat and coat and then substituted an old necktie for his own clean white one and encased his legs in mudspotted leggings this done he produced a very large and thick pocketbook fastened by a broad elastic band and said well what do you think of this will it do for queens taxes or sanitary inspection or the gas or the watersupply very well indeed i should say i replied whats the case oh ill tell you all about that when its overno time now oh here you are kerrett by the bye kerrett im going out presently by the back way wait for about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after i am gone and then just go across the road and speak to that lady in black with the veil who is waiting in that little footpassage opposite say mr martin hewitt sends his compliments and he advises her not to wait as he has already left his office by another door and has been gone some little time thats all it would be a pity to keep the poor woman waiting all day for nothing now the papers daily news standard telegraph chronicleyes here it is in the chronicle the whole advertisement read thus yobhr shop roast you st then tonight nd top rd l no red bl straight mon one at a time whats this i asked a cryptogram ill see hewitt answered but i wont tell you anything about it till afterwards so you get your lunch kerrett bring the directory this was all i actually saw of this case myself and i have written the rest in its proper order from hewitts information as i have written some other cases entirely to resume at the point where for the time i lost sight of the matter hewitt left by the back way and stopped an empty cab as it passed abney park cemetery was his direction to the driver in little more than twenty minutes the cab was branching off down the essex road on its way to stoke newington and in twenty minutes more hewitt stopped it in church street stoke newington he walked through a street or two and then down another the houses of which he scanned carefully as he passed opposite one which stood by itself he stopped and making a pretence of consulting and arranging his large pocketbook he took a good look at the house it was rather larger neater and more pretentious than the others in the street and it had a natty little coachhouse just visible up the side entrance there were red blinds hung with heavy lace in the front windows and behind one of these blinds hewitt was able to catch the glint of a heavy gas chandelier he stepped briskly up the front steps and knocked sharply at the door mr merston he asked pocketbook in hand when a neat parlourmaid opened the door yes ah hewitt stepped into the hall and pulled off his hat its only the meter theres been a deal of gas running away somewhere here and im just looking to see if the meters are right where is it the girl hesitated illill ask master she said very well i dont want to take it away you knowonly to give it a tap or two and so on the girl retired to the back of the hall and without taking her eyes off martin hewitt gave his message to some invisible person in a back room whence came a growling reply of all right hewitt followed the girl to the basement apparently looking straight before him but in reality taking in every detail of the place the gas meter was in a very large lumber cupboard under the kitchen stairs the girl opened the door and lit a candle the meter stood on the floor which was littered with hampers and boxes and odd sheets of brown paper but a thing that at once arrested hewitts attention was a garment of some sort of bright blue cloth with large brass buttons which was lying in a tumbled heap in a corner and appeared to be the only thing in the place that was not covered with dust nevertheless hewitt took no apparent notice of it but stooped down and solemnly tapped the meter three times with his pencil and listened with great gravity placing his ear to the top then he shook his head and tapped again at length he said its a bit doubtful ill just get you to light the gas in the kitchen a moment keep your hand to the burner and when i call out shut it off at once see the girl turned and entered the kitchen and hewitt immediately seized the blue coatfor a coat it was it had a dull red piping in the seams and was of the swallowtail patterna livery coat in fact he held it for a moment before him examining its pattern and colour and then rolled it up and flung it again into the corner right he called to the servant shut off the girl emerged from the kitchen as he left the cupboard well she asked are you satisfied now quite satisfied thank you hewitt replied is it all right she continued jerking her hand toward the cupboard well no it isnt theres something wrong there and im glad i came you can tell mr merston if you like that i expect his gas bill will be a good deal less next quarter and there was a suspicion of a chuckle in hewitts voice as he crossed the hall to leave for a gas inspector is pleased when he finds at length what he has been searching for things had fallen out better than hewitt had dared to expect he saw the key of the whole mystery in that blue coat for it was the uniform coat of the hall porters at one of the banks that he had visited in the morning though which one he could not for the moment remember he entered the nearest postoffice and despatched a telegram to plummer giving certain directions and asking the inspector to meet him then he hailed the first available cab and hurried toward the city at lombard street he alighted and looked in at the door of each bank till he came to buller clayton ladds cos this was the bank he wanted in the other banks the hall porters wore mulberry coats brickdust coats brown coats and what not but here behind the ladders and scaffold poles which obscured the entrance he could see a man in a blue coat with dull red piping and brass buttons he sprang up the steps pushed open the inner swing door and finally satisfied himself by a closer view of the coat to the wearers astonishment then he regained the pavement and walked the whole length of the bank premises in front afterwards turning up the paved passage at the side deep in thought the bank had no windows or doors on the side next the court and the two adjoining houses were old and supported in places by wooden shores both were empty and a great board announced that tenders would be received in a months time for the purchase of the old materials of which they were constructed also that some part of the site would be let on a long building lease hewitt looked up at the grimy fronts of the old buildings the windows were crusted thick with dirtall except the bottom window of the house nearer the bank which was fairly clean and seemed to have been quite lately washed the door too of this house was cleaner than that of the other though the paint was worn hewitt reached and fingered a hook driven into the lefthand doorpost about six feet from the ground it was new and not at all rusted also a tiny splinter had been displaced when the hook was driven in and clean wood showed at the spot having observed these things hewitt stepped back and read at the bottom of the big board the name winsor weekes surveyors and auctioneers abchurch lane then he stepped into lombard street two hansoms pulled up near the postoffice and out of the first stepped inspector plummer and another man this man and the two who alighted from the second hansom were unmistakably plainclothes constablestheir air gait and boots proclaimed it whats all this demanded plummer as hewitt approached youll soon see i think but first have you put the watch on no hackworth road yes nobody will get away from there alone very good i am going into abchurch lane for a few minutes leave your men out here but just go round into the court by buller clayton laddss and keep your eye on the first door on the left i think well find something soon did you get rid of miss shaw no shes behind now and mrs lakers with her they met in the strand and came after us in another cab rare fun eh they think were pretty green its quite handy too so long as they keep behind me it saves all trouble of watching them and inspector plummer chuckled and winked very good you dont mind keeping your eye on that door do you ill be back very soon and with that hewitt turned off into abchurch lane at winsor weekess information was not difficult to obtain the houses were destined to come down very shortly but a week or so ago an office and a cellar in one of them was let temporarily to a mr westley he brought no references indeed as he paid a fortnights rent in advance he was not asked for any considering the circumstances of the case he was opening a london branch for a large firm of cider merchants he said and just wanted a rough office and a cool cellar to store samples in for a few weeks till the permanent premises were ready there was another key and no doubt the premises might be entered if there were any special need for such a course martin hewitt gave such excellent reasons that winsor weekess managing clerk immediately produced the key and accompanied hewitt to the spot i think youd better have your men handy hewitt remarked to plummer when they reached the door and a whistle quickly brought the men over the key was inserted in the lock and turned but the door would not open the bolt was fastened at the bottom hewitt stooped and looked under the door its a drop bolt he said probably the man who left last let it fall loose and then banged the door so that it fell into its place i must try my best with a wire or a piece of string a wire was brought and with some manoeuvring hewitt contrived to pass it round the bolt and lift it little by little steadying it with the blade of a pocketknife when at length the bolt was raised out of the hole the knifeblade was slipped under it and the door swung open they entered the door of the little office just inside stood open but in the office there was nothing except a board a couple of feet long in a corner hewitt stepped across and lifted this turning its downward face toward plummer on it in fresh white paint on a black ground were painted the words buller clayton ladds co temporary entrance hewitt turned to winsor weekess clerk and asked the man who took this room called himself westley didnt he yes youngish man cleanshaven and welldressed yes he was i fancy hewitt said turning to plummer i fancy an old friend of yours is in thismr sam gunter what the hoxton yob i think its possible hes been mr westley for a bit and somebody else for another bit but lets come to the cellar winsor weekess clerk led the way down a steep flight of steps into a dark underground corridor wherein they lighted their way with many successive matches soon the corridor made a turn to the right and as the party passed the turn there came from the end of the passage before them a fearful yell help help open the door im going madmad o my god and there was a sound of desperate beating from the inside of the cellar door at the extreme end the men stopped startled come said hewitt more matches and he rushed to the door it was fastened with a bar and padlock let me out for gods sake came the voice sick and hoarse from the inside let me out all right hewitt shouted we have come for you wait a moment the voice sank into a sort of sobbing croon and hewitt tried several keys from his own bunch on the padlock none fitted he drew from his pocket the wire he had used for the bolt of the front door straightened it out and made a sharp bend at the end hold a match close he ordered shortly and one of the men obeyed three or four attempts were necessary and several different bendings of the wire were effected but in the end hewitt picked the lock and flung open the door from within a ghastly figure fell forward among them fainting and knocked out the matches hullo cried plummer hold up who are you lets get him up into the open said hewitt he cant tell you who he is for a bit but i believe hes laker laker what here i think so steady up the steps dont bump him hes pretty sore already i expect truly the man was a pitiable sight his hair and face were caked in dust and blood and his fingernails were torn and bleeding water was sent for at once and brandy well said plummer hazily looking first at the unconscious prisoner and then at hewitt but what about the swag youll have to find that yourself hewitt replied i think my share of the case is about finished i only act for the guarantee society you know and if lakers proved innocent innocent how well this is what took place as near as i can figure it youd better undo his collar i thinkthis to the men what i believe has happened is this there has been a very clever and carefully prepared conspiracy here and laker has not been the criminal but the victim been robbed himself you mean but how where yesterday morning before he had been to more than three bankshere in fact but then how youre all wrong we know he made the whole round and did all the collection and then palmers office and all and the umbrella why the man lay still unconscious dont raise his head hewitt said and one of you had best fetch a doctor hes had a terrible shock then turning to plummer he went on as to how they managed the job ill tell you what i think first it struck some very clever person that a deal of money might be got by robbing a walkclerk from a bank this clever person was one of a clever gang of thievesperhaps the hoxton row gang as i think i hinted now you know quite as well as i do that such a gang will spend any amount of time over a job that promises a big haul and that for such a job they can always command the necessary capital there are many most respectable persons living in good style in the suburbs whose chief business lies in financing such ventures and taking the chief share of the proceeds well this is their plan carefully and intelligently carried out they watch laker observe the round he takes and his habits they find that there is only one of the clerks with whom he does business that he is much acquainted with and that this clerk is in a bank which is commonly second in lakers round the sharpest man among themand i dont think theres a man in london could do this as well as young sam gunterstudies lakers dress and habits just as an actor studies a character they take this office and cellar as we have seen because it is next door to a bank whose front entrance is being altereda fact which laker must know from his daily visits the smart mangunter let us say and i have other reasons for believing it to be hemakes up precisely like laker false moustache dress and everything and waits here with the rest of the gang one of the gang is dressed in a blue coat with brass buttons like a hallporter in bullers bank do you see yes i think so its pretty clear now a confederate watches at the top of the court and the moment laker turns in from cornhillhaving already been mind at the only bank where he was so well known that the disguised thief would not have passed musteras soon as he turns in from cornhill i say a signal is given and that boardpointing to that with the white lettersis hung on the hook in the doorpost the sham porter stands beside it and as laker approaches says this way in sir this morning the front ways shut for the alterations laker suspecting nothing and supposing that the firm have made a temporary entrance through the empty house enters he is seized when well along the corridor the board is taken down and the door shut probably he is stunned by a blow on the headsee the blood now they take his wallet and all the cash he has already collected gunter takes the wallet and also the umbrella since it has lakers initials and is therefore distinctive he simply completes the walk in the character of laker beginning with buller clayton laddss just round the corner it is nothing but routine work which is quickly done and nobody notices him particularlyit is the bills they examine meanwhile this unfortunate fellow is locked up in the cellar here right at the end of the underground corridor where he can never make himself heard in the street and where next him are only the empty cellars of the deserted house next door the thieves shut the front door and vanish the rest is plain gunter having completed the round and bagged some l or more spends a few pounds in a tourist ticket at palmers as a blind being careful to give lakers name he leaves the umbrella at charing cross in a conspicuous place right opposite the lost property office where it is sure to be seen and so completes his false trail then who are the people at hackworth road the capitalist lives therethe financier and probably the directing spirit of the whole thing merstons the name he goes by there and ive no doubt he cuts a very imposing figure in chapel every sunday hell be worth picking upthis isnt the first thing hes been in ill warrant butbut what about lakers mother and miss shaw well what the poor women are nearly out of their minds with terror and shame thats all but though they may think laker a criminal theyll never desert him theyve been following us about with a feeble vague sort of hope of being able to baffle us in some way or help him if we caught him or something poor things did you ever hear of a real woman whod desert a son or a lover merely because he was a criminal but heres the doctor when hes attended to him will you let your men take laker home i must hurry and report to the guarantee society i think but said the perplexed plummer where did you get your clue you must have had a tip from some one you knowyou cant have done it by clairvoyance what gave you the tip the daily chronicle the what the daily chronicle just take a look at the agony column in yesterday mornings issue and read the message to yobto gunter in fact thats all by this time a cab was waiting in lombard street and two of plummers men under the doctors directions carried laker to it no sooner however were they in the court than the two watching women threw themselves hysterically upon laker and it was long before they could be persuaded that he was not being taken to gaol the mother shrieked aloud my boymy boy dont take him oh dont take him theyve killed my boy look at his headoh his head and wrestled desperately with the men while hewitt attempted to soothe her and promised to allow her to go in the cab with her son if she would only be quiet the younger woman made no noise but she held one of lakers limp hands in both hers hewitt and i dined together that evening and he gave me a full account of the occurrences which i have here set down still when he was finished i was not able to see clearly by what process of reasoning he had arrived at the conclusions that gave him the key to the mystery nor did i understand the agony column message and i said so in the beginning hewitt explained the thing that struck me as curious was the fact that laker was said to have given his own name at palmers in buying his ticket now the first thing the greenest and newest criminal thinks of is changing his name so that the giving of his own name seemed unlikely to begin with still he might have made such a mistake as plummer suggested when he said that criminals usually make a mistake somewhereas they do in fact still it was the least likely mistake i could think ofespecially as he actually didnt wait to be asked for his name but blurted it out when it wasnt really wanted and it was conjoined with another rather curious mistake or what would have been a mistake if the thief were laker why should he conspicuously display his walletsuch a distinctive articlefor the clerk to see and note why rather had he not got rid of it before showing himself suppose it should be somebody personating laker in any case i determined not to be prejudiced by what i had heard of lakers betting a man may bet without being a thief but again supposing it were laker might he not have given his name and displayed his wallet and so on while buying a ticket for france in order to draw pursuit after himself in that direction while he made off in another in another name and disguised each supposition was plausible and in either case it might happen that whoever was laying this trail would probably lay it a little farther charing cross was the next point and there i went i already had it from plummer that laker had not been recognised there perhaps the trail had been laid in some other manner something left behind with lakers name on it perhaps i at once thought of the umbrella with his monogram and making a long shot asked for it at the lost property office as you know the guess was lucky in the umbrella as you know i found that scrap of paper that i judged had fallen in from the hand of the man carrying the umbrella he had torn the paper in half in order to fling it away and one piece had fallen into the loosely flapping umbrella it is a thing that will often happen with an omnibus ticket as you may have noticed also it was proved that the umbrella was unrolled when found and rolled immediately after so here was a piece of paper dropped by the person who had brought the umbrella to charing cross and left it i got the whole advertisement as you remember and i studied it yob is backslang for boy and it is often used in nicknames to denote a young smoothfaced thief gunter the man i suspect as a matter of fact is known as the hoxton yob the message then was addressed to some one known by such a nickname next hr shop roast now in thieves slang to roast a thing or a person is to watch it or him they call any place a shopnotably a thieves den so that this meant that some resortperhaps the hoxton row shopwas watched you st then tonight would be clearer perhaps when the rest was understood i thought a little over the rest and it struck me that it must be a direction to some other house since one was warned of as being watched besides there was the number and red bl which would be extremely likely to mean red blinds by way of clearly distinguishing the house and then the plan of the thing was plain you have noticed probably that the map of london which accompanies the post office directory is divided for convenience of reference into numbered squares yes the squares are denoted by letters along the top margin and figures down the side so that if you consult the directory and find a place marked as being in d for instance you find vertical divisions d and run your finger down it till it intersects horizontal division and there you are precisely i got my post office directory and looked for o it was in north london and took in parts of abney park cemetery and clissold park nd top was the next sign very well i counted the second street intersecting the top of the squarecounting in the usual way from the left that was lordship road then rd l from the point where lordship road crossed the top of the square i ran my finger down the road till it came to rd l or in other words the third turning on the lefthackworth road so there we were unless my guesses were altogether wrong straight mon probably meant straight monikerthat is to say the proper name a thiefs real name in contradistinction to that he may assume i turned over the directory till i found hackworth road and found that no was inhabited by a mr merston from the whole thing i judged this there was to have been a meeting at the hr shop but that was found at the last moment to be watched by the police for some purpose so that another appointment was made for this house in the suburbs you st then tonightthe person addressed was to come first and the others in the evening they were to ask for the householders straight monikermr merston and they were to come one at a time now then what was this what theory would fit it suppose this were a robbery directed from afar by the advertiser suppose on the day before the robbery it was found that the place fixed for division of spoils were watched suppose that the principal thereupon advertised as had already been agreed in case of emergency in these terms the principal in the actual robberythe yob addressedwas to go first with the booty the others were to come after one at a time anyway the thing was good enough to follow a little further and i determined to try no hackworth road i have told you what i found there and how it opened my eyes i went of course merely on chance to see what i might chance to see but luck favoured and i happened on that coatbrought back rolled up on the evening after the robbery doubtless by the thief who had used it and flung carelessly into the handiest cupboard that was this gangs mistake well i congratulate you i said i hope theyll catch the rascals i rather think they will now they know where to look they can scarcely miss merston anyway there has been very little to go upon in this case but i stuck to the thread however slight and it brought me through the rest of the case of course is plummers it was a peculiarity of my commission that i could equally well fulfil it by catching the man with all the plunder or by proving him innocent having done the latter my work was at an end but i left it where plummer will be able to finish the job handsomely plummer did sam gunter merston and one accomplice were takenthe first and last were well known to the policeand were identified by laker merston as hewitt had suspected had kept the lions share for himself so that altogether with what was recovered from him and the other two nearly l was saved for messrs liddle neal liddle merston when taken was in the act of packing up to take a holiday abroad and there cash his notes which were found neatly packed in separate thousands in his portmanteau as hewitt had predicted his gas bill was considerably less next quarter for less than halfway through it he began a term in gaol as for laker he was reinstated of course with an increase of salary by way of compensation for his broken head he had passed a terrible twentysix hours in the cellar unfed and unheard several times he had become insensible and again and again he had thrown himself madly against the door shouting and tearing at it till he fell back exhausted with broken nails and bleeding fingers for some hours before the arrival of his rescuers he had been sitting in a sort of stupor from which he was suddenly aroused by the sound of voices and footsteps he was in bed for a week and required a rest of a month in addition before he could resume his duties then he was quietly lectured by mr neal as to betting and i believe dropped that practice in consequence i am told that he is at the counter nowa considerable promotion the case of the lost foreigner i have already said in more than one place that hewitts personal relations with the members of the london police force were of a cordial character in the course of his work it has frequently been hewitts hap to learn of matters on which the police were glad of information and that information was always passed on at once and so long as no infringement of regulations or damage to public service were involved hewitt could always rely on a return in kind it was with a message of a useful sort that hewitt one day dropped into vine street policestation and asked for a particular inspector who was not in hewitt sat and wrote a note and by way of making conversation said to the inspector on duty anything very startling this way today nothing very startling perhaps as yet the inspector replied but one of our chaps picked up rather an odd customer a little while ago lunatic of some sort i should thinkin fact ive sent for the doctor to see him hes a foreignera frenchman i believe he seemed horribly weak and faint but the oddest thing occurred when one of the men thinking he might be hungry brought in some bread he went into fits of terror at the sight of it and wouldnt be pacified till they took it away again that was strange odd wasnt it and he was hungry too they brought him some more a little while after and he didnt funk it a bitpitched into it in fact like anything and ate it all with some cold beef its the way with some lunaticsnever the same five minutes together he keeps crying like a baby and saying things we cant understand as it happens theres nobody in just now who speaks french i speak french hewitt replied shall i try him certainly if you will hes in the mens room below theyve been making him as comfortable as possible by the fire until the doctor comes hes a long time i expect hes got a case on hewitt found his way to the large messroom where three or four policemen in their shirtsleeves were curiously regarding a young man of very disordered appearance who sat on a chair by the fire he was pale and exhibited marks of bruises on his face while over one eye was a scarcely healed cut his figure was small and slight his coat was torn and he sat with a certain indefinite air of shivering suffering he started and looked round apprehensively as hewitt entered hewitt bowed smilingly wished him goodday speaking in french and asked him if he spoke the language the man looked up with a dull expression and after an effort or two as of one who stutters burst out with je le nie thats strange hewitt observed to the men i ask him if he speaks french and he says he denies itspeaking in french hes been saying that very often sir one of the men answered as well as other things we cant make anything of hewitt placed his hand kindly on the mans shoulder and asked his name the reply was for a little while an inarticulate gurgle presently merging into a meaningless medley of words and syllablesquest ce quil naleystar squarrsacre nomnot spik itquel cheminsank you ver moshje le nie je le nie he paused stared and then as though realizing his helplessness he burst into tears hes been acryin two or three times said the man who had spoken before he was acryin when we found him several more attempts hewitt made to communicate with the man but though he seemed to comprehend what was meant he replied with nothing but meaningless gibber and finally gave up the attempt and leaning against the side of the fireplace buried his head in the bend of his arm then the doctor arrived and made his examination while it was in progress hewitt took aside the policeman who had been speaking before and questioned him further he had himself found the frenchman in a dull back street by golden square where the man was standing helpless and trembling apparently quite bewildered and very weak he had brought him in without having been able to learn anything about him one or two shopkeepers in the street where he was found were asked but knew nothing of himindeed had never seen him before but the curiousest thing the policeman proceeded was in this ere room when i brought him a loaf to give him a bit of a snack seein he looked so weak an ungry youd a thought we was agoin to poison im he fair screamed at the very sight o the bread an he scrouged hisself up in that corner an put his hands in front of his face i couldnt make out what was up at firstdidnt tumble to its bein the bread he was frightened of seein as he looked like a man as ud be frightened at anything else afore that but the nearer i came with it the more he yelled so i took it away an left it outside an then he calmed down an selp me when i cut some bits off that there very loaf an brought em in with a bit o beef he just went for em like one oclock he wasnt frightened o no bread then you bet rum thing how the fancies takes em when theyre a bit touched aint it all one way one minute all the other the next yes it is by the way have you another uncut loaf in the place yes sir half a dozen if you like one will be enough i am going over to speak to the doctor wait awhile until he seems very quiet and fairly comfortable then bring a loaf in quietly and put it on the table not far from his elbow dont attract his attention to what you are doing the doctor stood looking thoughtfully down on the frenchman who for his part stared gloomily but tranquilly at the fireplace hewitt stepped quietly over to the doctor and without disturbing the man by the fire said interrogatively aphasia the doctor tightened his lips frowned and nodded significantly motor he murmured just loudly enough for hewitt to hear and theres a general nervous breakdown as well i should say by the way perhaps theres no agraphia have you tried him with pen and paper pen and paper were brought and set before the man he was told slowly and distinctly that he was among friends whose only object was to restore him to his proper health would he write his name and address and any other information he might care to give about himself on the paper before him the frenchman took the pen and stared at the paper then slowly and with much hesitation he traced these marks illustration the man paused after the last of these futile characters and his pen stabbed into the paper with a blot as he dazedly regarded his work then with a groan he dropped it and his face sank again into the bend of his arm the doctor took the paper and handed it to hewitt complete agraphia you see he said he cant write a word he begins to write monsieur from sheer habit in beginning letters thus but the word tails off into a scrawl then his attempts become mere scribble with just a trace of some familiar word here and therebut quite meaningless all although he had never before chanced to come across a case of aphasia happily a rare disease hewitt was acquainted with its general nature he knew that it might arise either from some physical injury to the brain or from a breakdown consequent on some terrible nervous strain he knew that in the case of motor aphasia the sufferer though fully conscious of all that goes on about him and though quite understanding what is said to him is entirely powerless to put his own thoughts into spoken wordshas lost in fact the connection between words and their spoken symbols also that in most bad cases agraphiathe loss of ability to write words with any reference to their meaningis commonly an accompaniment you will have him taken to the infirmary i suppose hewitt asked yes the doctor replied i shall go and see about it at once the man looked up again as they spoke the policeman had in accordance with hewitts request placed a loaf of bread on the table near him and now as he looked up he caught sight of it he started visibly and paled but gave no such signs of abject terror as the policeman had previously observed he appeared nervous and uneasy however and presently reached stealthily toward the loaf hewitt continued to talk to the doctor while closely watching the frenchmans behaviour from the corner of his eye the loaf was what is called a plain cottage of solid and regular shape the man reached it and immediately turned it bottom up on the table then he sank back in his chair with a more contented expression though his gaze was still directed toward the loaf the policeman grinned silently at this curious manoeuvre the doctor left and hewitt accompanied him to the door of the room he will not be moved just yet i take it hewitt asked as they parted it may take an hour or two the doctor replied are you anxious to keep him here not for long but i think theres a curious inside to the case and i may perhaps learn something of it by a little watching but i cant spare very long at a sign from hewitt the loaf was removed then hewitt pulled the small table closer to the frenchman and pushed the pen and sheets of paper toward him the manoeuvre had its result the man looked up and down the room vacantly once or twice and then began to turn the papers over from that he went to dipping the pen in the inkpot and presently he was scribbling at random on the loose sheets hewitt affected to leave him entirely alone and seemed to be absorbed in a contemplation of a photograph of a policedivision brass band that hung on the wall but he saw every scratch the man made at first there was nothing but meaningless scrawls and attempted words then rough sketches appeared of a mans head a chair or what not on the mantelpiece stood a small clockapparently a sort of humble presentation piece the body of the clock being set in a horseshoe frame with crossed whips behind it after a time the frenchmans eyes fell on this and he began a crude sketch of it that he relinquished and went on with other random sketches and scribblings on the same piece of paper sketching and scribbling over the sketches in a halfmechanical sort of way as of one who trifles with a pen during a brown study beginning at the top lefthand corner of the paper he travelled all round it till he arrived at the lefthand bottom corner then dashing his pen hastily across his last sketch he dropped it and with a great shudder turned away again and hid his face by the fireplace hewitt turned at once and seized the papers on the table he stuffed them all into his coatpocket with the exception of the last which the man had been engaged on and this a facsimile of which is subjoined he studied earnestly for several minutes hewitt wished the men goodday and made his way to the inspector well the inspector said not much to be got out of him is there the doctor will be sending for him presently illustration i fancy said hewitt that this may turn out a very important case possiblyquite possiblyi may not have guessed correctly and so i wont tell you anything of it till i know a little more but what i want now is a messenger can i send somebody at once in a cab to my friend brett at his chambers certainly ill find somebody want to write a note hewitt wrote and despatched a note which reached me in less than ten minutes then he asked the inspector have you searched the frenchman oh yes we went all over him when we found he couldnt explain himself to see if we could trace his friends or his address he didnt seem to mind but there wasnt a single thing in his pocketnot a single thing barring a rag of a pockethandkerchief with no marking on it you noticed that somebody had stolen his watch i suppose well he hadnt got one but he had one of those little vertical buttonholes in his waistcoat used to fasten a watchguard to and it was much worn and frayed so that he must be in the habit of carrying a watch and it is gone yes and everything else too eh looks like robbery hes had a knock or two in the facenotice that i saw the bruises and the cut of course and his collar has been broken away with the back button somebody has taken him by the collar or throat was he wearing a hat when he was found no that would imply that he had only just left a house what street was he found in henry streeta little off golden square low street you know did the constable notice a door open near by the inspector shook his head half the doors in the street are open he said pretty nearly all day ah then theres nothing in that i dont think he lives there by the bye i fancy he comes from more in the seven dials or drury lane direction did you notice anything about the man that gave you a clue to his occupationor at any rate to his habits cant say i did well just take a look at the back of his coat before he goes awayjust over the loins goodday as i have said hewitts messenger was quick i happened to be inhaving lately returned from a latish lunchwhen he arrived with this note my dear bi meant to have lunched with you today but have been kept i expect you are idle this afternoon and i have a case that will interest youperhaps be useful to you from a journalistic point of view if you care to see anything of it cab away at once to fitzroy square south side where ill meet you i will wait no later than yours m h i had scarce a quarter of an hour so i seized my hat and left my chambers at once as it happened my cab and hewitts burst into fitzroy square from opposite sides almost at the same moment so that we lost no time come said hewitt taking my arm and marching me off we are going to look for some stabling try to feel as though youd just set up a brougham and had come out to look for a place to put it in i fear we may have to delude some person with that belief presently whywhat do you want stables for and why make me your excuse as to what i want the stables forreally im not altogether sure myself as to making you an excusewell even the humblest excuse is better than none but come here are some stables not good enough though even if any of them were empty come on we had stopped for an instant at the entrance to a small alley of rather dirty stables and hewitt paying apparently but small attention to the stables themselves had looked sharply about him with his gaze in the air i know this part of london pretty well hewitt observed and i can only remember one other range of stabling near by we must try that as a matter of fact im coming here on little more than conjecture though i shall be surprised if there isnt something in it do you know anything of aphasia i have heard of it of course though i cant say i remember ever knowing a case ive seen one todayvery curious case the mans a frenchman discovered helpless in the street by a policeman the only thing he can say that has any meaning in it at all is je le nie and that he says mechanically without in the least knowing what he is saying and he cant write but he got sketching and scrawling various things on some paper and his scrawlstogether with another thing or twohave given me an idea were following it up now when we are less busy and in a quiet place ill show you the sketches and explain things generally theres no time now and i may want your help for a bit in which case ignorance may prevent you spoiling things you clumsy ruffian hullo here we are i think we had stopped at the end of another stableyard rather dirtier than the first the stables were sound but inelegant sheds and one or two appeared to be devoted to other purposes having low chimneys on one of which an old basket was rakishly set by way of cowl beside the entrance a wornout old board was nailed with the legend stabling to let in letters formerly white on a ground formerly black come said hewitt well explore we picked our way over the greasy cobblestones and looked about us on the left was the wall enclosing certain backyards and on the right the stables two doors in the middle of these were open and a butchers young man who with his shiny bullet head would have been known for a butchers young man anywhere was wiping over the newwashed wheel of a smart butchers cart goodday hewitt said pleasantly to the young man i notice theres some stabling to let here now where should i inquire about it jones whitfield street the young man answered giving the wheel a final spin but theres only one little place to let now i think and it aint very grand oh which is that next but one to the street there a chap ad it for woodchoppin but e chucked it there aint room for moren a donkey an a barrow ah thats a pity were not particular but want something big enough and we dont mind paying a fair price perhaps we might make an arrangement with somebody here who has a stable the young man shook his head i shouldnt think so he said doubtfully theyre mostly shoppeople as wants all the room theirselves my guvnor couldnt do nothink i know these ere two stables aint scarcely enough for all e wants as it is then theres barkett the greengrocer ere next door that aint no good then next to that theres the little place as is to let and at the end theres griffiths at the buttershop and those the other way well this ere first ones curtiss euston roadthats a buttershop too an e as the next after that the last one up at the endi dunno quite whose that is it aint been long took but i blieve its some foreign bakers i aint ever see anythink come out of it though but theres a orse there i knowi seen the feed took in hewitt turned thoughtfully away thanks he said i suppose we cant manage it then goodday we walked to the street as the butchers young man wheeled in his cart and flung away his pail of water will you just hang about here brett he asked while i hurry round to the nearest ironmongers i shant be gone long were going to work a little burglary take note if anybody comes to that stable at the farther end he hurried away and i waited in a few moments the butchers young man shut his doors and went whistling down the street and in a few moments more hewitt appeared come he said theres nobody about now well lose no time ive bought a pair of pliers and a few nails we reentered the yard at the door of the last stable hewitt stooped and examined the padlock taking a nail in his pliers he bent it carefully against the brick wall then using the nail as a key still held by the pliers and working the padlock gently in his left hand in an astonishingly few seconds he had released the hasp and taken off the padlock im not altogether a bad burglar he remarked not so bad really the padlock fastened a bar which when removed allowed the door to be opened opening it hewitt immediately seized a candle stuck in a bottle which stood on a shelf pulled me in and closed the door behind us well do this by candlelight he said as he struck a match if the door were left open it would be seen from the street keep your ears open in case anybody comes down the yard the part of the shed that we stood in was used as a coachhouse and was occupied by a rather shabby tradesmans cart the shafts of which rested on the ground from the stall adjoining came the sound of the shuffling and trampling of an impatient horse we turned to the cart on the nameboard at the side were painted in worn letters the words schuyler baker the address which had been below was painted out hewitt took out the pins and let down the tail board within the cart was a new bedmattress which covered the whole surface at the bottom i felt it pressed it from the top and saw that it was an ordinary spring mattressperhaps rather unusually soft in the springs it seemed a curious thing to keep in a bakers cart hewitt who had set the candle on a convenient shelf plunged his arm into the farthermost recesses of the cart and brought forth a very long french loaf and then another diving again he produced certain loaves of the sort known as the plain cottage two sets of four each each set baked together in a row feel this bread said hewitt and i felt it it was stalealmost as hard as wood hewitt produced a large pocketknife and with what seemed to me to be superfluous care and elaboration cut into the top of one of the cottage loaves then he inserted his fingers in the gap he had made and firmly but slowly tore the hard bread into two pieces he pulled away the crumb from within till there was nothing left but a rather thick outer shell no he said rather to himself than to me theres nothing in that he lifted one of the very long french loaves and measured it against the interior of the cart it had before been propped diagonally and now it was noticeable that it was just a shade longer than the inside of the cart was wide jammed in in fact it held firmly hewitt produced his knife again and divided this long loaf in the centre there was nothing but bread in that the horse in the stall fidgeted more than ever that horse hasnt been fed lately i fancy hewitt said well give the poor chap a bit of this hay in the corner but i said what about this bread what did you expect to find in it i cant see what youre driving at ill tell you hewitt replied im driving after something i expect to find and close at hand here too how are your nerves todaypretty steady the thing may try them before i could reply there was a sound of footsteps in the yard outside approaching hewitt lifted his finger instantly for silence and whispered hurriedly theres only one if he comes here we grab him the steps came nearer and stopped outside the door there was a pause and then a slight drawing in of breath as of a person suddenly surprised at that moment the door was slightly shifted ajar and an eye peeped in catch him said hewitt aloud as we sprang to the door he mustnt get away i had been nearer the doorway and was first through it the stranger ran down the yard at his best but my legs were the longer and halfway to the street i caught him by the shoulder and swung him round like lightning he whipped out a knife and i flung in my left instantly on the chance of flooring him it barely checked him however and the knife swung short of my chest by no more than two inches but hewitt had him by the wrist and tripped him forward on his face he struggled like a wild beast and hewitt had to stand on his forearm and force up his wrist till the bones were near breaking before he dropped his knife but throughout the struggle the man never shouted called for help nor indeed made the slightest sound and we on our part were equally silent it was quickly over of course for he was on his face and we were two we dragged our prisoner into the stable and closed the door behind us so far as we had seen nobody had witnessed the capture from the street though of course we had been too busy to be certain theres a set of harness hanging over at the back said hewitt i think well tie him up with the traces and reinsnothing like leather we dont need a gag i know he wont shout while i got the straps hewitt held the prisoner by a peculiar neckandwrist grip that forbade him to move except at the peril of a snapped arm he had probably never been a person of pleasant aspect being short strongly and squatly built large and ugly of feature and wild and dirty of hair and beard and now his face flushed with struggling and smeared with mud from the stableyard his nose bleeding and his forehead exhibiting a growing bump he looked particularly repellent we strapped his elbows together behind and as he sullenly ignored a demand for the contents of his pockets hewitt unceremoniously turned them out helpless as he was the man struggled to prevent this though of course ineffectually there were papers tobacco a bunch of keys and various odds and ends hewitt was glancing hastily at the papers when suddenly dropping them he caught the prisoner by the shoulder and pulled him away from a partlyconsumed haytruss which stood in a corner and toward which he had quietly sidled keep him still said hewitt we havent examined this place yet and he commenced to pull away the hay from the corner presently a large piece of sackcloth was revealed and this being lifted left visible below it another batch of loaves of the same sort as we had seen in the cart there were a dozen of them in one square batch and the only thing about them that differed them from those in the cart was their position for the batch lay bottom side up thats enough i think hewitt said dont touch them for heavens sake he picked up the papers he had dropped that has saved us a little search he continued see here brett i was in the act of telling you my suspicions when this little affair interrupted me if you care to look at one or two of these letters youll see what i should have told you its anarchism and bombs of course im about as certain as i can be that theres a reversible dynamite bomb inside each of those innocent loaves though i assure you i dont mean meddling with them now but see here will you go and bring in a fourwheeler bring it right down the yard theres more to do and we mustnt attract attention i hurried away and found the cab the meaning of the loaves the cart and the springmattress was now plain there was an anarchist plot to carry out a number of explosions probably simultaneously in different parts of the city i had of course heard much of the terrible reversing bombsthose bombs which containing a tube of acid plugged by wadding required no fuse and only needed to be inverted to be set going to explode in a few minutes the loaves containing these bombs would form an effectual blind and they were to be distributed probably in broad daylight in the most natural manner possible in a bakers cart a man would be waiting near the scene of each contemplated explosion he would be given a loaf taken from the inverted batch he would take itperhaps wrapped in paper but still inverted and apparently the most innocent object possibleto the spot selected deposit it right side upwhich would reverse the inner tube and set up the actionin some quiet corner behind a door or what not and make his own escape while the explosion tore down walls andif the experiment were luckyscattered the flesh and bones of unsuspecting people the infernal loaves were made and kept reversed to begin with in order to stand more firmly andif observedmore naturally when turned over to explode even if a child picked up the loaf and carried it off that child at least would be blown to atoms which at any rate would have been something for the conspirators to congratulate themselves upon the springmattress of course was to ease the jolting to the bombs and obviate any random jerking loose of the acid which might have had the deplorable result of sacrificing the valuable life of the conspirator who drove the cart the other loaves too with no explosive contents had their use the two long ones which fitted across the inside of the cart would be jammed across so as to hold the bombs in the centre and the others would be used to pack the batch on the other sides and prevent any dangerous slipping about the thing seemed pretty plain except that as yet i had no idea of how hewitt learned anything of the business i brought the fourwheeler up to the door of the stable and we thrust the man into it and hewitt locked the stable door with its proper key then we drove off to tottenham court road policestation and by hewitts order straight into the yard in less than ten minutes from our departure from the stable our prisoner was finally secured and hewitt was deep in consultation with police officials messengers were sent and telegrams despatched and presently hewitt came to me with information the name of the helpless frenchman the police found this morning he said appears to be gerardat least i am almost certain of it among the papers found on the prisonerwhose full name doesnt appear but who seems to be spoken of as luigi he is italianamong the papers i say is a sort of notice convening a meeting for this evening to decide as to the final punishment to be awarded the traitor gerard now in charge of comrade pingard the place of meeting is not mentioned but it seems more than probable that it will be at the bakunin club not five minutes walk from this place the police have all these places under quiet observation of course and that is the club at which apparently important anarchist meetings have been held lately it is the only club that has never been raided as yet and it would seem the only one they would feel at all safe in using for anything important moreover luigi just now simply declined to open his mouth when asked where the meeting was to be and said nothing when the names of several other places were suggested but suddenly found his tongue at the mention of the bakunin club and denied vehemently that the meeting was to be thereit was the only thing he uttered so that it seems pretty safe to assume that it is to be there now of course the matters very serious men have been despatched to take charge of the stable very quietly and the club is to be taken possession of at oncealso very quietly it must be done without a moments delay and as there is a chance that the only detective officers within reach at the moment may be known by sight i have undertaken to get in first perhaps youll come we may have to take the door with a rush of course i meant to miss nothing if i could help it and said so very well replied hewitt well get ourselves up a bit he began taking off his collar and tie it is getting dusk he proceeded and we shant want old clothes to make ourselves look sufficiently shabby were both wearing bowler hats which is lucky make a dent in yoursif you can do so without permanently damaging it we got rid of our collars and made chokers of our ties we turned our coatcollars up at one side only and then with dented hats worn raffishly and our hands in our pockets we looked disreputable enough for all practical purposes in twilight a cordon of plainclothes police had already been forming round the club we were told and so we sallied forth we turned into windmill street crossed whitfield street and in a turning or two we came to the bakunin club i could see no sign of anything like a ring of policemen and said so hewitt chuckled of course not he said they dont go about a job of this sort with drums beating and flags flying but they are all there and some are watching us there is the house ill negotiate the house was one of the very shabby passe sort that abound in that quarter the very narrow area was railed over and almost choked with rubbish visible above it were three floors the lowest indicated by the door and one window and the other two by two windows eachmean and dirty all a faint light appeared in the top floor and another from somewhere behind the refuseheaped area everywhere else was in darkness hewitt looked intently into the area but it was impossible to discern anything behind the sole grimy patch of window that was visible then we stepped lightly up the three or four steps to the door and rang the bell we could hear slippered feet mounting a stair and approaching a latch was shifted a door opened six inches an indistinct face appeared and a female voice asked qui est la deux camarades hewitt grunted testily ouvrez vite i had noticed that the door was kept from opening further by a short chain this chain the woman unhooked from the door but still kept the latter merely ajar as though intending to assure herself still further but hewitt immediately pushed the door back planted his foot against it and entered asking carelessly as he did so ou se trouve luigi i followed on his heels and in the dark could just distinguish that hewitt pushed the woman instantly against the wall and clapped his hand to her mouth at the same moment a file of quiet men were suddenly visible ascending the steps at my heels they were the police the door was closed behind us almost noiselessly and a match was struck two men stood at the bottom of the stairs and the others searched the house only two men were foundboth in a top room they were secured and brought down the woman was now ungagged and she used her tongue at a great rate one of the men was a small meeklooking slip of a fellow and he appeared to be the womans husband eh messieurs le police she exclaimed vehemently it ees not of im mon pauvre pierre zat you sall rrun in im and mewe are not of the clobwe work onlywe housekeep hewitt whispered to an officer and the two men were taken below then hewitt spoke to the woman whose protests had not ceased you say you are not of the club he said but what is there to prove that if you are but housekeepers as you say you have nothing to fear but you can only prove it by giving the police information for instance now about gerard what have they done with him jean pingardim you ave take downstairse ave lose im jean pingard get last night all aboosaall dronk like zisshe rolled her head and shoulders to express intoxicationand he sleep too much today when emile go out and gerard he go too and nobody know i will tell you anysing we are not of the clobwe housekeep me and pierre but what did they do to gerard before he went away the woman was ready and anxious to tell anything gerard had been selected to do somethingwhat it was exactly she did not know but there was a horse and cart and he was to drive it where the horse and cart was also she did not know but gerard had driven a cart before in his work for a baker and he was to drive one in connection with some scheme among the members of the club but le pauvre gerard at the last minute disliked to drive the cart he had fear he did not say he had fear but he prepared a lettera letter that was not signed the letter was to be sent to the police and it told them the whereabouts of the horse and cart so that the police might seize these things and then there would be nothing for gerard who had fear to do in the way of driving no he did not betray the names of the comrades but he told the place of the horse and the cart nevertheless the letter was never sent there was suspicion and the letter was found in a pocket and read then there was a meeting and gerard was confronted with his letter he could say nothing but je le niefound no explanation but that there was much noise and she had observed from a staircase from which one might see through a ventilating hole gerard had much fearvery much fear his face was white and it moved he prayed for mercy and they talked of killing him it was discussed how he should be killed and the poor gerard was more terrified he was made to take off his collar and a razor was drawn across his throat though without cutting him till he fainted then water was flung over him and he was struck in the face till he revived he again repeated je le nie je le nie and nothing more then one struck him with a bottle and another with a stick the point of a knife was put against his throat and held there but this time he did not faint but cried softly as a man who is drunk je le nie je le nie so they tied a handkerchief about his neck and twisted it till his face grew purple and black and his eyes were round and terrible and then they struck his face and he fainted again but they took away the handkerchief having fear that they could not easily get rid of the body if he were killed for there was no preparation so they decided to meet again and discuss when there would be preparation wherefore they took him away to the rooms of jean pingardof jean and emile pingardin henry street golden square but emile pingard had gone out and jean was drunk and slept and they lost him jean pingard was he downstairsthe taller of the two the other was but le pauvre pierre who with herself was not of the club they worked only they were the keepers of the house there was nothing for which they should be arrested and she would give the police any information they might ask as i thought you see hewitt said to me the mans nerves have broken down under the terror and the strain and aphasia is the result i think i told you that the only articulate thing he could say was je le nie and now we know how those words were impressed on him till he now pronounces them mechanically with no idea of their meaning come we can do no more here now but wait a moment there were footsteps outside the light was removed and a policeman went to the door and opened it as soon as the bell rang three men stepped in one after another and the door was immediately shut behind themthey were prisoners we left quietly and although we of course expected it it was not till the next morning that we learned absolutely that the largest arrest of anarchists ever made in this country was made at the bakunin club that night each man as he came was admittedand collared we made our way to luzattis and it was over our dinner that hewitt put me in full possession of the earlier facts of this case which i have set down as impersonal narrative in their proper place at the beginning but i said what of that aimless scribble you spoke of that gerard made in the police station can i see it hewitt turned to where his coat hung behind him and took a handful of papers from his pocket most of these he said mean nothing at all that is what he wrote at first and he handed me the first of the two papers which were presented in facsimile in the earlier part of this narrative you see he said he has begun mechanically from long use to write monsieurthe usual beginning of a letter but he scarcely makes three letters before tailing off into sheer scribble he tries again and again and although once there is something very like que and once something like a word preceded by a negative n the whole thing is meaningless this he handed me the other paper which has been printed in facsimile does mean something though gerard never intended it can you spot the meaning really i think its pretty plainespecially now that you know as much as i about the days adventures the thing at the top lefthand corner i may tell you gerard intended for a sketch of a clock on the mantelpiece in the policestation i stared hard at the paper but could make nothing whatever of it i only see the horseshoe clock i said and a sort of second unsuccessful attempt to draw it again then there is a horseshoe dotted but scribbled over and then a sort of kite or balloon on a string a highlander andwell i dont understand it i confess tell me ill explain what i learned from that hewitt said and also what led me to look for it from what the inspector told me i judged the man to be in a very curious state and i took a fancy to see him most i was curious to know why he should have a terror of bread at one moment and eat it ravenously at another when i saw him i felt pretty sure that he was not mad in the common sense of the term as far as i could judge it seemed to be a case of aphasia then when the doctor came i had a chat as i have already told you with the policeman who found the man he told me about the incident of the bread with rather more detail than i had had from the inspector thus it was plain that the man was terrified at the bread only when it was in the form of a loaf and ate it eagerly when it was cut into pieces that was one thing to bear in mind he was not afraid of bread but only of a loaf very well i asked the policeman to find another uncut loaf and to put it near the man when his attention was diverted meantime the doctor reported that my suspicion as to aphasia was right the man grew more comfortable and was assured that he was among friends and had nothing to fear so that when at length he found the loaf near his elbow he was not so violently terrified only very uneasy i watched him and saw him turn it bottom upa very curious thing to do he immediately became less uneasythe turning over of the loaf seemed to have set his mind at rest in some way this was more curious still i thought for some little while before accepting the bomb theory as the most probable the doctor left and i determined to give the man another chance with pen and paper i felt pretty certain that if he were allowed to scribble and sketch as he pleased sooner or later he would do something that would give me some sort of a hint i left him entirely alone and let him do as he pleased but i watched after all the futile scribble which you have seen he began to sketch first a mans head then a chairjust what he might happen to see in the room presently he took to the piece of paper you have before you he observed that clock and began to sketch it then went on to other things such as you see scribbling idly over most of them when finished when he had made the last of the sketches he made a hasty scrawl of his pen over it and broke down it had brought his terror to his mind again somehow i seized the paper and examined it closely now just see ignore the clock which was merely a sketch of a thing before him and look at the three things following what are they a horseshoe a captive balloon and a highlander now cant you think of something those three things in that order suggest i could think of nothing whatever and i confessed as much think now tottenham court road i started of course i said that never struck me theres the horseshoe hotel with the sign outside theres the large toy and fancy shop halfway up where they have a captive balloon moored to the roof as an advertisement and theres the tobacco and snuff shop on the left toward the other end where they have a lifesize wooden highlander at the dooran uncommon thing indeed nowadays you are right the curious conjunction struck me at once there they are all three and just in the order in which one meets them going up from oxford street also as if to confirm the conjecture note the dotted horseshoe dont you remember that at night the horseshoe hotel sign is illuminated by two rows of gas lights now here was my clue at last plainly this man in his mechanical sketching was following a regular train of thought and unconsciously illustrating it as he went along many people in perfect health and mental soundness do the same thing if a pen and a piece of waste paper be near the mans train of thought led him in memory up tottenham court road and further to where some disagreeable recollection upset him it was my business to trace this train of thought do you remember the feat of dupin in poes story the murders in the rue morguehow he walks by his friends side in silence for some distance and then suddenly breaks out with a divination of his thoughts having silently traced them from a fruiterer with a basket through pavingstones epicurus dr nichols the constellation orion and a latin poem to a cobbler lately turned actor well it was some such task as this but infinitely simpler as a matter of fact that was set me this man begins by drawing the horseshoe clock having done with that and with the horseshoe still in his mind he starts to draw a horseshoe simply it is a failure and he scribbles it out his mind at once turns to the horseshoe hotel which he knows from frequently passing it and its sign of gasjets he sketches that making dots for the gas lights once started in tottenham court road his mind naturally follows his usual route along it he remembers the advertising captive balloon halfway up and down that goes on his paper in imagination he crosses the road and keeps on till he comes to the very noticeable highlander outside the tobacconists that is sketched thus it is plain that a familiar route with him was from new oxford street up tottenham court road at the policestation i ventured to guess from this that he lived somewhere near seven dials perhaps before long we shall know if this was right but to return to the sketches after the highlander there is something at first not very distinct a little examination however shows it to be intended for a chimneypot partly covered with a basket now an old basket stuck sideways on a chimney by way of cowl is not an uncommon thing in parts of the country but it is very unusual in london probably then it would be in some bystreet or alley next and last there is a horses head and it was at this that the mans trouble returned to him now when one goes to a place and finds a horse there that place is not uncommonly a stable and as a matter of fact the basketcowl would be much more likely to be found in use in a range of back stabling than anywhere else suppose then that after taking the direction indicated in the sketchesthe direction of fitzroy square in factone were to find a range of stabling with a basketcowl visible about it i know my london pretty well as you are aware and i could remember but two likely stableyards in that particular partthe two we looked at in the second of which you may possibly have noticed just such a basketcowl as i have been speaking of well what we did you know and that we found confirmation of my conjecture about the loaves you also know it was the recollection of the horse and cart and what they were to transport and what the end of it all had been that upset gerard as he drew the horses head you will notice that the sketches have not been done in separate rows left to rightthey have simply followed one another all round the paper which means preoccupation and unconsciousness on the part of the man who made them but i asked supposing those loaves to contain bombs how were the bombs put there baking the bread round them would have been risky wouldnt it certainly what they did was to cut the loaves each row down the centre then most of the crumb was scooped out the explosive inserted and the sides joined up and glued i thought you had spotted the joins though they certainly were neat no i didnt examine closely luigi of course had been told off for a daily visit to feed the horse and that is how we caught him one supposes so they hadnt rearranged their plans as to going on with the outrages after gerards defection by the way i noticed that he was accustomed to driving when i first saw him there was an unmistakable mark on his coat just at the small of the back that drivers get who lean against a rail in a cart the loaves were examined by official experts and as everybody now knows were found to contain as hewitt had supposed large charges of dynamite what became of some halfdozen of the men captured is also
