illustration an which is the honourable jintleman as do be burrnin to prisint me wid a bit o goold adventures of martin hewitt third series by arthur morrison illustrated by tsc crowther london ward lock co limited warwick house salisbury square ec new york and melbourne contents the case of the flitterbat lancers the case of the dead skipper the case of mr geldards elopement the case of the late mr rewse the affair of mrs setons child the case of the ward lane tabernacle the case of the flitterbat lancers i in none of the cases of investigation by martin hewitt which i have as yet recorded had i any direct and substantial personal interest in the case i am about to set forth however i had some such interest though legally i fear it amounted to no more than the cost of a smashed pane of glass but the case in some ways was one of the most curious which came under my notice and completely justified hewitts oft repeated dictum that there was nothing however romantic or apparently improbable that had not happened at some time in london it was late on a summer evening two or three years back that i drowsed in my armchair over a particularly solid and ponderous volume of essays on social economy i was doing a good deal of reviewing at the time and i remember that this particular volume had a property of such exceeding toughness that i had already made three successive attacks on it on as many successive evenings each attack having been defeated in the end by sleep the weather was hot my chair was very comfortable the days were tiring and the book had somewhere about its strings of polysyllables an essence as of laudanum still something had been done on each evening and now on the fourth i strenuously endeavoured to finish the book late as it was my lamp had been lighted but an hour or so for there had been light enough to read by near the window till well past nine oclock i was just beginning to feel that the words before me were sliding about and losing their meanings and that i was about to fall asleep after all when a sudden crash and a jingle of broken glass behind me woke me with a start and i threw the book down a pane of glass in my window was smashed and i hurried across and threw up the sash to see if i could whence the damage had come illustration a pane of glass in my window was smashed i think i have somewhere said i believe it was in describing the circumstances of the extraordinary death of mr foggatt that the building in which my chambers and hewitts office were situated was accessible or rather visible for there was no entrance from the rear there was in fact a small courtyard reached by a passage from the street behind and into this courtyard my sitting room window looked hullo there i shouted but there came no reply nor could i distinguish anybody in the courtyard it was at best a shadowy place at night with no artificial light after the news agent who had a permanent booth there had shut up and gone home gone he was now and to me the yard seemed deserted some men had been at work during the day on a drain pipe near the booth and i reflected that probably their litter had provided the stone wherewith my window had been smashed as i looked however two men came hurrying from the passage into the court and going straight into the deep shadow of one corner presently appeared again in a less obscure part hauling forth a third man who must have already been there in hiding the man who appeared so far as i could see to be smaller than either of his assailants struggled fiercely but without avail and was dragged across toward the passage leading to the street beyond but the most remarkable feature of the whole thing was the silence of all three men no cry no exclamation or expostulation escaped any one of them in perfect silence the two hauled the third across the courtyard and in perfect silence he swung and struggled to resist and escape the matter astonished me not a little and the men were entering the passage before i found voice to shout at them but they took no notice and disappeared soon after i heard cab wheels in the street beyond and had no doubt that the two men had carried off their prisoner illustration the man struggled fiercely i turned back into my room a little perplexed it seemed probable that the man who had been borne off had broken my window but why i looked about on the floor and presently found the missile it was as i had expected a piece of broken concrete but it was wrapped up in a worn piece of paper which had partly opened out again as it lay on my carpet thus indicating that it had only just been hastily crumpled round the stone but again why it might be considered a trifle more polite to hand a gentleman a clinker decently wrapped up than to give it him in its raw state but it came to much the same thing after all if it were passed through a shut window and why a clinker at all i disengaged the paper and spread it out then i saw it to be a rather hastily written piece of manuscript music whereof i append a reduced facsimile this gave me no help i turned the paper this way and that but could make nothing of it there was not a mark on it that i could discover except the music and the scrawled title flitterbat lancers at the top the paper was old dirty and cracked what did it all mean one might conceive of a person in certain circumstances sending a message possibly an appeal for help through a friends window wrapped round a stone but this seemed to be nothing of that sort it was not a message but a hastily written piece of music with no bars or time marked just as might have been put down by somebody anxious to make an exact note of an air the time of which he could remember moreover it was years old not a thing just written in a recent emergency what lunatic could have chosen this violent way of presenting me with an air from some forgotten flitterbat lancers that indeed was an idea what more likely than that the man taken away was a lunatic and the others his keepers a man under some curious delusion which led him not only to fling his old music notes through my window but to keep perfectly quiet while struggling for his freedom i looked out of the window again and then it seemed plain to me that the clinker and the paper could not have been intended for me personally but had been flung at my window as being the only one that showed a light within a reasonable distance of the yard most of the windows about mine were those of offices which had been deserted early in the evening once more i picked up the paper and with an idea to hear what the flitterbat lancers sounded like i turned to my little pianette and strummed over the notes making my own time and changing it as seemed likely but i make nothing of it and could by no means extract from the notes anything resembling an air i considered the thing a little more and half thought of trying martin hewitts office door in case he might still be there and could offer a guess at the meaning of my smashed window and the scrap of paper it was most probable however that he had gone home and i was about resuming my social economy when hewitt himself came in he had stayed late to examine a bundle of papers in connection with a case just placed in his hands and now having finished came to find if i were disposed for an evening stroll before turning in a thing i was in the habit of i handed him the paper and the piece of concrete observing theres a little job for you hewitt instead of the stroll what do those things mean and i told him the complete history of my smashed window hewitt listened attentively and examined both the paper and the fragment of paving you say these people made absolutely no sound whatever he asked none but that of scuffling and even that they seemed to do quietly could you see whether or not the two men gagged the other or placed their hands over his mouth no they certainly didnt do that it was dark of course but not so dark as to prevent my seeing generally what they were doing and when you first looked out of the window after the smash you called out but got no answer although the man you suppose to have thrown these things must have been there at the time and alone that was so hewitt stood for half a minute in thought and then said theres something in this what i cant guess at the moment but something deep i fancy are you sure you wont come out now on this my mind was made up that dreadful volume had vanquished me altogether three times already and if i let it go again it would haunt me like a nightmare there was indeed very little left to read and i determined to master that and draft my review before i slept so i told hewitt that i was sure and that i should stick to my work very well he said then perhaps you will lend me these articles holding up the paper and the stone as he spoke delighted to lend em im sure i said if you get no more melody out of the clinker than i did out of the paper you wont have a musical evening good night hewitt went away with the puzzle in his hand and i turned once more to my social economy and thanks to the gentleman who smashed my window conquered i am sure i should have dropped fast asleep had it not been for that ii at this time my only regular daily work was on an evening paper so that i left home at a quarter to eight on the morning following the adventure of my broken window in order as usual to be at the office at eight consequently it was not until lunchtime when my work was over that i had an opportunity of seeing hewitt i went to my own rooms first however and on the landing by my door i found the housekeeper in conversation with a shortish sun browned man with a goatee beard whose accent at once convinced me that he hailed from across the atlantic he had called it appeared three or four times during the morning to see me getting more impatient each time as he did not seem even to know my name the housekeeper had not considered it expedient to say when i was expected nor indeed to give him any information about me and he was growing irascible under the treatment when i at last appeared however he left her and approached me eagerly see here sir he said ive been stumpin these here durn stairs o yours half through the mornin im anxious to apologise i reckon and fix up some damage he had followed me into my sitting room and was now standing with his back to the fireplace a dripping umbrella in one hand and the forefinger of the other held up shoulder high and pointing in the manner of a pistol to my window which by the way had been mended during the morning in accordance with my instructions to the housekeeper sir he continued last night i took the extreme liberty of smashin your winder oh i said that was you was it it was sir me for that i hev come humbly to apologise i trust the draft has not discommoded you sir i regret the accident and i wish to pay for the fixin up and the general inconvenience he placed a sovereign on the table i low youll call that square now sir and fix things friendly and comfortable as between gentlemen an no ill will shake and he formally extended his hand i took it at once certainly i said certainly as a matter of fact you havent inconvenienced me at all indeed there were some circumstances about the affair that rather interested me but as to the damage i continued if youre really anxious to pay for it do you mind my sending the glazier to you to settle you see its only a matter of half a crown or so at most and i pushed the sovereign toward him but then he said looking a trifle disappointed theres general discommodedness you know to pay for and the general sass of the liberty to a strangers winder i aint no down easter not a boston dude but i reckon i know the gentlemanly thing and i can afford to do it yes say now didnt i startle your nerves not a bit i answered laughing in fact you did me a service by preventing me going to sleep just when i shouldnt so well say no more of that well there was one other little thing he pursued looking at me rather sharply as he slowly pocketed the sovereign there was a bit o paper round that pebble that came in here didnt happen to notice that did you yes i did it was an old piece of manuscript music that was it just might you happen to have it handy now well i said as a matter of fact a friend of mine has it now i tried playing it over once or twice as a matter of curiosity but i couldnt make anything of it and so i handed it to him ah said my visitor watching me narrowly thats a nailer is that flitterbat lancers a real nailer it whips em all nobody cant get ahead of that ha ha he laughed suddenly a laugh that seemed a little artificial theres music fellers as lows to set right down and play off anything right away that cant make anything of the flitterbat lancers that was two of em that was monkeyin with me last night they never could make anythin of it at all and i was tantalizing them with it all along till they got real mad and reckoned to get it out o my pocket and learn it off quiet at home and stop all my chaff ha ha so i got away for a bit and bein a bit lively after a number of tooth lotions all three was much that way just rolled it round a stone and heaved it through your winder before they could come up your winder bein the nearest one with a light in it ha ha ill be considerable obliged if youll get it from your friend right now is he stayin hereabout the story was so ridiculously lame that i determined to confront my visitor with hewitt and observe the result if he had succeeded in making any sense of the flitterbat lancers the scene might be amusing so i answered at once yes his office is only on the floor below he will probably be in at about this time come down with me we went down and found hewitt in his outer office this gentleman i told him with a solemn intonation has come to ask for his piece of manuscript music the flitterbat lancers he is particularly proud of it because nobody who tries to play it can make any sort of tune out of it and it was entirely because two dear friends of his were anxious to drag it out of his pocket and practice it over on the quiet that he flung it through my window pane last night wrapped round a piece of concrete the stranger glanced sharply at me and i could see that my manner and tone rather disconcerted him but hewitt came forward at once oh yes he said just so quite a natural sort of thing as a matter of fact i quite expected you your umbrellas wet do you mind putting it in the stand thank you come into my private office we entered the inner room and hewitt turning to the stranger went on yes that is a very extraordinary piece of music that flitterbat lancers i have been having a little practice with it myself though im really nothing of a musician i dont wonder you are anxious to keep it to yourself sit down the stranger with a distrustful look at hewitt complied at this moment hewitts clerk kerrett entered from the outer office with a slip of paper hewitt glanced at it and crumpled it in his hand i am engaged just now was his remark and kerrett vanished and now hewitt said as he sat down and suddenly turned to the stranger with an intent gaze and now mr hoker well talk of this music the stranger started and frowned youve the advantage of me sir he said you seem to know my name but i dont know yours hewitt smiled pleasantly my name he said is hewitt martin hewitt and it is my business to know a great many things for instance i know that you are mr reuben b hoker of robertsville ohio illustration mr hoker the visitor pushed his chair back and stared well that gits me he said youre a pretty smart chap anyway ive heard your name before of course and and so youve been a studyin of the flitterbat lancers have you this with a keen glance in hewitts face well well spose you have whats your opinion why answered hewitt still keeping his steadfast gaze on hokers eyes i think its pretty late in the century to be fishing about for the wedlake jewels thats all these words astonished me almost as much as they did mr hoker the great wedlake jewel robbery is as many will remember a traditional story of the sixties i remembered no more of it at the time than probably most men do who have at some time or another read up the causes clbres of the century sir francis wedlakes country house had been robbed and the whole of lady wedlakes magnificent collection of jewels stolen a man named shiels a strolling musician had been arrested and had been sentenced to a long term of penal servitude another man named legg one of the comparatively wealthy scoundrels who finance promising thefts or swindles and pocket the greater part of the proceeds had also been punished but only a very few of the trinkets and those quite unimportant items had been recovered the great bulk of the booty was never brought to light so much i remembered and hewitts sudden mention of the wedlake jewels in connection with my broken window mr reuben b hoker and the flitterbat lancers astonished me not a little as for hoker he did his best to hide his perturbation but with little success wedlake jewels eh he said and and whats that to do with it anyway to do with it responded hewitt with an air of carelessness well well i had my idea nothing more if the wedlake jewels have nothing to do with it well say no more about it thats all heres your paper mr hoker only a little crumpled here also is the piece of cement if the wedlake jewels have nothing to do with the affair you may possibly want that too i cant tell he rose and placed the articles in mr hokers hand with the manner of terminating the interview hoker rose with a bewildered look on his face and turned toward the door then he stopped looked at the floor scratched his cheek and finally after a thoughtful look first at me and then at hewitt sat down again emphatically in the chair he had just quitted and put his hat on the ground come he said well play a square game that paper has something to do with the wedlake jewels and win or lose ill tell you all i know about it youre a smart man youve found out more than i know already and whatever i tell you i guess it wont do me no harm it aint done me no good yet anyway say what you please of course hewitt answered but think first you might tell me something youd be sorry for afterward mind i dont invite your confidence confidence be durned say will you listen to what i say and tell me if you think ive been swindled or not there aint a creature in this country whose advice i can ask my dollars is gone now and i guess i wont go skirmishing after it any more if you think its no good will you do so much as i said before hewitt replied tell me what you please and if i can help you i will but remember i dont ask for your secrets thats all right i guess mr hewitt well now it was all like this and mr reuben b hoker plunged into a detailed account of his adventures since his arrival in london relieved of repetitions and put as directly as possible it was as follows mr hoker was a wagon builder had made a good business from very humble beginnings and intended to go on and make it still a better meantime he had come over to europe for a short holiday a thing he had promised himself for years he was wandering about the london streets on the second night after his arrival in the city when he managed to get into conversation with two men at a bar they were not very prepossessing men altogether though flashily dressed very soon they suggested a game of cards but reuben b hoker was not to be had in that way and after a while they parted the two were amusing fellows enough in their way and when hoker saw them again the next night in the same bar he made no difficulty in talking with them freely after a time and after a succession of drinks they told him that they had a speculation on hand a speculation that meant thousands if it succeeded and to carry out which they were only waiting for a paltry sum of there was a house they said in which they were certain was hidden a great number of jewels of immense value which had been deposited there by a man who was now dead exactly in what part of the house the jewels were to be found they did not know there was a paper they said which was supposed to contain some information but as yet they hadnt quite been able to make it out but that would really matter very little if once they could get possession of the house then they would simply set to work and search from the topmost chimney to the lowermost brick if necessary anyhow the jewels must be found sooner or later the only present difficulty was that the house was occupied and that the landlord wanted a large deposit of rent down before he would consent to turn out his present tenants and give them possession at a higher rental this deposit and other expenses would come to at least and they hadnt the money however if any friend of theirs who meant business would put the necessary sum at their disposal and keep his mouth shut they would make him an equal partner in the proceeds with themselves and as the value of the whole haul would probably be something not very far off the speculation would bring a tremendous return to the man who was smart enough to see the advantage of putting down his hoker very distrustful skeptically demanded more detailed particulars of the scheme but these the two men luker and birks were their names he found in course of talking inflexibly refused to communicate is it likely said luker that we should give the ole thing away to anybody who might easily go with his and clear out the bloomin show not much weve told you what the game is and if youd like to take a flutter with your all right youll do as well as anybody and well treat you square if you dont well dont thats all well get the oof from somewhere theres blokes as ud jump at the chance i can tell you only theyre inconvenient blokes to deal with as ill explain if you come in with us anyway we aint going to give the show away before youve done somethin to prove youre on the job straight put your money in and you shall know as much as we do then there were more drinks and more discussion hoker was still reluctant though tempted by the prospect and growing more venturesome with each drink dont you see said birks that if we was a tryin to ave you we should out with a tale as long as yer arm all complete with the address of the ouse and all then i spose youd lug out the pieces on the nail without askin a bloomin question more fool you thats all as it is the things so perfectly genuine that wed rather lose the chance and wait for some other bloke to find the money than run a chance of givin the thing away it aint you wotll be doin a favour mind if its anybody its us not that we want to talk of favours at all if you come to that its a matter o business simple and plain thats all it is if youre willin to come in with the money that we cant do without very well if you aint very well too only we aint goin to give the thing away to an outsider its a question of either us trustin you with a chance of collarin or you trustin us with a paltry we dont lay out no igh moral sentiments we only say the weight o money is all on one side take it or leave it thats all ave another scotch the talk went on and the drinks went on and it all ended at chucking out time in reuben b hoker handing over five ten pound notes with smiling though slightly incoherent assurances of his eternal friendship for luker and birks in the morning he awoke to the realization of a bad head a bad tongue and a bad opinion of his proceedings of the previous night in his sober senses it seemed plain that he had been swindled he had heard of the confidence trick to which many americans had unaccountably fallen victims for to him the trick had always seemed very thin and he had sworn that something better than the confidence trick would be required to get over him but now there seemed no doubt that this was no more than the confidence trick over again in a new and more impudent form all day he cursed his fuddled foolishness and at night he made for the bar that had been the scene if the transaction with little hope of seeing either luker or birks who had agreed to be there to meet him there they were however and rather to his surprise they made no demand for more money they asked him if he understood music and showed him the worn old piece of paper containing the manuscript flitterbat lancers the exact spot they said where the jewels were hidden was supposed to be indicated somehow and somewhere on that piece of paper hoker did not understand music and could find nothing on the paper that looked in the least like a direction to a hiding place for jewels or anything else luker and birks then went into full particulars of their project first as to its history first as to its history the jewels were the famous wedlake jewels which had been taken from sir francis wedlakes house in and never heard of again a certain jerry shiels had been arrested in connection with the robbery had been given a long sentence of penal servitude and had died in gaol this jerry shiels was an extraordinarily clever criminal and travelled about the country as a street musician although an expert burglar he very rarely perpetrated robberies himself but acted as a sort of travelling fence receiving stolen property and transmitting it to london or out of the country he also acted as the agent of a man named legg who had money and who financed any likely looking project of a criminal nature that shiels might arrange or recommend luker and birks explained that there were many men of this class and that it was to them that they had referred on the previous evening when they said that there were blokes that would jump at the chance of financing the present venture jerry shiels travelled with a pardner a man who played the harp and acted as his assistant and messenger in affairs wherein jerry was reluctant to appear personally when shiels was arrested he had in his possession a quantity of printed and manuscript music and after his first remand his pardner jimmy snape applied for the music to be given up to him in order as he explained that he might earn his living no objection was raised to this and shiels was quite willing that snape should have it and so it was handed over now among the music was a small slip headed flitterbat lancers which shiels had shown to snape before the arrest in case of shiels being taken snape was to take this particular slip to legg as fast as he could the slip indeed carried about it in some unexplained way which legg understood an indication of the place in which shiels had concealed the bulk of the wedlake jewels and the whole proceeding was an ingenious trick invented by shiels and used before it was supposed to communicate with legg while under arrest snape got the music but as chance would have it on that very day legg himself was arrested and soon after was sentenced also to a term of years snape hung about in london for a little while and then emigrated before leaving however he gave the slip of music to lukers father a rag shop keeper who was a friend of his and to whom he owed money he explained its history and hoped that luker senior would be able to recoup himself for the debt and a good deal over then he went luker senior had made all sorts of fruitless efforts to get at the information concealed in the paper he had held it to the fire to bring up concealed writing had washed it had held it to the light till his eyes ached had gone over it with a magnifying glass all in vain he had got musicians to strum out the notes on all sorts of instruments backwards forwards alternately and in every other way he could think of if at any time he fancied a resemblance in the resulting sound to some familiar song tune he got that song and studied all its words with loving care upside down right side up every way he took the words flitterbat lancers and transposed the letters in all directions and did everything else he could think of in the end he gave it up and died now lately luker junior had been impelled with a desire to see into the matter he had repeated all the parental experiments and more with chemicals and with the same lack of success he had taken his pal birks into his confidence and together they had tried other experiments still usually very clumsy ones indeed till at last they began to believe that the message had probably been written in some sort of invisible ink which the subsequent washings and experiments had erased altogether but he had done one other thing he had found the house which shiels rented at the time of his arrest and in which a good quantity of stolen property not connected with the wedlake case was discovered here he argued if anywhere jerry shiels had hidden the jewels there was no other place where he could be found to have lived or over which he had sufficient control to warrant his hiding valuables therein perhaps once the house could be properly examined something about it might give a clue as to what the message of the flitterbat lancers meant at any rate message or none anybody in possession of the house with a certain amount of patience secrecy and thoroughness could in time make himself master of every possible hiding place and could completely excavate the back yard the trouble was that the house was occupied and that money was wanted to get possession it was with the view of providing this that they had decided to broach the subject to hoker hoker of course was anxious to know where the house in question stood but this luker and birks would on no account inform him youve done your part they said and now you leave us to do ours theres a bit of a job about gettin the tenants out they wont go and itll take a bit of time before the landlord can make them so you just hold your jaw and wait when were safe in the ouse and theres no chance of anybody else pokin into the business then you can come and help find the stuff if you like but you aint goin to ave a chance of puttin in first for yourself this journey you bet hoker went home that night sober but in much perplexity the thing might be genuine after all indeed there were many little things that made him think it was but then if it were what guarantee had he that he would get his share supposing the search turned out successful none at all but then it struck him for the first time that these jewels though they may have lain untouched so long were stolen property after all the moral aspect of the affair began to trouble him a little but the legal aspect troubled him more that consideration however he decided to leave over for the present at any rate he had no more than the word of luker and birks that the jewels if they existed were those of lady wedlake and luker and birks themselves only professed to know from hearsay at any rate his was gone where he felt pretty sure he would have a difficulty in getting it back from and he determined to wait events but at least he made up his mind to have some little guarantee for his money in accordance with this resolve he suggested when he met the two men the next day that he should take charge of the slip of music and make an independent study of it this proposal however met with an instant veto the whole thing was now in their hands luker and birks laid it down and they didnt intend letting any of it out if hoker wanted to study the flitterbat lancers he could do it in their presence and if he were dissatisfied he could go to the next shop altogether it became clear to the unhappy hoker that now he had parted with his money he was altogether at the mercy of these fellows if he wished to get any share of the plunder or even to see his money back again and if he made any complaint or if the matter became at all known the affair would be blown upon as they expressed it and his money would be gone mostly though he resented their bullying talk and he determined to get even in the matter of the music he resolved to make up a piece of paper folded as like the slip as possible and substitute one for the other at their next meeting then he would put the flitterbat lancers in some safe place and face his fellow conspirators with a hand of cards equal to their own he carried out his plan the next evening with perfect success thanks to a trick of passing cards which he had learned in his youth and thanks also to the contemptuous indifference with which luker and birks had begun to regard him he got the slip in his pocket and left the bar he had not gone far however before luker discovered the trick and soon he became conscious of being followed he looked for a cab but he was in a dark street and no cab was near luker and birks turned the corner and began to run he saw they must catch him and felt no doubt that it they did he would lose the slip of paper the and everything they were big active fellows and could probably do as they liked with him especially since he could not call for help without risking an exposure of their joint enterprise everything depended now on his putting the flitterbat lancers out of their reach but where he could himself recover it then it would form a sort of security for his share of the venture he ran till he saw a narrow passage way on his right and into this he darted it led into a yard where stones were lying about and in a large building before him he saw the window of a lighted room a couple of floors up it was a desperate expedient but there was no time for consideration he wrapped a stone in the paper and flung it with all his force through the lighted window even as he did it he heard the feet of luker and birks as they hurried down the street the rest of the adventure in the court i myself saw luker and birks kept hoker in their lodgings all that night they searched him unsuccessfully for the paper they bullied they swore they cajoled they entreated they begged him to play the game square with his pals hoker merely replied that he had put the flitterbat lancers where they couldnt easily find it and that he intended playing the game square so long as they did the same in the end they released him apparently with more respect for his cuteness than they had before entertained advising him at any rate to get the paper into his possession as soon as he could with this view he repaired again to the scene of his window smashing exploit and having ascertained the exact position of the window in the building began his mornings attack on my outer door and now said mr hoker in conclusion of his narrative perhaps youll give me a bit of christian advice youre up to as many moves as most people over here am i playin a fool game running after these toughs or aint i i wouldnt have told you what i have of course if it wasnt clear that youd got hold of the hang of the scheme somehow say now is it all a swindle hewitt shrugged his shoulders it all depends he said on your friends luker and birks as you may easily see for yourself they may want to swindle you of your money and of the proceeds of the speculation as you call it or they may not im afraid theyd like to at any rate but perhaps youve got some little security in this piece of paper one thing is plain they certainly believe in the deposit of jewels themselves else they wouldnt have taken so much trouble to get the paper back on the chance of seeing some way of using it after they had got into the house they speak of then i guess ill go on with the thing if thats it that depends of course on whether you care to take trouble to get possession of what after all is somebody elses lawful property hoker looked a little uneasy well he said theres that of course i didnt know nothin about that at first and when i did id parted with my money and felt entitled to get something back for it anyway the stuff aint found yet when it is why then you know i might make a deal with the owner but say how did you find out my name and about this here affair being jined up with the wedlake jewels hewitt smiled as to the name and address you just think it over a little when youve gone away and if you dont see how i did it youre not so cute as i think you are in regard to the jewels well i just read the message of the flitterbat lancers thats all you read it whew that beats and what does it say and where how did you fix it hoker turned the paper over eagerly in his hands as he spoke see now said hewitt i wont tell you all that but ill tell you something and it may help you to test the real knowledge of luker and birks part of the message is in these words which you had better write down over the coals the fifth dancer slides says jerry shiels the horney what hoker exclaimed fifth dancer slides over the coals thats a mighty odd dance figure anyway lancers or not whats it all about about the wedlake jewels as i said now you can go and make a bargain with luker and birks the only other part of the message is an address and that they already know if they have been telling the truth about the house they intend taking you can offer to tell them what i have told you of the message after they have told you where the house is and proved to you that they are taking the steps they talk of if they wont agree to that i think you had best treat them as common rogues which they are and charge them with obtaining your money under false pretences but in any case dont be disappointed if you see very little of the wedlake jewels nothing more would hewitt say than that despite hokers many questions and when at last hoker had gone almost as troubled and perplexed as ever my friend turned to me and said now brett if you havent lunched and would like to see the end of this business hurry up the end of it i said is it to end so soon how simply by a police raid on jerry shielss old house with a search warrant i communicated with the police this morning before i came here poor hoker i said oh i had told the police before i saw hoker or heard of him of course i just conveyed the message on the music slip that was enough but ill tell you all about it when theres more time i must be off now with the information i have given him hoker and his friends may make an extra push and get into the house soon but i couldnt resist the temptation to give the unfortunate hoker some sort of a sporting chance though its a poor one i fear get your lunch as quickly as you can and go at once to colt row bankside southwark way you know probably we shall be there before you if not wait hewitt had assumed his hat and gloves as he spoke and now hurried away i took such lunch as i could in twenty minutes and hurried in a cab towards blackfriars bridge the cabman knew nothing of colt row but had a notion of where to find bankside once in the region i left him and then colt row was not difficult to find it was one of those places that decay with an access of respectability like drury lane and clare market once when jacobs island was still an island a little farther down the river colt row had evidently been an unsafe place for a person with valuables about him and then it probably prospered in its own way now it was quite respectable but very dilapidated and dirty and looked as unprosperous as a street well can it was too near the river to be a frequented thoroughfare and too far from it to be valuable for wharfage purposes it was a stagnant backwater in the london tide close though it stood to the full rush of the stream perhaps it was sixty yards long perhaps a little more it was certainly very few yards wide and the houses at each side had a patient and forlorn look of waiting for a metropolitan improvement to come along and carry them away to their rest many seemed untenanted and most threatened soon to be untenable i could see no signs as yet of hewitt nor of the police so i walked up and down the narrow pavement for a little while as i did so i became conscious of a face at a window of the least ruinous house in the row a face that i fancied expressed particular interest in my movements the house was an old gabled structure faced with plaster what had apparently once been a shop window or at any rate a wide one on the ground floor was now shuttered up and the face that watched me an old womans looked from a window next above i had noted these particulars with some curiosity when arriving again at the street corner i observed hewitt approaching in company with a police inspector and followed by two unmistakable plain clothes men well hewitt said youre first here after all have you seen any more of our friend hoker no nothing very well probably hell be here before long though the party turned into colt row and the inspector walking up to the door of the house with the shuttered bottom window knocked sharply there was no response so he knocked again but equally in vain all out said the inspector no i said i saw a woman watching me from the window above not three minutes ago ho ho the inspector replied thats so eh one of you you johnson step round to the back will you you know the courts behind one of the plain clothes men started off and after waiting another minute or two the inspector began a thundering cannonade of knocks that brought every available head out of the window of every inhabited room in the row the womans face appeared stealthily at the upper window again but the inspector saw and he shouted to her to open the door and save him the necessity of damaging it at this the woman opened the window and began abusing the inspector with a shrillness and fluency that added a street corner audience to that already congregated at the windows go away you blaggards the lady said among other things you ought to be orse wipped every one of ye a comin ere a tryin to turn decent people out o ouse and ome wait till my usband comes ome ell show yer ye mutton cadgin scoundrels payin our rent reglar and good tenants as is always been as you may ask mrs green next door this blessed minute and im a respectable married woman thats what i am ye dirty great cow ards this last word with a low tragic emphasis hewitt remembered what hoker had said about the present tenants refusing to quit the house on the landlords notice she thinks weve come from the landlord to turn her out he said to the inspector were not here from the landlord you old fool the inspector said in as low a voice as could be trusted to reach the womans ears we dont want to turn you out were the police with a search warrant to look for something left here before you came and youd better let us in i can tell you or youll get into trouble ark at im the woman screamed pointing at the inspector ark at im thinks i was born yesterday that feller go ome ye dirty pie stealer go ome oo sneaked the cooks watch eh go ome the audience showed signs of becoming a small crowd and the inspectors patience gave out here bradley he said addressing the remaining plain clothes man give a hand with these shutters and the two both powerful men seized the iron bar which held the shutters and began to pull but the garrison was undaunted and seizing a broom the woman began to belabour the invaders about the shoulders and head from above but just at this moment the woman emitting a terrific shriek was suddenly lifted from behind and vanished then the head of the plain clothes man who had gone round the houses appeared with the calm announcement theres a winder open behind sir but ill open the front door if you like illustration the woman began to belabour the invaders about the shoulders and head from above then there was a heavy thump and his head was withdrawn the broom was probably responsible the inspector shouted impatiently for the front door to be opened and in a minute or two the bolts were shot and it swung back the placid johnson stood in the passage and as we passed in he said ive locked er in the back room upstairs as a matter of fact we might have guessed it volleys of screeches punctuated by bangs from contact of broom and door left no doubt its the bottom staircase of course the inspector said and we tramped down into the basement a little way from the stairfoot hewitt opened a cupboard door which enclosed a receptacle for coals they still keep the coals here you see he said striking a match and passing it to and fro near the sloping roof of the cupboard it was of plaster and covered the under side of the stairs and now for the fifth dancer he said throwing the match away and making for the staircase again one two three four five and he tapped the fifth stair from the bottom here it is the stairs were uncarpeted and hewitt and the inspector began a careful examination of the one he had indicated they tapped it in different places and hewitt passed his hand over the surfaces of both tread and riser presently with his hand at the outer edge of the riser hewitt spoke here it is i think he said it is the riser that slides he took out his pocket knife and scraped away the grease and paint from the edge of the old stair then a joint was plainly visible for a long time the plank grimed and set with age refused to shift but at last by dint of patience and firm fingers it moved and in a few seconds was drawn clean out from the end like the lid of a domino box lying on its side within nothing was visible but grime fluff and small rubbish the inspector passed his hand along the bottom angle heres a hook or something at any rate he said it was the gold hook of an old fashioned earring broken off short hewitt slapped his thigh somebodys been here before us he said and a good time back too judging from the dust that hooks a plain indication that jewellery was here once and probably broken up for convenience of carriage and stowage theres plainly nothing more except except this piece of paper hewitts eyes had detected black with loose grime as it was a small piece of paper lying at the bottom of the recess he drew it out and shook off the dust why whats this he exclaimed more music why look here we went to the window and there saw in hewitts hand a piece of written musical notation thus hewitt pulled out from his pocket a few pieces of paper here is a copy i made this morning of the flitterbat lancers and a note or two of my own as well he said he took a pencil and constantly referring to his own papers marked a letter under each note on the last found slip of music when he had done this the letters read you are a clever cove whoever you are but there was a cleverer says jim snape the horneys mate you see hewitt said handing the inspector the paper snape the unconsidered messenger finding legg in prison set to work and got the jewels for himself he either had more gumption than the other people through whose hands the flitterbat lancers has passed or else he had got some clue to the cipher during his association with shiels the thing was a cryptogram of course of a very simple sort though uncommon in design snape was a humorous soul too to leave this message here in the same cipher on the chance of somebody else reading the flitterbat lancers but i asked why did he give that slip of music to lukers father well he owed him money and got out of it that way also he avoided the appearance of flushness that paying the debt might have given him and got quietly out of the country with his spoils also he may have paid off a grudge on old luker anyhow the thing plagued him enough the shrieks upstairs had grown hoarser but the broom continued vigorously let that woman out said the inspector and well go and report not much good looking for snape now i fancy but theres some satisfaction in clearing up that old quarter century mystery we left the place pursued by the execrations of the broom wielder who bolted the door behind us and from the window defied us to come back and vowed she would have us all searched before a magistrate for what we had probably stolen in the very next street we hove in sight of reuben b hoker in the company of two swell mob looking fellows who sheered off down a side turning at sight of our group hoker too looked rather shy at sight of the inspector as we passed hewitt stopped for a moment and said im afraid youve lost those jewels mr hoker come to my office to morrow and ill tell you all about it iii the meaning of the thing was so very plain hewitt said to me afterwards that the duffers who had the flitterbat lancers in hand for so long never saw it at all if shiels had made an ordinary clumsy cryptogram all letters and figures they would have seen what it was at once and at least would have tried to read it but because it was put in the form of music they tried everything else but the right way it was a clever dodge of shielss without a doubt very few people police officers or not turning over a heap of old music would notice or feel suspicious of that little slip among the rest but once one sees it is a cryptogram and the absence of bar lines and of notes beyond the stave would suggest that the reading is as easy as possible for my part i tried it as a cryptogram at once you know the plan it has been described a hundred times see here look at this copy of the flitterbat lancers its only difficulty and that is a small one is that the words are not divided since there are on the stave positions for less than a dozen notes and there are twenty six letters to be indicated it follows that crotchets quavers and semiquavers on the same line or space must mean different letters the first step is obvious we count the notes to ascertain which sign occurs most frequently and we find that the crotchet in the top space is the sign required it occurs no less than eleven times now the letter most frequently occurring in an ordinary sentence of english is e let us then suppose that this represents e at once a coincidence strikes us in ordinary musical notation in the treble clef the note occupying the top space would be e let us remember that presently now the most common word in the english language is the we know the sign for e the last letter of this word so let us see if in more than one place that sign is preceded by two others identical in each case if so the probability is that the other two signs will represent t and h and the whole word will be the now it happens in no less than four places the sign e is preceded by the same two other signs once in the first line twice in the second and once in the fourth no word of three letters ending in e would be in the least likely to occur four times in a short sentence except the then we will call it the and note the signs preceding the e they are a quaver under the bottom line for the t and a crotchet on the first space for the h we travel along the stave and wherever these signs occur we mark them with t or h as the case may be but now we remember that e the crotchet in the top space is in its right place as a musical note while the crotchet in the bottom space means h which is no musical note at all considering this for a minute we remember that among the notes which are expressed in ordinary music on the treble stave without the use of ledger lines d e and f are repeated at the lower and at the upper part of the stave therefore anybody making a cryptogram of musical notes would probably use one set of these duplicate positions to indicate other letters and as h is in the lower part of the stave that is where the variation comes in let us experiment by assuming that all the crotchets above f in ordinary musical notation have their usual values and let us set the letters over their respective notes now things begin to shape look toward the end of the second line there is the word the and the letters f f t h with another note between the two fs now that word can only possibly be fifth so that now we have the sign for i it is the crotchet on the bottom line let us go through and mark the is and now observe the first sign of the lot is i and there is one other sign before the word the the only words possible here beginning with i and of two letters are it if is and in now we have the signs for t and f so we know that it isnt it or if is would be unlikely here because there is a tendency as you see to regularity in these signs and t the next letter alphabetically to s is at the bottom of the stave let us try n at once we get the word dance at the beginning of line three and now we have got enough to see the system of the thing make a stave and put g a b c and the higher d e f in their proper musical places then fill in the blank places with the next letters of the alphabet downward h i j and we find that h and i fall in the places we have already discovered for them as crotchets now take quavers and go on with k l m n o and so on as before beginning on the a space when you have filled the quavers do the same with semiquavers there are only six alphabetical letters left for this u v w x y z now you will find that this exactly agrees with all we have ascertained already and if you will use the other letters to fill up over the signs still unmarked you will get the whole message in the colt row ken over the coals the fifth dancer slides says jerry shiels the horney illustration the fifth dancer slides dancer as perhaps you didnt know is thieves slang for a stair and horney is the strolling musicians name for a cornet player of course the thing took a little time to work out chiefly because the sentence was short and gave one few opportunities but anybody with the key using the cipher as a means of communication would read it as easily as print snape used the same cipher in his jocular little note to the next searcher in the colt row staircase as soon as i had read it of course i guessed the purport of the flitterbat lancers jerry shielss name is well known to anybody with half my knowledge of the criminal records of the century and his connection with the missing wedlake jewels and his death in prison came to my mind at once the police afterwards by the way soon identified his old house in colt row from their records certainly here was something hidden and as the wedlake jewels seemed most likely i made the shot in talking to hoker but you terribly astonished him by telling him his name and address how was that hewitt laughed aloud that he said why that was the thinnest trick of all why the man had it engraved at large all over the silver band of his umbrella handle when he left his umbrella outside kerrett i had indicated the umbrella to him by a sign just copied the lettering on one of the ordinary visitors forms and brought it in you will remember i treated it as an ordinary visitors announcement kerrett has played that trick before i fear and he laughed again on the afternoon of the next day reuben b hoker called on hewitt and had half an hours talk with him in his private room after that he came up to me with half a crown in his hand sir he said everything has turned out a durned sell i dont want to talk about it any more im goin out o this durn country night before last i broke your winder you put the damage at half a crown here is the money good day to you sir and reuben b hoker went out into the tumultuous world the case of the dead skipper i it is a good few years ago now that a suicide was investigated by a coroners jury before whom martin hewitt gave certain simple and direct evidence touching the manner of the death and testifying to the fact of its being a matter of self destruction the public got certain suggestive information from the bare newspaper report but they never learnt the full story of the tragedy that led up to the suicide that was so summarily disposed of the time i speak of was in hewitts early professional days not long after he had left messrs crellans office and a long time before i myself met him at that time fewer of the police knew him and were aware of his abilities and fewer still appreciated them at their true value inquiries in connection with a case had taken him early one morning to the district which is now called london over the border and which comprises west ham and the parts there adjoining at this time however the district was much unlike its present self for none of the grimy streets that now characterize it had been built and even in its nearest parts open land claimed more space than buildings hewitts business lay with the divisional surgeon of police who had he found been called away from his breakfast to a patient hewitt followed him in the direction of the patients house and met him returning they walked together and presently as they came in sight of a row of houses a girl having the appearance of a maid of all work came running from the side door of the end house a house rather larger and more pretentious than the others in the row almost immediately a policeman appeared from the front door and seeing the girl running shouted to hewitt and his companion to stop her this hewitt did by a firm though gentle grasp of the arms and turning her about marched her back again come come he said youll gain nothing by running away whatever it is but the girl shuddered and sobbed and cried incoherently no no dont im afraid i dont like it sir its awful i cant stop there she was a strongly built sullen looking girl with prominent eyebrows and a rather brutal expression of face consequently her extreme nervous agitation her distorted face and her tears were the more noticeable what is all this the surgeon asked as they reached the front door of the house girl in trouble the policeman touched his helmet its murder sir this time he said thats what it is ive sent for the inspector and ive sent for you too sir and of course i couldnt allow anyone to leave the house till id handed it over to the inspector come he added to the girl as he saw her indoors dont lets have any more o that it looks bad i can tell you wheres the body asked the surgeon first floor front sir bed sittin room ships captain im told throat cut awful come said the surgeon as he prepared to mount the stairs youd better come up too mr hewitt you may spot something that will help if its a difficult case together they entered the room and indeed the sight was of a sort that any maid servant might be excused for running away from between the central table and the fireplace the body lay fully clothed and the whole room was in a great state of confusion drawers lying about with the contents spilt boxes open and papers scattered about on a table was a bottle and a glass robbery evidently the surgeon said as he bent to his task see the pockets are all emptied and partly protruding at the top the watch and chain has been torn off leaving the swivel in the button hole yes hewitt answered that is so he had taken a rapid glance about the room and was now examining the stove a register with close attention he shut the trap above it and pushed to the room door then very carefully by the aid of the feather end of a quill pen which lay on the table he shifted the charred remains of a piece or two of paper from the top of the cold cinders into the fire shovel he carried them to the sideboard nearer the light from the window and examined them minutely making a few notes in his pocket book and then removing the glass shade from an ornament on the mantel piece placed it over them theres something that may be of some use to the police he remarked or may not as the case may be at any rate there it is safe from draughts if they want it theres nothing distinguishable on one piece but i think the other has been a cheque the surgeon had concluded his first rapid examination and rose to his feet a very deep cut he said and done from behind i think as he was sitting in his chair death at once without a doubt and has been dead seven or eight hours i should say bed not slept in you see couldnt have done it himself thats certain the knife hewitt added is either gone or hidden but here is the inspector the inspector was a stranger to hewitt and looked at him inquiringly till the surgeon introduced him and mentioned his profession then he said with the air of one unwillingly relaxing a rule of conduct all right doctor if hes a friend of yours a little practice for you eh mr hewitt yes hewitt answered modestly i havent had the advantage of any experience in the police force and perhaps i may learn perhaps also i may help you this did not seem to strike the inspector as a very luminous probability and he stepped to the landing and ordered up the constable to make his full report he had brought another man with him who took charge of the door by this time thinly populated as was the neighbourhood boys had begun to collect outside the policemans story was simple as he passed on his beat he had been called by three women who had a light ladder planted against the window sill of the room they feared something was wrong with the occupant of the room they said as they could not make him hear and his door was locked therefore they had brought the ladder to look in at the window but now each feared to go and look would he the policeman do so he mounted the ladder looked in at the window and saw what was still visible he had then at the womens urgent request entered the house broken in the door and found the body to be dead and cold he had told the women at once and warned them in the customary manner that any statement they might be disposed to volunteer would be noted and used as evidence the landlady who was a widow and gave her name as mrs beckle said that the dead mans name was abel pullin and that he was a captain in the merchant service who had occupied the room as a lodger since the end of last week only when he had returned from a voyage so far as she knew no stranger had been in the house since she last saw pullin alive on the previous evening and the only person living in the house who had since gone out was mr foster also a seafaring man who had been a mate but for some time had had no ship he had gone out an hour or so before the discovery was made earlier than usual and without breakfast that was all that mrs beckle knew and the only other persons in the house were the servant and a miss walker a school teacher they knew nothing but miss walker was very anxious to be allowed to go to her school which of course he had not allowed till the inspector should arrive illustration he mounted the ladder and looked in at the window thats all right the inspector said and youre sure the door was locked yes sir fast key in the lock no sir i havent seen any key window shut just as it is now yes sir nothings been touched the inspector walked to the window and opened it it was a wooden framed casement window fastened by the usual turning catch at the side with a heavy bow handle he just glanced out and then swung the window carelessly to on its hinges the catch however worked so freely that the handle dropped and the catch banged against the window frame as he turned away hewitt saw this and closed the casement properly after a glance at the sill the inspector made a rapid examination of the clothing on the body and then said its a singular thing about the key the door was locked fast but theres no key to be seen inside the room seems it must have been locked from the outside perhaps hewitt suggested other keys on this landing fit the lock its commonly the case in this sort of house thats so the inspector admitted with the air of encouraging a pupil well see they walked across the landing to the nearest door it had a small round brass scutcheon apparently recently placed there yale lock said the inspector thats no good they went to the third door which stood ajar seems to be mr fosters room the inspector remarked heres the key inside they took it across the landing and tried it it fitted captain pullins lock exactly and easily hullo said the inspector look at that hewitt nodded thoughtfully just then he became aware of somebody behind him who had arrived noiselessly he turned and saw a mincing little woman with a pursed mouth and lofty expression who took no notice of him but addressed the inspector i shall be glad to know if you please she said when i may leave the house and attend to my duties my school has already been open for three quarters of an hour and i cannot conceive why i am detained in this manner very sorry maam the inspector replied matter of duty of course perhaps we shall be able to let you go presently meanwhile perhaps you can help us youre not obliged to say anything of course but if you do we shall make a note of it you didnt hear any uncommon noise in the night did you nothing at all i retired at ten and i was asleep soon after i know nothing whatever of the whole horrible affair and i shall leave the house entirely as soon as i can arrange did you have any opportunity of observing mr pullins manners or habits hewitt asked indeed no i saw nothing of him but i could hear him very often and his language was not of the sort i could tolerate he seemed to dominate the whole house with his boorish behaviour and he was frequently intoxicated i had already told mrs beckle that if his stay were to continue mine should cease i avoided him indeed altogether and i know nothing of him do you know how he came here did he know mrs beckle or anybody else in the house before that also i cant say but mrs beckle i believe knew all about him in fact i have sometimes thought there was some mysterious connection between them though what i cannot say certainly i cannot understand a landlady keeping so troublesome a lodger you have seen a little more of mr foster of course well yes he has been here so much longer he was more endurable than was captain pullin certainly though he was not always sober the two did not love one another i believe there the inspector pricked his ears they didnt love one another you say maam why was that oh i dont really know i fancy mr foster wanted to borrow money or something he used to say captain pullin had plenty of money and had once sunk a ship purposely i dont know whether or not this was serious of course hewitt looked at her keenly have you ever heard him called captain pullin of the egret he asked no i never heard the name of any vessel theres just one thing miss walker the inspector said that im afraid i must insist on before you go its only a matter of form of course but i must ask you to let me look round your room i shant disturb it miss walker tossed her head very well then she said turning toward the door with the yale lock and producing the key there it is and she flung the door open the inspector stepped within and took a perfunctory glance round that will do thank you he said i am sorry to have kept you i think you may go now miss walker you wont be leaving here to day altogether i suppose no im afraid i cant good morning as she disappeared by the foot of the stairs the inspector remarked in a jocular undertone neednt bother about her she isnt strong enough to cut a hens throat just then miss walker appeared again and attempted to take her umbrella from the stand a heavy tall oaken one the ribs however had become jammed between the stand and the wall so miss walker with one hand calmly lifted the stand and disengaged the umbrella with the other my eyes observed the inspector shes a bit stronger than she looks the surgeon came upon the landing i shall send to the mortuary now he said ive seen all i want to see here have you seen the landlady no i think shes downstairs they went downstairs and found mrs beckle in the back room much agitated though she was not the sort of woman one would expect to find greatly upset by anything she was thin hard and rigid with the rigidity and sharpness that women acquire who have a long and lonely struggle with poverty she had at first very little to say captain pullin had lodged with her before last night he had been in all the evening and had gone to bed about half past eleven and a quarter of an hour later everybody else had done so and the house was fastened up for the night the front door was fully bolted and barred and it was found so in the morning no stranger had been in the house for some days the only person who had left before the discovery was mr foster and he went away when only the servant was up this was unusual as he usually took breakfast in the house what had frightened the girl so much she thought was the fact that after the door had been burst open she peeped into the room out of curiosity and was so horrified at the sight that she ran out of the house she had always been a hard working girl though of sullen habits the inspector made more particular inquiries as to mr foster and after some little reluctance mrs beckle gave her opinion that he was very short of money indeed he had lost his ship sometime back through a neglect of duty and he was not of altogether sober habits he had consequently been unable to get another berth as yet it was a fact she admitted that he owed her a considerable sum for rent but he had enough clothes and nautical implements in his boxes to cover that and more hewitt had been watching mrs beckles face very closely and now suddenly asked with pointed emphasis how long have you known mr pullin mrs beckle faltered and returned hewitts steadfast gaze with a quick glance of suspicion oh she said i have known him on and off for a long time a connection by marriage of course hewitts hard gaze was still upon her mrs beckle looked from him to the inspector and back again and the corners of her mouth twitched then she sat down and rested her head on her hand well i suppose i must say it though ive kept it to myself till now she said resignedly hes my brother in law of course as you have been told you are not obliged to say anything now but the more information you can give the better chance there may be of detecting your brother in laws murderer well i dont mind im sure it was a bad day when he married my sister he killed her not at once so that he might have been hung for it but by a course of regular brutality and starvation i hated the man she said with a quick access of passion which however she suppressed at once and yet you let him stay in your house oh i dont know i was afraid of him and he used to come just when he pleased and practically take possession of the house i couldnt keep him away and he drove away my other lodgers she suddenly fired up again wasnt that enough to make anybody desperate can you wonder at anything she quieted again by a quick effort and hewitt and the inspector exchanged glances let me see he was captain of the sailing ship egret wasnt he hewitt asked lost in the pacific a year or more ago yes if i remember the story of the loss aright he and one native hand a kanaka boy were the only survivors yes they were the only two he was the only one that came back to england just so and there were rumours i believe that after all he wasnt altogether a loser by that wreck mind i only say there were rumours there may have been nothing in them yes mrs beckle replied i know all about that they said the ship had been cast away purposely for the sake of the insurance but there was no truth in that else why did the underwriters pay and besides from what i know privately it couldnt have been abel pullin was a reckless scoundrel enough i know but he would have taken good care to be paid well for any villainy of that sort yes of course but it was suggested that he was no nothing of the sort he came here as usual as soon as he got home and until he got another ship he hadnt a penny i had to keep him so i know and he was sober almost all the time from want of money do you mean to say if the common talk were true that he would have remained like that without getting money of the owners his accomplices and at least making them give him another ship not he i know him too well yes no doubt he was just now back from his next voyage after that i take it yes in the iolanthe brig a smaller ship than he has been used to and belonging to different owners had he much money this time no he had bought himself a gold watch and chain abroad and he had a ring and a few pounds in money and some instruments that was all i think in addition to his clothes well theyve all been stolen now the inspector said have you missed anything yourself no nor the other lodgers so far as you know no neither of them very well mrs beckle well have a word or two with the servant now and then ill get you to come over the house with us sarah taffs was the servants name she seemed to have got over her agitation and was now sullen and uncommunicative she would say nothing you said i neednt say nothin if i didnt want to and i wont that was all she would say and she repeated it again and again once however in reply to a question as to foster she flashed out angrily if its mr foster youre after you wont find im es a gentleman e is and i aint goin to tell you nothin but that was all then mrs beckle showed the inspector the surgeon and hewitt over the house everything was in perfect order on the ground floor and on the stairs the stairs it appeared had been swept before the discovery was made nevertheless hewitt and the inspector scrutinised them narrowly the top floor consisted of two small rooms only used as bedrooms by mrs beckle and sarah taffs respectively nothing was missing and everything was in order there the one floor between contained the dead mans room miss walkers and fosters miss walkers room they had already seen and now they turned into fosters the place seemed to betray careless habits on the part of its tenant and was everywhere in slovenly confusion the bedclothes were flung anyhow on the floor and a chair was overturned hewitt looked round the room and remarked that there seemed to be no clothes hanging about as might have been expected no mrs beckle replied he has taken to keeping them all in his boxes lately how many boxes has he asked the inspector only these two that is all the inspector stooped and tried the lids both locked he said i think well take the liberty of a peep into these boxes he produced a bunch of keys and tried them all but none fitted then hewitt felt about inside the locks very carefully with a match and then taking a button hook from his pocket after a little careful humouring work turned both the locks one after another and lifted the lids mrs beckle uttered an exclamation of dismay and the inspector looked at her rather quizzically the boxes contained nothing but bricks illustration the boxes contained nothing but bricks ah said the inspector ive seen that sort of suits o clothes before people have em who dont pay hotel bills and such like youre a very good pick lock by the way mr hewitt i never saw anything quicker and neater but i know he had a lot of clothes mrs beckle protested ive seen them very likely very likely indeed the inspector answered but theyre gone now and mr fosters gone with em but but the girl didnt say he had any bundles with him when he went out no she didnt and she didnt say he hadnt did she she wont say anything about him and she says she wont plump even supposing he hadnt got them with him this morning that signifies nothing the clothes are gone and anybody intending a job of that sort the inspector jerked his thumb significantly towards the skippers room would get his things away quietly first so as to have no difficulty about getting away himself afterwards no the things pretty plain now i think and im afraid mr fosters a pretty bad lot anyway i shouldnt like to be in his shoes nor i hewitt assented evidence of that sort isnt easy to get over come mrs beckle the inspector said do you mind coming into the front room with us the bodys covered over with a rug the landlady disliked going it was plain to see but presently she pulled herself together and followed the men she peeped once distrustfully round the door to where the body lay and then resolutely turned her back on it his watch and chain are gone and whatever else he had in his pockets the inspector said i think you said he had a ring yes one a thick gold one then thats gone too everythings turned upside down and probably other things are stolen too do you miss any yes mrs beckle replied looking round but avoiding with her eyes the rug covered heap near the fireplace there was a sextant on the mantel piece it was his and he kept one or two other instruments in that drawer pointing to one which had been turned out but they seem to be gone now and there was a small ship carved in ivory and worth money i believe thats gone i dont know about his clothes some of them may be stolen or they may not she stepped to the bed and turned back the coverlet oh she added the sheets are gone from the bed too usual thing the inspector remarked wrap up the swag in a sheet you know makes a convenient bundle nothing else missing the landlady took one more look round and said doubtfully no no i dont think so oh but yes she suddenly added uncles hook oh remarked the inspector with dismal jocularity hes took uncles hook as well as his own has he what was uncles hook like it wasnt of much value mrs beckle explained but i kept it as a memorial my great uncle who died many years ago was a sea captain too and had lost his left hand by accident he wore a hook in its place a hook made for him on board his vessel it was an iron hook screwed into a wooden stock he had it taken off in his last illness and gave it to me to mind against his recovery but he never got well so ive kept it over since it used to hang on a nail at the side of the chimney breast no wounds about the body that might have been made with a hook like that doctor were there the inspector asked no no wounds at all but the one well well the inspector said moving toward the door weve got to find foster now thats plain ill see about it youve sent to the mortuary you say doctor all right youve no particular reason for sending the girl out of doors to day i suppose mrs beckle i can keep her in of course the landlady answered it will be inconvenient though ah then keep her in will you we mustnt lose sight of her ill leave a couple of men here of course and ill tell them she mustnt be allowed out hewitt and the surgeon went downstairs and parted at the door i shall be over again to morrow morning hewitt said about that other matter i was speaking of shall i find you in well the doctor answered at any rate they will tell you where i am good morning good morning hewitt answered and then stopped im obliged for being allowed to look about upstairs here he said im not sure what the inspector has in his mind by the way but i should think whatever i noticed would be pretty plain to him though naturally he would be cautious about talking of it before others as i was myself that being the case it might seem rather presumptuous in me to make suggestions especially as he seems fairly confident but if you have a chance presently of giving him a quiet hint you might draw his special attention to two things the charred paper that i took from the fireplace and the missing hook there is a good deal in that i fancy i shall have an hour or two to myself i expect this afternoon and ill make a small inquiry or two on my own account in town if anything comes of them ill let you know to morrow when i see you very well i shall expect you goodbye hewitt did not go straight away from the house to the railway station he took a turn or two about the row of houses and looked up each of the paths leading from them across the surrounding marshy fields then he took the path for the station about a hundred yards along the path reached a deep muddy ditch with a high hedge behind it and then lay by the side of the ditch for some little distance before crossing it hewitt stopped and looked thoughtfully at the ditch for a few moments before proceeding and then went briskly on his way that evenings papers were all agog with the mysterious murder of a ships captain at west ham and in next mornings papers it was announced that henry foster a seafaring man and lately mate of a trading ship had been arrested in connection with the crime ii that morning hewitt was at the surgeons house early the surgeon was in and saw him at once his own immediate business being transacted hewitt learned particulars of the arrest of foster the man actually came back of his own accord in the afternoon the surgeon said certainly he was drunk but that seems a very reckless sort of thing even for a drunken man one rather curious thing was that he asked for pullin as soon as he arrived and insisted on going to him to borrow half a sovereign of course he was taken into custody at once and charged and that seemed to sober him very quickly he seemed dazed for a bit and then when he realised the position he was in refused to say a word i saw him at the station he had certainly been drinking a good deal but a curious thing was that he hadnt a cent of money on him hed soon got rid of it all anyhow did you say anything to the inspector as to the things i mentioned to you yes but he didnt seem to think a great deal of them he took a look at the charred paper and saw that one piece had evidently been a cheque on the eastern consolidated bank but the other he couldnt see any sort of sign upon as to the hook he seemed to take it that that was used to fasten in the knot of the bundle to carry it the more easily well hewitt said i think i told you yesterday that i should make an inquiry or two myself yes i did ive made those inquiries and now i think i can give the inspector some help what is his name by the way truscott hes a very good sort of fellow really very well shall i find him at the station probably unless hes off duty that i dont know about but i should call at the house first i think if i were you that is much nearer than the station and he might possibly be there even if he isnt there will be a constable and he can tell you where to find truscott hewitt accordingly made for the house and had the good fortune to overtake truscott on his way there good morning inspector he called cheerily ive got some information for you i think oh good morning what is it its in regard to that business hewitt replied indicating by a nod the row of houses a hundred yards ahead but it will be clearer if we go over the whole thing together and take what i have found out in its proper place youre not altogether satisfied with your capture of foster are you well i mustnt say of course perhaps not weve traced his doings yesterday after he left the house and perhaps it doesnt help us much but what do you know ill tell you but first can you get hold of such a thing as a boat hook any long pole with a hook on the end will do i dont know that theres one handy perhaps theyll have a garden rake at the house if thatll do excellently i should think if its fairly long we will ask the garden rake was forthcoming at once and with it hewitt and the inspector made their way along the path that led towards the railway station and stopped where it came by the ditch ive brought you here purely on a matter of conjecture hewitt said and there may be nothing in it but if there is it will help us this is a very muddy ditch with a soft bottom many feet deep probably judging from the wet nature of the soil hereabout he took the rake and plunged it deep into the ditch dragging it slowly back up the side it brought up a tangle of duckweed and rushes and slimy mud with a stick or two among it do you think the knifes been thrown here asked the inspector possibly and possibly something else well see and hewitt made another dive they went along thus very thoroughly and laboriously dragging every part of the ditch as they went it being frequently necessary for both to pull together to get the rake through the tangle of weed and rubbish they had worked through seven or eight yards from the angle of the path where it approached the ditch when hewitt stopped with the rake at the bottom here is something that feels a little different he said ill get as good a hold as i can and then well drag it up slowly and steadily together he gave the rake a slight twist and then the two pulled steadily presently the sunken object came away suddenly as though mud suction had kept it under and rose easily to the surface it was a muddy mass and they had to swill it to and fro a few times in the clearer upper water before it was seen to be a linen bundle they drew it ashore and untied the thick knot at the top inside was an indian shawl also knotted and this they opened also there within wet and dirty lay a sextant a chronometer in a case a gold watch and chain a handful of coins a thick gold ring a ship carved in ivory with much of the delicate work broken a sealskin waistcoat a door key a seamans knife and an iron hook screwed into a wooden stock illustration they had to swill it before it was seen to be a linen bundle lord exclaimed inspector truscott whats this its a queer place to hide swag of this sort why that watch and those instruments must be ruined yes im afraid so hewitt answered you see the things are wrapped in the sheets just as you expected but those sheets mean something more there are two you notice yes of course but i dont see what it points to the whole things most odd foster certainly would have been a fool to hide the things here hes a sailor himself and knows better than to put away chronometers and sextants in a wet ditch unless he got frightened and put the things there out of sight because the murder was discovered but you say you have traced his movements after he left if he had come near here while the police were about he would have been seen from the house no youve got the wrong prisoner the person who put those things there didnt want them again then do you think robbery wasnt the motive after all yes it was but not this robbery come well talk it over in the house let us take these things with us arrived at the house hewitt immediately locked bolted and barred the front door then he very carefully and gently unfastened each lock bolt and bar in order pressing the door with his hand and taking every precaution to avoid noise nevertheless the noise was considerable there was a sad lack of oil everywhere and all the bolts creaked the lock in particular made a deal of noise and when the key was half turned its bolt shot back with a loud thump anybody who had once heard that door fastened or unfastened said hewitt would hesitate about opening it in the dead of night after committing murder he would remember the noise do you mind taking the things up to the room the room upstairs i will go and ask mrs beckle a question truscott went upstairs and presently hewitt followed i have just asked mrs beckle he said whether or not the captain went to the front door for any purpose on the evening before his death she says he stood there for some half an hour or so smoking his pipe before he went to bed we shall see what that means presently i think now we will go into the thing in the light of what i have found out illustration he stood there for some half an hour or so smoking his pipe before he went to bed yes tell me that very well i think it will make the thing plainer if i summarise separately all my conclusions from the evidence as a whole from the beginning perhaps the same ideas struck you but im sure youll excuse my going over them now here was a man undoubtedly murdered and the murderer was gone from the room there were two ways by which he could have gone the door and the window if he went by the window then he was somebody who did not live in the place since nobody seemed to have been missing when the girl came down though mind you it was necessary to avoid relying on all she said in view of her manner and her almost acknowledged determination not to incriminate foster it seemed at first sight probable that the murderer had gone out by the door because the key was gone entirely and if he had left by the window he would probably have left the key in the lock to hinder anybody who attempted to get in with another key or to peep but then the blind was up and was found so in the morning it would probably be pulled down at dark and the murderer would be unlikely to raise it except to go out that way but then the casement was shut and fastened just so but cant it be as easily shut and fastened from the outside as from the in the catch is very loose and swings by itself true this prevents the casement shutting when it is just carelessly banged to but see here he rose and went to the window anybody from outside who cared to hold the catch back with his finger till the casement was shut as far as the frame could then shut the window completely and the catch would simply swing into its appointed groove illustration the catch would simply swing into its appointed groove and now see something more you and i both looked at the sill outside it is a smooth new sill the house itself is almost new but probably you saw in one place a sharply marked pit or depression look it seems to have been drilled with a sharp steel point it was absolutely new for there was the powder of the stone about the mark the wind has since blown the powder away now if a man had descended from that sill by means of a rope with a hook at the end that was just the sort of mark i should expect him to leave behind so that at any rate the balance of probability was that the murderer had left by the window but there is another thing which confirms this you will remember that when mrs beckle mentioned that the sheets were gone from the bed you concluded that they had been taken to carry the swag yes and so they were as we have seen here in the bundle just so but why both sheets one would be ample and since you allude to the bundle why both sheets as well as the indian shawl this last by the way is a thing mrs beckle seems not to have missed in the confusion or perhaps she didnt know that pullin possessed it why all these wrappings and moreover why the hook the presumption is clear the bundle was already made up in the indian shawl and required no more wrapping the two sheets were wanted to tie together to enable the criminal to descend from the window and the hook was the very thing to hold this rope with at the top it was not necessary to tie it to anything and it would not prevent the shutting of the window behind moreover when the descent had been made a mere shake of the rope of sheets would dislodge the hook and bring it down thus leaving no evidence of the escape except the mark on the sill which was very small then again there was no noise or struggle heard pullin as you could see was a powerful hard set man not likely to allow his throat to be cut without a lot of trouble therefore the murderer must either have entered the room unknown to him an unlikely thing for he had not gone to bed or else must have been there with his permission and must have taken him by sudden surprise and now we come to the heart of the thing of the two papers burnt in the grate you have kept them under the shade i see one bore no trace of the writing that had been on it many inks and papers do not after having been burnt but the other bore plain signs of having been a cheque now just let us look at it the main body of the paper has burnt to a deep gray ash nearly black but the printed parts of the cheque those printed in coloured inks that is are of a much paler gray quite a light ash colour that is the colour to which most of the pink ink used in printing cheques burns as you may easily test for yourself with an old cheque of the sort that is printed from a fine plate with water solution pink ink the black ink on the other hand such as the number of the cheque is printed in has charred black and by sharp eyes is quite distinguishable against the general dark gray of the paper the cinder is unfortunately broken rather badly and the part containing the signature is missing altogether but one can plainly see in large script letters part of the boldest line of print the name of the bank the letters are e r n c o n s o and this must mean the eastern consolidated bank of course you saw that for yourself yes of course i did fortunately the whole of the cheque number is unbroken it is bk of course i took a note of that as well as of the other particulars distinguishable it is payable to pullin clearly for here is the latter half of his christian name abel and the first few letters of pullin then on the line where the amount is written at length there are the letters u s a n d and p plainly it was a large cheque for thousands at the bottom where the amount is placed in figures there is a bad break but the first figure is a the cheque then was one for at least and there is one more thing the cinder is perfect and unbroken nearly all along the top edge and there is no sign of crossing so that here is an open cheque which any thief might cash with a little care that is all we can see but it is enough i think now would a thief committing murder for the sake of plunder burn this cheque would pullin to whom the money was to be paid burn it i think not then who in the whole world would have any interest in burning it not a soul with one single exception the man who drew it yes yes what do you mean that the man who drew that cheque must have murdered pullin in order to get it back and destroy it that is my opinion now who would draw pullin a cheque for anybody in this house is it at all likely of course not again we are pointed to a stranger and now remember pullins antecedents on his last voyage but one his ship the egret from valparaiso for wellington new zealand was cast away on the paumotu islands far out of her proper course there was but a small crew and as it happened all were lost except pullin and one kanaka boy the egret was heavily insured and there were nasty rumours at lloyds that captain pullin had made sure of his whereabouts taken care of himself and destroyed the ship in collusion with the owners and that the kanaka boy had only escaped because he happened to be well acquainted with the islands but there was nothing positive in the way of proof and the underwriters paid with no more than covert grumblings and as you remember mrs heckle told us yesterday pullin on his return had no money now suppose the story of the intentional wreck were true and for some reason pullins payment was put off till after his next voyage would the people who sent their men to death in the pacific hesitate at a single murder to save i think not after i left you yesterday i made some particular inquiries at lloyds through a friend of mine an underwriter himself i find that the sole owner of the egret was one herbert roofe trading as herbert roofe co the firm is a very small one as shipping concerns go and has had the reputation for a long time of being very rocky financially indeed it was the common talk at lloyds that nothing but the wreck of the egret saved roofe from the bankruptcy court and he is supposed now to be hanging on by his eyelashes as my friend expresses it with very little margin to keep him going and in a continual state of touch and go between his debit and credit sides as to the rumours of the wilful casting away of the egret my friend assured me that the thing was as certain as anything could be short of legal proof there was something tricky about the cargo and altogether it was a black sort of business and to complete things he told me that the bankers of herbert roofe co were the eastern consolidated phew this is getting pretty warm i must say mr hewitt wait a minute my friend aided me a little further still i told him the whole story in confidence of course and he agreed to help at my suggestion he went to the manager of the eastern consolidated bank whom he knew personally and represented that among a heap of cheques one had got torn and the missing piece destroyed this was true entirely except in regard to the heap a little fiction which i trust my friend may be forgiven the cheque he said was on the eastern consolidated and its number was bk would the manager mind telling him which of his customers had the cheque book from which that had been taken trace of where the cheque had come from had been quite lost and it would save a lot of trouble if the bank could let him know certainly said the manager ill inquire he did and presently a clerk entered the room with the information that cheque no bk was from a book in the possession of messrs herbert roofe co the inspector rose excitedly from his chair come he said this must be followed up we mustnt waste time theres no knowing where roofe may have got to by this just a little more patience hewitt said i dont think there will be much difficulty in finding him he believes himself safe as soon as my friend told me what the bank manager had said i went round to roofes office to ascertain his whereabouts prepared with an excuse for the interview in case i should find him in it was a small office rather over a shop in leadenhall street when i asked for mr roofe the clerk informed me that he was at home confined to his room by a bad cold and had not been at the office since tuesday the next day but one before the body was discovered i appeared to be disappointed and asked if i could send him a message yes i could the clerk told me all letters were being sent to him and he was sending business instructions daily to the office from chadwell heath i saw that the address had slipped inadvertently from the clerks mouth for it is a general rule i know in city offices to keep the principals addresses from casual callers so i said no more but contented myself with the information i had got i took the first opportunity of looking at a suburban directory and then i found the name of mr roofes house at chadwell heath it is scarby lodge i must be off then at once truscott said and make careful inquiries as to his movements and those cinders bless my soul theyre as precious as diamonds now how shall we keep them from damage oh the glass shade will do i fancy but wait a moment let us review things thoroughly i will run rapidly over what i suggest has happened between roofe and pullin and you shall stop me if you see any flaw in the argument its best to make our impressions clear and definite now we will suppose that the egret has been lost and pullin has come home to claim the reward of his infamy we will suppose it is he goes to roofe and demands it roofe says he cant possibly pay just then he is very hard up and the insurance money of the egret has only just saved him from bankruptcy pullin insists on having his money but says roofe that is impossible because he hasnt got it a cheque for the amount would be dishonoured the plunder of the underwriters has all been used to keep things going roofe says plainly that pullin must wait for the money pullin cant reveal the conspiracy without implicating himself and roofe knows it he promises to pay in a certain time and gives pullin an acknowledgment of the debt an i o u perhaps or something of that kind and with that pullin has to be contented and having no money he has to go away on another voyage this time in a ship belonging to somebody else because it would look worse than ever if roofe gave him another berth at once he makes his voyage and he returns and asks for his money again but roofe is as hard up as ever he cannot pay and he cannot refuse to pay it is ruin either way he knows that pullin will stand no more delay and may do something desperate so roofe does something desperate himself he tells pullin that he must not call at his office nor must anybody see them together anywhere for fear of suspicion he suggests that he roofe should call at pullins lodgings late one night and bring the money pullin is to let him in himself so that nobody may see him pullin consents and thus assists in the concealment of his own murder he stands at the front door smoking his pipe you remember that mrs beckle told me so waiting for roofe when roofe comes pullin takes him very quietly up to his room without attracting attention roofe on his part has prepared things by feigning a bad cold and going to bed early going out perhaps through the window when all his household is quiet there are plenty of late trains from chadwell heath that would bring him to stratford well when they are safely in pullins room roofe hears the front door shut and bolted with all its squeaks and thumps and decides that it wont be safe to go out that way after he has committed his crime the men sit and talk and pullin drinks roofe doesnt you will remember the bottle on the table with only one glass roofe produces and writes a cheque for the and pullin hands back the i o u which roofe burns that would be the lower of the two charred pieces of paper which we have there with the other but cant read then the crime takes place perhaps pullin drinks a little too much perhaps he dozes we shall never know unless roofe confesses circumstantially at any rate roofe gets behind him uses the sharp seamans knife he has brought for the purpose and straightway the skipper is dead at his feet then roofe gets back the cheque and burns that after that he ransacks the whole room he fears there may be some documentary evidence unguarded letters or something of the sort which being examined may throw some light on the egret affair there are none then he sets about his escape he has the whole night before him and to make the thing look like a murder for ordinary plunder and at the same time account for the upset room he takes away all the dead mans valuables tied in that shawl he sees the hook just the thing he wants and of course the sheets are an obvious substitute for a rope he takes away the door key to make it seem likely that somebody inside the house had been the criminal and then he simply goes away through the window as i have already explained at there would be a train to chadwell heath and that would land him home early enough to enable him to regain his bedroom unobserved after that he wisely maintains the pretence of illness for a day or two i guessed that the things carried off would be in that ditch for very simple reasons i looked about the house and the ditch seemed the only available hiding place near more it was on the way to the station the direction roofe would naturally take he would seize the very first opportunity of getting rid of his burden for every possible reason it was a nuisance to carry he could not account for it if he were asked and the further he carried it before getting rid of it the more distinct the clue to the direction he had taken supposing it ever were found as i quite expected my guess was right the behaviour of some of the people in the house might have been suspicious if i hadnt had so strong a clue in my hand leading in another direction foster poor fellow has probably pawned all his clothes one after another and put those bricks in his boxes to conceal the fact so that mrs beckle might not turn him away he owed her so much that at last he hadnt the face to go and eat her breakfast when he had no money to pay for it he went out early met friends got stood drinks and came back drunk the girl taffs very naturally ran from the horrible sight in this room and probably foster had been kind to her at some time or another so that when she found he was suspected she refused to give any information yes the inspector said it certainly seems to fit together to the smallest bit as you put it theres a future before you mr hewitt you ought to be in the force but now i must go to chadwell heath are you coming iii at chadwell heath it was found that a first class return ticket to stratford had been taken just before the train left on the last night abel pullin was seen alive and that the return half had been given up by a passenger who arrived by the first train soon after six in the morning the porter who took the ticket remembered the circumstance because first class tickets were rare at that time in the morning but he did not recognise the passenger who was muffled up but i think theres enough for an arrest without a warrant at any rate truscott said we shall be able to walk round and pick up a little more evidence after that i am off to scarby lodge cant afford to waste any more time he was foolish to take a first class ticket any way that singles a man out and he might easily have been recognised he was smart enough not to use his season ticket though that would have done him clean scarby lodge was a rather pretentious house standing in about three acres of ground the path to the front door was well shaded and it was arranged that truscott should wait aside till hewitt had sent in a message asking to see mr roofe on a matter of urgent business and that then both should follow the servant to his room this was done and as the parlourmaid was knocking at the bedroom door she was astonished to find hewitt and the police inspector behind her truscott at once pushed open the door and the two walked in it was a large well lighted room and at the far end a man sat in his dressing gown near a table on which stood several medicine bottles he was a man apparently of about thirty eight well built and with sharp features he frowned as truscott and hewitt entered but betrayed no sign of emotion carelessly taking one of the small bottles from the table at his side what do you want here he said sorry to be so unceremonious mr roofe truscott said advancing up the long room but i am a police officer and it is my duty to arrest you on a serious charge a charge of murder on the person of stop sir let me see that illustration stop sir let me see that but it was too late before truscott could reach him roofe had swallowed the contents of the small bottle and swaying once dropped to the floor as though shot a faint smell as of bruised almonds rose in the air hewitt stooped over the man dead he said dead as abel pullin it is prussic acid he had arranged for instant action if by any chance the game went against him but inspector truscott was troubled this is a nice thing he said to have a prisoner commit suicide in front of my eyes itll be an unpleasant job for me im afraid but you can testify that i hadnt time to get near him cant you indeed he wasnt a prisoner at the time for i hadnt arrested him in fact the case of mr geldards elopement i many people have been surprised at the information that in all martin hewitts wide and busy practice the matrimonial cases whereon he has been engaged have been comparatively few that he has had many important cases of the sort is true but among the innumerable cases of different descriptions they make a small percentage the reason is that so many of the persons wishing to consult him on such concerns were actuated by mere unreasoning or fanciful jealousy that hewitt would do no more in their cases than urge reconciliation and mutual trust the common private inquiry offices chiefly flourish on this class of case and their proprietors present no particular reluctance to taking it up in any event it means fees for consultation and watching and recent newspaper reports have made it plain that among some of the less scrupulous agents a case may be manufactured from beginning to end according to order again hewitt had a distaste for the sort of work commonly involved in matrimonial troubles and with the immense amount of business brought to him rendering necessary his rejection of so many commissions it was easy for him to avoid what went against his inclinations still as i have said matrimonial cases there were and often of an interesting nature taking rise in no fanciful nor unreasoning jealousy when on its change of proprietorship i accepted my appointment on the paper that now claims me i had a week or twos holiday pending the final turning over of the property i could not leave town for i might have been wanted at any moment but i made an absorbing and instructive use of my leisure as an amateur assistant to hewitt i sat in his office much of the time and saw more of the daily routine of his work than i had ever done before and i was present at one or two interviews that initiated cases that afterwards developed striking features one of these which indeed i saw entirely through before i resumed my more legitimate work was the case of mr and mrs geldard hewitt had stepped out for a few minutes and i was sitting alone in his private room when i became conscious of some disturbance in the outer office an excited female voice was audible making impatient inquiries presently kerrett hewitts clerk came in with the message that a lady mrs geldard was the name on the visitors slip that she had filled up was anxious to see mr hewitt at once and failing himself had decided to see me whom kerrett had calmly taken it upon himself to describe as hewitts confidential assistant he apologised for this and explained that he thought as the lady seemed excited it would be as well to let her see me to begin with if there was no objection and perhaps she would begin to be coherent and intelligible by hewitts arrival which might occur at any moment so the lady was shown in she was tall bony and severe of face and she began as soon as she saw me ive come to get you to get a watch set on my husband ive endured this sort of thing in silence long enough i wont have it ill see if theres no protection to be had for a woman treated as i am with his goings out all day on business when his office is shut up tight all the time i wanted to see mr hewitt himself but i suppose youll do for the present at any rate though ill have it sifted to the bottom and get the best advice to be had no matter what it costs though i am only a woman with nobody to confide in or to speak a word for me and im not going to be crushed like a fly as ill soon let him know here i seized a short opportunity to offer mrs geldard a chair and to say that i expected mr hewitt in a few minutes very well ill wait and see him but you have to do with the watching business no doubt and youll understand what it is i want done and im sure im justified and mean to sift it to the bottom whatever happens am i to be kept in total ignorance of what my husband does all day when he is supposed to be at business is it likely i should submit to that i said i didnt think it likely at all which was a fact mrs geldard appeared to be about the least submissive woman i ever saw no and i wont thats more nice goings on somewhere no doubt with his office shut up all day and the business going to ruin i want you to watch him i want you to follow him to morrow morning and find out all he does and let me know ive followed him myself this morning and yesterday morning but he gets away somehow from the back of his office and i cant watch on two staircases at once so i want you to come and do it and ill here fortunately hewitts arrival checked mrs geldards flow of speech and i rose and introduced him i told him shortly that the lady desired a watch to be set on her husband at his office and a report to be given her of his daily proceedings hewitt did not appear to accept the commission with any particular delight but he sat down to hear his visitors story stay here brett he said as he saw my hands stretched towards the door weve an engagement presently you know the engagement i remembered was merely to lunch and hewitt kept me with some notion of restricting the time which this alarming woman might be disposed to occupy she repeated to hewitt in the same manner what she had already said to me and then hewitt seizing his first opportunity said will you please tell me mrs geldard definitely and concisely what evidence or even indication you have of unbecoming conduct on your husbands part and substantially what case you wish me to take up case why ive been telling you and again mrs geldard repeated her vague catalogue of sufferings assuring hewitt that she was determined to have the best advice and assistance and that therefore she had come to him in the end hewitt answered put concisely mrs geldard i take it that your case is simply this mr geldard is in business as i think you told me a general agent and broker and keeps an office in the city you have had various disagreements with him not an uncommon thing unfortunately between married people and you have entertained certain indefinite suspicions of his behaviour yesterday you went so far as to go to his office soon after he should have been there and found him absent and the office shut up you waited some time and called again but the door was still locked and the caretaker of the building assured you that mr geldard usually kept his office thus shut you knocked repeatedly and called through the keyhole but got no answer this morning you even followed your husband and saw him enter his office but when a little later you yourself attempted to enter it you once more found it locked and apparently tenantless from this you conclude that he must have left his rooms by some back way and you say you are determined to find out where he goes and what he does during the day for this purpose you i gather wish me to watch him and report his whole days proceedings to you yes of course as i said im afraid the state of my other engagements just at present will scarcely admit of that indeed to speak quite frankly this mere watching especially of husband or wife is not a sort of business that i care to undertake except as a necessary part of some definite tangible case but apart from that will you allow me to advise you not professionally i mean but merely as a man of the world why come to third parties with these vague suspicions family divisions of this sort with all sorts of covert mistrust and suspicion are bad things at best and once carried as far as you talk of carrying this go beyond peaceable remedy why not deal frankly and openly with your husband why not ask him plainly what he has been doing during the days you were unable to get into his office you will probably find it all capable of a very simple and innocent explanation am i to understand then mrs geldard said bridling that you refuse to help me i have not refused to help you hewitt replied on the contrary i am trying to help you now did your husband ever follow any other profession than the one he is now engaged in once he was a mechanical engineer but he got very few clients and it didnt pay there now is a suggestion would it be very unlikely that your husband trained mechanician as he is may have reverted so far to his old profession as to be conceiving some new invention and in that case what more probable than that he would lock himself securely in his office to work out his idea and take no notice of visitors knocking in order to admit nobody who might learn something of what he was doing does he keep a clerk or office boy no he never has since he left the mechanical engineering well mrs geldard im sorry i have no more time now but i must earnestly repeat my advice come to an understanding with your husband in a straightforward way as soon as you possibly can there are plenty of private inquiry offices about where they will watch anybody and do almost anything without any inquiry into their clients motives and with a single eye to fees i charge you no fee and advise you to treat your husband with frankness mrs geldard did not seem particularly satisfied though hewitts rejection of a consultation fee somewhat softened her she left protesting that hewitt didnt know the sort of man she had to deal with and that one way or another she must have an explanation come well get to lunch said hewitt im afraid my suggestion as to mr geldards probable occupation in his office wasnt very brilliant but it was the pleasantest i could think of for the moment and the main thing was to pacify the lady one does no good by aggravating a misunderstanding of that sort can you make any conjecture i said at what the trouble really is hewitt raised his eyebrows and shook his head theres no telling he said an angry jealous pragmatical woman apparently this mrs geldard and its impossible to judge at first sight how much she really knows and how much she imagines i dont suppose shell take my advice she seems to have worked herself into a state of rancour that must burst out violently somewhere but lunch is the present business come the next day i spent at a friends house a little way out of town so that it was not till the following morning about the same time that i learned from hewitt that mrs geldard had called again yes he said she seems to have taken my advice in her own way which wasnt a judicious one when i suggested that she should speak frankly to her husband i meant her to do it in a reasonably amicable mood instead of that she appears to have flown at his throat so to speak with all the bitterness at her tongues disposal the natural result was a row the man slanged back the woman threatened divorce and the man threatened to leave the country altogether and so yesterday mrs geldard was here again to get me to follow and watch him i had to decline once more and got something rather like a slanging myself for my pains she seemed to think i was in league with her husband in some way in the end i promised more to get rid of her than anything else to take the case in hand if ever there were anything really tangible to go upon if her husband really did desert her you know or anything like that if in fact there were anything more for me to consider than these spiteful suspicions i suppose i said she had nothing more to tell you than she had before very little she seems to have startled geldard however by a chance shot it seems that she once employed a maid whom she subsequently dismissed because as she tells me the young woman was a great deal too good looking and because she observed or fancied she observed signs of some secret understanding between her maid and her husband moreover it was her husband who discovered this maid and introduced her into the house and furthermore he did all he could to induce mrs geldard not to dismiss her he even hinted that her dismissal might cause serious trouble and mrs geldard says it is chiefly since this maid has left the house that his movements have become so mysterious well it seems that in the heat of yesterdays quarrel mrs geldard quite at random asked tauntingly how many letters geldard had received from emma trennatt lately emma trennatt was the girls name this chance shot seemed to hit the target geldard so his wife tells me at any rate winced visibly paled a little and dodged the question but for the rest of the quarrel he appeared much less at ease and made more than one attempt to find out how much his wife really knew of the correspondence she had spoken of but as her reference to it was of course the wildest possible fluke he got little guidance while his better half waxed savage in her triumph and they parted on wild cat terms she came straight here and evidently thought that after geldards reception of her allusion to correspondence with emma trennatt which she seemed to regard as final and conclusive confirmation of all her jealousies i should take the case in hand at once when she found me still disinclined she gave me a trifling sample of her rhetoric as no doubt commonly supplied to mr geldard she said in effect that she had only come to me because she meant having the best assistance possible but that she didnt think much of me after all and one man was as bad as another and so on i think she was a trifle angrier because i remained calm and civil and she went away this time without the least reference to a consultation fee one way or another illustration signs of some secret understanding i laughed probably i said she went off to some agent wholl watch as long as she likes to pay quite possibly but we were quite wrong hewitt took his hat and we made for the staircase as we opened the landing door there were hurried feet on the stairs below and as it shut behind mrs geldards bonnet load of pink flowers hove up before us she was in a state of fierce alarm and excitement that had oddly enough something of triumph in it as of the woman who says i told you so hewitt gave a tragic groan under his breath heres a nice state of things im in for now mr hewitt she began abruptly through your refusing to do anything for me while there was time though i was ready to pay you well as i told your young man but no you wouldnt listen to anything and seemed to think you knew my business better than i could tell you and now youve caused this state of affairs by delay perhaps youll take the case in hand now but you havent told me what has happened hewitt began whereat the lady instantly rejoined with a shrill pretence of a laugh happened why what do you suppose has happened after what i have told you over and over again my precious husbands gone clean away thats all hes deserted me and gone nobody knows where thats whats happened you said that if he did anything of that sort youd take the case up so now ive come to see if youll keep your promise not that its likely to be of much use now we turned back into hewitts private office and mrs geldard told her story disentangled from irrelevances repetitions opinions and incidental observations it was this after the quarrel geldard had gone to business as usual and had not been seen nor heard of since after her yesterdays interview with hewitt mrs geldard had called at her husbands office and found it shut as before she went home again and waited but he never returned home that evening nor all night in the morning she had gone to the office once more and finding it still shut had told the caretaker that her husband was missing and insisted on his bringing his own key and opening it for her inspection nobody was there and mrs geldard was astonished to find folded and laid on a cupboard shelf the entire suit of clothes that her husband had worn when he left home on the morning of the previous day she also found in the waste paper basket the fragments of two or three envelopes addressed to her husband which she brought for hewitts inspection they were in the handwriting of the girl trennatt and with them mrs geldard had discovered a small fragment of one of the letters a mere scrap but sufficient to show part of the signature emma and two or three of a row of crosses running beneath such as are employed to represent kisses these things she had brought with her hewitt examined them slightly and then asked can i have a photograph of your husband mrs geldard she immediately produced not only a photograph of her husband but also one of the girl trennatt which she said belonged to the cook hewitt complimented her on her foresight and now he said i think well go and take a look at mr geldards office if we may of course i shall follow him up now hewitt made a sign to me which i interpreted as asking whether i would care to accompany him i assented with a nod for the case seemed likely to be interesting i omit most of mrs geldards talk by the way which was almost ceaseless mostly compounded of useless repetition and very tiresome the office was on a third floor in a large building in finsbury pavement the caretaker made no difficulty in admitting us there were two rooms neither very large and one of them at the back very small indeed in this was a small locked door that leads on to the small staircase sir the caretaker said in response to hewitts inquiry the staircase leads down to the basement and it aint used much cept by the cleaners if i went down this back staircase hewitt pursued i suppose i should have no difficulty in gaining the street not a bit sir youd have to go a little way round to get into finsbury pavement but theres a passage leads straight from the bottom of the stairs out to moorfields behind yes remarked mrs geldard bitterly when the caretaker had left the room thats the way hes been leaving the office every day and in disguise too she pointed to the cupboard where her husbands clothes lay pretty plain proof that he was ashamed of his doings whatever they were come come hewitt answered deprecatingly well hope theres nothing to be ashamed of at any rate till theres proof of it theres no proof as yet that your husband has been disguising a great many men who rent offices i believe keep dress clothes at them i do it myself for convenience in case of an unexpected invitation or such other eventuality we may find that he returned here last night put on his evening dress and went somewhere dining illness or fifty accidents may have kept him from home but mrs geldard was not to be softened by any such suggestion which i could see hewitt had chiefly thrown out by way of pacifying the lady and allaying her bitterness as far as he could in view of a possible reconciliation when things were cleared up that isnt very likely she said if he kept a dress suit here openly i should know of it and if he kept it here unknown to me what did he want it for if he went out in dress clothes last night who did he go with who do you suppose after seeing those envelopes and that piece of the letter well well we shall see hewitt replied may i turn out the pockets of these clothes certainly theres nothing in them of importance mrs geldard said i looked before i came to you nevertheless hewitt turned them out here is a cheque book with a number of cheques remaining no counterfoils filled in which is awkward bankers the london amalgamated we will call there presently an ivory pocket paper knife a sovereign purse empty hewitt placed the articles on the table as he named them gold pencil case ivory folding rule russia leather card case he turned to mrs geldard there is no pocket book he said no pocket knife and no watch and there are no keys did mr geldard usually carry any of these things yes mrs geldard replied he carried all four hewitts simple methodical calmness and his plain disregard of her former volubility appeared by this to have disciplined mrs geldard into a businesslike brevity and directness of utterance as to the watch now can you describe it oh it was only a cheap one he had a gold one stolen or at any rate he told me so and since then he has only carried a very common sort of silver one without a chain the keys i only know there was a bunch of keys some of them fitted drawers and bureaux at home and others i suppose fitted locks in this office what of the pocket knife that was a very uncommon one it was a present as a matter of fact from an engineering friend who had had it made specially it was large with a tortoise shell handle and a silver plate with his initials there was only one ordinary knife blade in it all the other implements were small tools or things of that kind there was a small pair of silver calipers for instance like these hewitt suggested producing those he used for measuring drawers and cabinets in search of secret receptacles yes like those and there were folding steel compasses a tiny flat spanner a little spirit level and a number of other small instruments of that sort it was very well made indeed he used to say that it could not have been made for five pounds indeed hewitt cast his eyes about the two rooms i see no signs of books here mrs geldard account books i mean of course your husband must have kept account books i take it yes naturally he must have done i never saw them of course but every business man keeps books then after a pause mrs geldard continued and theyre gone too i never thought of that but there i might have known as much who can trust a man safely if his own wife cant but i wont shield him whatever hes been doing with his clients money hell have to answer for himself thank heaven ive enough to live on of my own without being dependent on a creature like him but think of the disgrace my husband nothing better than a common thief swindling his clients and making away with his books when he cant go on any longer but he shall be punished oh yes ill see hes punished if once i find him hewitt thought for a moment and then asked do you know any of your husbands clients mrs geldard no she answered rather snappishly i dont ive told you he never let me know anything of his business never anything at all and very good reason he had too thats certain then probably you do not happen to know the contents of these drawers hewitt pursued tapping the writing table as he spoke oh theres nothing of importance in them at any rate in the unlocked ones i looked at all of them this morning when i first came the table was of the ordinary pedestal pattern with four drawers at each side and a ninth in the middle at the top and of very ordinary quality the only locked drawer was the third from the top on the left hand side hewitt pulled out one drawer after another in one was a tin half full of tobacco in another a few cigars at the bottom of a box in a third a pile of notepaper headed with the address of the office and rather dusty another was empty still another contained a handful of string the top middle drawer rather reminded me of a similar drawer of my own at my last newspaper office for it contained several pipes but my own were mostly briars whereas these were all clays theres nothing really so satisfactory hewitt said as he lifted and examined each pipe by turn to a seasoned smoker as a well used clay most such men keep one or more of them for strictly private use there was nothing noticeable about these pipes except that they were uncommonly dirty but hewitt scrutinised each before returning it to the drawer then he turned to mrs geldard and said as to the bank now the london amalgamated mrs geldard are you known there personally oh yes my husband gave them authority to pay cheques signed by me up to a certain amount and i often do it for household expenses or when he happens to be away then perhaps it will be best for you to go alone hewitt responded of course they will never as a general thing give any person information as to the account of a customer but perhaps as you are known to them and hold your husbands authority to draw cheques they may tell you something what i want to find out is of course whether your husband drew from the bank all his remaining balance yesterday or any large sum you must go alone ask for the manager and tell him that you have seen nothing of mr geldard since he left for business yesterday morning mind you are not to appear angry or suspicious or anything of that sort and you mustnt say you are employing me to bring him back from an elopement that will shut up the channel of information at once hostile inquiries theyll never answer even by the smallest hint except after legal injunction you can be as distressed and as alarmed as you please your husband has disappeared since yesterday morning and youve no notion what has become of him that is your tale and a perfectly true one you would like to know whether or not he has withdrawn his balance or a considerable sum since that would indicate whether or not his absence was intentional and premeditated mrs geldard understood and undertook to make the inquiry with all discretion the bank was not far and it was arranged that she should return to the office with the result as soon as she had left hewitt turned to the pedestal table and probed the keyhole of the locked drawer with the small stiletto attached to his penknife this seems to be a common sort of lock he said i could probably open it with a bent nail but the whole table is a cheap sort of thing perhaps there is an easier way he drew the unlocked drawer above completely out passed his hand into the opening and felt about yes he said its just as i hoped as it usually is in pedestal tables not of the best quality the partition between the drawers doesnt go more than two thirds of the way back and i can drop my hand into the drawer below but i cant feel anything there it seems empty he withdrew his hand and we tilted the whole table backward so as to cause whatever lay in the drawers to slide to the back this dodge was successful hewitt reinserted his hand and withdrew it with two orderly heaps of papers each held together by a metal clip the papers in each clip on examination proved to be all of an identical character with the exception of dates they were in fact rent receipts those for the office which had been given quarterly were put back in their place with scarcely a glance and the others hewitt placed on the table before him each ran apart from dates in this fashion received from mr j cookson s one months rent of stable at dragon yard benton street to here followed the date also rent feed and care of horse in own stable as agreed w gask the receipts were ill written and here and there ill spelt hewitt put the last of the receipts in his pocket and returned the others to the drawer either he said mr cookson is a client who gets mr geldard to hire stables for him which may not be likely or mr geldard calls himself mr cookson when he goes driving possibly with miss trennatt we shall see the pedestal table put in order again hewitt took the poker and raked in the fireplace it was summer and behind the bars was a sort of screen of cartridge paper with a frilled edge and behind this various odds and ends had been thrown spent matches trade circulars crumpled up and torn paper there were also the remains of several cigars some only half smoked and one almost whole the torn paper hewitt examined piece by piece and finally sorted out a number of pieces which he set to work to arrange on the blotting pad they formed a complete note written in the same hand as were the envelopes already found by mrs geldard that of the girl emma trennatt it corresponded also with the solitary fragment of another letter which had accompanied them by way of having a number of crosses below the signature and it ran thus tuesday night dear sam to morrow to carry not late because people are coming for flowers what you did was no good the smoke leaks worse than ever and f thinks you must light a new pipe or else stop smoking altogether for a bit uncle is anxious emma then followed the crosses filling one line and nearly half the next seventeen in all hewitt gazed at the fragments thoughtfully this is a find he said most decidedly a find it looks so much like nonsense that it must mean something of importance the date you see is tuesday night it would be received here on wednesday yesterday morning so that it was immediately after the receipt of this note that geldard left its pretty plain the crosses dont mean kisses the note isnt quite of the sort that usually carries such symbols and moreover when a lady fills the end of a sheet of notepaper with kisses she doesnt stop less than half way across the last line she fills it to the end these crosses mean something very different i should like too to know what smoke means anyway this letter would probably astonish mrs geldard if she saw it well say nothing about it for the present he swept the fragments into an envelope and put away the envelope in his breast pocket there was nothing more to be found of the least value in the fireplace and a careful examination of the office in other parts revealed nothing that i had not noticed before so far as i could see except geldards boots standing on the floor of the cupboard wherein his clothes lay the whole place was singularly bare of what one commonly finds in an office in the way of papers hand books and general business material mrs geldard was not long away at the bank she found that the manager was absent and his deputy had been very reluctant to say anything definite without his sanction he gave mrs geldard to understand however that there was a balance still remaining to her husbands credit also that mr geldard had drawn a cheque the previous morning wednesday for an amount rather larger than usual and that was all by the way mrs geldard hewitt observed with an air of recollecting something there was a mr cookson i believe if i remember who knew a mr geldard you dont happen to know do you whether or not mr geldard had a client or an acquaintance of that name no i know nobody of the name ah it doesnt matter i suppose it isnt necessary for your husband to keep horses or vehicles of any description in his business no certainly not mrs geldard looked surprised at the question of course i should have known that he does not drive to business i suppose no he goes by omnibus but as to emma trennatt now this photograph is most welcome and will be of great assistance i make no doubt but is there anything individual by which i might identify her if i saw her anything beyond what i see in the photograph a peculiarity of step for instance or a scar or what not yes there is a large mole more than a quarter of an inch across i should think on her left cheek an inch below the outer corner of her eye the photograph only shows the other side of the face that will be useful to know now has she a relative living at crouch end or thereabout yes her uncle shes living with him now or she was at any rate till lately but how did you know that the crouch end postmark was on those envelopes you found do you know anything of her uncle nothing except that hes a nurseryman i believe not his full address no and trennatt is his name yes thank you i think mrs geldard hewitt said taking his hat that i will set out after your husband at once you i think can do no better than stay at home till i have news for you i have your address if anything comes to your knowledge please telegraph it to my office at once the office door was locked the keys were left with the caretaker and we saw mrs geldard into a cab at the door come said hewitt well go somewhere and look at a directory and after that to dragon yard i think i know a man in moorgate street wholl let me see his directory we started to walk down finsbury pavement suddenly hewitt caught my arm and directed my eyes toward a woman who had passed hurriedly in the opposite direction i had not seen her face but hewitt had if that isnt miss emma trennatt he said its uncommonly like the notion ive formed of her well see if she goes to geldards office we hurried after the woman who sure enough turned into the large door of the building we had just left as it was impossible that she should know us we followed her boldly up the stairs and saw her stop before the door of geldards office and knock we passed her as she stood there a handsome young woman enough and well back on her left cheek in the place mrs geldard had indicated there was plain to see a very large mole we pursued our way to the landing above and there we stopped in a position that commanded a view of geldards door the young woman knocked again and waited this doesnt look like an elopement yesterday morning does it hewitt whispered unless geldards left both this one and his wife in the lurch the young woman below knocked once or twice more walked irresolutely across the corridor and back and in the end after a parting knock started slowly back downstairs brett hewitt exclaimed with suddenness will you do me a favour that woman understands geldards secret comings and goings as is plain from the letter but she would appear to know nothing of where he is now since she seems to have come here to find him perhaps this last absence of his has nothing to do with the others in any case will you follow this woman she must be watched but i want to see to the matter in other places will you do it of course i assented at once we had been descending the stairs as hewitt spoke keeping distance behind the girl we were following thank you hewitt now said do it if you find anything urgent to communicate wire to me in care of the inspector at crouch end police station he knows me and i will call there in case you may have sent but if its after five this afternoon wire also to my office if you keep with her to crouch end where she lives we shall probably meet we parted at the door of the office we were at first bound for and i followed the girl southward this new turn of affairs increased the puzzlement i already laboured under here was the girl trennatt who by all evidence appeared to be well acquainted with geldards mysterious proceedings and in consequence of whose letter whatever it might mean he would seem to have absented himself herself apparently ignorant of his whereabouts and even unconscious that he had left his office i had at first begun to speculate on geldards probable secret employment i had heard of men keeping good establishments who unknown to even their own wives procured the wherewithal by begging or crossing sweeping in london streets i had heard also knew in fact from hewitts experience of well to do suburban residents whose actual profession was burglary or coining i had speculated on the possibility of geldards secret being one of that kind my mind had even reverted to the case which i have related elsewhere in which hewitt frustrated a dynamite explosion by his timely discovery of a bakers cart and a number of loaves and i wondered whether or not geldard was a member of some secret brotherhood of anarchists or fenians but here it would seem were two distinct mysteries one of geldards generally unaccountable movements and another of his disappearance each mystery complicating the other again what did that extraordinary note mean with its crosses and its odd references to smoking had the dirty clay pipes anything to do with it or the half smoked cigars perhaps the whole thing was merely ridiculously trivial after all i could make nothing of it however and applied myself to my pursuit of emma trennatt who mounted an omnibus at the bank on the roof of which i myself secured a seat ii here i must leave my own proceedings to put in their proper place those of martin hewitt as i subsequently learnt them benton street he found by the directory turned out of the city road south of old street so was quite near he was there in less than ten minutes and had discovered dragon yard dragon yard was as small a stable yard as one could easily find only the right hand side was occupied by stables and there were only three of these on the left was a high dead wall bounding a great warehouse or some such building across the first and second of the stables stretched a long board with the legend w gask corn hay and straw dealer and underneath a shop address in old street the third stable stood blank and uninscribed and all three were shut fast nobody was in the yard and hewitt at once proceeded to examine the end stable the doors were unusually well finished and close fitting and the lock was a good one of the lever variety and very difficult to pick hewitt examined the front of the building very carefully and then after a visit to the entrance of the yard to guard against early interruption returned and scrambled by projections and fastenings to the roof this was a roof in contrast to those of the other stables they were of tiles seemed old and carried nothing in the way of a skylight evidently it was the habit of mr gask and his helpers to do their horse and van business with gates wide open to admit light but the roof of this third stable was newer and better made and carried a good sized skylight of thick fluted glass hewitt took a good look at such few windows as happened to be in sight and straightaway began with the strongest blade of his pocket knife to cut away the putty from round one pane it was a rather long job for the putty had hardened thoroughly in the sun but it was accomplished at length and hewitt with a final glance at the windows in view prised up the pane from the end and lifted it out the interior of the stable was apparently empty neither stall nor rack was to be seen and the place was plainly used as a coach or van house simply hewitt took one more look about him and dropped quietly through the hole in the skylight the floor was thickly laid with straw there were a few odd pieces of harness a rope or two a lantern and a few sacks lying here and there and at the darkest end there was an obscure heap covered with straw and sacking this heap hewitt proceeded to unmask and having cleared away a few sacks left revealed about half a dozen rolls of linoleum one of these he dragged to the light where it became evident that it had remained thus rolled and tied with cord in two places for a long period there were cracks in the surface and when the cords were loosened the linoleum showed no disposition to open out or to become unrolled others of the rolls on inspection exhibited the same peculiarities moreover each roll appeared to consist of no more than a couple of yards of material at most though all were of the same pattern every roll in fact was of the same length thickness and shape as the others containing somewhere near two yards of linoleum in a roll of some half dozen thicknesses leaving an open diameter of some four inches in the centre hewitt looked at each in turn and then replaced the heap as he had found it after this to regain the skylight was not difficult by the aid of a trestle the pane was replaced as well as the absence of fresh putty permitted and five minutes later hewitt was in a hansom bound for crouch end illustration half a dozen rolls of linoleum he dismissed his cab at the police station within he had no difficulty in procuring a direction to trennatt the nurseryman and a short walk brought him to the place a fairly high wall topped with broken glass bounded the nursery garden next the road and in the wall were two gates one a wide double one for the admission of vehicles and the other a smaller one of open pales for ordinary visitors the garden stood sheltered by higher ground behind whereon stood a good sized house just visible among the trees that surrounded it hewitt walked along by the side of the wall soon he came to where the ground of the nursery garden appeared to be divided from that of the house by a most extraordinarily high hedge extending a couple of feet above the top of the wall itself stepping back the better to note this hedge hewitt became conscious of two large boards directly facing each other with scarcely four feet space between them one erected on a post in the ground of the house and the other similarly elevated from that of the nursery each being inscribed in large letters trespassers will be prosecuted hewitt smiled and passed on here plainly was a neighbours quarrel of long standing for neither board was by any means new the wall continued and keeping by it hewitt made the entire circuit of the large house and its grounds and arrived once more at that part of the wall that enclosed the nursery garden just here and near the wider gate the upper part of a cottage was visible standing within the wall and evidently the residence of the nurseryman it carried a conspicuous board with the legend h m trennatt nurseryman the large house and the nursery stood entirely apart from other houses or enclosures and it would seem that the nursery ground had at some time been cut off from the grounds attached to the house hewitt stood for a moment thoughtfully and then walked back to the outer gate of the house on the rise it was a high iron gate and as hewitt perceived it was bolted at the bottom within the garden showed a neglected and weed choked appearance such as one associates with the garden of a house that has stood long empty a little way off a policeman walked hewitt accosted him and spoke of the house i was wondering if it might happen to be to let he said do you know no sir the policeman replied it aint though anyone might almost think it to look at the garden thats a mr fuller as lives there and a rum un too oh hes a rum un is he keeps himself shut up perhaps yes sir ony as one old woman deaf as a post for servant and never lets nobody into the place its a rare game sometimes with the milkman the milkman he comes and rings that there bell but the old gals so deaf she never ears it then the milkman he just slips is and through the gate rails lifts the bolt and goes and bangs at the door old fuller runs out and swears a good un the old gal comes out and old fuller swears at er and she turns round and swears back like anything she dont care for im not a bit then when he aint avin a row with the milkman and the old gal he goes down the garden and rows with the old nurseryman there down the ill he jores the nurseryman from is side o the hedge and the nurseryman he jores back at the top of is voice ive stood out there ten minutes together and nearly bust myself a laughin at them gray eaded old fellers a callin each other everythink they can think of you can ear em alf over the parish why each of ems ad a board painted trespassers will be prosecuted and stuck em up facin each other so as to keep up the row very funny no doubt funny i believe you sir why its quite a treat sometimes on a dull beat like this why whats that blowed if i dont think theyre beginning again now yes they are well my beats the other way there was a sound of angry voices in the direction of the nursery ground and hewitt made toward it just where the hedge peeped over the wall the altercation was plain to hear youre an old vagabond and ill indict you for a nuisance youre an old thief and youd like to turn me out of house and home wouldnt you indict away you greedy old scoundrel these and similar endearments punctuated by growls and snorts came distinctly from over the wall accompanied by a certain scraping brushing sound as though each neighbour were madly attempting to scale the hedge and personally bang the other hewitt hastened round to the front of the nursery garden and quietly tried first the wide gate and next the small one both were fastened securely but in the manner of the milkman at the gate of the house above hewitt slipped his hand between the open slats of the small gate and slid the night latch that held it within the quarrel ran high as hewitt stepped quietly into the garden he trod on the narrow grass borders of the beds for quietness sake till presently only a line of shrubs divided him from the clamorous nurseryman stooping and looking through an opening which gave him a back view hewitt observed that the brushing and scraping noise proceeded not from angry scramblings but from the forcing through an inadequate opening in the hedge of some piece of machinery which the nurseryman was most amicably passing to his neighbour at the same time as he assailed him with savage abuse and received a full return in kind it appeared to consist of a number of coils of metal pipe not unlike those sometimes used in heating apparatus and was as yet only a very little way through something else of bright copper lay on the garden bed at the foot of the hedge but intervening plants concealed its shape illustration forcing through the hedge some piece of machinery hewitt turned quickly away and made towards the greenhouses keeping tall shrubs as much as possible between himself and the cottage and looking sharply about him here and there about the garden were stand pipes each carrying a tap at its upper end and placed conveniently for irrigation these in particular hewitt scrutinised and presently as he neared a large wooden outhouse close by the large gate turned his attention to one backed by a thick shrub when the thick undergrowth of the shrub was pushed aside a small stone slab black and dirty was disclosed and this hewitt lifted uncovering a square hole six or eight inches across from the foreside of which the stand pipe rose illustration the stand pipe in the nursery garden the row went cheerily on over by the hedge and neither trennatt nor his neighbour saw hewitt feeling with his hand discover two stop cocks and a branch pipe in the hole nor saw him try them both hewitt however was satisfied and saw his case plain he rose and made his way back toward the small gate he was scarce half way there when the straining of the hedge ceased and before he reached it the last insult had been hurled the quarrel ceased and trennatt approached hewitt immediately turned his back to the gate and looking about him inquiringly hemmed aloud as though to attract attention the nurseryman promptly burst round a corner crying whos that whos that eh what dye want eh why answered hewitt in a tone of mild surprise is it so uncommon to have a customer drop in id ha sworn that gate was fastened the old man said looking about him suspiciously that would have been rash i had no difficulty in opening it come cant you sell me a button hole the old man led the way to a greenhouse but as he went he growled again id ha sworn i shut that gate perhaps you forgot hewitt suggested you have had a little excitement with your neighbour havent you trennatt stopped and turned round darting a keen glance into hewitts face yes he answered angrily i have hes an old villain hed like to turn me out of here after being here all my life and a lot o good the ground ud be to him if he kep it like he keeps his own and look there he dragged hewitt toward the trespassers boards goes and sticks up a board like that looking over my hedge as though i wanted to go over among his weeds so i stuck up another in front of it and now they can stare each other out o countenance buttonhole you said sir eh the old man saw hewitt off the premises with great care and the latter flower in coat made straight for the nearest post office and despatched a telegram then he stood for some little while outside the post office deep in thought and in the end returned to the gate of the house above the nursery with much circumspection he opened the gate and entered the grounds but instead of approaching the house he turned immediately to the left behind trees and shrubs making for the side nearest the nursery soon he reached a long low wooden shed the door was only secured by a button and turning this he gazed into the dark interior now he had not noticed that close after him a woman had entered the gate and that that woman was mrs geldard she would have made for the house but catching sight of hewitt followed him swiftly and quietly over the long grass thus it came to pass that his first apprisal of the ladys presence was a sharp drive in the back which pitched him down the step to the low floor of what he had just perceived to be merely a tool house after which the door was shut and buttoned behind him illustration his first apprisal of the ladys presence was a sharp drive in the back perhaps youll be more careful in future came mrs geldards angry voice from without how you go making mischief between husband and wife and poking your nose into peoples affairs such fellows as you ought to be well punished hewitt laughed softly mrs geldard had evidently changed her mind the door presented no difficulty a fairly vigorous push dislodged the button entirely and he walked back to the outer gate chuckling quietly in the distance he heard mrs geldard in shrill altercation with the deaf old woman its no good you a talking the old woman was saying i cant hear nobody aint allowed in this here place so you must get out out you go now outside the gate hewitt met me iii my own adventures had been simple i had secured a back seat on the roof of the omnibus whereon emma trennatt travelled south from the bank from which i could easily observe where she alighted when she did so i followed and found to my astonishment that her destination was no other than the geldards private house at camberwell as i remembered from the address on the visitors slip which mrs geldard had handed in at hewitts office a couple of days before she handed a letter to the maid who opened the door and soon after in response to a message by the same maid entered the house presently the maid reappeared bonneted and hurried off to return in a few minutes in a cab with another following behind almost immediately mrs geldard emerged in company with emma trennatt she hurried the girl into one of the cabs and i heard her repeat loudly twice the address of hewitts office once to the girl and once to the cabman now it seemed plain to me that to follow emma trennatt farther would be waste of time for she was off to hewitts office where kerrett would learn her message and knowing where a message would find hewitt sooner than at his office i judged it well to tell mrs geldard of the fact i approached therefore as she was entering the other cab and began to explain when she cut me short you go and tell your master to attend to his own business as soon as he pleases for not a shilling does he get from me he ought to be ashamed of himself sowing dissension between man and wife for the sake of what he can make out of it and so ought you i bowed with what grace i might and retired the other cab had gone so i set forth to find one for myself at the nearest rank i could think of nothing better to do than to make for crouch end police station and endeavour to find hewitt soon after my cab emerged north of the city i became conscious of another cab whose driver i fancied i recognised and which kept ahead all along the route in fact it was mrs geldards cab and presently it dawned upon me that we must both be bound for the same place when it became quite clear that crouch end was the destination of the lady i instructed my driver to disregard the police station and follow the cab in front thus i arrived at mr fullers house just behind mrs geldard and thus waiting at the gate i met hewitt as he emerged hullo brett he said condole with me mrs geldard has changed her mind and considers me a pernicious creature anxious to make mischief between her and her husband im very much afraid i shant get my fee no i answered she told me you wouldnt we compared notes and hewitt laughed heartily the appearance of emma trennatt at geldards office this morning is explained he said she went first with a message from geldard to mrs geldard at camberwell explaining his absence and imploring her not to talk of it or make a disturbance mrs geldard had gone off to town and emma trennatt was told that she had gone to geldards office there she went and then we first saw her she found nobody at the office and after a minute or two of irresolution returned to camberwell and then succeeded in delivering her message as you saw mrs geldard is apparently satisfied with her husbands explanation but im afraid the revenue officers wont approve of it the revenue officers yes its a case of illicit distilling and a big case i fancy ive wired to somerset house and no doubt men are on their way here now but mrs geldards up at the house so wed better hurry up to the police station and have a few sent from there come along the whole things very clever and a most uncommonly big thing if i know all about it and i think i do geldard and his partners have been turning out untaxed spirit by the hundred gallons for a long time past geldard is the practical man the engineer and probably erected the whole apparatus himself in that house on the hill the spirit is brought down by a pipe laid a very little way under the garden surface and carried into one of the irrigation stand pipes in the nursery ground theres a quiet little hole behind the pipe with a couple of stop cocks one to shut off the water when necessary the other to do the same with the spirit when the stopcocks are right you just turn the tap at the top of the pipe and you get water or whisky as the case may be fuller the man up at the house attends to the still with such assistance as the deaf old woman can give him trennatt down below draws off the liquor ready to be carried away these two keep up an ostentatious appearance of being at unending feud to blind suspicion our as yet ungreeted friend geldard guiding spirit of the whole thing comes disguised as a carter with an apparent cart load of linoleum and carries away the manufactured stuff in the pleasing language of geldard and co smoke as alluded to in the note you saw means whisky something has been wrong with the apparatus lately and it has been leaking badly geldard has been at work on it patching but ineffectually what you did was no good said the charming emma in the note as you will remember uncle was anxious and justifiably so because not only does a leak of spirit mean a waste but it means a smell which some sharp revenue man might sniff moreover if there is a leak the liquid runs somewhere at random and with any sudden increase in volume attention might easily be attracted it was so bad that f fuller thought geldard must light another pipe start another still or give up smoking distilling for a bit there is the explanation of the note to morrow to carry probably means that he is to call with his cart the cart in whose society geldard becomes cookson to remove a quantity of spirit he is not to come late because people are expected on floral business the crosses i think will be found to indicate the amount of liquid to be moved but that we shall see anyhow geldard got there yesterday and had a busy day loading up and then set to repairing the damage was worse than supposed and an urgent thing result geldard works into early morning has a sleep in the place where he may be called at any moment and starts again early this morning new parts have to be ordered and these are delivered at trennatts to day and passed through the hedge meantime geldard sends a message to his wife explaining things and the result youve seen at the police station a telegram had already been received from somerset house that was enough for hewitt who had discharged his duty as a citizen and now dropped the case we left the police and the revenue officers to deal with the matter and travelled back to town yes said hewitt on the way after each had fully described his days experiences it seemed pretty plain that geldard left his office by the back way in disguise and there were things that hinted what that disguise was the pipes were noticeable they were quite unnecessarily dirty and partly from dirty fingers pipes smoked by a man in his office would never look like that they had been smoked out of doors by a man with dirty hands and hands and pipes would be in keeping with the rest of the mans appearance it was noticeable that he had left not only his clothes and hat but his boots behind him they were quite plain though good boots and would be quite in keeping with any dress but that of a labourer or some such man in his working clothes moreover the partly smoked cigars were probably thrown aside because they would appear inconsistent with geldards changed dress the contents of the pockets in the clothes left behind too told the same tale the cheap watch and the necessary keys pocketbook and pocket knife were taken but the articles of luxury the russia leather card case the sovereign purse and so on were left then we came on the receipts for stable rent suggestion perhaps the disguise was that of a carter then there was the coach house plainly if geldard took the trouble thus to disguise himself and thus to hide his occupation even from his wife he had some very good reason for secrecy now the goods which a man would be likely to carry secretly in a cart or van as a regular piece of business would probably be either stolen or smuggled when i examined those pieces of linoleum i became convinced that they were intended merely as receptacles for some other sort of article altogether they were old and had evidently been thus rolled for a very long period they appeared to have been exposed to weather but on the outside only moreover they were all of one size and shape each forming a long hollow cylinder with plenty of interior room now from this it was plainly unlikely that they were intended to hold stolen goods stolen goods are not apt to be always of one size and shape adaptable to a cylindrical recess perhaps they were smuggled now the only goods profitable to be smuggled nowadays are tobacco and spirits and plainly these rolls of linoleum would be excellent receptacles for either tobacco could be packed inside the rolls and the ends stopped artistically with narrow rolls of linoleum spirits could be contained in metal cylinders exactly fitting the cavity and the ends filled in the same way as for tobacco but for tobacco a smart man would probably make his linoleum rolls of different sizes for the sake of a more innocent appearance while for spirits it would be a convenience to have vessels of uniform measure to save trouble in quicker delivery and calculation of quantity bearing these things in mind i went in search of the gentle nurseryman at crouch end my general survey of the nursery ground and the house behind it inspired me with the notion that the situation and arrangement were most admirably adapted for the working of a large illicit still a form of misdemeanour let me tell you that is much more common nowadays than is generally supposed i remembered geldards engineering experience and i heard something of the odd manners of mr fuller my theory of a traffic in untaxed spirits became strengthened but why a nursery was this a mere accident of the design there were commonly irrigation pipes about nurseries and an extra one might easily be made to carry whisky with this in mind i visited the nursery with the result you know of the stand pipe i tested which was where i expected handy to the vehicle entrance could produce simple new river water or raw whisky at command of one of two stop cocks my duty was plain as you know i am a citizen first and an investigator after and i find the advantage of it in my frequent intercourse with the police and other authorities as soon as i could get away i telegraphed to somerset house but then i grew perplexed on a point of conduct i was commissioned by mrs geldard it scarcely seemed the loyal thing to put my clients husband in gaol because of what i had learnt in course of work on her behalf i decided to give him and nobody else a sporting chance if i could possibly get at him in the time at my disposal by himself so that no accomplice should get the benefit of my warning i would give him a plain hint to run then he could take his chance i returned to the place and began to work round the grounds examining the place as i went but at the very first outhouse i put my head into i was surprised in the rear by mrs geldard coming in hot haste to stop me and rescue her husband she most unmistakably gave me the sack and so now the police may catch geldard or not as their luck may be they did catch him in the next days papers a report of a great capture of illicit distillers occupied a prominent place the prisoners were james fuller henry matthew trennatt sarah blatten a deaf woman samuel geldard and his wife rebecca geldard the two women were found on the premises in violent altercation when the officers arrived a few minutes after hewitt and i had left the police station on our way home it was considered by far the greatest haul for the revenue authorities since the seizure of the famous ships boiler on a wagon in the east end stuffed full of tobacco after that same ships boiler had made about a dozen voyages to the continent and back for repair geldard was found dressed as a workman carrying out extensive alterations and repairs to the still and a light van was found in a shed belonging to the nursery loaded with seventeen rolls of linoleum each enclosing a cylinder containing two gallons of spirits and packed at each end with narrow linoleum rolls it will be remembered that seventeen was the number of crosses at the foot of emma trennatts note illustration the prisoners the subsequent raids on a number of obscure public houses in different parts of london in consequence of information gathered on the occasion of the geldard capture resulted in the seizure of a large quantity of secreted spirit for which no permit could be shown it demonstrated also the extent of geldards connection and indicated plainly what was done with the spirit when he had carted it away from crouch end some of the public houses in question must have acquired a notoriety among the neighbours for frequent purchases of linoleum the case of the late mr rewse i of this case i personally saw nothing beyond the first advent in hewitts office of mr horace bowyer who put the case in his hands and then i merely saw mr bowyers back as i passed downstairs from my rooms but i noted the case in full detail after hewitts return from ireland as it seemed to me one not entirely without interest if only as an exemplar of the fatal ease with which a man may unwittingly dig a pit for his own feet a pit from which there is no climbing out a few moments after i had seen the stranger disappear into hewitts office kerrett brought to hewitt in his inner room a visitors slip announcing the arrival on urgent business of mr horace bowyer that the visitor was in a hurry was plain from a hasty rattling of the closed wicket in the outer room where mr bowyer was evidently making impatient attempts to follow his announcement in person hewitt showed himself at the door and invited mr bowyer to enter which he did as soon as kerrett had released the wicket with much impetuosity he was a stout florid gentleman with a loud voice and a large stare mr hewitt he said i must claim your immediate attention to a business of the utmost gravity will you please consider yourself commissioned wholly regardless of expense to set aside whatever you may have in hand and devote yourself to the case i shall put in your hands certainly not hewitt replied with a slight smile what i have in hand are matters which i have engaged to attend to and no mere compensation for loss of fees could persuade me to leave my clients in the lurch else what would prevent some other gentleman coming here to morrow with a bigger fee than yours and bribing me away from you but this this is a most serious thing mr hewitt a matter of life or death it is indeed quite so hewitt replied but there are a thousand such matters at this moment pending of which you and i know nothing and there are also two or three more of which you know nothing but on which i am at work so that it becomes a question of practicability if you will tell me your business i can judge whether or not i may be able to accept your commission concurrently with those i have in hand some operations take months of constant attention some can be conducted intermittently others still are a mere matter of a few days many of hours simply i will tell you then mr bowyer replied in the first place will you have the kindness to read that it is a cutting from the standards column of news from the provinces of two days ago hewitt took the cutting and read as follows the epidemic of small pox in county mayo ireland shows few signs of abating the spread of the disease has been very remarkable considering the widely scattered nature of the population though there can be no doubt that the market towns are the centres of infection and that it is from these that the germs of contagion are carried into the country by people from all parts who resort thither on market days in many cases the disease has assumed a particularly malignant form and deaths have been very rapid and numerous the comparatively few medical men available are sadly overworked owing largely to the distances separating their different patients among those who have succumbed within the last few days is mr algernon rewse a young english gentleman who has been staying with a friend at a cottage a few miles from cullanin on a fishing excursion illustration algernon rewse hewitt placed the cutting on the table at his side yes he said inquiringly it is to mr algernon rewses death you wish to draw my attention it is mr bowyer answered and the reason i come to you is that i very much suspect more than suspect indeed that mr algernon rewse has not died by small pox but has been murdered murdered cold bloodedly and for the most sordid motives by the friend who has been sharing his holiday in what way do you suppose him to have been murdered that i cannot say that indeed i want you to find out among other things chiefly perhaps the murderer himself who has made off and your own status in the matter queried hewitt is that of i am trustee under a will by which mr rewse would have benefited considerably had he lived but a month or two longer that circumstance indeed lies rather near the root of the matter the thing stood thus under the will i speak of that of young rewses uncle a very old friend of mine in his lifetime the money lay in trust till the young fellow should attain twenty five years of age his younger sister miss mary rewse was also benefited but to a much smaller extent she was to come into her property also on attaining the age of twenty five or on her marriage whichever event happened first it was further provided that in case either of these young people died before coming into the inheritance his or her share should go to the survivor i want you particularly to remember this you will observe that now in consequence of young algernon rewses death barely two months before his twenty fifth birthday the whole of the very large property all personalty and free from any tie or restriction which would otherwise have been his will in the regular course pass on her twenty fifth birthday or on her marriage to miss mary rewse whose own legacy was comparatively trifling you will understand the importance of this when i tell you that the man whom i suspect of causing algernon rewses death and who has been his companion on his otherwise lonely holiday is engaged to be married to miss rewse mr bowyer paused at this but hewitt only raised his eyebrows and nodded i have never particularly liked the man mr bowyer went on he never seemed to have much to say for himself i like a man who holds up his head and opens his mouth i dont believe in the sort of modesty that he showed so much of it isnt genuine a man cant afford to be genuinely meek and retiring who has his way to make in the world and he was clever enough to know that he is poor then hewitt asked oh yes poor enough his name by the bye is main stanley main and he is a medical man he hasnt been practising except as assistant since he became qualified the reason being i understand that he couldnt afford to buy a good practice he is the person who will profit by young rewses death or at any rate who intended to but we will see about that as for mary poor girl she wouldnt have lost her brother for fifty fortunes as to the circumstances of the death now yes yes i am coming to that young algernon rewse you must know had rather run down in health and main persuaded him that he wanted a change i dont know what it was altogether but rewse seemed to have been having his own little love troubles and that sort of thing you know hed been engaged i think or very nearly so and the young lady died and so on well as i said he had run down and got into low health and spirits and no doubt a change of some sort would have done him good this stanley main always seemed to have a great influence over the poor boy he was about four or five years older than rewse and somehow he persuaded him to go away the two together to some outlandish wilderness of a place in the west of ireland for salmon fishing it seemed to me at the time rather a ridiculous sort of place to go to but main had his way and they went there was a cottage rather a good sort of cottage i believe for the district which some friend of mains once a landowner in the district had put up as a convenient box for salmon fishing and they rented it not long after they got there this epidemic of small pox got about in the district though that i believe has had little to do with poor young rewses death all appeared to go well until a day over a week ago when mrs rewse received this letter from main mr bowyer handed martin hewitt a letter written in an irregular and broken hand as though of a person writing under stress of extreme agitation it ran thus my dear mrs rewse you will probably have heard through the newspapers indeed i think algernon has told you in his letters that a very bad epidemic of small pox is abroad in this district i am deeply grieved to have to tell you that algernon himself has taken the disease in a rather bad form he showed the first symptoms to day tuesday and he is now in bed in the cottage it is fortunate that i as a medical man happen to be on the spot as the nearest local doctor is five miles off at cullanin and he is working and travelling night and day as it is i have my little medicine chest with me and can get whatever else is necessary from cullanin so that everything is being done for algernon that is possible and i hope to bring him up to scratch in good health soon though of course the disease is a dangerous one pray dont unnecessarily alarm yourself and dont think about coming over here or anything of that sort you can do no good and will only run risk yourself i will take care to let you know how things go on so please dont attempt to come the journey is long and would be very trying to you and you would have no place to stay at nearer than cullanin which is quite a centre of infection i will write again to morrow yours most sincerely stanley main not only did the handwriting of this letter show signs of agitation but here and there words had been repeated and sometimes a letter had been omitted hewitt placed the letter on the table by the newspaper cutting and mr bowyer proceeded another letter followed on the next day he said handing it to hewitt as he spoke a short one as you see not written with quite such signs of agitation it merely says that rewse is very bad and repeats the former entreaties that his mother will not think of going to him hewitt glanced at the letter and placed it with the other while mr bowyer continued notwithstanding mains persistent anxiety that she should stay at home mrs rewse who was of course terribly worried about her only son had almost made up her mind in spite of her very delicate health to start for ireland when she received a third letter announcing algernons death here it is it is certainly the sort of letter that one might expect to be written in such circumstances and yet there seems to me at least a certain air of disingenuousness about the wording there are as you see the usual condolences and so forth the disease was of the malignant type it says which is terribly rapid in its action often carrying off the patient even before the eruption has time to form then and this is a thing i wish you especially to note there is once more a repetition of his desire that neither the young mans mother nor his sister shall come to ireland the funeral must take place immediately he says under arrangements made by the local authorities and before they could reach the spot now doesnt this obtrusive anxiety of his that no connection of young rewses should be near him during his illness nor even at the funeral strike you as rather singular well possibly it is though it may easily be nothing but zeal for the health of mrs rewse and her daughter as a matter of fact what main says is very plausible they could do no sort of good in the circumstances and might easily run into danger themselves to say nothing of the fatigue of the journey and general nervous upset mrs rewse is in weak health i think you said yes shes almost an invalid in fact she is subject to heart disease but tell me now as an entirely impartial observer doesnt it seem to you that there is a very forced unreal sort of tone in all these letters perhaps one may notice something of the sort but fifty things may cause that the case from the beginning may have been worse than he made it out what ensued on the receipt of this letter mrs rewse was prostrated of course her daughter communicated with me as a friend of the family and that is how i heard of the whole thing for the first time i saw the letters and it seemed to me looking at all the circumstances of the case that somebody at least ought to go over and make certain that everything was as it should be here was this poor young man staying in a lonely cottage with the only man in the world who had any reason to desire his death or any profit to gain by it and he had a very great inducement indeed moreover he was a medical man carrying his medicine chest with him remember as he says himself in his letter in this situation rewse suddenly dies with nobody about him so far as there is anything to show but main himself as his medical attendant it would be main who would certify and register the death and no matter what foul play might have taken place he would be safe as long as nobody was on the spot to make searching inquiries might easily escape even then in fact when one man is likely to profit much by the death of another a doctors medicine chest is likely to supply but too easy a means to his end did you say anything of your suspicions to the ladies well well i hinted perhaps no more than hinted you know but they wouldnt hear of it got indignant and took on as people call it worse than ever so that i had to smooth them over but since it seemed somebodys duty to see into the matter a little more closely and there seemed to be nobody to do it but myself i started off that very evening by the night mail i was in dublin early the next morning and spent that day getting across ireland the nearest station was ten miles from cullanin and that as you remember was five miles from the cottage so that i drove over on the morning of the following day i must say main appeared very much taken aback at seeing me his manner was nervous and apprehensive and made me more suspicious than ever the body had been buried of course a couple of days or more i asked a few rather searching questions about the illness and so forth and his answers became positively confused he had burned the clothes that rewse was wearing at the time the disease first showed itself he said as well as all the bedclothes since there was no really efficient means of disinfection at hand his story in the main was that he had gone off to cullanin one morning on foot to see about a top joint of a fishing rod that was to be repaired when he returned early in the afternoon he found algernon rewse sickening of small pox at once put him to bed and there nursed him till he died i wanted to know of course why no other medical man had been called in he said that there was only one available and it was doubtful if he could have been got at even a days notice so overworked was he moreover he said this man with his hurry and over strain could never have given the patient such efficient attention as he himself who had nothing else to do after a while i put it to him plainly that it would at any rate have been more prudent to have had the body at least inspected by some independent doctor considering the fact that he was likely to profit so largely by young rewses death and i suggested that with an exhumation order it might not be too late now as a matter of justice to himself the effect of that convinced me the man gasped and turned blue with terror it was a full minute i should think before he could collect himself sufficiently to attempt to dissuade me from doing what i had hinted at he did so as soon as he could by every argument he could think of entreated me in fact almost desperately that decided me i said that after what he had said and particularly in view of his whole manner and bearing i should insist by every means in my power on having the body properly examined and i went off at once to cullanin to set the telegraph going and see whatever local authority might be proper when i returned in the afternoon stanley main had packed his bag and vanished and i have not heard nor seen anything of him since i stayed in the neighbourhood that day and the next and left for london in the evening by the help of my solicitors proper representations were made at the home office and especially in view of mains flight a prompt order was made for exhumation and medical examination preliminary to an inquest i am expecting to hear that the disinterment has been effected to day what i want you to do of course is chiefly to find main the irish constabulary in that district are fine big men and no doubt most excellent in quelling a faction fight or shutting up a shebeen but i doubt their efficiency in anything requiring much more finesse perhaps also you may be able to find out something of the means by which the murder it is plain it is one was committed it is quite possible that main may have adopted some means to give the body the appearance even to a medical man of death from small pox that hewitt said is scarcely likely else indeed why did he not take care that another doctor should see the body before the burial that would have secured him but that is not a thing one can deceive a doctor over of course in the circumstances exhumation is desirable but if the case is one of small pox i dont envy the medical man who is to examine at any rate the business is i should imagine not likely to be a very long one and i can take it in hand at once i will leave to night for ireland by the train from euston very good i shall go over myself of course if anything comes to my knowledge in the meanwhile of course ill let you know an hour or two after this a cab stopped at the door and a young lady dressed in black sent in her name and a minute later was shown into hewitts room it was miss mary rewse she wore a heavy veil and all she said she uttered in evidently deep distress of mind hewitt did what he could to calm her and waited patiently at length she said i felt that i must come to you mr hewitt and yet now that i am here i dont know what to say is it the fact that mr bowyer has commissioned you to investigate the circumstances of my poor brothers death and to discover the whereabouts of mr main yes miss rewse that is the fact can you tell me anything that will help me no no mr hewitt i fear not but it is such a dreadful thing and mr bowyer is im afraid he is so much prejudiced against mr main that i felt i ought to do something to say something at least to prevent you entering on the case with your mind made up that he has been guilty of such an awful thing he is really quite incapable of it i assure you pray miss rewse hewitt replied dont allow that apprehension to disturb you if mr main is as you say incapable of such an act as perhaps he is suspected of you may rest assured no harm will come to him so far as i am concerned at any rate i enter the case with a perfectly open mind a man in my profession who accepted prejudices at the beginning of a case would have very poor results to show indeed as yet i have no opinion no theory no prejudice nothing indeed but a bare outline of facts i shall derive no opinion and no theory from anything but a consideration of the actual circumstances and evidences on the spot i quite understand the relation in which mr main stands in regard to yourself and your family have you heard from him lately not since the letter informing us of my brothers death before then miss rewse hesitated yes she said we corresponded but but there was really nothing the letters were of a personal and private sort they were yes yes of course hewitt answered with his eyes fixed keenly on the veil which miss rewse still kept down of course i understand that then there is nothing else you can tell me no i fear not i can only implore you to remember that no matter what you may see and hear no matter what the evidence may be i am sure sure sure that poor stanley could never do such a thing and miss rewse buried her face in her hands hewitt kept his eyes on the lady though he smiled slightly and asked how long have you known mr main illustration how long have you known mr main for some five or six years now my poor brother knew him at school though of course they were in different forms mr main being the elder were they always on good terms they were always like brothers little more was said hewitt condoled with miss rewse as well as he might and she presently took her departure even as she descended the stairs a messenger came with a short note from mr bowyer enclosing a telegram just received from cullanin the telegram ran thus body exhumed death from shot wound no trace of small pox nothing yet heard of main have communicated with coroner oreilly ii hewitt and mr bowyer travelled towards mayo together mr bowyer restless and loquacious on the subject of the business in hand and hewitt rather bored thereby he resolutely declined to offer an opinion on any single detail of the case till he had examined the available evidence and his occasional remarks on matters of general interest the scenery and so forth struck his companion unused to business of the sort which had occasioned the journey as strangely cold blooded and indifferent telegrams had been sent ordering that no disarrangement of the contents of the cottage was to be allowed pending their arrival and hewitt well knew that nothing more was practicable till the site was reached at ballymaine where the train was left at last they stayed for the night and left early the next morning for cullanin where a meeting with dr oreilly at the mortuary had been appointed there the body lay stripped of its shroud calm and gray and beginning to grow ugly with a scarcely noticeable breach in the flesh of the left breast the wound has been thoroughly cleansed closed and stopped with a carbolic plug before interment dr oreilly said he was a middle aged grizzled man with a face whereon many recent sleepless nights had left their traces i have not thought it necessary to do anything in the way of dissection the bullet is not present it has passed clean through the body between the ribs both back and front piercing the heart on its way the death must have been instantaneous hewitt quickly examined the two wounds back and front as the doctor turned the body over and then asked perhaps dr oreilly you have had some experience of a gunshot wound before this the doctor smiled grimly i think so he answered with just enough of brogue in his words to hint his nationality and no more i was an army surgeon for a good many years before i came to cullanin and saw service in ashanti and in india come then hewitt said youre an expert would it have been possible for the shot to have been fired from behind oh no see the bullet entering makes a wound of quite a different character from that of the bullet leaving have you any idea of the weapon used a large revolver i should think perhaps of the regulation size that is i should judge the bullet to have been a conical one of about the size fitted to such a weapon smaller than that from a rifle can you form an idea of from what distance the shot was fired dr oreilly shook his head the clothes have all been burned he said and the wound has been washed otherwise one might have looked for powder blackening did you know either the dead man or dr main personally only very slightly i may say i saw just such a pistol as might cause that sort of wound in mains hands the day before he gave out that rewse had been attacked by small pox i drove past the cottage as he stood in the doorway with it in his hand he had the breach opened and seemed to be either loading or unloading it which it was i couldnt say very good doctor that may be important now is there any single circumstance incident or conjecture that you can tell me of in regard to this case that you have not already mentioned doctor oreilly thought for a moment and replied in the negative i heard of course he said of the reported new case of small pox and that main had taken the case in hand himself i was indeed relieved to hear it for i had already more on my hands than one man can safely be expected to attend to the cottage was fairly isolated and there could have been nothing gained by removal to an asylum indeed there was practically no accommodation so far as i can make out nobody seems to have seen young rewse alive or dead after main had announced that he had the small pox he seems to have done everything himself laying out the body and all and you may be pretty sure that none of the strangers about was particularly anxious to have anything to do with it the undertaker there is only one here and he is down with the small pox himself now was as much overworked as i was myself and was glad enough to send off a coffin by a market cart and leave the laying out and screwing down to main since he had got those orders main made out the death certificate himself and since he was trebly qualified everything seemed in order the certificate merely attributed the death to small pox i take it with no qualifying remarks small pox simply hewitt and mr bowyer bade dr oreilly good morning and their car was turned in the direction of the cottage where algernon rewse had met his death at the town hall in the market place however hewitt stopped the car and set his watch by the public clock this is more than half an hour before london time he said and we mustnt be at odds with the natives about the time as he spoke dr oreilly came running up breathlessly ive just heard something he said three men heard a shot in the cottage as they were passing last tuesday week where are the men i dont know at the moment but they can be found shall i set about it if you possibly can hewitt said you will help us enormously can you send them messages to be at the cottage as soon as they can get there to day tell them they shall have half a sovereign apiece right i will good day tuesday week said mr bowyer as they drove off that was the date of mains first letter and the day on which by his account rewse was taken ill then if that was the shot that killed rewse he must have been lying dead in the place while main was writing those letters reporting his sickness to his mother the cold blooded scoundrel yes hewitt replied i think it probable in any case that tuesday was the day that rewse was shot it wouldnt have been safe for main to write the mother lying letters about the small pox before rewse might have written home in the meantime or something might have occurred to postpone mains plans and then there would be impossible explanations required over a very bad road they jolted on and in the end arrived where the road now become a mere path passed a tumble down old farmhouse this is where the woman lives who cooked and cleaned house for rewse and main mr bowyer said there is the cottage scarce a hundred yards off a little to the right of the track well replied hewitt suppose we stop here and ask her a few questions i like to get the evidence of all the witnesses as soon as possible it simplifies subsequent work wonderfully they alighted and mr bowyer roared through the open door and tapped with his stick in reply to his summons a decent looking woman of perhaps fifty but wrinkled beyond her age and better dressed than any woman hewitt had seen since leaving cullanin appeared from the hinder buildings and curtsied pleasantly good morning mrs hurley good morning mr bowyer said this is mr martin hewitt a gentleman from london who is going to look into this shocking murder of our young friend mr rewse and sift it to the bottom he would like you to tell him something mrs hurley the woman curtsied again an its the jintleman is welcome sor sad doins as ut is she had a low pleasing voice much in contrast with her unattractive appearance and characterised by the softest and broadest brogue imaginable will ye not come in mother av hiven an thim two livin together an fishin an readin an all like brothers an trut ut is he was a foine young jintleman indade indade i suppose mrs hurley hewitt said youve seen as much of the life of those two gentlemen here as anybody true ut is sor none more nor as much did you ever hear of anybody being on bad terms with mr rewse anybody at all mr main or another niver a soul in all mayo how could ye such a foine young jintleman an fair spoken an all tell me all that happened on the day that you heard that mr rewse was ill tuesday week in the mornin sor twas much as ordnary i was over there at half afther sivin an twas half an hour afther that i cud hear the jintlemen dhressin they tuk their breakfast though mr rewses was a small wan it was half afther nine that mr main wint off walkin to cullanin mr rewse stayin in havin letthers to write half an hour later i came away mesilf later than that it was nigh elivin i wint across for a pail from the yard an then through the windy as i passed i saw the dear young jintleman sittin writin at the table calm an peaceful an saw him no more in this warrl and after that afther that sor i came back wid the pail an saw nor heard no more till two oclock whin mr main came back from cullanin did you see him as he came back that i did sor as i stud there nailin the fence where the pig bruk ut id been there an had me oi down the road lookin for him an hour past expectin he might be bringin somethin for me to cook for their dinner an more by token he gave me the toime from his watch set by the town hall clock and was it two oclock it was that to the sthroke an me own ould clock was right too whin i wint to set ut an one moment may i see your clock mrs hurley turned and shut an open door which had concealed an old hanging clock hewitt produced his watch and compared the time still right i see mrs hurley he said your clock keeps excellent time illustration mrs hurley he said your clock keeps excellent time it does that sor an nivir more than claned twice by rafferty since me own father rest his soul lift ut here tis no bad clock as mr rewse himsilf said oft an again an i always kape ut by the town hall toime but as i was sayin mr main came back an gave me the toime thin he wint sthraight to his house an no more av him i saw till may be half afther three and then an thin sor he came across in a sad takin wid a letther take ut sez he an have ut posted at cullanin by the first that can get there mr rewse has the sickness on him awful bad he sez an ye must not be near the place or yell take ut i have him to bed an his clothes i shall burn behin the cottage sez he so if ye see smoke yell know what ut is therell be no docthor wanted im wan mesilf an ill do all for um an sure i knew him for a docthor ivir since he come the cottage ye shall not come near he sez till uts over one way or another an yez can lave whativir av food an dhrink we want mid betwixt the houses an go back an ill come and fetch ut but have the letther posted he sez at wanst tis not contagious he sez bein as ive dishinfected it mesilf but kape yez away from the cottage an i kept and then did he go back to the cottage at once he

letther an wan for the undhertaker too for he tells me its all over an hes dead an they buried him next day followin illustration he laves another letther wid the dirthy plates an shouts for ut to be posted so that from the time you went for the pail and saw mr rewse writing till after the funeral you were never at the cottage at all nivir sor an can ye blame me wid children an terence himself sick wid bronchitis in this house of course of course you did quite right indeed you only obeyed orders but now think do you remember on any one of those three days hearing a shot or any other unusual noise in the cottage nivir at all sor tis that ive been thryin to bring to mind these four days such may have been but not that i heard after you went for the pail and before mr main returned to the house did mr rewse leave the cottage at all or might he have done so he did not lave at all to my knowledge sure he might have gone an he might have come back widout my knowin but see him i did not thank you mrs hurley i think well go across to the cottage now if any people come will you send them after us i suppose a policeman is there he is sor an the serjint is not far away theyve been in chyarge since mr bowyer wint away last but shlapin here hewitt and mr bowyer walked towards the cottage did you notice said mr bowyer that the woman saw rewse writing letters now what were those letters and where are they he has no correspondents that i know of but his mother and sister and they heard nothing from him is this something else some other plot there is something very deep here yes hewitt replied thoughtfully i think our inquiries may take us deeper than we have expected and in the matter of those letters yes i think they may lie near the kernel of the mystery here they arrived at the cottage an uncommonly substantial structure for the district it was square of plain solid brick with a slated roof on the patch of ground behind it there were still signs of the fires wherein main had burnt rewses clothes and other belongings and sitting on the window sill in front was a big member of the ric soldierly and broad who rose as they came and saluted mr bowyer good day constable mr bowyer said i hope nothing has been disturbed not a shtick sor nobodys as much as gone in have any of the windows been opened or shut hewitt asked this wan was sor the policeman said indicating the one behind him when they took away the corrpse an so was the next round the corrner tis the bedroom windies they are an they opened thim to give ut a bit av air the other windy behin sittin room windy has not been opened very well hewitt answered well take a look at that unopened window from the inside the door was opened and they passed inside there was a small lobby and on the left of this was the bedroom with two single beds the only other room of consequence was the sitting room the cottage consisting merely of these a small scullery and a narrow closet used as a bath room wedged between the bedroom and the sitting room they made for the single window of the sitting room at the back it was an ordinary sash window and was shut but the catch was not fastened hewitt examined the catch drawing mr bowyers attention to a bright scratch on the grimy brass see he said that nick in the catch exactly corresponds with the narrow space between the two frames of the window and look he lifted the bottom sash a little as he spoke there is the mark of a knife on the frame of the top sash somebody has come in by that window forcing the catch with a knife yes yes cried mr bowyer greatly excited and he has gone out that way too else why is the window shut and the catch not fastened why should he do that what in the world does this thing mean before hewitt could reply the constable put his head into the room and announced that one larry shanahan was at the door and had been promised half a sovereign one of the men who heard a shot hewitt said to mr bowyer bring him in constable the constable brought in larry shanahan and larry shanahan brought in a strong smell of whisky he was an extremely ragged person with only one eye which caused him to hold his head aside as he regarded hewitt much as a parrot does on his face sun scorched brown and fiery red struggled for mastery and his voice was none of the clearest he held his hat against his stomach with one hand and with the other pulled his forelock an which is the honourable jintleman he said as do be burrnin to prisint me wid a bit o goold here i am said hewitt jingling money in his pocket and here is the half sovereign its only waiting where it is till you have answered a few questions they say you heard a shot fired hereabout faith an that i did sor twas a shot in this house indade no other and when was it sure twas in the afthernoon but on what day last tuesday sivin noight sor as i know by rayson av ballyshiel fair that i wint to tell me all about it i will sor twas pigs i was dhrivin that day sor to ballyshiel fair from just beyond cullanin at cullanin sor i dhropped in wid danny mulcahy that intintioned thravellin the same way an while we tuk a thrifle av a dhrink in comes dennis grady that was to go to ballyshiel similarously an so we had another thrifle av a dhrink or maybe a thrifle more an we wint togedther passin this way sor as ye may not know bein likely a shtranger well sor ut was as we were just forninst this place that there came a divil av a bang that makes us shtop simultaneous whats that sez dan tis a gunshot sez i an tis in the brick house too that is so sez dennis nowhere else and we lukt at wan another an whatll we do sez i what would yez sez dan tis none av our business that is so sez dennis again and we wint on ut was quare maybe but it might aisily be wan av the jintlemen emptyin a barrl out o windy or what not an an so an so mr shanahan scratched his ear an so we wint and do you know at what time this was larry shanahan ceased scratching and seized his ear between thumb and forefinger gazing severely at the floor with his one eye as he did so plunged in computation sure he said twould be twould be lets see twould be he looked up twould be half past two maybe or maybe a thrifle nearer three and main was in the place all the time after two mr bowyer said bringing down his fist on his open hand that finishes it weve nailed him to the minute had you a watch with you asked hewitt divil of a watch in the company sor i made an internal calculation tis foive mile from cullanin and we never lift till near half an hour after the town hall clock had struck twelve twould take us two hours and a thrifle more considherin the pigs an the rough road an the distance an an the thrifle of dhrink his eye rolled slyly as he said it that was my calculation sor here the constable appeared with two more men each had the usual number of eyes but in other respects they were very good copies of mr shanahan they were both ragged and neither bore any violent likeness to a teetotaler dan mulcahy and dennis grady announced the constable mr dan mulcahys tale was of a piece with mr larry shanahans and mr dennis gradys was the same they had all heard the shot it was plain what dan had said to dennis and what dennis had said to larry mattered little also they were all agreed that the day was tuesday by token of the fair but as to the time of day there arose a disagreement twas nigh soon afther wan oclock said dan mulcahy soon afther wan exclaimed larry shanahan with scorn soon afther your grandmothers pig twas half afther two at laste ut sthruck twelve nigh half an hour before we lift cullanin why yez heard ut that i did not ut sthruck eleven an we wint in foive minutes what fool talk ye shpake dan mulcahy twas twelve sthruck i counted ut thin ye counted wrong i counted ut an twas elivin yez nayther av yez right interposed dennis grady twas not elivin when we lift twas not be the mother av moses i wondher at ye dennis grady ye must have been dhrunk as a kerry cow and both mulcahy and shanahan turned upon the obstinate grady and the dispute waxed clamorous till hewitt stopped it come come he said never mind the time then settle that between you after youve gone does either of you remember not calculate you know but remember the time you got to ballyshiel the actual time by a clock not a guess not one of the three had looked at a clock at ballyshiel do you remember anything about coming home again they did not they looked furtively at one another and presently broke into a grin ah i see how that was hewitt said good humouredly thats all now i think come its ten shillings each i think and he handed over the money the men touched their forelocks again stowed away the money and prepared to depart as they went larry shanahan stepped mysteriously back again and said in a whisper maybe the jintlemen wud like me to kiss the book on ut an as to the toime oh no thank you hewitt laughed we take your word for it mr shanahan and mr shanahan pulled his forelock again and vanished theres nothing but confusion to be got from them mr bowyer remarked testily its a mere waste of time no no not a waste of time hewitt replied nor a waste of money one thing is made pretty plain that is that the shot was fired on tuesday mrs hurley never noticed the report but these three men were close by and there is no doubt that they heard it its the only single thing they agree about at all they contradict one another over everything else but they agree completely in that of course i wish we could have got the exact time but that cant be helped as it is it is rather fortunate that they disagreed so entirely two of them are certainly wrong and perhaps all three in any case it wouldnt have been safe to trust to mere computation of time by three men just beginning to get drunk who had no particular reason for remembering but if by any chance they had agreed on the time we might have been led into a wrong track altogether by taking the thing as fact but a gunshot is not such a doubtful thing when three independent witnesses hear a gunshot together there can be little doubt that a shot has been fired now i think youd better sit down perhaps you can find something to read im about to make a very minute examination of this place and it will probably bore you if youve nothing else to do but mr bowyer would think of nothing but the business in hand i dont understand that window he said shaking his finger towards it as he spoke not at all why should main want to get in and out by a window he wasnt a stranger hewitt began a most careful inspection of the whole surface of floor ceiling walls and furniture of the sitting room at the fireplace he stooped and lifted with great care a few sheets of charred paper from the grate these he put on the window ledge will you just bring over that little screen he asked to keep the draught from this burnt paper thank you it looks like letter paper and thick letter paper since the ashes are very little broken the weather has been fine and there has been no fire in that grate for a long time these papers have been carefully burned with a match or a candle ah perhaps the letters poor young rewse was writing in the morning but what can they tell us perhaps nothing perhaps a great deal hewitt was examining the cinders keenly holding the surface sideways to the light come he said see if i can guess rewses address in london mountjoy gardens hampstead is that it yes is it there can you read it show me mr bowyer hurried across the room eager and excited you can sometimes read words on charred paper hewitt replied as you may have noticed this has curled and crinkled rather too much in the burning but it is plainly notepaper with an embossed heading which stands out rather clearly he has evidently brought some notepaper with him from home in his trunk look you can just see the ink lines crossing out the address but theres little else at the beginning of the letter there is my d then a gap and then the last stroke of m and the rest of the word mother my dear mother or my dearest mother evidently something follows too in the same line but that is unreadable my dear mother and sister perhaps after that there is nothing recognisable the first letter looks rather like w but even that is indistinct it seems to be a longish letter several sheets but they are stuck together in the charring perhaps more than one letter the thing is plain mr bowyer said the poor lad was writing home and perhaps to other places and main after his crime burned the letters because they would have stultified his own with the lying tale about small pox hewitt said nothing but resumed his general search he passed his hand rapidly over every inch of the surface of everything in the room then he entered the bedroom and began an inspection of the same sort there there were two beds one at each end of the room and each inch of each piece of bed linen passed rapidly under his sharp eye after the bedroom he betook himself to the little bath room and then to the scullery finally he went outside and examined every board of a close fence that stood a few feet from the sitting room window and the brick paved path lying between when it was all over he returned to mr bowyer here is a strange thing he said the shot passed clean through rewses body striking no bones and meeting no solid resistance it was a good sized bullet as dr oreilly testifies and therefore must have had a large charge of powder behind it in the cartridge after emerging from rewses back it must have struck something else in this confined place yet on nowhere ceiling floor wall nor furniture can i find the mark of a bullet nor the bullet itself the bullet itself main might easily have got rid of yes but not the mark indeed the bullet would scarcely be easy to get at if it had struck anything i have seen about here it would have buried itself just look round now where could a bullet strike in this place without leaving its mark mr bowyer looked round well no he said nowhere unless the window was open and it went out that way then it must have hit the fence or the brick paving between and there is no sign of a bullet there hewitt replied push the sash as high as you please the shot couldnt have passed over the fence without hitting the window first as to the bedroom windows thats impossible mr shanahan and his friends would not only have heard the shot they would have seen it which they didnt then whats the meaning of it the meaning of it is simply this either rewse was shot somewhere else and his body brought here afterwards or the article whatever it was that the bullet struck must have been taken away yes of course its just another piece of evidence destroyed by main thats all every step we go we see the diabolical completeness of his plans but now every piece of evidence missing only tells the more against him the body alone condemns him past all redemption hewitt was gazing about the room thoughtfully i think well have mrs hurley over here he said she should tell us if anything is missing constable will you ask mrs hurley to step over here mrs hurley came at once and was brought into the sitting room just look about you mrs hurley hewitt said in this room and everywhere else and tell me if anything is missing that you can remember was here on the morning of the day you last saw mr rewse she looked thoughtfully up and down the room sure sor she said tis all there as ordnary her eyes rested on the mantelpiece and she added at once except the clock indade except the clock the clock ut is sure ut stud on that same mantelpiece on that mornin as ut always did what sort of clock was it just a plain round wan wid a metal case an american clock they said ut was but ut kept nigh as good time as me own it did keep good time you say faith an ut did sor mine an this ran together for weeks wid nivir a minute betune thim thank you mrs hurley thank you that will do hewitt exclaimed with something of excitement in his voice he turned to mr bowyer we must find that clock he said and theres the pistol nothing has been seen of that come help me search look for a loose board but hell have taken them away with him probably the pistol perhaps although that isnt likely the clock no its evidence man evidence hewitt darted outside and walked hurriedly round the cottage looking this way and that about the country adjacent presently he returned no he said i think its more likely in the house he stood for a moment and thought then he made for the fireplace and flung the fender across the floor all round the hearthstone an open crack extended see there he exclaimed as he pointed to it he took the tongs and with one leg levered the stone up till he could seize it in his fingers then he dragged it out and pushed it across the linoleum that covered the floor in the space beneath lay a large revolver and a common american round nickel plated clock see here he cried see here and he rose and placed the articles on the mantelpiece the glass before the clock face was smashed to atoms and there was a gaping rent in the face itself for a few seconds hewitt regarded it as it stood and then he turned to mr bowyer mr bowyer he said we have done mr stanley main a sad injustice poor young rewse committed suicide there is proof undeniable and he pointed to the clock illustration he took the tongs and with one leg levered the stone up proof how where nonsense man pooh ridiculous if rewse committed suicide why should main go to all that trouble and tell all those lies to prove that he died of small pox more even than that what has he run away for ill tell you mr bowyer in a moment but first as to this clock remember main set his watch by the cullanin town hall clock and mrs hurleys clock agreed exactly that we have proved ourselves to day by my own watch mrs hurleys clock still agrees this clock was always kept in time with mrs hurleys main returned at two exactly look at the time by that clock the time when the bullet crashed into and stopped it the time was three minutes to one hewitt took the clock unscrewed the winder and quickly stripped off the back exposing the works see he said the bullet is lodged firmly among the wheels and has been torn into snags and strips by the impact the wheels themselves are ruined altogether the central axle which carries the hands is bent see there neither hand will move in the slightest that bullet struck the axle and fixed those hands immovably at the moment of time when algernon rewse died look at the mainspring it is less than half run out proof that the clock was going when the shot struck it main left rewse alive and well at half past nine he did not return till two when rewse had been dead more than an hour but then hang it all how about the lies and the false certificate and the bolting let me tell you the whole tale mr bowyer as i conjecture it to have been poor young rewse was as you told me in a bad state of health thoroughly run down i think you said you said something of his engagement and the death of the lady this pointed clearly to a nervous a mental upset very well he broods and so forth he must go away and find change of scene and occupation his intimate friend main brings him here the holiday has its good effect perhaps at first but after a while it gets monotonous and brooding sets in again i do not know whether or not you happen to know it but it is a fact that four fifths of all persons suffering from melancholia have suicidal tendencies this may never have been suspected by main who otherwise might not have left him so long alone at any rate he is left alone and he takes the opportunity he writes a note to main and a long letter to his mother an awful heartbreaking letter with a terrible picture of the mental agony wherein he was to die perhaps with a tincture of religious mania in it and prophesying merited hell for himself in the hereafter this done he simply stands up from this table at which he has been writing and with his back to the fireplace shoots himself there he lies till main returns an hour later main finds the door shut and nobody answers his knock he goes round to the sitting room window looks through and perhaps he sees the body anyway he pushes back the catch with his knife opens the window and gets in and then he sees he is completely knocked out of time the thing is terrible what shall he what can he do poor rewses mother and sister dote on him and his mother is an invalid heart disease to let her see that awful letter would be to kill her he burns the letter also the note to himself then an idea strikes him even without the letter the news of her boys suicide will probably kill the poor old lady can she be prevented hearing of it of his death she must know thats inevitable but as to the manner would it not be possible to concoct some kind lie and then the opportunities of the situation occur to him nobody but himself knows of it he is a medical man fully qualified and empowered to give certificates of death more there is an epidemic of small pox in the neighbourhood what easier with a little management than to call the death one by small pox nobody would be anxious to examine too closely the corpse of a small pox patient he decides that he will do it he writes the letter to mrs rewse announcing that her son has the disease and he forbids mrs hurley to come near the place for fear of infection he cleans the floor it is linoleum here you see and the stains were fresh burns the clothes cleans and stops the wound at every turn his medical knowledge is of use he puts the smashed clock and the pistol out of sight under the hearth in a word he carries out the whole thing rather cleverly and a terrible few days he must have passed it never strikes him that he has dug a frightful pit for his own feet you are suspicious and you come across in a perhaps rather peremptory manner you tell him how suspicious his conduct has been and then a sense of his terrible position comes upon him like a thunderclap he sees it all he has deliberately of his own motion destroyed every evidence of the suicide there is no evidence in the world that rewse did not die a natural death except the body and that you are going to dig up he sees now you remind him of it in fact that he is the one man alive who can profit by rewses death and there is the shot body and there is the false death certificate and there are the lying letters and the tales to the neighbours and everything he has himself destroyed everything that proves suicide all that remains points to a foul murder and to him as the murderer can you wonder at his complete breakdown and his flight what else in the world could the poor fellow do well well yes yes mr bowyer replied thoughtfully it seems very plausible of course but still look at probabilities my dear sir look at probabilities no but look at possibilities there is that clock get over it if you can was there ever a more insurmountable alibi could main possibly be here shooting rewse and half way between here and cullanin at the same time remember mrs hurley saw him come back at two and she had been watching for an hour and could see more than half a mile up the road well yes i suppose youre right and what must we do now bring main back i think we should advertise to begin with say rewse is proved to have died over an hour before you came all safe your evidence is wanted or something of that sort and we must set the telegraph going the police already are looking for him no doubt meanwhile i will look here for a clue myself the advertisement was successful in two days indeed main afterwards said that he was at the time once the first terror was over in doubt whether or not it would be best to go back and face the thing out trusting to his innocence he could not venture home for money nor to his bank for fear of the police he chanced upon the advertisement as he searched the paper for news of the case and that decided him his explanation of the matter was precisely as hewitt had expected his only thought till mr bowyer first arrived at the cottage had been to smother the real facts and to spare the feelings of mrs rewse and her daughter and it was not till that gentleman put them so plainly before him that he in the least realised the dangers of his position that his fears for mrs rewse were only too well grounded was proved by events for the poor old lady only survived her son by a month these events took place some little while ago as may be gathered from the fact that miss rewse has now been mrs stanley main for nearly three years illustration gun and broken clock the affair of mrs setons child it has struck me that many of my readers may wonder that although i have set down in detail a number of interesting cases wherein hewitt figured with success i have scarcely as much as alluded to his failures for failures he had and of a fair number more than once he has found his search met perhaps at the beginning perhaps after some little while by an impenetrable wall of darkness through which no clue led at other times he has lost time on a false trail while his quarry escaped at others still the stupidity or inaccuracy of some person upon whom he has depended for information has set his plans to naught the reason why none of these cases have been embodied in the present papers is simply this that a problem with no answer a puzzle with no explanation an incident with no satisfactory end as a rule lends itself but poorly to purposes of popular narrative and it is often difficult to make understood and appreciated any degree of skill and acumen unless it produces a clear and intelligible result that such results attended hewitts efforts in an extraordinary degree those who have followed my narratives so far will need no assurance but withal impossibilities still remain impossibilities for hewitt as for the dullest creature alive on some other occasion i may perhaps set out at length a case in which martin hewitt achieved nothing more than unqualified failure for the present i shall content myself with a case which although it was completely cleared up in the end yet for some while baffled hewitt because of some of the reasons i have alluded to on the ground floor of the building wherein hewitt kept his office and in which i myself had my chambers were the offices of messrs streatley raikes an old fashioned firm of family solicitors messrs streatley raikess junior clerk appeared in hewitts outer office one morning with the query is your guvnor in kerrett admitted the fact will you tell him mr raikes sends his compliments and will be obliged if he can step downstairs for a few minutes its a client of ours a lady and shes in a great state about losing her baby or something say mr raikes would bring her up only she seems too ill to get up the stairs this was the purport of the message which kerrett brought into the inner room and in three minutes hewitt was in streatley raikess office i thought the only useful thing possible would be to send for you mr hewitt mr raikes explained indeed if my client had been better acquainted with london no doubt she would have come to you direct she is in a bad state in the inner office her name is mrs seton her husband is a recent client of ours quite young and rather wealthy people so far as i know made a fortune early i believe in south africa and came here to live their child their only child a little toddler of two years or thereabout disappeared yesterday in a most mysterious way and all efforts to find it seem to have failed as yet the police have been set going everywhere but there is no news as yet mrs seton seems to have passed a dreadful night and could think of nothing better to do this morning than to come to us she has her maid with her and looks to be breaking down entirely i believe shes lying on the sofa in my private room now will you see her i think you might hear what she has to say whether you take the case in hand or not something may strike you and in any case it will comfort her to get your opinion i told her all about you you know and she clutched at the chance eagerly shall i see if we may go in mr raikes knocked at the door of his inner sanctum and waited then he knocked again and set the door ajar there was a quiet come in and pushing open the door the lawyer motioned hewitt to follow him on the sofa facing the door sat a lady very pale and exhibiting plain signs of grief and physical weariness a heavy veil was thrown back over her bonnet and her maid stood at her side holding a bottle of salts as she saw hewitt she made as if to rise but he stepped quickly forward and laid his hand on her shoulder pray dont disturb yourself mrs seton he said mr raikes has told me something of your trouble and perhaps when i know a little more i shall be able to offer you some advice but remember that it will be very important for you to maintain your strength and spirits as much as possible illustration on the sofa facing the door sat a lady very pale and exhibiting plain signs of grief this is mr martin hewitt you know mr raikes here put in of whom i was speaking mrs seton inclined her head and with a very obvious effort began it is my child you know mr hewitt my little boy charley we cant find him mr raikes has told me so when did you see the child last yesterday morning his nurse left him sitting on the floor in a room we call the small morning room where we sometimes allowed him to play when nurse was out because the nursery was out of hearing except from the bedrooms i myself was in the large morning room and as he seemed to be very quiet i went to look and found he was not there you looked elsewhere of course yes but he was nowhere in the house and none of the servants had seen him at first i supposed that his nurse had gone back to the small morning room and taken him with her i had sent her on an errand but when she returned i found that was not the case can he walk oh yes he can walk quite well but he could scarcely have come out from the room without my hearing him the two rooms the morning room and the small sitting room are on opposite sides of the same passage do the doors face each other no the door of the small room is farther up the passage than the other but in any case he was nowhere in the house but if he left the room he must have got out somehow is there no other door yes there is a french window with the lower panels of wood in the room it gives on to a few steps leading down into the garden but that was closed and bolted on the inside you found no trace whatever of him i take it on the whole premises not a trace of any sort nor had anybody about the place seen him did you yourself actually see him in this room or have you merely the nurses word for it i saw her put him there she left him playing with a box of toys when i went to look for him the toys were there scattered on the floor but he had gone mrs seton sank on the arms of her maid and her breast heaved im sure hewitt said youll keep your nerves as steady as you can mrs seton much may depend on it if you have nothing else to tell me now i think i will come to your house at once look at it and question your servants myself meantime what has been done the police have been notified everywhere of course mr raikes said handing hewitt a printed bill damp from the press and here is a bill containing a description of the child and offering a reward which is being circulated now hewitt glanced at the bill and nodded that is quite right he said so far as i can tell at present but i must see the place do you feel strong enough to come home now mrs seton hewitts business like decision and confidence of manner gave the lady fresh strength the brougham is here she said and we can drive home at once we live at cricklewood a fine pair of horses stood before the brougham though they still bore signs of hard work and indeed they had been kept at their best pace all that morning all the way to cricklewood hewitt kept mrs seton in conversation never for a moment leaving her attention disengaged the missing child he learned was the only one and the family had only been in england for something less than a year mr seton had become possessed of real property in south africa had sold it in london and had determined to settle here a little way past shoot up hill the coachman swung his pair off to the left and presently entering a gate pulled up before a large old fashioned house here hewitt immediately began a complete examination of the premises the possible exits from the grounds he found were four in number the two wide front gates giving on to the carriage drive the kitchen and stable entrance and a side gate in a fence always locked however inside the house from the central hall a passage to the right led to another wherein was the door of the small morning room this was a very ordinary room fifteen feet square or so lighted by the glass in the french window the bottom panes of which however had been filled in with wood the contents of a box of toys lay scattered on the floor and the box itself lay near have these toys been moved hewitt asked since the child was missed no we havent allowed anything to be disturbed the disappearance seemed so wholly unaccountable that we thought the police might wish to examine the place exactly as it was they did not seem to think it necessary however hewitt knelt and examined the toys without disturbing them they were of very good quality and represented a farmyard with horses carts ducks geese and cows complete one of the carts had had a string attached so that it might be pulled along the floor now hewitt said rising you think mrs seton that the child could not have toddled through the passage and so into some other part of the house without you hearing him well mrs seton answered with indecision i thought so at first but i begin to doubt because he must have done so i suppose they went into the passage the door of the large morning room was four or five yards further toward the passage leading to the hall and on the opposite side the floor in this passage hewitt observed is rather thickly carpeted see here i can walk on it at a good pace without noise mrs seton assented of course she said if he got past here he might have got anywhere about the house and so into the grounds there is a veranda outside the drawing room and doors in various places of course the grounds have been completely examined oh yes every inch the weather has been very dry unfortunately hewitt said and it would be useless for me to look for footprints on your hard gravel especially of so small a child let us come back to the room is the french window fastened as you found it yes nothing has been changed the french window was as is usual one of two casements joining in the centre and fastened by bolts top and bottom it is not your habit i see hewitt observed to open both halves of the window no one side is always fastened the other we secure by the bottom bolt because the catch of the handle doesnt always act properly and you found that bolt fastened as i see it now yes hewitt lifted the bolt and opened the door four or five steps led parallel with the face of the wall to a sort of path which ran the whole length of the house on this side and was only separated from a quiet public lane by a low fence and a thin hedge almost opposite a small light gate stood in the fence firmly padlocked i see hewitt remarked your house is placed close against one side of the grounds is that the side gate which you always keep locked mrs seton replied in the affirmative and hewitt laid his hand on the gate in question still he said if security is the object i should recommend hinges a little less rural in pattern see here and he gave the gate a jerk upward lifting the hinge pins from their sockets and opening the gate from that side the padlock acting as hinge those hinges he added were meant for a heavier gate than that and he replaced the gate illustration those hinges were meant for a heavier gate than that yes mrs seton replied i am obliged to you but that doesnt concern us now the french window was bolted on the inside would you like to see the servants the servants were produced and hewitt questioned each in turn but not one would admit having seen anything of master charles seton after he had been left in the small morning room a rather stupid groom fancied he had seen master charles on the side lawn but then remembered that that must have been the day before the cook an uncommonly thin sharp featured woman for one of her trade was especially positive that she had not seen him all that day and she would be sure to have remembered if she had seen him leaving the house she said because she was the more particular since he was lost the last time this was news to hewitt lost the last time he asked why what is this mrs seton was he lost once before oh yes mrs seton answered six or seven weeks ago but that was quite different he strayed out at the front gate and was brought back from the police station in the evening but this may be most important hewitt said you should certainly have told me tell me now exactly what happened on this first occasion but it was really quite an ordinary sort of accident he was left alone and got out through an open gate of course we were very anxious but we had him back the same evening need we waste time in talking about that but it will be no waste of time i assure you what was it that happened exactly nurse was about to take him for a short walk just before lunch on the front lawn he suddenly remembered a whip which had been left in the nursery and insisted on taking it with him she left him and went back for it taking however some little time to find it when she returned he was nowhere to be seen but one of the gates was a couple of feet or more open it had caught on a loose stone in swinging to and no doubt he had wandered off that way a lady found him some distance away and not knowing to whom he belonged took him that evening to a police station and as messages had been sent to the police stations we had him back soon after he was left there do you know who the lady was her name was mrs clark she left her name and address at the police station and of course i wrote to thank her but there was some mistake in taking it down i suppose for the letter was returned marked not known then you never saw this lady yourself no i think i will make a note of the exact description of the child and then visit the police station to which this lady took him six weeks ago fair curly hair i think and blue eyes age two years and three months walks and runs well and speaks fairly plainly dress pale blue llama frock with lace white under linen linen overall pale blue silk socks and tan shoes everything good as new except the shoes which were badly worn at the backs through a habit he has of kicking back and downward with his heels when sitting they were rather old shoes and only used indoors if i remember aright nothing was said of those shoes in the printed bill was that so no i believe not i have been so worried yes mrs seton of course it is most creditable in you to have kept up so well while i have been making my inquiries go now and take a good rest while i do what is possible by the way where was mr seton yesterday morning when you missed the boy in the city he has some important business in hand just now and to day he has gone to the city again of course he is sadly worried but he saw that everything possible was done and his business was very important just so mr seton was not married before i presume if i may no certainly not why do you ask i beg your pardon but i have a habit of asking almost every question i can think of i cant know too much of a case you know and most unlikely pieces of information sometimes turn out useful thank you for your patience i will try another plan now mrs seton had kept up remarkably well during hewitts examination but she was plainly by no means a strong woman and her maid came again to her assistance as hewitt left hewitt himself made for the police station few inspectors indeed of the metropolitan police force did not know hewitt by sight and the one here in charge knew him well he remembered very well the occasion six weeks or so before when mrs clark brought mrs setons child to the station he was on duty himself at the time and he turned up the book containing an entry on the subject from this it appeared that the lady gave the address no sedgby road belsize park i suppose you didnt happen to know the lady hewitt asked by sight or otherwise no i didnt and im not sure i could swear to her again the inspector answered she wore a heavy veil and i didnt see much of her face one rum thing i noticed though she seemed rather taken with the baby and as she stooped down to kiss him before she went away i could see an old scar on her throat it was just the sort of scar ive seen on a man thats had his throat cut and got over it she wore a high collar to hide it but stooping shifted the collar and so i saw it did she seem an educated woman oh yes perfect lady spoke very nice i told her a baby had been inquired after by mrs seton and from the description id no doubt this was the one and so it was at what time was this pm exactly here it is all entered properly now as to sedgby road belsize park do you happen to know it oh yes very well very quiet respectable road indeed i only know it through walking through i see a suburban directory on the shelf behind you do you mind pulling it down thanks let us find sedgby road here it is see there is no no the highest number is no more there is the inspector answered running his finger down the column and theres no clark in the road thats more false address thats plain and so theyve lost him again have they we had notice yesterday of course and ive just got some bills this last seems a queer sort of affair dont it child sitting inside the house disappeared like a ghost and all the doors and windows fastened inside hewitt agreed that the affair had very uncommon features and presently left the station and sought a cab all the way back to his office he considered the matter deeply as a matter of fact he was at a loss certain evidence he had seen in the house but it went a very little way and beyond that there was merely no clue whatever there were features of the childs first estrayal also that attracted him though it might very easily be the case that nothing connected the two events there was an unknown woman apparently a lady who had once had her throat cut bringing the child back after several hours and giving a false name and address for since the address was false the same was probably the case with the name why was this this time the child was still absent and nothing whatever was there to suggest in what direction he might be followed neither was there anything to indicate why he should be detained anywhere if detained he was hewitt determined while awaiting any result that the bills might bring to cause certain inquiries to be made into the antecedents of the setons moreover other work was waiting and the seton business must be put aside for a few hours at least hewitt sat late in his office that evening and at about nine oclock mrs seton returned the poor woman seemed on the verge of serious illness she had received two anonymous letters which she brought with her and with scarcely a word placed before hewitts eyes the first he opened and read as follows the writer observes that you are offering a reward for the recovery of your child there is no necessity for this charley is quite safe happy and in good hands pray do not instruct detectives or take any such steps just yet the child is well and shall be returned to you this i swear solemnly his errand is one of mercy pray have patience hewitt turned the letter and envelope in his hand good paper of the same sort as the envelope he remarked but only a half sheet freshly torn off probably because the other side bore an address heading therefore most likely from a respectable sort of house the writing is a womans and good though the writer was agitated when she did it posted this afternoon at willesden you see mrs seton said anxiously she knows his name she calls him charley yes hewitt answered there may be something in that or there may not the name charles seton is on the bills isnt it and they have been visible publicly all day to day so that the name may be more easily explained than some other parts of the letter for instance the writer says that the childs errand is one of mercy the little fellow may be very intelligent no doubt is but children of two years old as a rule do not practise errands of mercy nor indeed errands of any sort can you think of anything whatever mrs seton in connection with your family history or indeed anything else that may throw light on that phrase he looked keenly at her as he asked but her expression was one of blank doubt merely as she shook her head slowly and answered in the negative hewitt turned to the other letter and read this madam if you want your child you had better make an arrangement with me you fancy he has strayed but as a matter of fact he has been stolen and you little know by whom you will never get him back except through me you may rest assured of that are you prepared to pay me one hundred pounds if i hand him to you and no questions asked your present reward is paltry and you may finally bid good bye to your child if you will not accept my terms if you do say as much in an advertisement to the standard addressed to veritas a mans handwriting hewitt commented fairly well formed but shaky the writer is not in first rate health each line totters away in a downward slope at the end i shouldnt be surprised to hear that the gentleman drank postmark hampstead posted this afternoon also but the striking thing is the paper and envelope they are each of exactly the same kind and size as those of the other letter the paper also is a half sheet and torn off on the same side as the other confirmation of my suspicion that the object is to get rid of the printed address i shall be surprised if both these were not written in the same house that looks like a traitor in the enemys camp the question is which is the traitor hewitt regarded the letters intently for a few seconds and then proceeded plainly he said if these letters are written by people who know anything about the matter one writer is lying the woman promises that the child shall be returned without reward or search and talks generally as if the taking away of the child or the estrayal or whatever it was were a very virtuous sort of proceeding the man says plainly that the child has been stolen with no attempt to gloss the matter and asserts that nothing will get the child back but heavy blackmail a very different story on the other hand can there be any concerted design in these two letters are they intended each from its own side to play up to a certain result hewitt paused and thought then he asked suddenly do you recognise anything familiar either in the handwriting or the stationery of these letters no nothing very well hewitt said we will come to closer quarters with the blackmailer i think you neednt commit yourself to paying anything of course but mr hewitt i will gladly pay or do anything the hundred pounds is nothing i will pay it gladly if i can only get my child well well we shall see the man may not be able to do what he offers after all but that we will test it is too late now for an advertisement in to morrow mornings standard but there is the evening standard he may even mean that and the next mornings i will have an advertisement inserted in both inviting this man to make an appointment and prove the genuineness of his offer that will fetch him if he wants the money and can do anything for it have you nothing else to tell me nothing but have you ascertained nothing yourself dont say ive to pass another night in such dreadful suspense im afraid mrs seton i must ask you to be patient a little longer i have ascertained something but it has not carried me far as yet remember that if there is anything at all in these anonymous letters and i think there is the child is at any rate safe and to be found one way or another both agree in that this he said mainly to comfort his client for in fact he had learned very little his news from the city as to mr setons early history had been but meagre he was known as a successful speculator and that was almost all there was an indefinite notion that he had been married once before but nothing more all the next day hewitt did nothing in the case another affair a previous engagement kept him hard at work in his office all day and indeed had this not been the case he could have done little his city inquiries were still in progress and he awaited moreover a reply to the advertisement but at about half past seven in the evening this telegram arrived child returned come at once seton in five minutes hewitt was making north west in a hansom and in half an hour he was ringing the bell at the setons house within mrs seton was still semi hysterical clasping the child an intelligent looking little fellow in her arms and refusing to release her hold of him for a moment mr seton stood before the fire in the same room he was a smart looking scrupulously dressed man of thirty five or thereabouts and he began explaining his telegram as soon as he had wished hewitt good evening the childs back he said and of course thats the great thing but im not satisfied mr hewitt i want to know why it was taken away and i want to punish somebody its really very extraordinary my poor wife has been driving about all day she called on you by the bye but you were out hewitt credited this to kerrett who had been told he must not be disturbed and she has been all over the place uselessly unable to rest of course well i have been at home since half past four and at about six i was smoking in the small morning room i often use it as a smoking room and looking out at the french window i came away from there and half an hour or more later as it was getting dusk i remembered i had left the french window open and sent a servant to shut it she went straight to the room and there on the floor where he was seen last she found the child playing with his toys as though nothing had happened and how was he dressed as he is now yes just as he was when we missed him hewitt stepped up to the child as he sat on his mothers lap and rubbed his cheek speaking pleasantly to him the little fellow looked up and smiled and hewitt observed one thing is noticeable this linen overall is almost clean little boys like this dont keep one white overall clean for three days do they and see those shoes arent they new those he had were old i think you said and tan coloured the shoes now on the childs feet were of white leather with a noticeable sewn ornamentation in silk his mother had not noticed them before and as she looked he lifted his little foot higher and said look mummy more new shoes ask him suggested hewitt hurriedly who gave them to him his father asked him and the little fellow looked puzzled after a pause he said mummy no his mother answered i didnt he thought a moment and then said no no not vis mummy course not and for some little while after that the only answer procurable from him was course not which seemed to be a favourite phrase of his have you asked him where he has been yes his mother answered but he only says ta ta ask him again she did this time after a little reflection he pointed his chubby arm toward the door and said been dere who took you asked mrs seton again charley seemed puzzled then looking doubtfully at his mother he said mummy no not mummy she answered and his reply was course not after which he attempted to climb on her shoulder then at hewitts suggestion he was asked whom he went to see this time the reply was prompt poor daddy he said what this daddy no not vis daddy course not and that was all that could be got from him he will probably say things in the next day or two which may be useful hewitt said if you listen pretty sharply now i should like to go to the small morning room in time room in question the door was still open outside the moon had risen and made the evening almost as clear as day hewitt examined the steps and the path at their foot but all was dry and hard and showed no footmark then as his eye rested on the small gate see here he exclaimed suddenly somebody has been in lifting the gate as i showed mrs seton when i was last here the gate has been replaced in a hurry and only the top hinge has dropped in its place the bottom one is disjointed he lifted the gate once more and set it back the ground just along its foot was softer than in the parts surrounding and here hewitt perceived the print of a heel it was the heel mark of a womans boot small and sharp and of the usual curved d shape nowhere else within or without was there the slightest mark hewitt went some distance either way in the outer lane but without discovering anything more i think i will borrow those new shoes hewitt said on his return i think i should be disposed to investigate further in any case for my own satisfaction the thing interests me by the way mrs seton tell me would these shoes be more likely to have been bought at a regular shoemakers or at a baby linen shop certainly i should say at a baby linen shop mrs seton answered they are of excellent quality and for babies shoes of this fancy description one would never go to an ordinary shoemakers so much the better because the baby linen shops are fewer than the shoemakers i may take these then perhaps before i go you had better make quite certain that there is nothing else about the child which is not your own there was nothing and with the shoes in his pocket hewitt regained his cab and travelled back to his office the case from its very bareness and simplicity puzzled him why was the child taken plainly not to keep for it had been returned almost as it went plainly also not for the sake of reward or blackmail for here was the child safely back before the anonymous blackmailer had had a chance of earning his money more the advertised reward had not been claimed also it could not be a matter of malice or revenge for the child was quite unharmed and indeed seemed to have been quite happy no conceivable family complication previous to the marriage of mr and mrs seton could induce anybody to take away and return the child which was undoubtedly mrs setons then who could be the poor daddy and mummy not vis daddy and not vis mummy that the child had been with the setons knew nothing of them it was difficult to see what it could all mean arrived at his office hewitt took a map and setting the leg of a pair of compasses on the site of the setons house described a circle including in its radius all willesden and hampstead then with the suburban directory to help him he began searching out and noting all the baby linen shops in the area after all there were not many about a dozen this done hewitt went home in the morning he began his hunt his design was to call at each of the shops until he had found in which a pair of shoes of that particular pattern had been sold on the day of little charley setons disappearance the first two shops he tried did not keep shoes of the pattern and had never had them and the young ladies behind the counter seemed vastly amused at hewitts inquiries nothing perturbed he tried the next shop on his list in the hampstead district there they kept such shoes as a rule but were out of them at present hewitt immediately sent his card to the proprietress requesting a few minutes interview the lady a very dignified lady indeed in black silk gray corkscrew curls and spectacles came out with hewitts card between her fingers he apologised for troubling her and stepping out of hearing from the counter explained that his business was urgent a child has been taken away by some unauthorised person whom i am endeavouring to trace this person bought this pair of shoes on monday you keep such shoes i find though they are not in stock at present and as they appear to be of an uncommon sort possibly they were bought here the lady looked at them yes she said this pattern of shoe is made especially for me i do not think you can buy them at other places illustration this pattern of shoe is made especially for me then may i ask you to inquire from your assistants if any were sold on monday and to whom certainly then there were consultations behind counters and desks and examinations of carbon papered books in the end the proprietress came to hewitt followed by a young lady of rather pert and self confident aspect we find she said that two pairs of these shoes were sold on monday but one pair was afterwards brought back and exchanged for others less expensive this young lady sold both ah then possibly she may remember something of the person who bought the pair which was not exchanged yes the assistant answered at once addressing herself to the lady it was mrs butchers servant the proprietress frowned slightly oh indeed she said mrs butchers servant was it there have been inquiries about mrs butcher before i believe though not here mrs butcher is a woman who takes babies to mind and is said to make a trade of adopting them or finding people anxious to adopt them i know nothing of her nor do i want to she lives somewhere not far off and you can get her address i believe from the greengrocers round the corner does she keep more than one servant oh i think not but no doubt the greengrocer can say the lady seemed to feel it an affront that she should be supposed to know anything of mrs butcher and hewitt consequently started for the greengrocers now this was just one of those cases in which dependence on information given by other people put hewitt on the wrong scent he spent that day in a fatiguing pursuit of mrs butchers servant with adventures rather amusing in themselves but quite irrelevant to the seton case in the end when he had captured her and proceeded to open a cunning battery of inquiries under plea of a bet with a friend that the shoes could not be matched he soon found that she had been the purchaser who after buying just such a pair of shoes had returned and exchanged them for something cheaper and the only outcome of his visit to the baby linen shop was the waste of a day it was indeed just one of those checks which while they may hamper the progress of a narrative for popular reading are nevertheless inseparable from the matter of fact experience of hewitts profession with a very natural rage in his heart but with as polite an exterior as possible hewitt returned to the baby linen shop in the evening the whole case seemed barren of useful evidence and at each turn as yet he had found himself helpless at the shop the self confident young lady calmly admitted that soon after he had left something had caused her to remember that it was the other customer who had kept the white shoes and not mrs butchers servant and do you know the other customer he asked no she was quite a stranger she brought in a little boy from a cab and bought a lot of things for him a suit of outdoor clothes as well as the shoes ah now probably this is what i want can you remember anything of the child yes he was a pretty little fellow about two years old or so with curls she called him charley did she put the things on him in the shop not the frock but she put on the outer coat the hat and the shoes i can remember it all now quite well now i have had time to think then what shoes did the child wear when he came in rather old tan coloured ones then i think this is the person i am after you say you never saw her at any other time before or since try to describe her well she was a lady well dressed in black she had a very high collar to hide a scar on her neck like the scars people have sometimes after abscesses i think i could see it from the side when she stooped down and are you sure she had nothing sent home did she take everything with her yes nothing was sent else we should know her address you know she didnt happen to pay with a banknote did she no in cash hewitt left with little more ceremony and made the best of his way to his friend the inspector at the police station here was the woman with the scarred neck again charleys deliverer once now his kidnapper if only something else could be ascertained of her some small clue that might bring her identity into view the thing would be done at the station however there was something new a man had just come in very drunk and had given himself into custody for kidnapping the child charles seton whose description was set forth on the bill which still appeared on the notice board outside the station when hewitt arrived the man was lolling wretched and maudlin against the rail and oblivious of most of the questions addressed to him was ranting and snivelling by turns his dress was good though splashed with mud and his bloated face bleared eyes and loose tremulous mouth proclaimed the habitual drunkard i shay ill gimmeself up he proclaimed with a desperate attempt at dignity ill gimmeself up takin away lil boy ill shacrifishe mself solemn duty shacrifishe mself felpless woman aint it ver well then gimmeself up takin way lil boy buyin m pair shoes no harm in that issher hope not ver well then and he subsided into tears whats your name asked the inspector illustration whats your name asked the inspector whash name thash my bishnesh warrer wan know name for grapertnence ask gellumshname im gellum thash wha i am besht of shisters too besht shisers snivelling again an im ungraful beasht but i shacrifishe self she shan get n trouble dyear gimmeself up shtealin lil boy who says i ain gellum nothing more intelligible than this could be got out of him and presently he was taken off to the cells then hewitt asked the inspector what will happen to him now the inspector laughed oh hell get very sober and sick and sorry by the morning he said and then hell have to send home for some money thats all and as to the child oh hell forget all about that thats only a drunken freak the child has been recovered you know that i suppose yes but i am still after the person who took it away it was a woman indeed ive more than a suspicion that it was the woman who brought the child here when he was lost before the one with the scar on the neck you know is that so said the inspector well thats a rum go aint it what did she bring him back here for if she wanted him again that i want to find out hewitt answered and now i want you to do me a favour you say you expect that man below will want to send home in the morning for money well i want to be the messenger the inspector opened his eyes want to be the messenger well thats easily done if youre here at the time ill leave word but why well ive a sort of notion i know something about his family and i want to make sure shall i be here at eight in the morning or shall we say nine which you like i expect hell be shouting for bail before eight very well we will say eight good night and so hewitt had to let yet another night go without an explanation of the mystery but he felt that his hand was on the key at last though it had only fallen there by chance prompt to his time at eight in the morning he was at the police station where another inspector was now on duty who however had been told of hewitts wish ah he said youre well to time mr hewitt that prisoners as limp as rags now hes begging of us to send to his sister does he say anything about that child says he dont know anything about it all a drunken freak his names oliver neale and he lives at morton terrace hampstead with his sister her names mrs isitt and youre to take this note and bring her back with you or at any rate some money and youre to say hes truly repentant the inspector concluded with a grin the distance was short and hewitt walked it morton terrace was a short row of pleasant old fashioned villas ivy grown and neat and no was as neat as any to the servant who answered his ring hewitt announced himself as a gentleman with a message from mrs isitts brother this did not seem to prepossess the girl in hewitts favour and she backed to the end of the hall and communicated with somebody on the stairs before finally showing hewitt into a room where he was quickly followed by mrs isitt she was a rather tall woman of perhaps thirty eight and had probably been attractive though now her face bore lines of sad grief hewitt noticed that she wore a very high black collar good morning mrs isitt he said im afraid my errand is not altogether pleasant the fact is your brother mr neale was not altogether sober last night and he is now at the police station where he wrote this note mrs isitt did not appear surprised and took the note with no more than a sigh yes she said it cant be concealed this is not the first time by many as you probably know if you are a friend of his she read the note and as she looked up hewitt said no i have not known him long i happened to be at the station last night and he rather attracted my attention by insisting in his intoxicated state on giving himself up for kidnapping a child charles seton mrs isitt started as though shot pale of cheek she glanced fearfully in hewitts face and there met a keen gaze that seemed to read her brain she saw that her secret was known but for a moment she struggled and her lips worked convulsively charles seton charles seton she said yes mrs isitt that is the name the child as a matter of fact was stolen by the person who bought these shoes for it do you recognise them he produced the shoes and held them before her the woman sank on the sofa behind her terrified but unable to take her eyes from hewitts come mrs isitt he said you have been recognised here is my card i am commissioned by the parents of the child to find who removed him and i think i have succeeded she took the card and glanced at it dazedly then she sank with a groaning sob with her face on the head of the sofa and as she did so hewitt could see a scar on the side of her neck peeping above her high collar illustration she sank with a groaning sob with her face on the head of the sofa oh my god the woman moaned then it has come to this he will die he will die the womans anguish was piteous to see hewitt had gained his point and was willing to spare her he placed his hand on her heaving shoulder and begged her not to distress herself the matter is rather difficult to understand mrs isitt he said if you will compose yourself perhaps you can explain i can assure you that there is no desire to be vindictive im afraid my manner upset you pray reassure yourself may i sit down nobody could by his manner more easily restore confidence and trust than hewitt when it pleased him mrs isitt lifted her head and gazed at him once more with a troubled though quieter expression i think you wrote mrs seton an anonymous letter hewitt said producing the first of those which mrs seton had brought him it was kind of you to reassure the poor woman oh tell me mrs isitt asked was she much upset at missing the little boy did it make her ill she was upset of course but perhaps the joy of recovering him compensated for all yes i took him back as soon as i possibly could really i did mr hewitt and oh i was so tempted my life has been so unhappy if you only knew she buried her face in her hands will you tell me hewitt suggested gently you see whatever happens an explanation of some sort is the first thing yes yes of course oh i am a wretched woman she paused for some little while and then went on mr hewitt my husband is a lunatic she paused again there was never a man mr hewitt so devoted to his wife and children as my husband he bore even with the continual annoyance of my brother whom you saw because he was my brother but a little more than a year ago as the result of an accident a tumour formed on his brain the thing is incurable except as a remote possibility by a most dangerous operation which the doctors fear to attempt except under most favourable conditions without that he must die sooner or later meantime he is insane though with many and sometimes long intervals of perfect lucidity when the disease attacked him there was little warning except from pains in the head till one dreadful night then he rose from bed a maniac and killed our child a little girl of six whom he was devotedly attached to he also cut my own throat with his razor but i recovered i would rather say nothing more of that it is too dreadful though indeed i think about little else there was another child a baby boy about a year old when his sister died and he he died of scarlet fever scarcely four months ago my husband was taken to a private asylum at willesden where he now is i visited him frequently and took the baby and it was almost terrible to see a part of his insanity no doubt how his fondness for that child grew when it died i never dared to tell him indeed the doctors forbade it in his state he would have died raving but he asked for it sometimes earnestly sometimes angrily till i almost feared to visit him then he began to demand it of the doctors and attendants and his excitement increased day by day i was told to prepare for the worst when i visited him he sometimes failed to recognise me and at others demanded the child fiercely i should tell you that it was only just about this time that it was found that the tumour existed and the idea of the operation was suggested but of course it was impossible in his disturbed condition i scarcely dared to go to see him and yet i did so long to dr bailey did indeed suggest that possibly we might find he would be quieted by being shown another child but i myself felt that to be very unlikely it was while things were in this state and about six or seven weeks ago that walking toward cricklewood one morning i saw a little fellow trotting along all alone who actually startled me startled me very much by his resemblance to our poor little one the likeness was one of those extraordinary ones that one only finds among young children this child was a little bigger and stronger than ours was when he died but then it was older probably very nearly the age and size our own would have been had it lived nobody else was in sight and i fancied the child looked about to cry so i went to it and spoke plainly it had strayed and could not tell me where it lived only that its name was charley i took it in my arms and it grew quite friendly as i talked to it suddenly dr baileys suggestion came in my mind if any child could deceive my poor husband surely this was the one of course i should have to find its parents probably through the police but why not at any rate take it to willesden in the meantime for an hour or so i could not resist the temptation i took the first available cab the result of the experiment almost frightened me my poor husband received the child with transports of delight kissed it and laughed and wept over it like a mother rather than a father and refused to give it up for hours the child of course would not answer to its strange name at first but he seemed an adaptable little thing and presently began calling my poor husband daddy i had not been so happy myself for months as i was as i watched them i had told dr bailey what i fear was not strictly true that i had borrowed the child from a friend at length i felt i must go and take the boy to the police and with great difficulty i managed to get it away my poor husband crying like a child well i took the little fellow to the station i judged nearest to where i found him and gave him up to the care of the inspector but i was a little frightened at having kept him so long and gave a false name and address still i learned from the inspector that the child had been inquired after and by whom illustration daddy my husband was quiet for some days after this but then he began to ask for his boy with more vehemence than ever he grew worse and worse and soon his ravings were terrible dr bailey urged me to bring the child again but what could i do i formed a desperate idea of going to mrs seton telling her the whole thing and imploring her to let me take the child again but then would that be likely would she allow her child to be placed in the arms of a lunatic one indeed who had already killed a child of his own i felt that the thing was impossible still i went to the house and walked about it again and again i scarcely knew why and my poor husband in his confinement screamed for his child till i dared not go near him so it was when one morning last monday morning i had passed the front of the setons house and turned up the lane at the side i could see over the low fence and hedge and as i came to the french window with the steps i saw that the window was open at one side and little charley was standing on the top step he recognised me smiled and called just as my own child would have done indeed as i stood there i almost fell into the delusion of my poor mad husband i took the gate in my hands shaking it impatiently and in attempting to open it from the wrong end found the hinges lift out i could see that nobody else was in the room behind the french window there was the temptation the overwhelming temptation and i was distracted i took the little fellow hurriedly in my arms and pulled the window to so that the bottom bolt fell into the floor socket then i replaced the gate as i found it and ran to where i knew there was a cab stand oh mr hewitt was it so very sinful and i meant to bring him back that same afternoon i really did the child was in indoor clothes and had no hat i called at a baby linen shop and bought hat cloak frock and a new pair of shoes then i hurried to willesden again the effect was magical my husband was happy once more but when at last i attempted to take the child away he would not let it go it was terrible oh i cant describe the scene dr bailey told me that come what might i must stay that night in a room his wife would provide for me and keep the child or perhaps i must sit up with my husband and let the child sleep on my knee in the end it was the latter that i did by the morning my senses were blunted and i scarcely cared what happened i determined that as i had gone so far i would keep the child that day at least indeed as i say whether by the influence of my husband i know not but i almost felt myself falling into his delusion that the child was ours i went home for an hour at midday taking the child and then my wretched brother saw it and got the whole story from me he told me that reward bills were out about the child and then i dimly realised that its mother must be suffering pain and i wrote the note you spoke of perhaps i had some little idea of delaying pursuit i dont know at any rate i wrote it and posted it at willesden as i went back my husband had been asleep when i left but now he was awake again and asking for the child once more there is little more to say i stayed that night and the next day and by that time my husband had become tranquil and rational as he had not been for months if only the improvement can be sustained they think of operating to morrow or the next day i carried charley back in the dusk intending to put him inside one of the gates ring and watch him safely in from a little way off but as i passed down the side lane i saw the french window open again and nobody near i had been that way before and felt bolder there i took his hat and cloak i had already changed his frock and after kissing him put him hastily through the window and came away but i had forgotten the new shoes i remembered them however when i got home and immediately conceived a fear that the childs parents might trace me by their means i mentioned this fear to my brother and it appeared to frighten him he borrowed some money of me yesterday and it seems got intoxicated in that state he is always anxious to do some noble action though he is capable i am grieved to say of almost any meanness when sober he lives here at my expense indeed and borrows money from his friends for drink these may seem hard things for a sister to say but everybody knows it he has wearied me and i have lost all shame of him i suppose in his muddled state he got the notion that he would accuse himself of what i had done and so shield me i expect he repented of his self sacrifice this morning though hewitt knew that he had but said nothing also he said nothing of the anonymous letter he had in his pocket wherein mr oliver neale had covertly demanded a hundred pounds for the restoration of charley seton he guessed however that that gentleman had feared making the appointment that the advertisement answering his letter had suggested to mr and mrs seton hewitt told the whole story omitting at first names and addresses i saw plainly he said in course of his talk that the child might easily have been taken from the french window i did not say so for mrs seton was already sufficiently distressed and the notion that the child was kidnapped and not simply lost might have made her worse just then the toys the cart with the string on it in particular had been dragged in the direction of the window and then nothing would be easier than for the child to open the window itself there was nothing but a drop bolt working very easily which the child must often have seen lifted and you will remember that the catch did not act once the child had opened the window and got outside the whole thing was simple the gate could be lifted the child taken and the window pulled to so that the bolt would fall into its place and leave all as before as to the previous occasion i thought it curious at first that the child should stray before lunch and yet not be heard of again till the evening and then apparently not be over fatigued but beyond these little things and what i inferred from the letter i had very little to help me indeed nothing in fact till i got the shoes and they didnt carry me very far the drunken rant of the man in the police station attracted me because he spoke not only of taking away the child but of buying it shoes now nobody could know of the buying of the shoes who did not know something more but i knew it was a woman who had taken charley as you know from the heel mark and the evidence of the shop people so that when the bemused fool talked of his sister and sacrificing himself for her and keeping her out of trouble and so on i ranged the case up in my mind and so far as i ventured i guessed it aright the police inspector knew nothing of the matter of the shoes nor of the fact of the person i was after being a woman so thought the thing no more than a drunken freak and now hewitt said before i tell you this womans name dont you think the poor creature has suffered enough both mrs seton and her husband agreed that she had and that so far as they were concerned no further steps should be taken and when she was told where to go mrs seton went off at once to offer mrs isitt her forgiveness and sympathy but mrs isitts punishment came in twenty four hours when her husband died in the surgeons hands the case of the ward lane tabernacle i among the few personal friendships that martin hewitt has allowed himself to make there is one for an eccentric but very excellent old lady named mrs mallett she must be more than seventy now but she is of robust and active not to say masculine habit and her relations with hewitt are irregular and curious he may not see her for many weeks perhaps for months until one day she will appear in the office push directly past kerrett who knows better than to attempt to stop her into the inner room and salute hewitt with a shake of the hand and a savage glare of the eye which would appall a stranger but which is quite amiably meant as for myself it was long ere i could find any resource but instant retreat before her gaze though we are on terms of moderate toleration now after her first glare she sits in the chair by the window and directs her glance at hewitts small gas grill and kettle in the fireplace a glance which hewitt with all expedition translates into tea slightly mollified by the tea mrs mallett condescends to remark in tones of tragic truculence on passing matters of conventional interest the weather the influenza her own health hewitts health and so forth any reply of hewitts being commonly received with either disregard or contempt in half an hours time or so she leaves the office with a stern command to hewitt to attend at her house and drink tea on a day and at a time named a command which hewitt obediently fulfils when he passes through a similarly exhilarating experience in mrs malletts back drawing room at her little freehold house in fulham altogether mrs mallett to a stranger is a singularly uninviting personality and indeed except hewitt who has learnt to appreciate her hidden good qualities i doubt if she has a friend in the world her studiously concealed charities are a matter of as much amusement as gratification to hewitt who naturally in the course of his peculiar profession comes across many sad examples of poverty and suffering commonly among the decent sort who hide their troubles from strangers eyes and suffer in secret when such a case is in his mind it is hewitts practice to inform mrs mallett of it at one of the tea ceremonies mrs mallett receives the story with snorts of incredulity and scorn but takes care while expressing the most callous disregard and contempt of the troubles of the sufferers to ascertain casually their names and addresses twenty four hours after which hewitt need only make a visit to find their difficulties in some mysterious way alleviated illustration slightly mollified by the tea mrs mallett never had any children and was early left a widow her appearance for some reason or another commonly leads strangers to believe her an old maid she lives in her little detached house with its square piece of ground attended by a housekeeper older than herself and one maid servant she lost her only sister by death soon after the events i am about to set down and now has i believe no relations in the world it was also soon after these events that her present housekeeper first came to her in place of an older and very deaf woman quite useless who had been with her before i believe she is moderately rich and that one or two charities will benefit considerably at her death also i should be far from astonished to find hewitts own name in her will though this is no more than idle conjecture the one possession to which she clings with all her soul her one pride and treasure is her great uncle josephs snuff box the lid of which she steadfastly believes to be made of a piece of noahs original ark discovered on the top of mount ararat by some intrepid explorer of vague identity about a hundred years ago this is her one weakness and woe to the unhappy creature who dares hint a suggestion that possibly the wood of the ark rotted away to nothing a few thousand years before her great uncle joseph ever took snuff i believe he would be bodily assaulted the box is brought out for hewitts admiration at every tea ceremony at fulham when hewitt handles it reverently and expresses as much astonishment and interest as if he had never seen or heard of it before it is on these occasions only that mrs malletts customary stiffness relaxes the sides of the box are of cedar of lebanon she explains which very possibly they are and the gold mountings were worked up from spade guineas which one can believe without undue strain on the reason and it is usually these times when the old lady softens under the combined influence of tea and uncle josephs snuff box that hewitt seizes to lead up to his hint of some starving governess or distressed clerk with the full confidence that the more savagely the story is received the better will the poor people be treated as soon as he turns his back it was her jealous care of uncle josephs snuff box that first brought mrs mallett into contact with martin hewitt and the occasion though not perhaps testing his acuteness to the extent that some did was nevertheless one of the most curious and fantastic on which he has ever been engaged she was then some ten or twelve years younger than she is now but hewitt assures me she looked exactly the same that is to say she was harsh angular and seemed little more than fifty years of age it was before the time of kerrett and another youth occupied the outer office hewitt sat late one afternoon with his door ajar when he heard a stranger enter the outer office and a voice which he afterwards knew well as mrs malletts ask is mr martin hewitt in yes maam i think so if you will write your name and is he in there and with three strides mrs mallett was at the inner door and stood before hewitt himself while the routed office lad stared helplessly in the rear mr hewitt mrs mallet said i have come to put an affair into your hands which i shall require to be attended to at once hewitt was surprised but he bowed politely and said with some suspicion of a hint in his tone yes i rather supposed you were in a hurry she glanced quickly in hewitts face and went on i am not accustomed to needless ceremony mr hewitt my name is mallett mrs mallett and here is my card i have come to consult you on a matter of great annoyance and some danger to myself the fact is i am being watched and followed by a number of persons hewitts gaze was steadfast but he reflected that possibly this curious woman was a lunatic the delusion of being watched and followed by unknown people being perhaps the most common of all also it was no unusual thing to have a lunatic visit the office with just such a complaint so he only said soothingly indeed that must be very annoying yes yes the annoyance is bad enough perhaps she answered shortly but i am chiefly concerned about my great uncle josephs snuff box this utterance sounded a trifle more insane than the other so hewitt answered a little more soothingly still ah of course a very important thing the snuff box no doubt it is mr hewitt it is important as i think you will admit when you have seen it here it is and she produced from a small handbag the article that hewitt was destined so often again to see and affect an interest in you may be incredulous mr hewitt but it is nevertheless a fact that the lid of this snuff box is made of the wood of the original ark that rested on mount ararat she handed the box to hewitt who murmured indeed very interesting very wonderful really and returned it to the lady immediately that mr hewitt was the property of my great uncle joseph simpson who once had the honour of shaking hands with his late majesty king george the fourth the box was presented to my uncle by and then mrs mallett plunged into the whole history and adventures of the box in the formula wherewith hewitt subsequently became so well acquainted and which need not be here set out in detail when the box had been properly honoured mrs mallett proceeded with her business i am convinced mr hewitt she said that systematic attempts are being made to rob me of this snuff box i am not a nervous or weak minded woman or perhaps i might have sought your assistance before the watching and following of myself i might have disregarded but when it comes to burglary i think it is time to do something certainly hewitt agreed well i have been pestered with demands for the box for some time past i have here some of the letters which i have received and i am sure i know at whose instigation they were sent she placed on the table a handful of papers of various sizes which hewitt examined one after another they were mostly in the same handwriting and all were unsigned every one was couched in a fanatically toned imitation of scriptural diction and all sorts of threats were expressed with many emphatic underlinings the spelling was not of the best the writing was mostly uncouth and the grammar was in ill shape in many places the thous and thees and their accompanying verbs falling over each other disastrously the purport of the messages was rather vaguely expressed but all seemed to make a demand for the restoration of some article held in extreme veneration this was alluded to in many figurative ways as the token of life the seal of the woman and so forth and sometimes mrs mallett was requested to restore it to the ark of the covenant one of the least vague of these singular documents ran thus thou of no faith put the bond of the woman clothed with the sun on the stoan sete in thy back garden this night or thy blood beest on your own hed give it back to us the five righteous only in this citty give us that what saves the faithful when the erth is swalloed up hewitt read over these fantastic missives one by one till he began to suspect that his client mad or not certainly corresponded with mad quakers then he said yes mrs mallett these are most extraordinary letters are there any more of them bless the man yes there were a lot that i burnt all the same crack brained sort of thing they are mostly in one handwriting hewitt said though some are in another but i confess i dont see any very direct reference to the snuff box oh but its the only thing they can mean mrs mallett replied with great positiveness why he wanted me to sell it him and last night my house was broken into in my absence and everything ransacked and turned over but not a thing was taken why because i had the box with me at my sisters and this is the only sacred relic in my possession and what saved the faithful when the world was swallowed up why the ark of course the old ladys manner was odd but notwithstanding the bizarre and disjointed character of her complaint hewitt had now had time to observe that she had none of the unmistakable signs of the lunatic her eye was steady and clear and she had none of the restless habits of the mentally deranged even at that time hewitt had met with curious adventures enough to teach him not to be astonished at a new one and now he set himself seriously to get at his clients case in full order and completeness come mrs mallett he said i am a stranger and i can never understand your case till i have it not as it presents itself to your mind in the order of importance of events but in the exact order in which they happened you had a great uncle i understand living in the early part of the century who left you at his death the snuff box which you value so highly now you suspect that somebody is attempting to extort or steal it from you tell me as clearly and simply as you can whom you suspect and the whole story of the attempts thats just what im coming to the old lady answered rather pettishly my uncle joseph had an old housekeeper who of course knew all about the snuff box and it is her son reuben penner who is trying to get it from me the old woman was half crazy with one extraordinary religious superstition and another and her son seems to be just the same my great uncle was a man of strong common sense and a churchman though he did think he could write plays and if it hadnt been for his restraint i believe that is i have been told mrs penner would have gone clean demented with religious mania well she died in course of time and my great uncle died some time after leaving me the most important thing in his possession i allude to the snuff box of course a good bit of property and a tin box full of his worthless manuscripts i became a widow at twenty six and since then i have lived very quietly in my present house in fulham a couple of years ago i received a visit from reuben penner i didnt recognise him which wasnt wonderful since i hadnt seen him for thirty years or more he is well over fifty now a large heavy faced man with uncommonly wild eyes for a greengrocer which is what he is though he dresses very well considering he was quite respectful at first and very awkward in his manner he took a little time to get his courage and then he began questioning me about my religious feelings well mr hewitt i am not the sort of person to stand a lecture from a junior and an inferior whatever my religious opinions may be and i pretty soon made him realise it but somehow he persevered he wanted to know if i would go to some place of worship that he called his tabernacle i asked him who was the pastor he said himself i asked him how many members of the congregation there were and the man was as solemn as an owl i assure you mr hewitt he actually said five i kept my countenance and asked why such a small number couldnt attend church or at any rate attach itself to some decent dissenting chapel and then the man burst out mad mad as a hatter he was as incoherent as such people usually are but as far as i could make out he talked among a lot of other things of some imaginary woman a woman standing on the moon and driven into a wilderness on the wings of an eagle the man was so madly possessed of his fancies that i assure you for a while he almost ceased to look ridiculous he was so earnest in his rant but i soon cut him short its best to be severe with these people its the only chance of bringing them to their senses reuben penner i said shut up your mother was a very decent person in her way i believe but she was half a lunatic with her superstitious notions and youre a bigger fool than she was imagine a grown man and of your age coming and asking me of all people in the world to leave my church and make another fool in a congregation of five with you to rave at me about women in the moon go away and look after your greengrocery and go to church or chapel like a sensible man go away and dont play the fool any longer i wont hear another word illustration reuben penner i said shut up when i talk like this i am usually attended to and in this case penner went away with scarcely another word i saw nothing of him for about a month or six weeks and then he came and spoke to me as i was cutting roses in my front garden this time he talked to begin with at least more sensibly mrs mallett he said you have in your keeping a very sacred relic i have i said left me by my great uncle joseph and what then well he hummed and hawed a little i wanted to ask if you might be disposed to part with it what i said dropping my scissors sell it well yes he answered putting on as bold a face as he could the notion of selling my uncle josephs snuff box in any possible circumstances almost made me speechless what i repeated sell it sell it it would be a sinful sacrilege his face quite brightened when i said this and he replied yes of course it would i think so myself maam but i fancied you thought otherwise in that case maam not being a believer yourself im sure you would consider it a graceful and a pious act to present it to my little tabernacle where it would be properly valued and it having been my mothers property he got no further i am not a woman to be trifled with mr hewitt and i believe i beat him out of the garden with my basket i was so infuriated i can scarcely remember what i did the suggestion that i should sell my uncle josephs snuff box to a greengrocer was bad enough the request that i should actually give it to his tabernacle was infinitely worse but to claim that it had belonged to his mother well i dont know how it strikes you mr hewitt but to me it seemed the last insult possible illustration i am not a woman to be trifled with shocking shocking of course hewitt said since she seemed to expect a reply and he called you an unbeliever too but what happened after that after that he took care not to bother me personally again but these wretched anonymous demands came in with all sorts of darkly hinted threats as to the sin i was committing in keeping my own property they didnt trouble me much i put em in the fire as fast as they came until i began to find i was being watched and followed and then i kept them very sensible hewitt observed very sensible indeed to do that but tell me as to these papers those you have here are nearly all in one handwriting but some as i have already said are in another now before all this business did you ever see reuben penners handwriting no never then you are not by any means sure that he has written any of these things but then who else could that of course is a thing to be found out at present at any rate we know this that if penner has anything to do with these letters he is not alone because of the second handwriting also we must not bind ourselves past other conviction that he wrote any one of them by the way i am assuming that they all arrived by post yes they did but the envelopes are not here have you kept any of them i hardly know there may be some at home is it important it may be but those i can see at another time please go on these things continued to arrive as i have said and i continued to burn them till i began to find myself watched and followed and then i kept them that was two or three months ago it is a most unpleasant sensation that of feeling that some unknown person is dogging your footsteps from corner to corner and observing all your movements for a purpose you are doubtful of once or twice i turned suddenly back but i never could catch the creatures of whom i am sure penner was one you saw these people of course well yes in a way with the corner of my eye you know but it was mostly in the evening it was a woman once but several times i feel certain it was penner and once i saw a man come into my garden at the back in the night and i feel quite sure that was penner was that after you had this request to put the article demanded on the stone seat in the garden the same night i sat up and watched from the bath room window expecting someone would come it was a dark night and the trees made it darker but i could plainly see someone come quietly over the wall and go up to the seat could you distinguish his face no it was too dark but i feel sure it was penner has penner any decided peculiarity of form or gait no hes just a big common sort of man but i tell you i feel certain it was penner for any particular reason no perhaps not but who else could it have been no im very sure it must have been penner hewitt repressed a smile and went on just so he said and what happened then he went up to the seat as i said and looked at it passing his hand over the top then i called out to him i said if i found him on my premises again by day or night id give him in charge of the police i assure you he got over the wall the second time a good deal quicker than the first and then i went to bed though i got a shocking cold in the head sitting at that open bath room window nobody came about the place after that till last night a few days ago my only sister was taken ill i saw her each day and she got worse yesterday she was so bad that i wouldnt leave her i sent home for some things and stopped in her house for the night to day i got an urgent message to come home and when i went i found that an entrance had been made by a kitchen window and the whole house had been ransacked but not a thing was missing were drawers and boxes opened everywhere most seemed to have been opened with keys but some were broken the place was turned upside down but as i said before not a thing was missing a very old woman very deaf who used to be my housekeeper but who does nothing now was in the house and so was my general servant they slept in rooms at the top and were not disturbed of course the old woman is too deaf to have heard anything and the maid is a very heavy sleeper the girl was very frightened but i pacified her before i came away as it happened i took the snuff box with me i had got very suspicious of late of course and something seemed to suggest that i had better make sure of it so i took it its pretty strong evidence that they have been watching me closely isnt it that they should break in the very first night i left the place and are you quite sure that nothing has been taken quite certain i have spent a long time in a very careful search and you want me i presume to find out definitely who these people are and get such evidence as may ensure their being punished that is the case of course i know reuben penner is the moving spirit im quite certain of that but still i can see plainly enough that as yet theres no legal evidence of it mind im not afraid of him not a bit that is not my character im not afraid of all the madmen in england but im not going to have them steal my property this snuff box especially precisely i hope you have left the disturbance in your house exactly as you found it oh of course and i have given strict orders that nothing is to be touched to morrow morning i should like you to come and look at it i must look at it certainly hewitt said but i would rather go at once pooh nonsense mrs mallett answered with the airy obstinacy that hewitt afterwards knew so well im not going home again now to spend an hour or two more my sister will want to know what has become of me and she mustnt suspect that anything is wrong or it may do all sorts of harm the place will keep till the morning and i have the snuff box safe with me you have my card mr hewitt havent you very well can you be at my house to morrow morning at half past ten i will be there and you can see all you want by daylight well consider that settled good day hewitt saw her to his office door and waited till she had half descended the stairs then he made for a staircase window which gave a view of the street the evening was coming on murky and foggy and the street lights were blotchy and vague outside a four wheeled cab stood and the driver eagerly watched the front door when mrs mallett emerged he instantly began to descend from the box with the quick invitation cab mum cab he seemed very eager for his fare and though mrs mallett hesitated a second she eventually entered the cab he drove off and hewitt tried in vain to catch a glimpse of the number of the cab behind it was always a habit of his to note all such identifying marks throughout a case whether they seemed important at the time or not and he has often had occasion to be pleased with the outcome now however the light was too bad no sooner had the cab started than a man emerged from a narrow passage opposite and followed he was a large rather awkward heavy faced man of middle age and had the appearance of a respectable artisan or small tradesman in his best clothes hewitt hurried downstairs and followed the direction the cab and the man had taken toward the strand but the cab by this time was swallowed up in the strand traffic and the heavy faced man had also disappeared hewitt returned to his office a little disappointed for the man seemed rather closely to answer mrs malletts description of reuben penner illustration cab mum ii punctually at half past ten the next morning hewitt was at mrs malletts house at fulham it was a pretty little house standing back from the road in a generous patch of garden and had evidently stood there when fulham was an outlying village hewitt entered the gate and made his way to the front door where two young females evidently servants stood they were in a very disturbed state and when he asked for mrs mallett assured him that nobody knew where she was and that she had not been seen since the previous afternoon but said hewitt she was to stay at her sisters last night i believe yes sir answered the more distressed of the two girls she in a cap but she hasnt been seen there this is her sisters servant and shes been sent over to know where she is and why she hasnt been there this the other girl in bonnet and shawl corroborated nothing had been seen of mrs mallett at her sisters since she had received the message the day before to the effect that the house had been broken into and im so frightened the other girl said whimperingly theyve been in the place again last night who have the robbers when i came in this morning but didnt you sleep here i i ought to ha done sir but but after mrs mallett went yesterday i got so frightened i went home at ten and the girl showed signs of tears which she had apparently been already indulging in and what about the old woman the deaf woman where was she she was in the house sir there was nowhere else for her to go and she was deaf and didnt know anything about what happened the night before and confined to her room and and so i didnt tell her i see hewitt said with a slight smile you left her here she didnt see or hear anything did she no sir she cant hear and she didnt see nothing and how do you know thieves have been in the house everythinks tumbled about worse than ever sir and all different from what it was yesterday and theres a box o papers in the attic broke open and all sorts o things have you spoken to the police no sir im that frightened i dont know what to do and missis was going to see a gentleman about it yesterday and very well i am that gentleman mr martin hewitt i have come down now to meet her by appointment did she say she was going anywhere else as well as to my office and to her sisters no sir and she shes got the snuff box with her and all this latter circumstance seemed largely to augment the girls terrors for her mistresss safety very well hewitt said i think id better just look over the house now and then consider what has become of mrs mallett if she isnt heard of in the meantime the girl found a great relief in hewitts presence in the house the deaf old house keeper who seldom spoke and never heard being as she said worse than nobody have you been in all the rooms hewitt asked no sir i was afraid when i came in i went straight upstairs to my room and as i was coming away i see the things upset in the other attic i went into mrs perks room next to mine shes the deaf old woman and she was there all right but couldnt hear anything then i came down and only just peeped into two of the rooms and saw the state they were in and then i came out into the garden and presently this young woman came with the message from mrs rudd very well well look at the rooms now hewitt said and they proceeded to do so all were in a state of intense confusion drawers taken from chests and bureaux littered about the floor with their contents scattered about them carpets and rugs had been turned up and flung into corners even pictures on the walls had been disturbed and while some hung awry others rested on the floor and on chairs the things however appeared to have been fairly carefully handled for nothing was damaged except one or two framed engravings the brown paper on the backs of which had been cut round with a knife and the wooden slats shifted so as to leave the backs of the engravings bare this the girl told hewitt had not been done on the night of the first burglary the other articles also had not on that occasion been so much disturbed as they now were mrs malletts bedroom was the first floor front here the confusion was if possible greater than in the other rooms the bed had been completely unmade and the clothes thrown separately on the floor and everything else was displaced it was here indeed that the most noticeable features of the disturbance were observed for on the side of the looking glass hung a very long old fashioned gold chain untouched and on the dressing table lay a purse with the money still in it and on the looking glass stuck into the crack of the frame was a half sheet of notepaper with this inscription scrawled in pencil to mr martin hewitt mrs mallett is alright and in frends hands she will return soon alright if you keep quiet but if you folloe her or take any steps the conseqinses will be very serious this paper was not only curious in itself and curious as being addressed to hewitt but it was plainly in the same handwriting as were the most of the anonymous letters which mrs mallett had produced the day before in hewitts office hewitt studied it attentively for a few moments and then thrust it in his pocket and proceeded to inspect the rest of the rooms all were the same simply well furnished rooms turned upside down the top floor consisted of three comfortable attics one used as a lumber room and the others used respectively as bedrooms for the servant and the deaf old woman none of these rooms appeared to have been entered the girl said on the first night but now the lumber room was almost as confused as the rooms downstairs two or three boxes were opened and their contents turned out one of these was what is called a steel trunk a small one which had held old papers the others were filled chiefly with old clothes the servants room next this was quite undisturbed and untouched and then hewitt was admitted to the room of mrs malletts deaf old pensioner the old woman sat propped up in her bed and looked with half blind eyes at the peak in the bedclothes made by her bent knees the servant screamed in her ear but she neither moved nor spoke hewitt laid his hand on her shoulder and said in the slow and distinct tones he had found best for reaching the senses of deaf people i hope you are well did anything disturb you in the night but she only turned her head half toward him and mumbled peevishly i wish youd bring my tea youre late enough this morning nothing seemed likely to be got from her and hewitt asked the servant is she altogether bedridden no the girl answered leastways she neednt be she stops in bed most of the time but she can get up when she likes ive seen her but missis humours her and lets her do as she likes and she gives plenty of trouble i dont believe shes as deaf as she makes out indeed hewitt answered deafness is convenient sometimes i know now i want you to stay here while i make some inquiries perhaps youd better keep mrs rudds servant with you if you want company i dont expect to be very long gone and in any case it wouldnt do for her to go to her mistress and say that mrs mallett is missing or it might upset her seriously hewitt left the house and walked till he found a public house where a post office directory was kept he took a glass of whisky and water most of which he left on the counter and borrowed the directory he found greengrocers in the trade section and ran his finger down the column till he came on this address penner reuben little marsh row hammersmith w then he returned the directory and found the best cab he could to take him to hammersmith little marsh row was not a vastly prosperous sort of place and the only shops were three all small two were chandlers and the third was a sort of semi shed of the greengrocery and coal persuasion with the name penner on a board over the door the shutters were all up though the door was open and the only person visible was a very smudgy boy who was in the act of wheeling out a sack of coals to the smudgy boy hewitt applied himself i dont see mr penner about he said will he be back soon the boy stared hard at hewitt no he said he wont es guv up the shop e paid is next weeks rent this mornin and retired illustration the boy stared hard at hewitt oh hewitt answered sharply retired has he and whats become of the stock eh where are the cabbages and potatoes e told me to give em to the pore an i did theres lots o pore lives round ere my mothers one an these ere coals is for er an im goin to ave the trolley for myself dear me hewitt answered regarding the boy with amused interest youre a very business like almoner and what will the tabernacle do without mr penner i dunno the boy answered closing the door behind him i dunno nothin about the tabernacle only where it is ah and where is it i might find him there perhaps ward lane fust on left second on right its a shop wots bin shut up next door to a stableyard and the smudgy boy started off with his trolley the tabernacle was soon found at some very remote period it had been an unlucky small shop but now it was permanently shuttered and the interior was lighted by holes cut in the upper panels of the shutters hewitt took a good look at the shuttered window and the door beside it and then entered the stable yard at the side to the left of the passage giving entrance to the yard there was a door which plainly was another entrance to the house and a still damp mud mark on the step proved it to have been lately used hewitt rapped sharply at the door with his knuckles presently a female voice from within could be heard speaking through the key hole in a very loud whisper who is it asked the voice hewitt stooped to the key hole and whispered back is mr penner here now no then i must come in and wait for him open the door a bolt was pulled back and the door cautiously opened a few inches hewitts foot was instantly in the jamb and he forced the door back and entered come he said in a loud voice ive come to find out where mr penner is and to see whoever is in here immediately there was an assault of fists on the inside of a door at the end of the passage and a loud voice said do you hear whoever you are ill give you five pounds if youll bring mr martin hewitt here his office is portsmouth street strand or the same if youll bring the police and the voice was that of mrs mallett hewitt turned to the woman who had opened the door and who now stood much frightened in the corner beside him come he said your keys quick and dont offer to stir or ill have you brought back and taken to the station the woman gave him a bunch of keys without a word hewitt opened the door at the end of the passage and once more mrs mallett stood before him prim and rigid as ever except that her bonnet was sadly out of shape and her mantle was torn thank you mr hewitt she said i thought youd come though where i am i know no more than adam somebody shall smart severely for this why and that woman that woman she pointed contemptuously at the woman in the corner who was about two thirds her height was going to search me me why mrs mallett blazing with suddenly revived indignation took a step forward and the woman vanished through the outer door come hewitt said no doubt youve been shamefully treated but we must be quiet for a little first i will make quite sure that nobody else is here and then well get to your house nobody was there the rooms were dreary and mostly empty the front room which was lighted by the holes in the shutters had a rough reading desk and a table with half a dozen wooden chairs this said hewitt is no doubt the tabernacle proper and there is very little to see in it come back now mrs mallett to your house and well see if some explanation of these things is not possible i hope your snuff box is quite safe mrs mallett drew it from her pocket and exhibited it triumphantly i told them they should never get it she said and they saw i meant it and left off trying she had straightened her bonnet and concealed the rent in her mantle as best she could as they emerged in the street she said the first thing of course is to bring the police into this place no i think we wont do that yet hewitt said in the first place the case is one of assault and detention and your remedy is by summons or action and then there are other things to speak of we shall get a cab in the high street and you shall tell me what has happened to you mrs malletts story was simple the cab in which she left hewitts office had travelled west and was apparently making for the locality of her sisters house but the evening was dark the fog increased greatly and she shut the windows and took no particular notice of the streets through which she was passing indeed with such a fog that would have been impossible she had a sort of undefined notion that some of the streets were rather narrow and dirty but she thought nothing of it since all cabmen are given to selecting unexpected routes after a time however the cab slowed made a sharp turn and pulled up the door was opened and here you are mum said the cabby she did not understand the sharp turn and had a general feeling that the place could not be her sisters but as she alighted she found she had stepped directly upon the threshold of a narrow door into which she was immediately pulled by two persons inside this she was sure must have been the side door in the stable yard through which hewitt himself had lately obtained entrance to the tabernacle before she had recovered from her surprise the door was shut behind her she struggled stoutly and screamed but the place she was in was absolutely dark she was taken by surprise and she found resistance useless they were men who held her and the voice of the only one who spoke she did not know he demanded in firm and distinct tones that the sacred thing should be given up and that mrs mallett should sign a paper agreeing to prosecute nobody before she was allowed to go she however as she asserted with her customary emphasis was not the sort of woman to give in to that she resolutely declined to do anything of the sort and promised her captors whoever they were a full and legal return for their behaviour then she became conscious that a woman was somewhere present and the man threatened that this woman should search her this threat mrs mallett met as boldly as the others she should like to meet the woman who would dare attempt to search her she said she defied anybody to attempt it as for her uncle josephs snuff box no matter where it was it was where they would not be able to get it that they should never have but sooner or later they should have something very unpleasant for their attempts to steal it this declaration had an immediate effect they importuned her no more and she was left in an inner room and the key was turned on her there she sat dozing occasionally the whole night her indomitable spirit remaining proof through all those doubtful hours of darkness once or twice she heard people enter and move about and each time she called aloud to offer as hewitt had heard a reward to anybody who should bring the police or communicate her situation to hewitt day broke and still she waited sleepless and unfed till hewitt at last arrived and released her on mrs malletts arrival at her house mrs rudds servant was at once despatched with reassuring news and hewitt once more addressed himself to the question of the burglary first mrs mallett he said did you ever conceal anything anything at all mind in the frame of an engraving no never were any of your engravings framed before you had them not one that i can remember they were mostly uncle josephs and he kept them with a lot of others in drawers he was rather a collector you know very well now come up to the attic something has been opened there that was not touched at the first attempt mrs malletts indignation at the second burglary was something to see but there was triumph in her manner she still had the snuff box see now said hewitt when the attic was reached here is a box full of papers do you know everything that was in it no i dont mrs mallett replied there were a lot of my uncles manuscript plays here you see the dead bridegroom or the drum of fortune and so on and there were a lot of autographs i took no interest in them although some were rather valuable i believe now bring your recollection to bear as strongly as you can hewitt said do you ever remember seeing in this box a paper bearing nothing whatever upon it but a wax seal oh yes i remember that well enough ive noticed it each time ive turned the box over which is very seldom it was a plain slip of vellum paper with a red seal cracked and rather worn some celebrated persons seal i suppose what about it hewitt was turning the papers over one at a time it doesnt seem to be here now he said do you see it no mrs mallett returned examining the papers herself it isnt it appears to be the only thing missing but why should they take it i think we are at the bottom of all this mystery now hewitt answered quietly it is the seal of the woman the what i dont understand the fact is mrs mallett that these people have never wanted your uncle josephs snuff box at all but that seal not wanted the snuff box nonsense why didnt i tell you penner asked for it wanted to buy it yes you did but so far as i can remember you never spoke of a single instance of penner mentioning the snuff box by name he spoke of a sacred relic and you of course very naturally assumed he spoke of the box none of the anonymous letters mentioned the box you know and once or twice they actually did mention a seal though usually the thing was spoken of in a roundabout and figurative way as is the manner of many people of strange beliefs in speaking of anything they particularly venerate moreover remember that when they had entrapped you last night the moment you mentioned the snuff box specifically by name they ceased troubling you and contented themselves with shutting you up all along these people reuben penner and the others have been after the seal and you have been defending the snuff box but why the seal did you never hear of joanna southcott oh yes of course she was an ignorant visionary who set up as prophetess eighty or ninety years ago or more joanna southcott as you may see by any suitable book of reference gave herself out as a prophetess in she was an ignorant woman and no doubt deceived herself and really believed in the extravagant claims she put forward she was to be the mother of the messiah she said and she was the woman driven into the wilderness as foretold in the twelfth chapter of the book of revelation she died at the end of when her followers numbered more than all fanatic believers though of course mostly ignorant people she had made rather a good thing in her lifetime by the sale of seals each of which was to secure the eternal salvation of the holder at her death of course many of the believers fell away but others held on as faithfully as ever asserting that the holy joanna would rise again and fulfil all the prophecies these poor people dwindled in numbers gradually and although they attempted to bring up their children in their own faith the whole belief has been practically extinct for years now you will remember that you told me of penners mother being a superstitious fanatic of some sort and that your uncle joseph had checked her extravagances the thing seems pretty plain now your uncle joseph possessed himself of joanna southcotts seal by way of removing from poor old mrs penner an object of a sort of idolatry and kept it as a curiosity reuben penner grew up strong in his mothers delusions and to him and the few believers he had gathered round him at his tabernacle the seal was an object worth risking anything to get i should think that probably it is the only one remaining in existence at the present moment you see he tried every way of getting at it first he tried to convert you to his belief then he tried to buy it and you will remember his mentioning that it had been his mothers a suggestion which you thinking of the snuff box naturally resented after that he and his friends tried anonymous letters and at last grown desperate they resorted to watching you burglary and kidnapping their first nights raid was unsuccessful so last night they tried kidnapping you by the aid of a cabman possibly one of themselves when they had got you and you had at last given them to understand that it was your uncle josephs snuff box you were defending they tried the house again and this time were successful on the occasion of their first burglary they avoided the top floor because of the servant sleeping there this time she went home they probably saw her go and they got at the box in the attic i guessed they had succeeded then from a simple circumstance they had begun to cut out the backs of framed engravings for purposes of search but only some of the engravings were so treated that meant either that the article wanted was found behind one of them or that the intruders broke off in their picture examination to search somewhere else and were then successful and so under no necessity of opening the other engravings you assured me that nothing could have been concealed in any of the engravings so i at once assumed that they had found what they were after in the only place wherein they had not searched the night before the attic and probably among the papers in the trunk but then if they found it there why didnt they return and let me go because you would have found where they had brought you they probably intended to keep you there till the dark of the next evening and then take you away in a cab again and leave you some distance off to prevent my following and possibly finding you they left here on your looking glass this note hewitt produced it threatening all sorts of vague consequences if you were not left to them they knew you had come to me of course having followed you to my office and now penner feels himself anything but safe he has relinquished his greengrocery and dispensed his stock in charity and probably having got the seal the only thing he coveted in the world he has taken himself off not so much perhaps from fear of punishment as for fear the seal may be taken from him and with it the salvation his odd belief teaches him it will confer and then hewitt related the circumstance of the smudgy boy and his sack of coals mrs mallett sat silently for a little while and then said in a rather softened voice mr hewitt i am not what is called a woman of sentiment as you may have observed and i have been most shamefully treated over this wretched seal if that was really what penner wanted but if all you tell me has been actually what has happened i have a sort of perverse inclination to forgive the man in spite of myself the thing probably had been his mothers or at any rate he believed so and his giving up his little all to attain the object of his ridiculous faith and distributing his goods among the poor people and all that really its worthy of an old martyr if only it were done in the cause of a faith a little less stupid though of course he thinks his is the only religion as others do of theirs but then mrs mallett stiffened again theres not much to prove your theories is there hewitt smiled perhaps not he said except that to my mind at any rate everything points to my explanation being the only possible one the thing presented itself to you from the beginning as an attempt on the snuff box you value so highly and the possibility of the seal being the object aimed at never entered your mind i saw it whole from the outside and on thinking the thing over after our first interview i remembered joanna southcott i think you will find i am right well if you are as i said i half believe i shall forgive the man we will advertise if you like telling him he has nothing to fear if he can give an explanation of his conduct consistent with what he calls his religious belief absurd as it may be that night fell darker and foggier than the last the advertisement went into the daily papers but reuben penner never saw it late the next day a bargeman passing old swan pier struck some large object with his boat hook and brought it to the surface it was the body of a drowned man and it was afterwards identified as that of reuben penner late greengrocer of hammersmith how he came into the water there was nothing to show others have been drowned by accident on those foggy nights but then there have also been suicides in the river thames on nights just as foggy nobody knew there was no money nor any valuables found on the body and there was a story of a large heavy faced man who had given a poor woman a perfect stranger a watch and chain and a handful of money down near tower hill on that foggy evening but this again was only a story not definitely authenticated what was certain was that tied securely round the dead mans neck with a cord and gripped and crumpled tightly in his right hand was a soddened piece of vellum paper blank but carrying an old red seal of which the device was almost entirely rubbed and cracked away nobody at the inquest quite understood this transcribers note the final paragraph contains an apparent printing error after the words nobody knew possibly involving a missing line of
