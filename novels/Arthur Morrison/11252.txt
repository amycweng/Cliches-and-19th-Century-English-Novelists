proofreading team martin hewitt investigator by arthur morrison contents i the lenton croft robberies ii the loss of sammy crockett iii the case of mr foggatt iv the case of the dixon torpedo v the quinton jewel affair vi the stanway cameo mystery vii the affair of the tortoise martin hewitt investigator i the lenton croft robberies those who retain any memory of the great law cases of fifteen or twenty years back will remember at least the title of that extraordinary will case bartley v bartley and others which occupied the probate court for some weeks on end and caused an amount of public interest rarely accorded to any but the cases considered in the other division of the same court the case itself was noted for the large quantity of remarkable and unusual evidence presented by the plaintiffs sideevidence that took the other party completely by surprise and overthrew their case like a house of cards the affair will perhaps be more readily recalled as the occasion of the sudden rise to eminence in their profession of messrs crellan hunt crellan solicitors for the plaintiffa result due entirely to the wonderful ability shown in this case of building up apparently out of nothing a smashing weight of irresistible evidence that the firm has since maintainedindeed enhancedthe position it then won for itself need scarcely be said here its name is familiar to everybody but there are not many of the outside public who know that the credit of the whole performance was primarily due to a young clerk in the employ of messrs crellan who had been given charge of the seemingly desperate task of collecting evidence in the case this mr martin hewitt had however full credit and reward for his exploit from his firm and from their client and more than one other firm of lawyers engaged in contentious work made good offers to entice hewitt to change his employers instead of this however he determined to work independently for the future having conceived the idea of making a regular business of doing on behalf of such clients as might retain him similar work to that he had just done with such conspicuous success for messrs crellan hunt crellan this was the beginning of the private detective business of martin hewitt and his action at that time has been completely justified by the brilliant professional successes he has since achieved his business has always been conducted in the most private manner and he has always declined the help of professional assistants preferring to carry out himself such of the many investigations offered him as he could manage he has always maintained that he has never lost by this policy since the chance of his refusing a case begets competition for his services and his fees rise by a natural process at the same time no man could know better how to employ casual assistance at the right time some curiosity has been expressed as to mr martin hewitts system and as he himself always consistently maintains that he has no system beyond a judicious use of ordinary faculties i intend setting forth in detail a few of the more interesting of his cases in order that the public may judge for itself if i am right in estimating mr hewitts ordinary faculties as faculties very extraordinary indeed he is not a man who has made many friendships this probably for professional reasons notwithstanding his genial and companionable manners i myself first made his acquaintance as a result of an accident resulting in a fire at the old house in which hewitts office was situated and in an upper floor of which i occupied bachelor chambers i was able to help in saving a quantity of extremely important papers relating to his business and while repairs were being made allowed him to lock them in an old wallsafe in one of my rooms which the fire had scarcely damaged the acquaintance thus begun has lasted many years and has become a rather close friendship i have even accompanied hewitt on some of his expeditions and in a humble way helped him such of the cases however as i personally saw nothing of i have put into narrative form from the particulars given me i consider you brett he said addressing me the most remarkable journalist alive not because youre particularly clever you know because between ourselves i hope youll admit youre not but because you have known something of me and my doings for some years and have never yet been guilty of giving away any of my little business secrets you may have become acquainted with im afraid youre not so enterprising a journalist as some brett but now since you ask you shall write somethingif you think it worth while this he said as he said most things with a cheery chaffing goodnature that would have been perhaps surprising to a stranger who thought of him only as a grim and mysterious discoverer of secrets and crimes indeed the man had always as little of the aspect of the conventional detective as may be imagined nobody could appear more cordial or less observant in manner although there was to be seen a certain sharpness of the eyewhich might after all only be the twinkle of good humor i did think it worth while to write something of martin hewitts investigations and a description of one of his adventures follows at the head of the first flight of a dingy staircase leading up from an everopen portal in a street by the strand stood a door the dusty groundglass upper panel of which carried in its center the single word hewitt while at its righthand lower corner in smaller letters clerks office appeared on a morning when the clerks in the groundfloor offices had barely hung up their hats a short welldressed young man wearing spectacles hastening to open the dusty door ran into the arms of another man who suddenly issued from it i beg pardon the first said is this hewitts detective agency office yes i believe you will find it so the other replied he was a stoutish cleanshaven man of middle height and of a cheerful round countenance youd better speak to the clerk in the little outer office the visitor was met by a sharp lad with inky fingers who presented him with a pen and a printed slip the printed slip having been filled with the visitors name and present business and conveyed through an inner door the lad reappeared with an invitation to the private office there behind a writingtable sat the stoutish man himself who had only just advised an appeal to the clerk goodmorning mr lloydmr vernon lloyd he said affably looking again at the slip youll excuse my care to start even with my visitorsi must you know you come from sir james norris i see yes i am his secretary i have only to ask you to go straight to lenton croft at once if you can on very important business sir james would have wired but had not your precise address can you go by the next train eleventhirty is the first available from paddington quite possibly do you know any thing of the business it is a case of a robbery in the house or rather i fancy of several robberies jewelry has been stolen from rooms occupied by visitors to the croft the first case occurred some months agonearly a year ago in fact last night there was another but i think you had better get the details on the spot sir james has told me to telegraph if you are coming so that he may meet you himself at the station and i must hurry as his drive to the station will be rather a long one then i take it you will go mr hewitt twyford is the station yes i shall come and by the are you going by that train yourself no i have several things to attend to now i am in town goodmorning i shall wire at once mr martin hewitt locked the drawer of his table and sent his clerk for a cab at twyford station sir james norris was waiting with a dogcart sir james was a tall florid man of fifty or thereabout known away from home as something of a county historian and nearer his own parts as a great supporter of the hunt and a gentleman much troubled with poachers as soon as he and hewitt had found one another the baronet hurried the detective into his dogcart weve something over seven miles to drive he said and i can tell you all about this wretched business as we go that is why i came for you myself and alone hewitt nodded i have sent for you as lloyd probably told you because of a robbery at my place last evening it appears as far as i can guess to be one of three by the same hand or by the same gang late yesterday afternoon pardon me sir james hewitt interrupted but i think i must ask you to begin at the first robbery and tell me the whole tale in proper order it makes things clearer and sets them in their proper shape very well eleven months ago or thereabout i had rather a large party of visitors and among them colonel heath and mrs heaththe lady being a relative of my own late wife colonel heath has not been long retired you knowused to be political resident in an indian native state mrs heath had rather a good stock of jewelry of one sort and another about the most valuable piece being a bracelet set with a particularly fine pearlquite an exceptional pearl in factthat had been one of a heap of presents from the maharajah of his state when heath left india it was a very noticeable bracelet the gold setting being a mere featherweight piece of native filigree workalmost too fragile to trust on the wristand the pearl being as i have said of a size and quality not often seen well heath and his wife arrived late one evening and after lunch the following day most of the men being off by themselvesshooting i thinkmy daughter my sister who is very often down here and mrs heath took it into their heads to go walkingfernhunting and so on my sister was rather long dressing and while they waited my daughter went into mrs heaths room where mrs heath turned over all her treasures to show her as women do you know when my sister was at last ready they came straight away leaving the things littering about the room rather than stay longer to pack them up the bracelet with other things was on the dressingtable then one moment as to the door they locked it as they came away my daughter suggested turning the key as we had one or two new servants about and the window that they left open as i was going to tell you well they went on their walk and came back with lloyd whom they had met somewhere carrying their ferns for them it was dusk and almost dinnertime mrs heath went straight to her room andthe bracelet was gone was the room disturbed not a bit everything was precisely where it had been left except the bracelet the door hadnt been tampered with but of course the window was open as i have told you you called the police of course yes and had a man from scotland yard down in the morning he seemed a pretty smart fellow and the first thing he noticed on the dressingtable within an inch or two of where the bracelet had been was a match which had been lit and thrown down now nobody about the house had had occasion to use a match in that room that day and if they had certainly wouldnt have thrown it on the cover of the dressingtable so that presuming the thief to have used that match the robbery must have been committed when the room was getting darkimmediately before mrs heath returned in fact the thief had evidently struck the match passed it hurriedly over the various trinkets lying about and taken the most valuable nothing else was even moved nothing at all then the thief must have escaped by the window although it was not quite clear how the walking party approached the house with a full view of the window but saw nothing although the robbery must have been actually taking place a moment or two before they turned up there was no waterpipe within any practicable distance of the window but a ladder usually kept in the stableyard was found lying along the edge of the lawn the gardener explained however that he had put the ladder there after using it himself early in the afternoon of course it might easily have been used again after that and put back just what the scotland yard man said he was pretty sharp too on the gardener but very soon decided that he knew nothing of it no stranger had been seen in the neighborhood nor had passed the lodge gates besides as the detective said it scarcely seemed the work of a stranger a stranger could scarcely have known enough to go straight to the room where a ladyonly arrived the day beforehad left a valuable jewel and away again without being seen so all the people about the house were suspected in turn the servants offered in a body to have their boxes searched and this was done everything was turned over from the butlers to the new kitchenmaids i dont know that i should have had this carried quite so far if i had been the loser myself but it was my guest and i was in such a horrible position well theres little more to be said about that unfortunately nothing came of it all and the things as great a mystery now as ever i believe the scotland yard man got as far as suspecting me before he gave it up altogether but give it up he did in the end i think thats all i know about the first robbery is it clear oh yes i shall probably want to ask a few questions when i have seen the place but they can wait what next well sir james pursued the next was a very trumpery affair that i should have forgotten all about probably if it hadnt been for one circumstance even now i hardly think it could have been the work of the same hand four months or thereabout after mrs heaths disasterin february of this year in factmrs armitage a young widow who had been a schoolfellow of my daughters stayed with us for a week or so the girls dont trouble about the london season you know and i have no town house so they were glad to have their old friend here for a little in the dull time mrs armitage is a very active young lady and was scarcely in the house half an hour before she arranged a drive in a ponycart with evamy daughterto look up old people in the village that she used to know before she was married so they set off in the afternoon and made such a round of it that they were late for dinner mrs armitage had a small plain gold broochnot at all valuable you know two or three pounds i supposewhich she used to pin up a cloak or anything of that sort before she went out she stuck this in the pincushion on her dressingtable and left a ringrather a good one i believelying close by this asked hewitt was not in the room that mrs heath had occupied i take it no this was in another part of the building well the brooch wenttaken evidently by some one in a deuce of a hurry for when mrs armitage got back to her room there was the pincushion with a little tear in it where the brooch had been simply snatched off but the curious thing was that the ringworth a dozen of the broochwas left where it had been put mrs armitage didnt remember whether or not she had locked the door herself although she found it locked when she returned but my niece who was indoors all the time went and tried it oncebecause she remembered that a gasfitter was at work on the landing near byand found it safely locked the gasfitter whom we didnt know at the time but who since seems to be quite an honest fellow was ready to swear that nobody but my niece had been to the door while he was in sight of itwhich was almost all the time as to the window the sashline had broken that very morning and mrs armitage had propped open the bottom half about eight or ten inches with a brush and when she returned that brush sash and all were exactly as she had left them now i scarcely need tell you what an awkward job it must have been for anybody to get noiselessly in at that unsupported window and how unlikely he would have been to replace it with the brush exactly as he found it just so i suppose the brooch was really gone i mean there was no chance of mrs armitage having mislaid it oh none at all there was a most careful search then as to getting in at the window would it have been easy well yes sir james replied yes perhaps it would it was a firstfloor window and it looks over the roof and skylight of the billiardroom i built the billiardroom myselfbuilt it out from a smokingroom just at this corner it would be easy enough to get at the window from the billiardroom roof but then he added that couldnt have been the way somebody or other was in the billiardroom the whole time and nobody could have got over the roof which is nearly all skylight without being seen and heard i was there myself for an hour or two taking a little practice well was anything done strict inquiry was made among the servants of course but nothing came of it it was such a small matter that mrs armitage wouldnt hear of my calling in the police or anything of that sort although i felt pretty certain that there must be a dishonest servant about somewhere a servant might take a plain brooch you know who would feel afraid of a valuable ring the loss of which would be made a greater matter of well yes perhaps so in the case of an inexperienced thief who also would be likely to snatch up whatever she took in a hurry but im doubtful what made you connect these two robberies together nothing whateverfor some months they seemed quite of a different sort but scarcely more than a month ago i met mrs armitage at brighton and we talked among other things of the previous robberythat of mrs heaths bracelet i described the circumstances pretty minutely and when i mentioned the match found on the table she said how strange why my thief left a match on the dressingtable when he took my poor little brooch hewitt nodded yes he said a spent match of course yes of course a spent match she noticed it lying close by the pincushion but threw it away without mentioning the circumstance still it seemed rather curious to me that a match should be lit and dropped in each case on the dressingcover an inch from where the article was taken i mentioned it to lloyd when i got back and he agreed that it seemed significant scarcely said hewitt shaking his head scarcely so far to be called significant although worth following up everybody uses matches in the dark you know well at any rate the coincidence appealed to me so far that it struck me it might be worth while to describe the brooch to the police in order that they could trace it if it had been pawned they had tried that of course over the bracelet without any result but i fancied the shot might be worth making and might possibly lead us on the track of the more serious robbery quite so it was the right thing to do well well they found it a woman had pawned it in londonat a shop in chelsea but that was some time before and the pawnbroker had clean forgotten all about the womans appearance the name and address she gave were false so that was the end of that business had any of the servants left you between the time the brooch was lost and the date of the pawn ticket no were all your servants at home on the day the brooch was pawned oh yes i made that inquiry myself very good what next yesterdayand this is what made me send for you my late wifes sister came here last tuesday and we gave her the room from which mrs heath lost her bracelet she had with her a very oldfashioned brooch containing a miniature of her father and set in front with three very fine brilliants and a few smaller stones here we are though at the croft ill tell you the rest indoors hewitt laid his hand on the baronets arm dont pull up sir james he said drive a little farther i should like to have a general idea of the whole case before we go in very good sir james norris straightened the horses head again and went on late yesterday afternoon as my sisterinlaw was changing her dress she left her room for a moment to speak to my daughter in her room almost adjoining she was gone no more than three minutes or five at most but on her return the brooch which had been left on the table had gone now the window was shut fast and had not been tampered with of course the door was open but so was my daughters and anybody walking near must have been heard but the strangest circumstance and one that almost makes me wonder whether i have been awake today or not was that there lay a used match on the very spot as nearly as possible where the brooch had beenand it was broad daylight hewitt rubbed his nose and looked thoughtfully before him umcurious certainly he said anything else nothing more than you shall see for yourself i have had the room locked and watched till you could examine it my sisterinlaw had heard of your name and suggested that you should be called in so of course i did exactly as she wanted that she should have lost that brooch of all things in my house is most unfortunate you see there was some small difference about the thing between my late wife and her sister when their mother died and left it its almost worse than the heaths bracelet business and altogether im not pleased with things i can assure you see what a position it is for me here are three ladies in the space of one year robbed one after another in this mysterious fashion in my house and i cant find the thief its horrible people will be afraid to come near the place and i can do nothing ah well well see perhaps we had better turn back now bytheby were you thinking of having any alterations or additions made to your house no what makes you ask i think you might at least consider the question of painting and decorating sir jamesor say putting up another coachhouse or something because i should like to be to the servants the architector the builder if you pleasecome to look around you havent told any of them about this business not a word nobody knows but my relatives and lloyd i took every precaution myself at once as to your little disguise be the architect by all means and do as you please if you can only find this thief and put an end to this horrible state of affairs youll do me the greatest service ive ever asked forand as to your fee ill gladly make it whatever is usual and three hundred in addition martin hewitt bowed youre very generous sir james and you may be sure ill do what i can as a professional man of course a good fee always stimulates my interest although this case of yours certainly seems interesting enough by itself most extraordinary dont you think so here are three persons all ladies all in my house two even in the same room each successively robbed of a piece of jewelry each from a dressingtable and a used match left behind in every case all in the most difficultone would say impossiblecircumstances for a thief and yet there is no clue well we wont say that just yet sir james we must see and we must guard against any undue predisposition to consider the robberies in a lump here we are at the lodge gate again is that your gardenerthe man who left the ladder by the lawn on the first occasion you spoke of mr hewitt nodded in the direction of a man who was clipping a box border yes will you ask him anything no no at any rate not now remember the building alterations i think if there is no objection i will look first at the room that the ladymrs hewitt looked up inquiringly my sisterinlaw mrs cazenove oh yes you shall come to her room at once thank you and i think mrs cazenove had better be there they alighted and a boy from the lodge led the horse and dogcart away mrs cazenove was a thin and faded but quick and energetic lady of middle age she bent her head very slightly on learning martin hewitts name and said i must thank you mr hewitt for your very prompt attention i need scarcely say that any help you can afford in tracing the thief who has my propertywhoever it may bewill make me most grateful my room is quite ready for you to examine the room was on the second floorthe top floor at that part of the building some slight confusion of small articles of dress was observable in parts of the room this i take it inquired hewitt is exactly as it was at the time the brooch was missed precisely mrs cazenove answered i have used another room and put myself to some other inconveniences to avoid any disturbance hewitt stood before the dressingtable then this is the used match he observed exactly where it was found yes where was the brooch i should say almost on the very same spot certainly no more than a very few inches away hewitt examined the match closely it is burned very little he remarked it would appear to have gone out at once could you hear it struck i heard nothing whatever absolutely nothing if you will step into miss norris room now for a moment hewitt suggested we will try an experiment tell me if you hear matches struck and how many where is the matchstand the matchstand proved to be empty but matches were found in miss norris room and the test was made each striking could be heard distinctly even with one of the doors pushed to both your own door and miss norris were open i understand the window shut and fastened inside as it is now and nothing but the brooch was disturbed yes that was so thank you mrs cazenove i dont think i need trouble you any further just at present i think sir james hewitt added turning to the baronet who was standing by the doori think we will see the other room and take a walk outside the house if you please i suppose by the by that there is no getting at the matches left behind on the first and second occasions no sir james answered certainly not here the scotland yard man may have kept his the room that mrs armitage had occupied presented no peculiar feature a few feet below the window the roof of the billiardroom was visible consisting largely of skylight hewitt glanced casually about the walls ascertained that the furniture and hangings had not been materially changed since the second robbery and expressed his desire to see the windows from the outside before leaving the room however he wished to know the names of any persons who were known to have been about the house on the occasions of all three robberies just carry your mind back sir james he said begin with yourself for instance where were you at these times when mrs heath lost her bracelet i was in tagley wood all the afternoon when mrs armitage was robbed i believe i was somewhere about the place most of the time she was out yesterday i was down at the farm sir james face broadened i dont know whether you call those suspicious movements he added and laughed not at all i only asked you so that remembering your own movements you might the better recall those of the rest of the household was anybody to your knowledgeanybody mindin the house on all three occasions well you know its quite impossible to answer for all the servants youll only get that by direct questioningi cant possibly remember things of that sort as to the family and visitorswhy you dont suspect any of them do you i dont suspect a soul sir james hewitt answered beaming genially not a soul you see i cant suspect people till i know something about where they were its quite possible there will be independent evidence enough as it is but you must help me if you can the visitors now was there any visitor here each timeor even on the first and last occasions only no not one and my own sister perhaps you will be pleased to know was only there at the time of the first robbery just so and your daughter as i have gathered was clearly absent from the spot each timeindeed was in company with the party robbed your niece now why hang it all mr hewitt i cant talk of my niece as a suspected criminal the poor girls under my protection and i really cant allow hewitt raised his hand and shook his head deprecatingly my dear sir havent i said that i dont suspect a soul do let me know how the people were distributed as nearly as possible let me see it was your niece i think who found that mrs armitages door was lockedthis door in facton the day she lost her brooch yes it was just soat the time when mrs armitage herself had forgotten whether she locked it or not and yesterdaywas she out then no i think not indeed she goes out very littleher health is usually bad she was indoors too at the time of the heath robbery since you ask but come now i dont like this its ridiculous to suppose that she knows anything of it i dont suppose it as i have said i am only asking for information that is all your resident family i take it and you know nothing of anybody elses movementsexcept perhaps mr lloyds lloyd well you know yourself that he was out with the ladies when the first robbery took place as to the others i dont remember yesterday he was probably in his room writing i think that acquits him eh sir james looked quizzically into the broad face of the affable detective who smiled and replied oh of course nobody can be in two places at once else what would become of the alibi as an institution but as i have said i am only setting my facts in order now you see we get down to the servantsunless some stranger is the party wanted shall we go outside now lenton croft was a large desultory sort of house nowhere more than three floors high and mostly only two it had been added to bit by bit till it zigzagged about its site as sir james norris expressed it like a game of dominoes hewitt scrutinized its external features carefully as they strolled around and stopped some little while before the windows of the two bedrooms he had just seen from the inside presently they approached the stables and coachhouse where a groom was washing the wheels of the dogcart do you mind my smoking hewitt asked sir james perhaps you will take a cigar yourselfthey are not so bad i think i will ask your man for a light sir james felt for his own matchbox but hewitt had gone and was lighting his cigar with a match from a box handed him by the groom a smart little terrier was trotting about by the coachhouse and hewitt stooped to rub its head then he made some observation about the dog which enlisted the grooms interest and was soon absorbed in a chat with the man sir james waiting a little way off tapped the stones rather impatiently with his foot and presently moved away for full a quarter of an hour hewitt chatted with the groom and when at last he came away and overtook sir james that gentleman was about reentering the house i beg your pardon sir james hewitt said for leaving you in that unceremonious fashion to talk to your groom but a dog sir jamesa good dogwill draw me anywhere oh replied sir james shortly there is one other thing hewitt went on disregarding the others curtness that i should like to know there are two windows directly below that of the room occupied yesterday by mrs cazenoveone on each floor what rooms do they light that on the ground floor is the morningroom the other is mr lloydsmy secretary a sort of study or sittingroom now you will see at once sir james hewitt pursued with an affable determination to win the baronet back to goodhumoryou will see at once that if a ladder had been used in mrs heaths case anybody looking from either of these rooms would have seen it of course the scotland yard man questioned everybody as to that but nobody seemed to have been in either of the rooms when the thing occurred at any rate nobody saw anything still i think i should like to look out of those windows myself it will at least give me an idea of what was in view and what was not if anybody had been there sir james norris led the way to the morningroom as they reached the door a young lady carrying a book and walking very languidly came out hewitt stepped aside to let her pass and afterward said interrogatively miss norris your daughter sir james no my niece do you want to ask her anything dora my dear sir james added following her in the corridor this is mr hewitt who is investigating these wretched robberies for me i think he would like to hear if you remember anything happening at any of the three times the lady bowed slightly and said in a plaintive drawl i uncle really i dont remember anything nothing at all you found mrs armitages door locked i believe asked hewitt when you tried it on the afternoon when she lost her brooch oh yes i believe it was locked yes it was had the key been left in the key oh no i think not no do you remember anything out of the common happeninganything whatever no matter how trivialon the day mrs heath lost her bracelet no really i dont i cant remember at all nor yesterday no nothing i dont remember anything thank you said hewitt hastily thank you now the morningroom sir james in the morningroom hewitt stayed but a few seconds doing little more than casually glance out of the windows in the room above he took a little longer time it was a comfortable room but with rather effeminate indications about its contents little pieces of draped silkwork hung about the furniture and japanese silk fans decorated the mantelpiece near the window was a cage containing a gray parrot and the writingtable was decorated with two vases of flowers lloyd makes himself pretty comfortable eh sir james observed but it isnt likely anybody would be here while he was out at the time that bracelet went no replied hewitt meditatively no i suppose not he stared thoughtfully out of the window and then still deep in thought rattled at the wires of the cage with a quill toothpick and played a moment with the parrot then looking up at the window again he said that is mr lloyd isnt it coming back in a fly yes i think so is there anything else you would care to see here no thank you hewitt replied i dont think there is they went down to the smokingroom and sir james went away to speak to his secretary when he returned hewitt said quietly i think sir jamesi think that i shall be able to give you your thief presently what have you a clue who do you think i began to believe you were hopelessly stumped well yes i have rather a good clue although i cant tell you much about it just yet but it is so good a clue that i should like to know now whether you are determined to prosecute when you have the criminal why bless me of course sir james replied with surprise it doesnt rest with me you knowthe property belongs to my friends and even if they were disposed to let the thing slide i shouldnt allow iti couldnt after they had been robbed in my house of course of course then if i can i should like to send a message to twyford by somebody perfectly trustworthynot a servant could anybody go well theres lloyd although hes only just back from his journey but if its important hell go it is important the fact is we must have a policeman or two here this evening and id like mr lloyd to fetch them without telling anybody else sir james rang and in response to his message mr lloyd appeared while sir james gave his secretary his instructions hewitt strolled to the door of the smokingroom and intercepted the latter as he came out im sorry to give you this trouble mr lloyd he said but i must stay here myself for a little and somebody who can be trusted must go will you just bring back a policeconstable with you or rather twotwo would be better that is all that is wanted you wont let the servants know will you of course there will be a female searcher at the twyford policestation ahof course well you neednt bring her you know that sort of thing is done at the station and chatting thus confidentially martin hewitt saw him off when hewitt returned to the smokingroom sir james said suddenly why bless my soul mr hewitt we havent fed you im awfully sorry we came in rather late for lunch you know and this business has bothered me so i clean forgot everything else theres no dinner till seven so youd better let me give you something now im really sorry come along thank you sir james hewitt replied i wont take much a few biscuits perhaps or something of that sort and by the by if you dont mind i rather think i should like to take it alone the fact is i want to go over this case thoroughly by myself can you put me in a room any room you like where will you go the diningrooms rather large but theres my study thats pretty snug or perhaps i can go into mr lloyds room for half an hour or so i dont think hell mind and its pretty comfortable certainly if youd like ill tell them to send you whatever theyve got thank you very much perhaps theyll also send me a lump of sugar and a walnut itsits a little fad of mine awhat a lump of sugar and a walnut sir james stopped for a moment with his hand on the bellrope oh certainly if youd like it certainly he added and stared after this detective with curious tastes as he left the room when the vehicle bringing back the secretary and the policeman drew up on the drive martin hewitt left the room on the first floor and proceeded downstairs on the landing he met sir james norris and mrs cazenove who stared with astonishment on perceiving that the detective carried in his hand the parrotcage i think our business is about brought to a head now hewitt remarked on the stairs here are the police officers from twyford the men were standing in the hall with mr lloyd who on catching sight of the cage in hewitts hand paled suddenly this is the person who will be charged i think hewitt pursued addressing the officers and indicating lloyd with his finger what lloyd gasped sir james aghast nonot lloydnonsense he doesnt seem to think it nonsense himself does he hewitt placidly observed lloyd had sank on a chair and gray of face was staring blindly at the man he had run against at the office door that morning his lips moved in spasms but there was no sound the wilted flower fell from his buttonhole to the floor but he did not move this is his accomplice hewitt went on placing the parrot and cage on the hall table though i doubt whether there will be any use in charging him eh polly the parrot put his head aside and chuckled hullo polly it quietly gurgled come along sir james norris was hopelessly bewildered lloydlloyd he said under his breath lloydand that this was his little messenger his useful mercury hewitt explained tapping the cage complacently in fact the actual lifter hold him up the last remark referred to the wretched lloyd who had fallen forward with something between a sob and a loud sigh the policemen took him by the arms and propped him in his chair system said hewitt with a shrug of the shoulders an hour or two after in sir james study i cant say i have a system i call it nothing but commonsense and a sharp pair of eyes nobody using these could help taking the right road in this case i began at the match just as the scotland yard man did but i had the advantage of taking a line through three cases to begin with it was plain that that match being left there in daylight in mrs cazenoves room could not have been used to light the tabletop in the full glare of the window therefore it had been used for some other purposewhat purpose i could not at the moment guess habitual thieves you know often have curious superstitions and some will never take anything without leaving something behinda pebble or a piece of coal or something like thatin the premises they have been robbing it seemed at first extremely likely that this was a case of that kind the match had clearly been brought inbecause when i asked for matches there were none in the stand not even an empty box and the room had not been disturbed also the match probably had not been struck there nothing having been heard although of course a mistake in this matter was just possible this match then it was fair to assume had been lit somewhere else and blown out immediatelyi remarked at the time that it was very little burned plainly it could not have been treated thus for nothing and the only possible object would have been to prevent it igniting accidentally following on this it became obvious that the match was used for whatever purpose not as a match but merely as a convenient splinter of wood so far so good but on examining the match very closely i observed as you can see for yourself certain rather sharp indentations in the wood they are very small you see and scarcely visible except upon narrow inspection but there they are and their positions are regular see there are two on each side each opposite the corresponding mark of the other pair the match in fact would seem to have been gripped in some fairly sharp instrument holding it at two points above and two belowan instrument as it may at once strike you not unlike the beak of a bird now here was an idea what living creature but a bird could possibly have entered mrs heaths window without a laddersupposing no ladder to have been usedor could have got into mrs armitages window without lifting the sash higher than the eight or ten inches it was already open plainly nothing further it is significant that only one article was stolen at a time although others were about a human being could have carried any reasonable number but a bird could only take one at a time but why should a bird carry a match in its beak certainly it must have been trained to do that for a purpose and a little consideration made that purpose pretty clear a noisy chattering bird would probably betray itself at once therefore it must be trained to keep quiet both while going for and coming away with its plunder what readier or more probably effectual way than while teaching it to carry without dropping to teach it also to keep quiet while carrying the one thing would practically cover the other i thought at once of course of a jackdaw or a magpiethese birds thievish reputations made the guess natural but the marks on the match were much too wide apart to have been made by the beak of either i conjectured therefore that it must be a raven so that when we arrived near the coachhouse i seized the opportunity of a little chat with your groom on the subject of dogs and pets in general and ascertained that there was no tame raven in the place i also incidentally by getting a light from the coachhouse box of matches ascertained that the match found was of the sort generally used about the establishmentthe large thick redtopped english match but i further found that mr lloyd had a parrot which was a most intelligent pet and had been trained into comparative quietnessfor a parrot also i learned that more than once the groom had met mr lloyd carrying his parrot under his coat it having as its owner explained learned the trick of opening its cagedoor and escaping i said nothing of course to you of all this because i had as yet nothing but a train of argument and no results i got to lloyds room as soon as possible my chief object in going there was achieved when i played with the parrot and induced it to bite a quill toothpick when you left me in the smokingroom i compared the quill and the match very carefully and found that the marks corresponded exactly after this i felt very little doubt indeed the fact of lloyd having met the ladies walking before dark on the day of the first robbery proved nothing because since it was clear that the match had not been used to procure a light the robbery might as easily have taken place in daylight as notmust have so taken place in fact if my conjectures were right that they were right i felt no doubt there could be no other explanation when mrs heath left her window open and her door shut anybody climbing upon the open sash of lloyds high window could have put the bird upon the sill above the match placed in the birds beak for the purpose i have indicated and struck first in case by accident it should ignite by rubbing against something and startle the birdthis match would of course be dropped just where the object to be removed was taken up as you know in every case the match was found almost upon the spot where the missing article had been leftscarcely a likely triple coincidence had the match been used by a human thief this would have been done as soon after the ladies had left as possible and there would then have been plenty of time for lloyd to hurry out and meet them before darkespecially plenty of time to meet them coming back as they must have been since they were carrying their ferns the match was an article well chosen for its purpose as being a not altogether unlikely thing to find on a dressingtable and if noticed likely to lead to the wrong conclusions adopted by the official detective in mrs armitages case the taking of an inferior brooch and the leaving of a more valuable ring pointed clearly either to the operator being a fool or unable to distinguish values and certainly from other indications the thief seemed no fool the door was locked and the gasfitter so to speak on guard and the window was only eight or ten inches open and propped with a brush a human thief entering the window would have disturbed this arrangement and would scarcely risk discovery by attempting to replace it especially a thief in so great a hurry as to snatch the brooch up without unfastening the pin the bird could pass through the opening as it was and would have to tear the pincushion to pull the brooch off probably holding the cushion down with its claw the while now in yesterdays case we had an alteration of conditions the window was shut and fastened but the door was openbut only left for a few minutes during which time no sound was heard either of coming or going was it not possible then that the thief was already in the room in hiding while mrs cazenove was there and seized its first opportunity on her temporary absence the room is full of draperies hangings and what not allowing of plenty of concealment for a bird and a bird could leave the place noiselessly and quickly that the whole scheme was strange mattered not at all robberies presenting such unaccountable features must have been effected by strange means of one sort or another there was no improbability consider how many hundreds of examples of infinitely higher degrees of birdtraining are exhibited in the london streets every week for coppers so that on the whole i felt pretty sure of my ground but before taking any definite steps i resolved to see if polly could not be persuaded to exhibit his accomplishments to an indulgent stranger for that purpose i contrived to send lloyd away again and have a quiet hour alone with his bird a piece of sugar as everybody knows is a good parrot bribe but a walnut split in half is a betterespecially if the bird be used to it so i got you to furnish me with both polly was shy at first but i generally get along very well with pets and a little perseverance soon led to a complete private performance for my benefit polly would take the match mute as wax jump on the table pick up the brightest thing he could see in a great hurry leave the match behind and scuttle away round the room but at first wouldnt give up the plunder to me it was enough i also took the liberty as you know of a general look round and discovered that little collection of brummagem rings and trinkets that you have just seenused in pollys education no doubt when we sent lloyd away it struck me that he might as well be usefully employed as not so i got him to fetch the police deluding him a little i fear by talking about the servants and a female searcher there will be no trouble about evidence hell confess of that im sure i know the sort of man but i doubt if youll get mrs cazenoves brooch back you see he has been to london today and by this time the swag is probably broken up sir james listened to hewitts explanation with many expressions of assent and some of surprise when it was over he smoked a few whiffs and then said but mrs armitages brooch was pawned and by a woman exactly i expect our friend lloyd was rather disgusted at his small luckprobably gave the brooch to some female connection in london and she realized on it such persons dont always trouble to give a correct address the two smoked in silence for a few minutes and then hewitt continued i dont expect our friend has had an easy job altogether with that bird his successes at most have only been three and i suspect he had many failures and not a few anxious moments that we know nothing of i should judge as much merely from what the groom told me of frequently meeting lloyd with his parrot but the plan was not a bad onenot at all even if the bird had been caught in the act it would only have been that mischievous parrot you see and his master would only have been looking for him ii the loss of sammy crockett it was of course always a part of martin hewitts business to be thoroughly at home among any and every class of people and to be able to interest himself intelligently or to appear to do so in their various pursuits in one of the most important cases ever placed in his hands he could have gone but a short way toward success had he not displayed some knowledge of the more sordid aspects of professional sport and a great interest in the undertakings of a certain dealer therein the great case itself had nothing to do with sport and indeed from a narrative point of view was somewhat uninteresting but the man who alone held the one piece of information wanted was a keeper backer or gaffer of professional pedestrians and it was through the medium of his pecuniary interest in such matters that hewitt was enabled to strike a bargain with him the man was a publican on the outskirts of padfield a northern town pretty famous for its sporting tastes and to padfield therefore hewitt betook himself and arrayed in a way to indicate some inclination of his own toward sport he began to frequent the bar of the hare and hounds kentish the landlord was a stout bullnecked man of no great communicativeness at first but after a little acquaintance he opened out wonderfully became quite a jolly and rather intelligent companion and came out with innumerable anecdotes of his sporting adventures he could put a very decent dinner on the table too at the hare and hounds and hewitts frequent invitation to him to join therein and divide a bottle of the best in the cellar soon put the two on the very best of terms good terms with mr kentish was hewitts great desire for the information he wanted was of a sort that could never be extracted by casual questioning but must be a matter of open communication by the publican extracted in what way it might be look here said kentish one day ill put you on to a good thing my boya real good thing of course you know all about the padfield yards handicap being run off now well i havent looked into it much hewitt replied ran the first round of heats last saturday and monday didnt they they did wellkentish spoke in a stage whisper as he leaned over and rapped the tableive got the final winner in this house he nodded his head took a puff at his cigar and added in his ordinary voice dont say nothing no of course not got something on of course rather what do you think got any price i liked been saving him up for this why hes got twentyone yards and he can do even time all the way fact why he could win runnin backards he won his heat on monday likelikelike that the gaffer snapped his fingers in default of a better illustration and went on he might ha took it a little easier i think its shortened his price of course him jumpin in by two yards but you can get decent odds now if you go about it right you take my tipback him for his heat next saturday in the second round and for the final youll get a good price for the final if you pop it down at once but dont go makin a song of it will you now im givin you a tip i wouldnt give anybody else thanks very much its awfully good of you ill do what you advise but isnt there a dark horse anywhere else not dark to me my boy not dark to me i know every man runnin like a book old taylorhim over at the cophes got a very good lad at eighteen yards a very good lad indeed and hes a tryer this time i know but bless you my lad could give him ten instead o taking three and beat him then when im runnin a real tryer im generally runnin something very near a winner you bet and this time mind this time im runnin the certainest winner i ever runand i dont often make a mistake you back him i shall if youre as sure as that but who is he oh crocketts his namesammy crockett hes quite a new lad ive got young steggles looking after himsticks to him like wax takes his little breathers in my bit o ground at the back here ive got a cindersprint path there over behind the trees i dont let him out o sight much i can tell you hes a straight lad and he knows itll be worth his while to stick to me but theres some ud poison him if they thought hed spoil their books soon afterward the two strolled toward the taproom i expect sammyll be there the landlord said with steggles i dont hide him too muchtheyd think id got something extra on if i did in the taproom sat a lean wiredrawnlooking youth with sloping shoulders and a thin face and by his side was a rather short thickset man who had an odd air no matter what he did of proprietorship and surveillance of the lean youth several other men sat about and there was loud laughter under which the lean youth looked sheepishly angry tarnt no good sammy lad some one was saying you amakin after nancy webbshell ha nowt to do with ee don like em so threadpapery added another no sammy you arent the lad for she i see her what about nancy webb asked kentish pushing open the door sammys all right any way you keep fit my lad an go on improving and some day youll have as good a house as me never mind the lasses had his glass o beer has he this to raggy steggles who answering in the affirmative viewed his charge as though he were a post and the beer a recent coat of paint has two glasses of mild a day the landlord said to hewitt never puts on flesh so he can stand it come out now he nodded to steggles who rose and marched sammy crockett away for exercise on the following afternoon it was thursday as hewitt and kentish chatted in the landlords own snuggery steggles burst into the room in a great state of agitation and spluttered out hehes bolted gone away what sammygone hooked it i cant find him the landlord stared blankly at the trainer who stood with a sweater dangling from his hand and stared blankly back what dye mean kentish said at last dont be a fool hes in the place somewhere find him but this steggles defied anybody to do he had looked already he had left crockett at the cinderpath behind the trees in his runninggear with the addition of the long overcoat and cap he used in going between the path and the house to guard against chill i was goin to give him a bust or two with the pistol the trainer explained but when we got over tother side raggy ses he its blawin a bit chilly i think ill ha a sweater theres one on my box aint there so in i coomes for the sweater and it werent on his box and when i found it and got backhe werent there theyd seen nowt o him in t house and he werent nowhere hewitt and the landlord now thoroughly startled searched everywhere but to no purpose what should he go off the place for asked kentish in a sweat of apprehension taint chilly a bitits warm he didnt want no sweater never wore one before it was a piece of kid to be able to clear out nice thing this is i stand to win two years takings over him hereyoull have to find him ah but how exclaimed the disconcerted trainer dancing about distractedly ive got all i could scrape on him myself where can i look here was hewitts opportunity he took kentish aside and whispered what he said startled the landlord considerably yes ill tell you all about that he said if thats all you want its no good or harm to me whether i tell or no but can you find him that i cant promise of course but you know who i am now and what im here for if you like to give me the information i want ill go into the case for you and of course i shant charge any fee i may have luck you know but i cant promise of course the landlord looked in hewitts face for a moment then he said done its a deal very good hewitt replied get together the one or two papers you have and well go into my business in the evening as to crockett dont say a word to anybody im afraid it must get out since they all know about it in the house but theres no use in making any unnecessary noise dont make hedging bets or do anything that will attract notice now well go over to the back and look at this cinderpath of yours here steggles who was still standing near was struck with an idea how about old taylor at the cop guvnor eh he said meaningly his lads good enough to win with sammy out and taylor is backing him plenty think he knows any thing o this thats likely hewitt observed before kentish could reply yes look heresuppose steggles goes and keeps his eye on the cop for an hour or two in case theres anything to be heard of dont show yourself of course kentish agreed and the trainer went when hewitt and kentish arrived at the path behind the trees hewitt at once began examining the ground one or two rather large holes in the cinders were made as the publican explained by crockett in practicing getting off his mark behind these were several fresh tracks of spiked shoes the tracks led up to within a couple of yards of the high fence bounding the ground and there stopped abruptly and entirely in the fence a little to the right of where the tracks stopped there was a stout door this hewitt tried and found ajar thats always kept bolted kentish said hes gone out that wayhe couldnt have gone any other without comin through the house but he isnt in the habit of making a step three yards long is he hewitt asked pointing at the last footmark and then at the door which was quite that distance away from it besides he added opening the door theres no footprint here nor outside the door opened on a lane with another fence and a thick plantation of trees at the other side kentish looked at the footmarks then at the door then down the lane and finally back toward the house thats a licker he said this is a quiet sort of lane was hewitts next remark no houses in sight where does it lead that way it goes to the old kilnsdisused this way down to a turning off the padfield and catton road hewitt returned to the cinderpath again and once more examined the footmarks he traced them back over the grass toward the house certainly he said he hasnt gone back to the house here is the double line of tracks side by side from the housesteggles ordinary boots with iron tips and crocketts running pumps thus they came out here is steggles track in the opposite direction alone made when he went back for the sweater crockett remained you see various prints in those loose cinders at the end of the path where he moved this way and that and then two or three paces toward the fencenot directly toward the door you noticeand there they stop dead and there are no more either back or forward now if he had wings i should be tempted to the opinion that he flew straight away in the air from that spotunless the earth swallowed him and closed again without leaving a wrinkle on its face kentish stared gloomily at the tracks and said nothing however hewitt resumed i think ill take a little walk now and think over it you go into the house and show yourself at the bar if anybody wants to know how crockett is hes pretty well thank you by the by can i get to the copthis place of taylorsby this back lane yes down to the end leading to the catton road turn to the left and then first on the right any onell show you the cop and kentish shut the door behind the detective who straightway walkedtoward the old kilns in little more than an hour he was back it was now becoming dusk and the landlord looked out papers from a box near the side window of his snuggery for the sake of the extra light ive got these papers together for you he said as hewitt entered any news nothing very great heres a bit of handwriting i want you to recognize if you can get a light kentish lit a lamp and hewitt laid upon the table half a dozen small pieces of torn paper evidently fragments of a letter which had been torn up here reproduced in facsimile illustration six scraps of paper mmy throw them ou right away left hi hate his lane wr the landlord turned the scraps over regarding them dubiously these arent much to recognize anyhow i dont know the writing where did you find em they were lying in the lane at the back a little way down plainly they are pieces of a note addressed to some one called sammy or something very like it see the first piece with its mmy that is clearly from the beginning of the note because there is no line between it and the smooth straight edge of the paper above also nothing follows on the same line some one writes to crockettpresuming it to be a letter addressed to him as i do for other reasonsas sammy it is a pity that there is no more of the letter to be found than these pieces i expect the person who tore it up put the rest in his pocket and dropped these by accident kentish who had been picking up and examining each piece in turn now dolorously broke out oh its plain hes sold usbolted and done us me as took him out o the gutter too look herethrow them over thats plain enoughcant mean anything else means throw me over and my friendsme after what ive done for him then right awaygo right away i spose as he has done thenhe was fiddling with the scraps and finally fitted two togetherwhy look here this one with lane on it fits over the one about throwing over and it says poor f where its torn that means poor fool i sposeme or fathead or something like that thats nice why id twist his neck if i could get hold of him and i will hewitt smiled perhaps its not quite so uncomplimentary after all he said if you cant recognize the writing never mind but if hes gone away to sell you it isnt much use finding him is it he wont win if he doesnt want to why he wouldnt dare to rope under my very eyes idid well well perhaps well get him to run after all and as well as he can one thing is certainhe left this place of his own will further i think he is in padfield now he went toward the town i believe and i dont think he means to sell you well he shouldnt ive made it worth his while to stick to me ive put a fifty on for him out of my own pocket and told him so and if he won that would bring him a lump more than hed probably get by going crooked besides the prize money and anything i might give him over but it seems to me hes putting me in the cart altogether that we shall see meantime dont mention anything ive told you to any onenot even to steggles he cant help us and he might blurt things out inadvertently dont say anything about these pieces of paper which i shall keep myself bytheby steggles is indoors isnt he very well keep him in dont let him be seen hunting about this evening ill stay here tonight and well proceed with crocketts business in the morning and now well settle my business please in the morning hewitt took his breakfast in the snuggery carefully listening to any conversation that might take place at the bar soon after nine oclock a fast dogcart stopped outside and a redfaced loudvoiced man swaggered in greeting kentish with boisterous cordiality he had a drink with the landlord and said hows things fancy any of em for the sprint handicap got a lad o your own in havent you oh yes kentish replied crockett only a young un not got to his proper mark yet i reckon i think old taylors got no this time capital lad the other replied with a confidential nod shouldnt wonder at all want to do anything yourself over it no i dont think so im not on at present might have a little flutter on the grounds just for fun nothing else there were a few more casual remarks and then the redfaced man drove away who was that asked hewitt who had watched the visitor through the snuggery window thats danbybookmaker cute chap hes been told crocketts missing ill bet anything and come here to pump me no good though as a matter of fact ive worked sammy crockett into his books for about half im in for altogetherthrough third parties of course hewitt reached for his hat im going out for half an hour now he said if steggles wants to go out before i come back dont let him let him go and smooth over all those tracks on the cinderpath very carefully and by the by could you manage to have your son about the place today in case i happen to want a little help out of doors certainly ill get him to stay in but what do you want the cinders smoothed for hewitt smiled and patted his hosts shoulder ill explain all my tricks when the jobs done he said and went out on the lane from padfield to sedby village stood the plough beerhouse wherein j webb was licensed to sell by retail beer to be consumed on the premises or off as the thirsty list nancy webb with a very fine color a very curly fringe and a wide smiling mouth revealing a fine set of teeth came to the bar at the summons of a stoutish old gentleman in spectacles who walked with a stick the stoutish old gentleman had a glass of bitter beer and then said in the peculiarly quiet voice of a very deaf man can you tell me if you please the way into the main catton road down the lane turn to the right at the crossroads then first to the left the old gentleman waited with his hand to his ear for some few seconds after she had finished speaking and then resumed in his whispering voice im afraid im very deaf this morning he fumbled in his pocket and produced a notebook and pencil may i trouble you to write it down im so very deaf at times that ithank you the girl wrote the direction and the old gentleman bade her goodmorning and left all down the lane he walked slowly with his stick at the crossroads he turned put the stick under his arm thrust his spectacles into his pocket and strode away in the ordinary guise of martin hewitt he pulled out his notebook examined miss webbs direction very carefully and then went off another way altogether toward the hare and hounds kentish lounged moodily in his bar well my boy said hewitt has steggles wiped out the tracks not yet i havent told him but hes somewhere about ill tell him now no dont i dont think well have that done after all i expect hell want to go out soonat any rate some time during the day let him go whenever he likes ill sit upstairs a bit in the clubroom very well but how do you know steggles will be going out well hes pretty restless after his lost protege isnt he i dont suppose hell be able to remain idle long and about crockett do you give him up oh no dont you be impatient i cant say im quite confident yet of laying hold of himthe time is so short you seebut i think i shall at least have news for you by the evening hewitt sat in the clubroom until the afternoon taking his lunch there at length he saw through the front window raggy steggles walking down the road in an instant hewitt was downstairs and at the door the road bent eighty yards away and as soon as steggles passed the bend the detective hurried after him all the way to padfield town and more than half through it hewitt dogged the trainer in the end steggles stopped at a corner and gave a note to a small boy who was playing near the boy ran with the note to a bright wellkept house at the opposite corner martin hewitt was interested to observe the legend h danby contractor on a board over a gate in the side wall of the garden behind this house in five minutes a door in the side gate opened and the head and shoulders of the redfaced man emerged steggles immediately hurried across and disappeared through the gate this was both interesting and instructive hewitt took up a position in the side street and waited in ten minutes the trainer reappeared and hurried off the way he had come along the street hewitt had considerately left clear for him then hewitt strolled toward the smart house and took a good look at it at one corner of the small piece of forecourt garden near the railings a small baizecovered glassfronted noticeboard stood on two posts on its top edge appeared the words h danby houses to be sold or let but the only notice pinned to the green baize within was an old and dusty one inviting tenants for three shops which were suitable for any business and which would be fitted to suit tenants apply within hewitt pushed open the front gate and rang the doorbell there are some shops to let i see he said when a maid appeared i should like to see them if you will let me have the key masters out sir you cant see the shops till monday dear me thats unfortunate im afraid i cant wait till monday didnt mr danby leave any instructions in case anybody should inquire yes siras ive told you he said anybody who called about em must come again on monday oh very well then i suppose i must try one of the shops is in high street isnt it no sir theyre all in the new partgranville road ah im afraid that will scarcely do but ill see goodday martin hewitt walked away a couple of streets lengths before he inquired the way to granville road when at last he found that thoroughfare in a new and muddy suburb crowded with brickheaps and halffinished streets he took a slow walk along its entire length it was a melancholy example of baffled enterprise a row of a dozen or more shops had been built before any population had arrived to demand goods wouldbe tradesmen had taken many of these shops and failure and disappointment stared from the windows some were half covered by shutters because the scanty stock scarce sufficed to fill the remaining half others were shut almost altogether the inmates only keeping open the door for their own convenience and perhaps keeping down a shutter for the sake of a little light others again had not yet fallen so low but struggled bravely still to maintain a show of business and prosperity with very little success opposite the shops there still remained a dusty illtreated hedge and a forlornlooking field which an old board offered on building leases altogether a most depressing spot there was little difficulty in identifying the three shops offered for letting by mr h danby they were all together near the middle of the row and were the only ones that appeared not yet to have been occupied a dusty to let bill hung in each window with written directions to inquire of mr h danby or at no now no was a melancholy bakers shop with a stock of three loaves and a plate of stale buns the disappointed baker assured hewitt that he usually kept the keys of the shops but that the landlord mr danby had taken them away the day before to see how the ceilings were standing and had not returned them but if you was thinking of taking a shop here the poor baker added with some hesitation iiif youll excuse my advising youi shouldnt recommend it ive had a sickener of it myself hewitt thanked the baker for his advice wished him better luck in future and left to the hare and hounds his pace was brisk come he said as he met kentishs inquiring glance this has been a very good day on the whole i know where our man is now and i think we can get him by a little management where is he oh down in padfield as a matter of fact hes being kept there against his will we shall find i see that your friend mr danby is a builder as well as a bookmaker not a regular builder he speculates in a street of new houses now and again thats all but is he in it hes as deep in it as anybody i think now dont fly into a passion there are a few others in it as well but youll do harm if you dont keep quiet but go and get the police come and fetch him if you know where theyre keeping him why so we will if we cant do it without them but its quite possible we can and without all the disturbance and perhaps delay that calling in the police would involve consider now in reference to your own arrangements wouldnt it pay you better to get him back quietly without a soul knowingperhaps not even danby knowingtill the heat is run tomorrow well yes it would of course very good then so be it remember what i have told you about keeping your mouth shut say nothing to steggles or anybody is there a cab or brougham your son and i can have for the evening theres an old hiring landau in the stables you can shut up into a cab if thatll do excellent well run down to the town in it as soon as its ready but first a word about crockett what sort of a lad is he likely to give them trouble show fight and make a disturbance no i should say not hes no plucked un certainly all his manhoods in his legs i believe you see he aint a big sort o chap at best and hed be pretty easy put uponat least i guess so very good so much the better for then he wont have been damaged and they will probably only have one man to guard him now the carriage please young kentish was a sixfoot sergeant of grenadiers home on furlough and luxuriating in plain clothes he and hewitt walked a little way toward the town allowing the landau to catch them up they traveled in it to within a hundred yards of the empty shops and then alighted bidding the driver wait i shall show you three empty shops hewitt said as he and young kentish walked down granville road i am pretty sure that sammy crockett is in one of them and i am pretty sure that that is the middle one take a look as we go past when the shops had been slowly passed hewitt resumed now did you see anything about those shops that told a tale of any sort no sergeant kentish replied i cant say i noticed anything beyond the fact that they were emptyand likely to stay so i should think well stroll back and look in at the windows if nobodys watching us hewitt said you see its reasonable to suppose theyve put him in the middle one because that would suit their purpose best the shops at each side of the three are occupied and if the prisoner struggled or shouted or made an uproar he might be heard if he were in one of the shops next those inhabited so that the middle shop is the most likely now see there he went on as they stopped before the window of the shop in question over at the back theres a staircase not yet partitioned off it goes down below and up above on the stairs and on the floor near them there are muddy footmarks these must have been made today else they would not be muddy but dry and dusty since there hasnt been a shower for a week till today move on again then you noticed that there were no other such marks in the shop consequently the man with the muddy feet did not come in by the front door but by the back otherwise he would have made a trail from the door so we will go round to the back ourselves it was now growing dusk the small pieces of ground behind the shops were bounded by a low fence containing a door for each house this door is bolted inside of course hewitt said but there is no difficulty in climbing i think we had better wait in the garden till dark in the meantime the jailer whoever he is may come out in which case we shall pounce on him as soon as he opens the door you have that few yards of cord in your pocket i think and my handkerchief properly rolled will make a very good gag now over they climbed the fence and quietly approached the house placing themselves in the angle of an outhouse out of sight from the windows there was no sound and no light appeared just above the ground about a foot of window was visible with a grating over it apparently lighting a basement suddenly hewitt touched his companions arm and pointed toward the window a faint rustling sound was perceptible and as nearly as could be discerned in the darkness some white blind or covering was placed over the glass from the inside then came the sound of a striking match and at the side edge of the window there was a faint streak of light thats the place hewitt whispered come well make a push for it you stand against the wall at one side of the door and ill stand at the other and well have him as he comes out quietly now and ill startle them he took a stone from among the rubbish littering the garden and flung it crashing through the window there was a loud exclamation from within the blind fell and somebody rushed to the back door and flung it open instantly kentish let fly a heavy righthander and the man went over like a skittle in a moment hewitt was upon him and the gag in his mouth hold him hewitt whispered hurriedly ill see if there are others he peered down through the low window within sammy crockett his bare legs dangling from beneath his long overcoat sat on a packingbox leaning with his head on his hand and his back toward the window a guttering candle stood on the mantelpiece and the newspaper which had been stretched across the window lay in scattered sheets on the floor no other person besides sammy was visible they led their prisoner indoors young kentish recognized him as a publichouse loafer and racecourse ruffian well known in the neighborhood so its you is it browdie he said ive caught you one hard clump and ive half a mind to make it a score more but youll get it pretty warm one way or another before this jobs forgotten sammy crockett was overjoyed at his rescue he had not been illtreated he explained but had been thoroughly cowed by browdie who had from time to time threatened him savagely with an iron bar by way of persuading him to quietness and submission he had been fed and had taken no worse harm than a slight stiffness from his adventure due to his light underattire of jersey and kneeshorts sergeant kentish tied browdies elbows firmly together behind and carried the line round the ankles bracing all up tight then he ran a knot from one wrist to the other over the back of the neck and left the prisoner trussed and helpless on the heap of straw that had been sammys bed you wont be very jolly i expect kentish said for some time you cant shout and you cant walk and i know you cant untie yourself youll get a bit hungry too perhaps but thatll give you an appetite i dont suppose youll be disturbed till some time tomorrow unless our friend danby turns up in the meantime but you can come along to jail instead if you prefer it they left him where he lay and took sammy to the old landau sammy walked in slippers carrying his spiked shoes hanging by the lace in his hand ah said hewitt i think i know the name of the young lady who gave you those slippers crockett looked ashamed and indignant yes he said theyve done me nicely between em but ill pay herill hush hush hewitt said you mustnt talk unkindly of a lady you know get into this carriage and well take you home well see if i can tell you your adventures without making a mistake first you had a note from miss webb telling you that you were mistaken in supposing she had slighted you and that as a matter of fact she had quite done with somebody elseleft himof whom you were jealous isnt that so well yes young crockett answered blushing deeply under the carriagelamp but i dont see how you come to know that then she went on to ask you to get rid of steggles on thursday afternoon for a few minutes and speak to her in the back lane now your running pumps with their thin soles almost like paper no heels and long spikes hurt your feet horribly if you walk on hard ground dont they ay that they doenough to cripple you id never go on much hard ground with em theyre not like cricket shoes i see not a bit cricket shoes you can walk anywhere in well she knew thisi think i know who told herand she promised to bring you a new pair of slippers and to throw them over the fence for you to come out in i spose shes been tellin you all this crockett said mournfully you couldnt ha seen the letter i saw her tear it up and put the bits in her pocket she asked me for it in the lane in case steggles saw it well at any rate you sent steggles away and the slippers did come over and you went into the lane you walked with her as far as the road at the end and then you were seized and gagged and put into a carriage that was browdie did that said crockett and another chap i dont know butwhy this is padfield high street he looked through the window and regarded the familiar shops with astonishment of course it is where did you think it was why where was that place you found me in granville road padfield i suppose they told you you were in another town told me it was newstead hatch they drove for about three or four hours and kept me down on the floor between the seats so as i couldnt see where we was going done for two reasons said hewitt first to mystify you and prevent any discovery of the people directing the conspiracy and second to be able to put you indoors at night and unobserved well i think i have told you all you know yourself now as far as the carriage but there is the hare and hounds just in front well pull up here and ill get out and see if the coast is clear i fancy mr kentish would rather you came in unnoticed in a few seconds hewitt was back and crockett was conveyed indoors by a side entrance hewitts instructions to the landlord were few but emphatic dont tell steggles about it he said make an excuse to get rid of him and send him out of the house take crockett into some other bedroom not his own and let your son look after him then come here and ill tell you all about it sammy crockett was undergoing a heavy grooming with white embrocation at the hands of sergeant kentish when the landlord returned to hewitt does danby know youve got him he asked how did you do it danby doesnt know yet and with luck he wont know till he sees crockett running tomorrow the man who has sold you is steggles steggles steggles it is at the very first when steggles rushed in to report sammy crockett missing i suspected him you didnt i suppose no hes always been considered a straight man and he looked as startled as anybody yes i must say he acted it very well but there was something suspicious in his story what did he say crockett had remarked a chilliness and asked for a sweater which steggles went to fetch now just think you understand these things would any trainer who knew his business as steggles does have gone to bring out a sweater for his man to change for his jersey in the open air at the very time the man was complaining of chilliness of course not he would have taken his man indoors again and let him change there under shelter then supposing steggles had really been surprised at missing crockett wouldnt he have looked about found the gate open and told you it was open when he first came in he said nothing of thatwe found the gate open for ourselves so that from the beginning i had a certain opinion of steggles what you say seems pretty plain now although it didnt strike me at the time but if steggles was selling us why couldnt he have drugged the lad that would have been a deal simpler because steggles is a good trainer and has a certain reputation to keep up it would have done him no good to have had a runner drugged while under his care certainly it would have cooked his goose with you it was much the safer thing to connive at kidnapping that put all the active work into other hands and left him safe even if the trick failed now you remember that we traced the prints of crocketts spiked shoes to within a couple of yards from the fence and that there they ceased suddenly yes you said it looked as though he had flown up into the air and so it did but i was sure that it was by that gate that crockett had left and by no other he couldnt have got through the house without being seen and there was no other waylet alone the evidence of the unbolted gate therefore as the footprints ceased where they did and were not repeated anywhere in the lane i knew that he had taken his spiked shoes offprobably changed them for something else because a runner anxious as to his chances would never risk walking on bare feet with a chance of cutting them ordinary broad smoothsoled slippers would leave no impression on the coarse cinders bordering the track and nothing short of spiked shoes would leave a mark on the hard path in the lane behind the spiketracks were leading not directly toward the door but in the direction of the fence when they stopped somebody had handed or thrown the slippers over the fence and he had changed them on the spot the enemy had calculated upon the spikes leaving a track in the lane that might lead us in our search and had arranged accordingly so far so good i could see no footprints near the gate in the lane you will remember that i sent steggles off to watch at the cop before i went out to the backmerely of course to get him out of the way i went out into the lane leaving you behind and walked its whole length first toward the old kilns and then back toward the road i found nothing to help me except these small pieces of paperwhich are here in my pocketbook by the by of course this mmy might have meant jimmy or tommy as possibly as sammy but they were not to be rejected on that account certainly crockett had been decoyed out of your ground not taken by force or there would have been marks of a scuffle in the cinders and as his request for a sweater was probably an excusebecause it was not at all a cold afternoonhe must have previously designed going out inference a letter received and here were pieces of a letter now in the light of what i have said look at these pieces first there is the mmythat i have dealt with then see this throw them ovclearly a part of throw them over exactly what had probably been done with the slippers then the poor f coming just on the line before and seen by joining up with this other piece might easily be a reference to poor feet these coincidences one on the other went far to establish the identity of the letter and to confirm my previous impressions but then there is something else two other pieces evidently mean left him and right away perhaps but there is another containing almost all of the words hate his with the word hate underlined now who writes hate with the emphasis of underscoringwho but a woman the writing is large and not very regular it might easily be that of a halfeducated woman here was something moresammy had been enticed away by a woman now i remembered that when we went into the taproom on wednesday some of his companions were chaffing crockett about a certain nancy webb and the chaff went home as was plain to see the woman then who could most easily entice sammy crockett away was nancy webb i resolved to find who nancy webb was and learn more of her meantime i took a look at the road at the end of the lane it was damper than the lane being lower and overhung by trees there were many wheeltracks but only one set that turned in the road and went back the way it came toward the town and they were narrow wheelscarriage wheels crockett tells me now that they drove him about for a long time before shutting him up probably the inconvenience of taking him straight to the hidingplace didnt strike them when they first drove off a few inquiries soon set me in the direction of the plough and miss nancy webb i had the curiosity to look around the place as i approached and there in the garden behind the house were steggles and the young lady in earnest confabulation every conjecture became a certainty steggles was the lover of whom crockett was jealous and he had employed the girl to bring sammy out i watched steggles home and gave you a hint to keep him there but the thing that remained was to find steggles employer in this business i was glad to be in when danby called he came of course to hear if you would blurt out anything and to learn if possible what steps you were taking he failed by way of making assurance doubly sure i took a short walk this morning in the character of a deaf gentleman and got miss webb to write me a direction that comprised three of the words on these scraps of paperleft right and lane see they correspond the peculiar fs ts and all now i felt perfectly sure that steggles would go for his pay today in the first place i knew that people mixed up with shady transactions in professional pedestrianism are not apt to trust one another farthey know better therefore steggles wouldnt have had his bribe first but he would take care to get it before the saturday heats were run because once they were over the thing was done and the principal conspirator might have refused to pay up and steggles couldnt have helped himself again i hinted he should not go out till i could follow him and this afternoon when he went follow him i did i saw him go into danbys house by the side way and come away again danby it was then who had arranged the business and nobody was more likely considering his large pecuniary stake against crocketts winning this race but now how to find crockett i made up my mind he wouldnt be in danbys own house that would be a deal too risky with servants about and so on i saw that danby was a builder and had three shops to letit was on a paper before his house what more likely prison than an empty house i knocked at danbys door and asked for the keys of those shops i couldnt have them the servant told me danby was out a manifest lie for i had just seen him and that nobody could see the shops till monday but i got out of her the address of the shops and that was all i wanted at the time now why was nobody to see those shops till monday the interval was suspiciousjust enough to enable crockett to be sent away again and cast loose after the saturday racing supposing him to be kept in one of the empty buildings i went off at once and looked at the shops forming my conclusions as to which would be the most likely for danbys purpose here i had another confirmation of my ideas a poor halfbankrupt baker in one of the shops had by the bills the custody of a set of keys but he too told me i couldnt have them danby had taken them awayand on thursday the very daywith some trivial excuse and hadnt brought them back that was all i wanted or could expect in the way of guidance the whole thing was plain the rest you know all about well youre certainly as smart as they give you credit for i must say but suppose danby had taken down his to let notice what would you have done then we had our course even then we should have gone to danby astounded him by telling him all about his little games terrorized him with threats of the law and made him throw up his hand and send crockett back but as it is you see he doesnt know at this momentprobably wont know till tomorrow afternoonthat the lad is safe and sound here you will probably use the interval to make him pay for losing the gameby some of the ingenious financial devices you are no doubt familiar with ay that i will hell give any price against crockett now so long as the bet dont come direct from me but about crockett now hewitt went on wont this confinement be likely to have damaged his speed for a day or two ah perhaps the landlord replied but bless ye that wont matter theres four more in his heat tomorrow two i know arent tryers and the other two i can hold in at a couple of quid apiece any day the third round and final wont be till tomorrow week and hell be as fit as ever by then its as safe as ever it was how much are you going to have on ill lump it on for you safe enough this is a chance not to be missed its picking money up thank you i dont think ill have anything to do with it this professional pedestrian business doesnt seem a pretty one at all i dont call myself a moralist but if youll excuse my saying so the thing is scarcely the game i care to pick tap money at in any way oh very well if you think so i wont persuade ye though i dont think so much of your smartness as i did after that still we wont quarrel youve done me a mighty good turn that i must say and i only feel i arent level without doing something to pay the debt come now youve got your trade as ive got mine let me have the bill and ill pay it like a lord and feel a deal more pleased than if you made a favor of itnot that im above a favor of course but id prefer paying and thats a fact my dear sir you have paid hewitt said with a smile you paid in advance it was a bargain wasnt it that i should do your business if you would help me in mine very well a bargains a bargain and weve both performed our parts and you mustnt be offended at what i said just now that i wont but as to that raggy steggles once those heats are over tomorrow illwell it was on the following sunday week that martin hewitt in his rooms in london turned over his paper and read under the head padfield annual yards handicap this announcement final heat crockett first willis second trewby third owen howell a runaway win by nearly three yards iii the case of mr foggatt almost the only dogmatism that martin hewitt permitted himself in regard to his professional methods was one on the matter of accumulative probabilities often when i have remarked upon the apparently trivial nature of the clews by which he allowed himself to be guidedsometimes to all seeming in the very face of all likelihoodhe has replied that two trivialities pointing in the same direction became at once by their mere agreement no trivialities at all but enormously important considerations if i were in search of a man he would say of whom i knew nothing but that he squinted bore a birthmark on his right hand and limped and i observed a man who answered to the first peculiarity so far the clue would be trivial because thousands of men squint now if that man presently moved and exhibited a birthmark on his right hand the value of that squint and that mark would increase at once a hundred or a thousand fold apart they are little together much the weight of evidence is not doubled merely it would be only doubled if half the men who squinted had righthand birthmarks whereas the proportion if it could be ascertained would be perhaps more like one in ten thousand the two trivialities pointing in the same direction become very strong evidence and when the man is seen to walk with a limp that limp another triviality reenforcing the others brings the matter to the rank of a practical certainty the bertillon system of identificationwhat is it but a summary of trivialities thousands of men are of the same height thousands of the same length of foot thousands of the same girth of headthousands correspond in any separate measurement you may name it is when the measurements are taken together that you have your man identified forever just consider how few if any of your friends correspond exactly in any two personal peculiarities hewitts dogma received its illustration unexpectedly close at home the old house wherein my chambers and hewitts office were situated contained besides my own two or three more bachelors dens in addition to the offices on the ground and first and second floors at the very top of all at the back a fat middleaged man named foggatt occupied a set of four rooms it was only after a long residence by an accidental remark of the housekeepers that i learned the mans name which was not painted on his door or displayed with all the others on the wall of the groundfloor porch mr foggatt appeared to have few friends but lived in something as nearly approaching luxury as an old bachelor living in chambers can live an ascending case of champagne was a common phenomenon of the staircase and i have more than once seen a picture destined for the top floor of a sort that went far to awaken green covetousness in the heart of a poor journalist the man himself was not altogether prepossessing fat as he was he had a way of carrying his head forward on his extended neck and gazing widely about with a pair of the roundest and most prominent eyes i remember to have ever seen except in a fish on the whole his appearance was rather vulgar rather arrogant and rather suspicious without any very pronounced quality of any sort but certainly he was not pretty in the end however he was found shot dead in his sittingroom it was in this way hewitt and i had dined together at my club and late in the evening had returned to my rooms to smoke and discuss whatever came uppermost i had made a bargain that day with two speculative odd lots at a book sale each of which contained a hidden prize we sat talking and turning over these books while time went unperceived when suddenly we were startled by a loud report clearly it was in the building we listened for a moment but heard nothing else and then hewitt expressed his opinion that the report was that of a gunshot gunshots in residential chambers are not common things wherefore i got up and went to the landing looking up the stairs and down at the top of the next flight i saw mrs clayton the housekeeper she appeared to be frightened and told me that the report came from mr foggatts room she thought he might have had an accident with the pistol that usually lay on his mantelpiece we went upstairs with her and she knocked at mr foggatts door there was no reply through the ventilating fanlight over the door it could be seen that there were lights within a sign mrs clayton maintained that mr foggatt was not out we knocked again much more loudly and called but still ineffectually the door was locked and an application of the housekeepers key proved that the tenants key had been left in the lock inside mrs claytons conviction that something had happened became distressing and in the end hewitt pried open the door with a small poker something had happened in the sittingroom mr foggatt sat with his head bowed over the table quiet and still the head was ill to look at and by it lay a large revolver of the fullsized army pattern mrs clayton ran back toward the landing with faint screams run brett said hewitt a doctor and a policeman i bounced down the stairs half a flight at a time first i thought a doctor he may not be dead i could think of no doctor in the immediate neighborhood but ran up the street away from the strand as being the more likely direction for the doctor although less so for the policeman it took me a good five minutes to find the medico after being led astray by a red lamp at a private hotel and another five to get back with a policeman foggatt was dead without a doubt probably had shot himself the doctor thought from the powderblackening and other circumstances certainly nobody could have left the room by the door or he must have passed my landing while the fact of the door being found locked from the inside made the thing impossible there were two windows to the room both of which were shut one being fastened by the catch while the catch of the other was brokenan old fracture below these windows was a sheer drop of fifty feet or more without a foot or handhold near the windows in the other rooms were shut and fastened certainly it seemed suicideunless it were one of those accidents that will occur to people who fiddle ignorantly with firearms soon the rooms were in possession of the police and we were turned out we looked in at the housekeepers kitchen where her daughter was reviving and calming mrs clayton with gin and water you mustnt upset yourself mrs clayton hewitt said or what will become of us all the doctor thinks it was an accident he took a small bottle of sewingmachine oil from his pocket and handed it to the daughter thanking her for the loan there was little evidence at the inquest the shot had been heard the body had been foundthat was the practical sum of the matter no friends or relatives of the dead man came forward the doctor gave his opinion as to the probability of suicide or an accident and the police evidence tended in the same direction nothing had been found to indicate that any other person had been near the dead mans rooms on the night of the fatality on the other hand his papers bankbook etc proved him to be a man of considerable substance with no apparent motive for suicide the police had been unable to trace any relatives or indeed any nearer connections than casual acquaintances fellowclubmen and so on the jury found that mr foggatt had died by accident well brett hewitt asked me afterward what do you think of the verdict i said that it seemed to be the most reasonable one possible and to square with the commonsense view of the case yes he replied perhaps it does from the point of view of the jury and on their information their verdict was quite reasonable nevertheless mr foggatt did not shoot himself he was shot by a rather tall active young man perhaps a sailor but certainly a gymnasta young man whom i think i could identify if i saw him but how do you know this by the simplest possible inferences which you may easily guess if you will but think but then why didnt you say this at the inquest my dear fellow they dont want any inferences and conjectures at an inquest they only want evidence if i had traced the murderer of course then i should have communicated with the police as a matter of fact it is quite possible that the police have observed and know as much as i door more they dont give everything away at an inquest you know it wouldnt do but if you are right how did the man get away come we are near home now let us take a look at the back of the house he couldnt have left by foggatts landing door as we know and as he was there i am certain of that and as the chimney is out of the questionfor there was a good fire in the gratehe must have gone out by the window only one window is possiblethat with the broken catchfor all the others were fastened inside out of that window then he went but how the window is fifty feet up of course it is but why will you persist in assuming that the only way of escape by a window is downward see now look up there the window is at the top floor and it has a very broad sill over the window is nothing but the flat face of the gableend but to the right and a foot or two above the level of the top of the window an iron gutter ends observe it is not of lead composition but a strong iron gutter supported just at its end by an iron bracket if a tall man stood on the end of the windowsill steadying himself by the left hand and leaning to the right he could just touch the end of this gutter with his right hand the full stretch toe to finger is seven feet three inches i have measured it an active gymnast or a sailor could catch the gutter with a slight spring and by it draw himself upon the roof you will say he would have to be very active dexterous and cool so he would and that very fact helps us because it narrows the field of inquiry we know the sort of man to look for because being certain as i am that the man was in the room i know that he left in the way i am telling you he must have left in some way and all the other ways being impossible this alone remains difficult as the feat may seem the fact of his shutting the window behind him further proves his coolness and address at so great a height from the ground all this was very plain but the main point was still dark you say you know that another man was in the room i said how do you know that as i said by an obvious inference come now you shall guess how i arrived at that inference you often speak of your interest in my work and the attention with which you follow it this shall be a simple exercise for you you saw everything in the room as plainly as i myself bring the scene back to your memory and think over the various small objects littering about and how they would affect the case quick observation is the first essential for my work did you see a newspaper for instance yes there was an evening paper on the floor but i didnt examine it anything else on the table there was a whisky decanter taken from the tantalusstand on the sideboard and one glass that by the by i added looked as though only one person were present so it did perhaps although the inference wouldnt be very strong go on there was a fruitstand on the sideboard with a plate beside it containing a few nutshells a piece of apple a pair of nutcrackers and i think some orange peel there was of course all the ordinary furniture but no chair pulled up to the table except that used by foggatt himself thats all i noticed i think staythere was an ashtray on the table and a partly burned cigar near itonly one cigar though excellentexcellent indeed as far as memory and simple observation go you saw everything plainly and you remember everything surely now you know how i found out that another man had just left no i dont unless there were different kinds of ash in the ashtray that is a fairly good suggestion but there were notthere was only a single ash corresponding in every way to that on the cigar dont you remember everything that i did as we went downstairs you returned a bottle of oil to the housekeepers daughter i think i did doesnt that give you a hint come you surely have it now i havent then i shant tell you you dont deserve it think and dont mention the subject again till you have at least one guess to make the thing stares you in the face you see it you remember it and yet you wont see it i wont encourage your slovenliness of thought my boy by telling you what you can know for yourself if you like goodbyim off now theres a case in hand i cant neglect dont you propose to go further into this then hewitt shrugged his shoulders im not a policeman he said the case is in very good hands of course if anybody comes to me to do it as a matter of business ill take it up its very interesting but i cant neglect my regular work for it naturally i shall keep my eyes open and my memory in order sometimes these things come into the hands by themselves as it were in that case of course i am a loyal citizen and ready to help the law au revoir i am a busy man myself and thought little more of hewitts conundrum for some time indeed when i did think i saw no way to the answer a week after the inquest i took a holiday i had written my nightly leaders regularly every day for the past five years and saw no more of hewitt for six weeks after my return with still a few days of leave to run one evening we together turned into luzattis off coventry street for dinner i have been here several times lately hewitt said they feed you very well no not that tablehe seized my arm as i turned to an unoccupied corneri fancy its draughty he led the way to a longer table where a dark lithe and as well as could be seen tall young man already sat and took chairs opposite him we had scarcely seated ourselves before hewitt broke into a torrent of conversation on the subject of bicycling as our previous conversation had been of a literary sort and as i had never known hewitt at any other time to show the slightest interest in bicycling this rather surprised me i had however such a general outsiders grasp of the subject as is usual in a journalistofallwork and managed to keep the talk going from my side as we went on i could see the face of the young man opposite brighten with interest he was a rather finelooking fellow with a dark though very clear skin but had a hard angry look of eye a prominence of cheekbone and a squareness of jaw that gave him a rather uninviting aspect as hewitt rattled on however our neighbors expression became one of pleasant interest merely of course hewitt said weve a number of very capital men just now but i believe a deal in the forgotten riders of five ten and fifteen years back osmond i believe was better than any man riding now and i think it would puzzle some of them to beat furnivall as he was at his best but poor old cortisreally i believe he was as good as anybody nobody ever beat cortisexceptlet me seei think somebody beat cortis oncewho was it now i cant remember liles said the young man opposite looking up quickly ah yesliles it was charley liles wasnt it a championship mile championship cortis won the other three though yes so he did i saw cortis when he first broke the old mile record and straightway hewitt plunged into a whirl of talk of bicycles tricycles records racing cyclists hillier and synyer and noel whiting taylerson and appleyardtalk wherein the young man opposite bore an animated share while i was left in the cold our new friend it seems had himself been a prominent racing bicyclist a few years back and was presently at hewitts request exhibiting a neat gold medal that hung at his watchguard that was won he explained in the old tall bicycle days the days of bad tracks when every racing cyclist carried cinder scars on his face from numerous accidents he pointed to a blue mark on his forehead which he told us was a track scar and described a bad fall that had cost him two teeth and broken others the gaps among his teeth were plain to see as he smiled presently the waiter brought dessert and the young man opposite took an apple nutcrackers and a fruitknife lay on our side of the stand and hewitt turned the stand to offer him the knife no thanks he said i only polish a good apple never peel it its a mistake except with thickskinned foreign ones and he began to munch the apple as only a boy or a healthy athlete can presently he turned his head to order coffee the waiters back was turned and he had to be called twice to my unutterable amazement hewitt reached swiftly across the table snatched the halfeaten apple from the young mans plate and pocketed it gazing immediately with an abstracted air at a painted cupid on the ceiling our neighbor turned again looked doubtfully at his plate and the tablecloth about it and then shot a keen glance in the direction of hewitt he said nothing however but took his coffee and his bill deliberately drank the former gazing quietly at hewitt as he did it paid the latter and left immediately hewitt was on his feet and taking an umbrella which stood near followed just as he reached the door he met our late neighbor who had turned suddenly back your umbrella i think hewitt asked offering it yes thanks but the mans eye had more than its former hardness and his jaw muscles tightened as i looked he turned and went hewitt came back to me pay the bill he said and go back to your rooms i will come on later i must follow this manits the foggatt case as he went out i heard a cab rattle away and immediately after it another i paid the bill and went home it was ten oclock before hewitt turned up calling in at his office below on his way up to me mr sidney mason he said is the gentleman the police will be wanting tomorrow i expect for the foggatt murder he is as smart a man as i remember ever meeting and has done me rather neatly twice this evening you mean the man we sat opposite at luzattis of course yes i got his name of course from the reverse of that gold medal he was good enough to show me but i fear he has bilked me over the address he suspected me that was plain and left his umbrella by way of experiment to see if i were watching him sharply enough to notice the circumstance and to avail myself of it to follow him i was hasty and fell into the trap he cabbed it away from luzattis and i cabbed it after him he has led me a pretty dance up and down london tonight and two cabbies have made quite a stroke of business out of us in the end he entered a house of which of course i have taken the address but i expect he doesnt live there he is too smart a man to lead me to his den but the police can certainly find something of him at the house he went in atand i expect left by the back way by the way you never guessed that simple little puzzle as to how i found that this was a murder did you you see it now of course something to do with that apple you stole i suppose something to do with it i should think so you worthy innocent just ring your bell well borrow mrs claytons sewingmachine oil again on the night we broke into foggatts room you saw the nutshells and the bitten remains of an apple on the sideboard and you remembered it and yet you couldnt see that in that piece of apple possibly lay an important piece of evidence of course i never expected you to have arrived at any conclusion as i had because i had ten minutes in which to examine that apple and to do what i did with it but at least you should have seen the possibility of evidence in it first now the apple was white a bitten apple as you must have observed turns of a reddish brown color if left to stand long different kinds of apples brown with different rapidities and the browning always begins at the core this is one of the twenty thousand tiny things that few people take the trouble to notice but which it is useful for a man in my position to know a russet will brown quite quickly the apple on the sideboard was as near as i could tell a newtown pippin or other apple of that kind which will brown at the core in from twenty minutes to half an hour and in other parts in a quarter of an hour more when we saw it it was white with barely a tinge of brown about the exposed core inference somebody had been eating it fifteen or twenty minutes before perhaps a little longeran inference supported by the fact that it was only partly eaten i examined that apple and found it bore marks of very irregular teeth while you were gone i oiled it over and rushing down to my rooms where i always have a little plaster of paris handy for such work took a mold of the part where the teeth had left the clearest marks i then returned the apple to its place for the police to use if they thought fit looking at my mold it was plain that the person who had bitten that apple had lost two teeth one at top and one below not exactly opposite but nearly so the other teeth although they would appear to have been fairly sound were irregular in size and line now the dead man had as i saw a very excellent set of false teeth regular and sharp with none missing therefore it was plain that somebody else had been eating that apple do i make myself clear quite go on there were other inferences to be madeslighter but all pointing the same way for instance a man of foggatts age does not as a rule munch an unpeeled apple like a schoolboy inference a young man and healthy why i came to the conclusion that he was tall active a gymnast and perhaps a sailor i have already told you when we examined the outside of foggatts window it was also pretty clear that robbery was not the motive since nothing was disturbed and that a friendly conversation had preceded the murderwitness the drinking and the eating of the apple whether or not the police noticed these things i cant say if they had had their best men on they certainly would i think but the case to a rough observer looked so clearly one of accident or suicide that possibly they didnt as i said after the inquest i was unable to devote any immediate time to the case but i resolved to keep my eyes open the man to look for was tall young strong and active with a very irregular set of teeth a tooth missing from the lower jaw just to the left of the center and another from the upper jaw a little farther still toward the left he might possibly be a person i had seen about the premises i have a good memory for faces or of course he possibly might not just before you returned from your holiday i noticed a young man at luzattis whom i remembered to have seen somewhere about the offices in this building he was tall young and so on but i had a client with me and was unable to examine him more narrowly indeed as i was not exactly engaged on the case and as there are several tall young men about i took little trouble but today finding the same young man with a vacant seat opposite him i took the opportunity of making a closer acquaintance you certainly managed to draw him out oh yes the easiest person in the world to draw out is a cyclist the easiest cyclist to draw out is of course the novice but the next easiest is the veteran when you see a healthy welltrainedlooking man who nevertheless has a slight stoop in the shoulders and maybe a medal on his watchguard it is always a safe card to try him first with a little cycleracing talk i soon brought mr mason out of his shell read his name on his medal and had a chance of observing his teethindeed he spoke of them himself now as i observed just now there are several tall athletic young men about and also there are several men who have lost teeth but now i saw that this tall and athletic young man had lost exactly two teethone from the lower jaw just to the left of the center and another from the upper jaw farther still toward the left trivialities pointing in the same direction became important considerations more his teeth were irregular throughout and as nearly as i could remember it looked remarkably like this little plaster mold of mine he produced from his pocket an irregular lump of plaster about three inches long on one side of this appeared in relief the likeness of two irregular rows of six or eight teeth minus one in each row where a deep gap was seen in the position spoken of by my friend he proceeded this was enough at least to set me after this young man but he gave me the greatest chance of all when he turned and left his apple eaten unpeeled rememberanother important triviality on his plate im afraid i wasnt at all polite and i ran the risk of arousing his suspicions but i couldnt resist the temptation to steal it i did as you saw and here it is he brought the apple from his coatpocket one bitten side placed against the upper half of the mold fitted precisely a projection of apple filling exactly the deep gap the other side similarly fitted the lower half theres no getting behind that you see hewitt remarked merely observing the mans teeth was a guide to some extent but this is as plain as his signature or his thumb impression youll never find two men bite exactly alike no matter whether they leave distinct teethmarks or not here by the by is mrs claytons oil well take another mold from this apple and compare them he oiled the apple heaped a little plaster in a newspaper took my waterjug and rapidly pulled off a hard mold the parts corresponding to the merely broken places in the apple were of course dissimilar but as to the teethmarks the impressions were identical that will do i think hewitt said tomorrow morning brett i shall put up these things in a small parcel and take them round to bow street but are they sufficient evidence quite sufficient for the police purpose there is the man and all the resthis movements on the day and so forthare simple matters of inquiry at any rate that is police business i had scarcely sat down to my breakfast on the following morning when hewitt came into the room and put a long letter before me from our friend of last night he said read it this letter began abruptly and undated and was as follows to martin hewitt esq sir i must compliment you on the adroitness you exhibited this evening in extracting from me my name the address i was able to balk you of for the time being although by the time you read this you will probably have found it through the law list as i am an admitted solicitor that however will be of little use to you for i am removing myself i think beyond the reach even of your abilities of search i knew you well by sight and was perhaps foolish to allow myself to be drawn as i did still i had no idea that it would be dangerous especially after seeing you as a witness with very little to say at the inquest upon the scoundrel i shot your somewhat discourteous seizure of my apple at first amazed meindeed i was a little doubtful as to whether you had really taken itbut it was my first warning that you might be playing a deep game against me incomprehensible as the action was to my mind i subsequently reflected that i had been eating an apple instead of taking the drink he first offered me in the dead wretchs rooms on the night he came to his merited end from this i assume that your design was in some way to compare what remained of the two applesalthough i do not presume to fathom the depths of your detective system still i have heard of many of your cases and profoundly admire the keenness you exhibit i am thought to be a keen man myself but although i was able to some extent to hold my own tonight i admit that your acumen in this case alone is something beyond me i do not know by whom you are commissioned to hunt me nor to what extent you may be acquainted with my connection with the creature i killed i have sufficient respect for you however to wish that you should not regard me as a vicious criminal and a couple of hours to spare in which to offer you an explanation that will convince you that such is not altogether the case a hasty and violent temper i admit possessing but even now i can not forget the one crime it has led me intofor it is i suppose strictly speaking a crime for it was the man foggatt who made a felon of my father before the eyes of the world and killed him with shame it was he who murdered my mother and none the less murdered her because she died of a broken heart that he was also a thief and a hypocrite might have concerned me little but for that of my father i remember very little he must i fear have been a weak and incapable man in many respects he had no business abilitiesin fact was quite unable to understand the complicated business matters in which he largely dealt foggatt was a consummate master of all those arts of financial jugglery that make so many fortunes and ruin so many others in matters of company promoting stocks and shares he was unable to exercise them however because of a great financial disaster in which he had been mixed up a few years before and which made his name one to be avoided in future in these circumstances he made a sort of secret and informal partnership with my father who ostensibly alone in the business acted throughout on the directions of foggatt understanding as little what he did poor simple man as a schoolboy would have done the transactions carried on went from small to large and unhappily from honorable to dishonorable my father relied on the superior abilities of foggatt with an absolute trust carrying out each day the directions given him privately the previous evening buying selling printing prospectuses signing whatever had to be signed all with sole responsibility and as sole partner while foggatt behind the scenes absorbed the larger share of the profits in brief my unhappy and foolish father was a mere tool in the hands of the cunning scoundrel who pulled all the wires of the business himself unseen and irresponsible at last three companies for the promotion of which my father was responsible came to grief in a heap fraud was written large over all their history and while foggatt retired with his plunder my father was left to meet ruin disgrace and imprisonment from beginning to end he and he only was responsible there was no shred of evidence to connect foggatt with the matter and no means of escape from the net drawn about my father he lived through three years of imprisonment and then entirely abandoned by the man who had made use of his simplicity he diedof nothing but shame and a broken heart of this i knew nothing at the time again and again as a small boy i remember asking of my mother why i had no father at home as other boys hadunconscious of the stab i thus inflicted on her gentle heart of her my earliest as well as my latest memory is that of a pale weeping woman who grudged to let me out of her sight little by little i learned the whole cause of my mothers grief for she had no other confidant and i fear my character developed early for my first coherent remembrance of the matter is that of a childish design to take a tableknife and kill the bad man who had made my father die in prison and caused my mother to cry one thing however i never knewthe name of that bad man again and again as i grew older i demanded to know but my mother always withheld it from me with a gentle reminder that vengeance was for a greater hand than mine i was seventeen years of age when my mother died i believe that nothing but her strong attachment to myself and her desire to see me safely started in life kept her alive so long then i found that through all those years of narrowed means she had contrived to scrape and save a little moneysufficient as it afterward proved to see me through the examinations for entrance to my profession with the generous assistance of my fathers old legal advisers who gave me my articles and who have all along treated me with extreme kindness for most of the succeeding years my life does not concern the matter in hand i was a lawyers clerk in my benefactors service and afterward a qualified man among their assistants all through the firm were careful in pursuance of my poor mothers wishes that i should not learn the name or whereabouts of the man who had wrecked her life and my fathers i first met the man himself at the clifton club where i had gone with an acquaintance who was a member it was not till afterward that i understood his curious awkwardness on that occasion a week later i called as i had frequently done at the building in which your office is situated on business with a solicitor who has an office on the floor above your own on the stairs i almost ran against mr foggatt he started and turned pale exhibiting signs of alarm that i could not understand and asked me if i wished to see him no i replied i didnt know you lived here i am after somebody else just now arent you well he looked at me rather doubtfully and said he was not very well i met him twice or thrice after that and on each occasion his manner grew more friendly in a servile flattering and mean sort of waya thing unpleasant enough in anybody but doubly so in the intercourse of a man with another young enough to be his own son still of course i treated the man civilly enough on one occasion he asked me into his rooms to look at a rather fine picture he had lately bought and observed casually lifting a large revolver from the mantelpiece you see i am prepared for any unwelcome visitors to my little den he he conceiving him of course to refer to burglars i could not help wondering at the forced and hollow character of his laugh as we went down the stairs he said i think we know one another pretty well now mr mason eh and if i could do anything to advance your professional prospects i should be glad of the chance of course i understand the struggles of a young professional manhe he it was the forced laugh again and the man spoke nervously i think he added that if you will drop in tomorrow evening perhaps i may have a little proposal to make will you i assented wondering what this proposal could be perhaps this eccentric old gentleman was a good fellow after all anxious to do me a good turn and his awkwardness was nothing but a natural delicacy in breaking the ice i was not so flush of good friends as to be willing to lose one he might be desirous of putting business in my way i went and was received with cordiality that even then seemed a little overeffusive we sat and talked of one thing and another for a long while and i began to wonder when mr foggatt was coming to the point that most interested me several times he invited me to drink and smoke but long usage to athletic training has given me a distaste for both practices and i declined at last he began to talk about myself he was afraid that my professional prospects in this country were not great but he had heard that in some of the coloniessouth africa for exampleyoung lawyers had brilliant opportunities if youd like to go there he said ive no doubt with a little capital a clever man like you could get a grand practice together very soon or you might buy a share in some good established practice i should be glad to let you have l or even a little more if that wouldnt satisfy you and i stood aghast why should this man almost a stranger offer me l or even more if that wouldnt satisfy me what claim had i on him it was very generous of him of course but out of the question i was at least a gentleman and had a gentlemans selfrespect meanwhile he had gone maundering on in a halting sort of way and presently let slip a sentence that struck me like a blow between the eyes i shouldnt like you to bear illwill because of what has happened in the past he said your lateyour late lamented motherim afraidshe had unworthy suspicionsim sureit was best for all partiesyour father always appreciated i set back my chair and stood erect before him this groveling wretch forcing the words through his dry lips was the thief who had made another of my father and had brought to miserable ends the lives of both my parents everything was clear the creature went in fear of me never imagining that i did not know him and sought to buy me offto buy me from the remembrance of my dead mothers broken heart for ll that he had made my father steal for him i said not a word but the memory of all my mothers bitter years and a savage sense of this crowning insult to myself took a hold upon me and i was a tiger even then i verily believe that one word of repentance one tone of honest remorse would have saved him but he drooped his eyes snuffled excuses and stammered of unworthy suspicions and no illwill i let him stammer presently he looked up and saw my face and fell back in his chair sick with terror i snatched the pistol from the mantelpiece and thrusting it in his face shot him where he sat my subsequent coolness and quietness surprise me now i took my hat and stepped toward the door but there were voices on the stairs the door was locked on the inside and i left it so i went back and quietly opened a window below was a clear drop into darkness and above was plain wall but away to one side where the slope of the gable sprang from the roof an iron gutter ended supported by a strong bracket it was the only way i got upon the sill and carefully shut the window behind me for people were already knocking at the lobby door from the end of the sill holding on by the reveal of the window with one hand leaning and stretching my utmost i caught the gutter swung myself clear and scrambled on the roof i climbed over many roofs before i found in an adjoining street a ladder lashed perpendicularly against the front of a house in course of repair this to me was an easy opportunity of descent notwithstanding the boards fastened over the face of the ladder and i availed myself of it i have taken some time and trouble in order that you so far as i am aware the only human being beside myself who knows me to be the author of foggatts death shall have at least the means of appraising my crime at its just value of culpability how much you already know of what i have told you i can not guess i am wrong hardened and flagitious i make no doubt but i speak of the facts as they are you see the thing of course from your own point of viewi from mine and i remember my mother trusting that you will forgive the odd freak of a mana criminal let us saywho makes a confidant of the man set to hunt him down i beg leave to be sir your obedient servant sidney mason i read the singular document through and handed it back to hewitt how does it strike you hewitt asked mason would seem to be a man of very marked character i said certainly no fool and if his tale is true foggatt is no great loss to the world just soif the tale is true personally i am disposed to believe it is where was the letter posted it wasnt posted it was handed in with the others from the frontdoor letterbox this morning in an unstamped envelope he must have dropped it in himself during the night paper hewitt proceeded holding it up to the light turkey mill ruled foolscap envelope blue official shape piries watermark both quite ordinary and no special marks where do you suppose hes gone impossible to guess some might think he meant suicide by the expression beyond the reach even of your abilities of search but i scarcely think he is the sort of man to do that no there is no telling something may be got by inquiring at his late address of course but when such a man tells you he doesnt think you will find him you may count upon its being a difficult job his opinion is not to be despised what shall you do put the letter in the box with the casts for the police fiat justitia you know without any question of sentiment as to the apple i really think if the police will let me ill make you a present of it keep it somewhere as a souvenir of your absolute deficiency in reflective observation in this case and look at it whenever you feel yourself growing dangerously conceited it should cure you this is the history of the withered and almost petrified half apple that stands in my cabinet among a number of flint implements and one or two rather fine old roman vessels of mr sidney mason we never heard another word the police did their best but he had left not a track behind him his rooms were left almost undisturbed and he had gone without anything in the way of elaborate preparation for his journey and without leaving a trace of his intentions iv the case of the dixon torpedo hewitt was very apt in conversation to dwell upon the many curious chances and coincidences that he had observed not only in connection with his own cases but also in matters dealt with by the official police with whom he was on terms of pretty regular and indeed friendly acquaintanceship he has told me many an anecdote of singular happenings to scotland yard officials with whom he has exchanged experiences of inspector nettings for instance who spent many weary months in a search for a man wanted by the american government and in the end found by the merest accident a misdirected call that the man had been lodging next door to himself the whole of the time just as ignorant of course as was the inspector himself as to the enemy at the other side of the partywall also of another inspector whose name i can not recall who having been given rather meager and insufficient details of a man whom he anticipated having great difficulty in finding went straight down the stairs of the office where he had received instructions and actually fell over the man near the door where he had stooped down to tie his shoelace there were cases too in which when a great and notorious crime had been committed and various persons had been arrested on suspicion some were found among them who had long been badly wanted for some other crime altogether many criminals had met their deserts by venturing out of their own particular line of crime into another often a man who got into trouble over something comparatively small found himself in for a startlingly larger trouble the result of some previous misdeed that otherwise would have gone unpunished the ruble noteforger mirsky might never have been handed over to the russian authorities had he confined his genius to forgery alone it was generally supposed at the time of his extradition that he had communicated with the russian embassy with a view to giving himself upa foolish proceeding on his part it would seem since his whereabouts indeed even his identity as the forger had not been suspected he had communicated with the russian embassy it is true but for quite a different purpose as martin hewitt well understood at the time what that purpose was is now for the first time published the time was halfpast one in the afternoon and hewitt sat in his inner office examining and comparing the handwriting of two letters by the aid of a large lens he put down the lens and glanced at the clock on the mantelpiece with a premonition of lunch and as he did so his clerk quietly entered the room with one of those printed slips which were kept for the announcement of unknown visitors it was filled up in a hasty and almost illegible hand thus name of visitor f graham dixon address chancery lane business private and urgent show mr dixon in said martin hewitt mr dixon was a gaunt wornlooking man of fifty or so well although rather carelessly dressed and carrying in his strong though drawn face and dullish eyes the look that characterizes the lifelong strenuous brainworker he leaned forward anxiously in the chair which hewitt offered him and told his story with a great deal of very natural agitation you may possibly have heard mr hewitti know there are rumorsof the new locomotive torpedo which the government is about adopting it is in fact the dixon torpedo my own invention and in every respectnot merely in my own opinion but in that of the government expertsby far the most efficient and certain yet produced it will travel at least four hundred yards farther than any torpedo now made with perfect accuracy of aim a very great desideratum let me tell you and will carry an unprecedentedly heavy charge there are other advantagesspeed simple discharge and so forththat i neednt bother you about the machine is the result of many years of work and disappointment and its design has only been arrived at by a careful balancing of principles and means which are expressed on the only four existing sets of drawings the whole thing i need hardly tell you is a profound secret and you may judge of my present state of mind when i tell you that one set of drawings has been stolen from your house from my office in chancery lane this morning the four sets of drawings were distributed thus two were at the admiralty office one being a finished set on thick paper and the other a set of tracings therefrom and the other two were at my own office one being a penciled set uncoloreda sort of finished draft you understandand the other a set of tracings similar to those at the admiralty it is this last set that has gone the two sets were kept together in one drawer in my room both were there at ten this morning of that i am sure for i had to go to that very drawer for something else when i first arrived but at twelve the tracings had vanished you suspect somebody probably i can not it is a most extraordinary thing nobody has left the office except myself and then only to come to you since ten this morning and there has been no visitor and yet the drawings are gone but have you searched the place of course i have it was twelve oclock when i first discovered my loss and i have been turning the place upside down ever sincei and my assistants every drawer has been emptied every desk and table turned over the very carpet and linoleum have been taken up but there is not a sign of the drawings my men even insisted on turning all their pockets inside out although i never for a moment suspected either of them and it would take a pretty big pocket to hold the drawings doubled up as small as they might be you say your menthere are two i understandhad neither left the office neither and they are both staying in now worsfold suggested that it would be more satisfactory if they did not leave till something was done toward clearing the mystery up and although as i have said i dont suspect either in the least i acquiesced just so nowi am assuming that you wish me to undertake the recovery of these drawings the engineer nodded hastily very good i will go round to your office but first perhaps you can tell me something about your assistantssomething it might be awkward to tell me in their presence you know mr worsfold for instance he is my draughtsmana very excellent and intelligent man a very smart man indeed and i feel sure quite beyond suspicion he has prepared many important drawings for me he has been with me nearly ten years now and i have always found him trustworthy but of course the temptation in this case would be enormous still i can not suspect worsfold indeed how can i suspect anybody in the circumstances the other now his names ritter he is merely a tracer not a fully skilled draughtsman he is quite a decent young fellow and i have had him two years i dont consider him particularly smart or he would have learned a little more of his business by this time but i dont see the least reason to suspect him as i said before i cant reasonably suspect anybody very well we will get to chancery lane now if you please and you can tell me more as we go i have a cab waiting what else can i tell you i understand the position to be succinctly this the drawings were in the office when you arrived nobody came out and nobody went in and yet they vanished is that so that is so when i say that absolutely nobody came in of course i except the postman he brought a couple of letters during the morning i mean that absolutely nobody came past the barrier in the outer officethe usual thing you know like a counter with a frame of ground glass over it i quite understand that but i think you said that the drawings were in a drawer in your own roomnot the outer office where the draughtsmen are i presume that is the case it is an inner room or rather a room parallel with the other and communicating with it just as your own room is which we have just left but then you say you never left your office and yet the drawings vanishedapparently by some unseen agencywhile you were there in the room let me explain more clearly the cab was bowling smoothly along the strand and the engineer took out a pocketbook and pencil i fear he proceeded that i am a little confused in my explanationi am naturally rather agitated as you will see presently my offices consist of three rooms two at one side of a corridor and the other oppositethus he made a rapid pencil sketch illustration in the outer office my men usually work in the inner office i work myself these rooms communicate as you see by a door our ordinary way in and out of the place is by the door of the outer office leading into the corridor and we first pass through the usual lifting flap in the barrier the door leading from the inner office to the corridor is always kept locked on the inside and i dont suppose i unlock it once in three months it has not been unlocked all the morning the drawer in which the missing drawings were kept and in which i saw them at ten oclock this morning is at the place marked d it is a large chest of shallow drawers in which the plans lie flat i quite understand then there is the private room opposite what of that that is a sort of private sittingroom that i rarely use except for business interviews of a very private nature when i said i never left my office i did not mean that i never stirred out of the inner office i was about in one room and another both the outer and the inner offices and once i went into the private room for five minutes but nobody came either in or out of any of the rooms at that time for the door of the private room was wide open and i was standing at the bookcase i had gone to consult a book just inside the door with a full view of the doors opposite indeed worsfold was at the door of the outer office most of the short time he came to ask me a question well hewitt replied it all comes to the simple first statement you know that nobody left the place or arrived except the postman who couldnt get near the drawings and yet the drawings went is this your office the cab had stopped before a large stone building mr dixon alighted and led the way to the firstfloor hewitt took a casual glance round each of the three rooms there was a sort of door in the frame of ground glass over the barrier to admit of speech with visitors this door hewitt pushed wide open and left so he and the engineer went into the inner office would you like to ask worsfold and ritter any questions mr dixon inquired presently those are their coats i take it hanging just to the right of the outer office door over the umbrella stand yes those are all their thingscoats hats stick and umbrella and those coats were searched you say yes and this is the drawerthoroughly searched of course oh certainly every drawer was taken out and turned over well of course i must assume you made no mistake in your hunt now tell me did anybody know where these plans were beyond yourself and your two men as far as i can tell not a soul you dont keep an office boy no there would be nothing for him to do except to post a letter now and again which ritter does quite well for as you are quite sure that the drawings were there at ten oclock perhaps the thing scarcely matters but i may as well know if your men have keys of the office neither i have patent locks to each door and i keep all the keys myself if worsfold or ritter arrive before me in the morning they have to wait to be let in and i am always present myself when the rooms are cleaned i have not neglected precautions you see no i suppose the object of the theftassuming it is a theftis pretty plain the thief would offer the drawings for sale to some foreign government of course they would probably command a great sum i have been looking as i need hardly tell you to that invention to secure me a very large fortune and i shall be ruined indeed if the design is taken abroad i am under the strictest engagements to secrecy with the admiralty and not only should i lose all my labor but i should lose all the confidence reposed in me at headquarters should in fact be subject to penalties for breach of contract and my career stopped forever i can not tell you what a serious business this is for me if you can not help me the consequences will be terrible bad for the service of the country too of course of course now tell me this it would i take it be necessary for the thief to exhibit these drawings to anybody anxious to buy the secreti mean he couldnt describe the invention by word of mouth oh no that would be impossible the drawings are of the most complicated description and full of figures upon which the whole thing depends indeed one would have to be a skilled expert to properly appreciate the design at all various principles of hydrostatics chemistry electricity and pneumatics are most delicately manipulated and adjusted and the smallest error or omission in any part would upset the whole no the drawings are necessary to the thing and they are gone at this moment the door of the outer office was heard to open and somebody entered the door between the two offices was ajar and hewitt could see right through to the glass door left open over the barrier and into the space beyond a welldressed dark bushybearded man stood there carrying a handbag which he placed on the ledge before him hewitt raised his hand to enjoin silence the man spoke in a rather highpitched voice and with a slight accent is mr dixon now within he asked he is engaged answered one of the draughtsmen very particularly engaged i am afraid you wont be able to see him this afternoon can i give him any message this is twothe second time i have come today not two hours ago mr dixon himself tells me to call again i have a very importantvery excellent steampacking to show him that is very cheap and the best of the market the man tapped his bag i have just taken orders from the largest railway companies can not i see him for one second only i will not detain him really im sure you cant this afternoon he isnt seeing anybody but if youll leave your name my name is hunter but what the good of that he ask me to call a little later and i come and now he is engaged it is a very great pity and the man snatched up his bag and walkingstick and stalked off indignantly hewitt stood still gazing through the small aperture in the doorway youd scarcely expect a man with such a name as hunter to talk with that accent would you he observed musingly it isnt a french accent nor a german but it seems foreign you dont happen to know him i suppose no i dont he called here about halfpast twelve just while we were in the middle of our search and i was frantic over the loss of the drawings i was in the outer office myself and told him to call later i have lots of such agents here anxious to sell all sorts of engineering appliances but what will you do now shall you see my men i think said hewitt risingi think ill get you to question them yourself myself yes i have a reason will you trust me with the key of the private room opposite i will go over there for a little while you talk to your men in this room bring them in here and shut the door i can look after the office from across the corridor you know ask them each to detail his exact movements about the office this morning and get them to recall each visitor who has been here from the beginning of the week ill let you know the reason of this later come across to me in a few minutes hewitt took the key and passed through the outer office into the corridor ten minutes later mr dixon having questioned his draughtsmen followed him he found hewitt standing before the table in the private room on which lay several drawings on tracingpaper see here mr dixon said hewitt i think these are the drawings you are anxious about the engineer sprang toward them with a cry of delight why yes yes he exclaimed turning them over every one of them but wherehowthey must have been in the place after all then what a fool i have been hewitt shook his head im afraid youre not quite so lucky as you think mr dixon he said these drawings have most certainly been out of the house for a little while never mind howwell talk of that after there is no time to lose tell mehow long would it take a good draughtsman to copy them they couldnt possibly be traced over properly in less than two or two and a half long days of very hard work dixon replied with eagerness ah then it is as i feared these tracings have been photographed mr dixon and our task is one of every possible difficulty if they had been copied in the ordinary way one might hope to get hold of the copy but photography upsets everything copies can be multiplied with such amazing facility that once the thief gets a decent start it is almost hopeless to checkmate him the only chance is to get at the negatives before copies are taken i must act at once and i fear between ourselves it may be necessary for me to step very distinctly over the line of the law in the matter you see to get at those negatives may involve something very like housebreaking there must be no delay no waiting for legal procedure or the mischief is done indeed i very much question whether you have any legal remedy strictly speaking mr hewitt i implore you do what you can i need not say that all i have is at your disposal i will guarantee to hold you harmless for anything that may happen but do i entreat you do everything possible think of what the consequences may be well yes so i do hewitt remarked with a smile the consequences to me if i were charged with housebreaking might be something that no amount of guarantee could mitigate however i will do what i can if only from patriotic motives now i must see your tracer ritter he is the traitor in the camp ritter but how never mind that now you are upset and agitated and had better not know more than is necessary for a little while in case you say or do something unguarded with ritter i must take a deep course what i dont know i must appear to know and that will seem more likely to him if i disclaim acquaintance with what i do know but first put these tracings safely away out of sight dixon slipped them behind his bookcase now hewitt pursued call mr worsfold and give him something to do that will keep him in the inner office across the way and tell him to send ritter here mr dixon called his chief draughtsman and requested him to put in order the drawings in the drawers of the inner room that had been disarranged by the search and to send ritter as hewitt had suggested ritter walked into the private room with an air of respectful attention he was a puffyfaced unhealthylooking young man with very small eyes and a loose mobile mouth sit down mr ritter hewitt said in a stern voice your recent transactions with your friend mr hunter are well known both to mr dixon and myself ritter who had at first leaned easily back in his chair started forward at this and paled you are surprised i observe but you should be more careful in your movements out of doors if you do not wish your acquaintances to be known mr hunter i believe has the drawings which mr dixon has lost and if so i am certain that you have given them to him that you know is theft for which the law provides a severe penalty ritter broke down completely and turned appealingly to mr dixon oh sir he pleaded it isnt so bad i assure you i was tempted i confess and hid the drawings but they are still in the office and i can give them to youreally i can indeed hewitt went on then in that case perhaps youd better get them at once just go and fetch them in we wont trouble to observe your hidingplace ill only keep this door open to be sure you dont lose your way you knowdown the stairs for instance the wretched ritter with hanging head slunk into the office opposite presently he reappeared looking if possible ghastlier than before he looked irresolutely down the corridor as if meditating a run for it but hewitt stepped toward him and motioned him back to the private room you mustnt try any more of that sort of humbug hewitt said with increased severity the drawings are gone and you have stolen them you know that well enough now attend to me if you received your deserts mr dixon would send for a policeman this moment and have you hauled off to the jail that is your proper place but unfortunately your accomplice who calls himself hunterbut who has other names besides thatas i happen to knowhas the drawings and it is absolutely necessary that these should be recovered i am afraid that it will be necessary therefore to come to some arrangement with this scoundrelto square him in fact now just take that pen and paper and write to your confederate as i dictate you know the alternative if you cause any difficulty ritter reached tremblingly for the pen address him in your usual way hewitt proceeded say this there has been an alteration in the plans have you got that there has been an alteration in the plans i shall be alone here at six oclock please come without fail have you got it very well sign it and address the envelope he must come here and then we may arrange matters in the meantime you will remain in the inner office opposite the note was written and martin hewitt without glancing at the address thrust it into his pocket when ritter was safely in the inner office however he drew it out and read the address i see he observed he uses the same name hunter little carton street westminster is the address and there i shall go at once with the note if the man comes here i think you had better lock him in with ritter and send for a policemanit may at least frighten him my object is of course to get the man away and then if possible to invade his house in some way or another and steal or smash his negatives if they are there and to be found stay here in any case till i return and dont forget to lock up those tracings it was about six oclock when hewitt returned alone but with a smiling face that told of good fortune at first sight first mr dixon he said as he dropped into an easy chair in the private room let me ease your mind by the information that i have been most extraordinarily lucky in fact i think you have no further cause for anxiety here are the negatives they were not all quite dry when iwell whatstole them i suppose i must say so that they have stuck together a bit and probably the films are damaged but you dont mind that i suppose he laid a small parcel wrapped in a newspaper on the table the engineer hastily tore away the paper and took up five or six glass photographic negatives of a halfplate size which were damp and stuck together by the gelatine films in couples he held them one after another up to the light of the window and glanced through them then with a great sigh of relief he placed them on the hearth and pounded them to dust and fragments with the poker for a few seconds neither spoke then dixon flinging himself into a chair said mr hewitt i cant express my obligation to you what would have happened if you had failed i prefer not to think of but what shall we do with ritter now the other man hasnt been here yet by the by no the fact is i didnt deliver the letter the worthy gentleman saved me a world of trouble by taking himself out of the way hewitt laughed im afraid he has rather got himself into a mess by trying two kinds of theft at once and you may not be sorry to hear that his attempt on your torpedo plans is likely to bring him a dose of penal servitude for something else ill tell you what has happened little carton street westminster i found to be a seedy sort of placeone of those old streets that have seen much better days a good many people seem to live in each housethey are fairly large houses by the wayand there is quite a company of bellhandles on each doorpost all down the side like organstops a barber had possession of the ground floor front of no for trade purposes so to him i went can you tell me i said where in this house i can find mr hunter he looked doubtful so i went on his friend will do you knowi cant think of his name foreign gentleman dark with a bushy beard the barber understood at once oh thats mirsky i expect he said now i come to think of it he has had letters addressed to hunter once or twice ive took em in top floor back this was good so far i had got at mr hunters other alias so by way of possessing him with the idea that i knew all about him i determined to ask for him as mirsky before handing over the letter addressed to him as hunter a little bluff of that sort is invaluable at the right time at the top floor back i stopped at the door and tried to open it at once but it was locked i could hear somebody scuttling about within as though carrying things about and i knocked again in a little while the door opened about a foot and there stood mr hunteror mirsky as you likethe man who in the character of a traveler in steampacking came here twice today he was in his shirtsleeves and cuddled something under his arm hastily covered with a spotted pockethandkerchief i have called to see m mirsky i said with a confidential letter oh yas yas he answered hastily i knowi know excuse me one minute and he rushed off downstairs with his parcel here was a noble chance for a moment i thought of following him in case there might be something interesting in the parcel but i had to decide in a moment and i decided on trying the room i slipped inside the door and finding the key on the inside locked it it was a confused sort of room with a little iron bedstead in one corner and a sort of rough boarded inclosure in another this i rightly conjectured to be the photographic darkroom and made for it at once there was plenty of light within when the door was left open and i made at once for the dryingrack that was fastened over the sink there were a number of negatives in it and i began hastily examining them one after another in the middle of this our friend mirsky returned and tried the door he rattled violently at the handle and pushed then he called at this moment i had come upon the first of the negatives you have just smashed the fixing and washing had evidently only lately been completed and the negative was drying on the rack i seized it of course and the others which stood by it who are you there inside mirsky shouted indignantly from the landing why for you go in my room like that open this door at once or i call the police i took no notice i had got the full number of negatives one for each drawing but i was not by any means sure that he had not taken an extra set so i went on hunting down the rack there were no more so i set to work to turn out all the undeveloped plates it was quite possible you see that the other set if it existed had not yet been developed mirsky changed his tune after a little more banging and shouting i could hear him kneel down and try the keyhole i had left the key there so that he could see nothing but he began talking softly and rapidly through the hole in a foreign language i did not know it in the least but i believe it was russian what had led him to believe i understood russian i could not at the time imagine though i have a notion now i went on ruining his stock of plates i found several boxes apparently of new plates but as there was no means of telling whether they were really unused or were merely undeveloped but with the chemical impress of your drawings on them i dragged every one ruthlessly from its hidingplace and laid it out in the full glare of the sunlightdestroying it thereby of course whether it was unused or not mirsky left off talking and i heard him quietly sneaking off perhaps his conscience was not sufficiently clear to warrant an appeal to the police but it seemed to me rather probable at the time that that was what he was going for so i hurried on with my work i found three dark slidesthe parts that carried the plates in the back of the camera you knowone of them fixed in the camera itself these i opened and exposed the plates to ruination as before i suppose nobody ever did so much devastation in a photographic studio in ten minutes as i managed i had spoiled every plate i could find and had the developed negatives safely in my pocket when i happened to glance at a porcelain washingwell under the sink there was one negative in that and i took it up it was not a negative of a drawing of yours but of a russian twentyruble note this was a discovery the only possible reason any man could have for photographing a banknote was the manufacture of an etched plate for the production of forged copies i was almost as pleased as i had been at the discovery of your negatives he might bring the police now as soon as he liked i could turn the tables on him completely i began to hunt about for anything else relating to this negative i found an inkingroller some old pieces of blanket used in printing from plates and in a corner on the floor heaped over with newspapers and rubbish a small copyingpress there was also a dish of acid but not an etched plate or a printed note to be seen i was looking at the press with the negative in one hand and the inkingroller in the other when i became conscious of a shadow across the window i looked up quickly and there was mirsky hanging over from some ledge or projection to the side of the window and staring straight at me with a look of unmistakable terror and apprehension the face vanished immediately i had to move a table to get at the window and by the time i had opened it there was no sign or sound of the rightful tenant of the room i had no doubt now of his reason for carrying a parcel downstairs he probably mistook me for another visitor he was expecting and knowing he must take this visitor into his room threw the papers and rubbish over the press and put up his plates and papers in a bundle and secreted them somewhere downstairs lest his occupation should be observed plainly my duty now was to communicate with the police so by the help of my friend the barber downstairs a messenger was found and a note sent over to scotland yard i awaited of course for the arrival of the police and occupied the interval in another look roundfinding nothing important however when the official detective arrived he recognized at once the importance of the case a large number of forged russian notes have been put into circulation on the continent lately it seems and it was suspected that they came from london the russian government have been sending urgent messages to the police here on the subject of course i said nothing about your business but while i was talking with the scotland yard man a letter was left by a messenger addressed to mirsky the letter will be examined of course by the proper authorities but i was not a little interested to perceive that the envelope bore the russian imperial arms above the words russian embassy now why should mirsky communicate with the russian embassy certainly not to let the officials know that he was carrying on a very extensive and lucrative business in the manufacture of spurious russian notes i think it is rather more than possible that he wroteprobably before he actually got your drawingsto say that he could sell information of the highest importance and that this letter was a reply further i think it quite possible that when i asked for him by his russian name and spoke of a confidential letter he at once concluded that i had come from the embassy in answer to his letter that would account for his addressing me in russian through the keyhole and of course an official from the russian embassy would be the very last person in the world whom he would like to observe any indications of his little etching experiments but anyhow be that as it may hewitt concluded your drawings are safe now and if once mirsky is caught and i think it likely for a man in his shirtsleeves with scarcely any start and perhaps no money about him hasnt a great chance to get awayif he is caught i say he will probably get something handsome at st petersburg in the way of imprisonment or siberia or what not so that you will be amply avenged yes but i dont at all understand this business of the drawings even now how in the world were they taken out of the place and how in the world did you find it out nothing could be simpler and yet the plan was rather ingenious ill tell you exactly how the thing revealed itself to me from your original description of the case many people would consider that an impossibility had been performed nobody had gone out and nobody had come in and yet the drawings had been taken away but an impossibility is an impossibility after all and as drawings dont run away of themselves plainly somebody had taken them unaccountable as it might seem now as they were in your inner office the only people who could have got at them besides yourself were your assistants so that it was pretty clear that one of them at least had something to do with the business you told me that worsfold was an excellent and intelligent draughtsman well if such a man as that meditated treachery he would probably be able to carry away the design in his headat any rate a little at a timeand would be under no necessity to run the risk of stealing a set of the drawings but ritter you remarked was an inferior sort of man not particularly smart i think were your wordsonly a mechanical sort of tracer he would be unlikely to be able to carry in his head the complicated details of such designs as yours and being in a subordinate position and continually overlooked he would find it impossible to make copies of the plans in the office so that to begin with i thought i saw the most probable path to start on when i looked round the rooms i pushed open the glass door of the barrier and left the door to the inner office ajar in order to be able to see any thing that might happen in any part of the place without actually expecting any definite development while we were talking as it happened our friend mirsky or hunteras you please came into the outer office and my attention was instantly called to him by the first thing he did did you notice anything peculiar yourself no really i cant say i did he seemed to behave much as any traveler or agent might well what i noticed was the fact that as soon as he entered the place he put his walkingstick into the umbrellastand over there by the door close by where he stood a most unusual thing for a casual caller to do before even knowing whether you were in this made me watch him closely i perceived with increased interest that the stick was exactly of the same kind and pattern as one already standing there also a curious thing i kept my eyes carefully on those sticks and was all the more interested and edified to see when he left that he took the other sticknot the one he came withfrom the stand and carried it away leaving his own behind i might have followed him but i decided that more could be learned by staying as in fact proved to be the case this by the by is the stick he carried away with him i took the liberty of fetching it back from westminster because i conceive it to be ritiers property hewitt produced the stick it was an ordinary thick malacca cane with a buckhorn handle and a silver band hewitt bent it across his knee and laid it on the table yes dixon answered that is ritters stick i think i have often seen it in the stand but what in the world one moment ill just fetch the stick mirsky left behind and hewitt stepped across the corridor he returned with another stick apparently an exact facsimile of the other and placed it by the side of the other when your assistants went into the inner room i carried this stick off for a minute or two i knew it was not worsfolds because there was an umbrella there with his initial on the handle look at this martin hewitt gave the handle a twist and rapidly unscrewed it from the top then it was seen that the stick was a mere tube of very thin metal painted to appear like a malacca cane it was plain at once that this was no malacca caneit wouldnt bend inside it i found your tracings rolled up tightly you can get a marvelous quantity of thin tracingpaper into a small compass by tight rolling and thisthis was the way they were brought back the engineer exclaimed i see that clearly but how did they get away thats as mysterious as ever not a bit of it see here mirsky gets hold of ritter and they agree to get your drawings and photograph them ritter is to let his confederate have the drawings and mirsky is to bring them back as soon as possible so that they shant be missed for a moment ritter habitually carries this malacca cane and the cunning of mirsky at once suggests that this tube should be made in outward facsimile this morning mirsky keeps the actual stick and ritter comes to the office with the tube he seizes the first opportunityprobably when you were in this private room and worsfold was talking to you from the corridorto get at the tracings roll them up tightly and put them in the tube putting the tube back into the umbrellastand at halfpast twelve or whenever it was mirsky turns up for the first time with the actual stick and exchanges them just as he afterward did when he brought the drawings back yes but mirsky came half an hour after they wereoh yes i see what a fool i was i was forgetting of course when i first missed the tracings they were in this walkingstick safe enough and i was tearing my hair out within arms reach of them precisely and mirsky took them away before your very eyes i expect ritter was in a rare funk when he found that the drawings were missed he calculated no doubt on your not wanting them for the hour or two they would be out of the office how lucky that it struck me to jot a pencilnote on one of them i might easily have made my note somewhere else and then i should never have known that they had been away yes they didnt give you any too much time to miss them well i think the rest pretty clear i brought the tracings in here screwed up the sham stick and put it back you identified the tracings and found none missing and then my course was pretty clear though it looked difficult i knew you would be very naturally indignant with ritter so as i wanted to manage him myself i told you nothing of what he had actually done for fear that in your agitated state you might burst out with something that would spoil my game to ritter i pretended to know nothing of the return of the drawings or how they had been stolenthe only things i did know with certainty but i did pretend to know all about mirskyor hunterwhen as a matter of fact i knew nothing at all except that he probably went under more than one name that put ritter into my hands completely when he found the game was up he began with a lying confession believing that the tracings were still in the stick and that we knew nothing of their return he said that they had not been away and that he would fetch themas i had expected he would i let him go for them alone and when he returned utterly broken up by the discovery that they were not there i had him altogether at my mercy you see if he had known that the drawings were all the time behind your bookcase he might have brazened it out sworn that the drawings had been there all the time and we could have done nothing with him we couldnt have sufficiently frightened him by a threat of prosecution for theft because there the things were in your possession to his knowledge as it was he answered the helm capitally gave us mirskys address on the envelope and wrote the letter that was to have got him out of the way while i committed burglary if that disgraceful expedient had not been rendered unnecessary on the whole the case has gone very well it has gone marvelously well thanks to yourself but what shall i do with ritter heres his stickknock him downstairs with it if you like i should keep the tube if i were you as a memento i dont suppose the respectable mirsky will ever call to ask for it but i should certainly kick ritter out of doorsor out of window if you likewithout delay mirsky was caught and after two remands at the policecourt was extradited on the charge of forging russian notes it came out that he had written to the embassy as hewitt had surmised stating that he had certain valuable information to offer and the letter which hewitt had seen delivered was an acknowledgment and a request for more definite particulars this was what gave rise to the impression that mirsky had himself informed the russian authorities of his forgeries his real intent was very different but was never guessed i wonder hewitt has once or twice observed whether after all it would not have paid the russian authorities better on the whole if i had never investigated mirskys little note factory the dixon torpedo was worth a good many twentyruble notes v the quinton jewel affair it was comparatively rarely that hewitt came into contact with members of the regular criminal classthose i mean who are thieves of one sort or another by exclusive profession still nobody could have been better prepared than hewitt for encountering this class when it became necessary by some means which i never quite understood he managed to keep abreast of the very latest fashions in the everchanging slang dialect of the fraternity and he was a perfect master of the more modern and debased form of romany so much so that frequently a gypsy who began as they always do by pretending that he understood nothing and never heard of a gypsy language ended by confessing that hewitt could rokker better than most romany chals themselves by this acquaintance with their habits and talk hewitt was sometimes able to render efficient service in cases of especial importance in the quinton jewel affair hewitt came into contact with a very accomplished thief the case will probably be very well remembered sir valentine quinton before he married had been as poor as only a man of rank with an old country establishment to keep up can be his marriage however with the daughter of a wealthy financier had changed all that and now the quinton establishment was carried on on as lavish a scale as might be and indeed the extravagant habits of lady quinton herself rendered it an extremely lucky thing that she had brought a fortune with her among other things her jewels made quite a collection and chief among them was the great ruby one of the very few that were sent to this country to be sold at an average price of somewhere about twenty thousand pounds apiece i believe by the burmese king before the annexation of his country let but a ruby be of a great size and color and no equally fine diamond can approach its value well this great ruby which was set in a pendant by the by together with a necklace brooches bracelets earringsindeed the greater part of lady quintons collectionwere stolen the robbery was effected at the usual time and in the usual way in cases of carefully planned jewelry robberies the time was early eveningdinnertime in factand an entrance had been made by the window to lady quintons dressingroom the door screwed up on the inside and wires artfully stretched about the grounds below to overset anybody who might observe and pursue the thieves on an investigation by london detectives however a feature of singularity was brought to light there had plainly been only one thief at work at radcot hall and no other had been inside the grounds alone he had planted the wires opened the window screwed the door and picked the lock of the safe clearly this was a thief of the most accomplished description some few days passed and although the police had made various arrests they appeared to be all mistakes and the suspected persons were released one after another i was talking of the robbery with hewitt at lunch and asked him if he had received any commission to hunt for the missing jewels no hewitt replied i havent been commissioned they are offering an immense reward howevera very pleasant sum indeed i have had a short note from radcot hall informing me of the amount and thats all probably they fancy that i may take the case up as a speculation but that is a great mistake im not a beginner and i must be commissioned in a regular manner hit or miss if i am to deal with the case ive quite enough commissions going now and no time to waste hunting for a problematical reward but we were nearer a clue to the quinton jewels than we then supposed we talked of other things and presently rose and left the restaurant strolling quietly toward home some little distance from the strand and near our own door we passed an excited irishmanwithout doubt an irishman by appearance and talkwho was pouring a torrent of angry complaints in the ears of a policeman the policeman obviously thought little of the mans grievances and with an amused smile appeared to be advising him to go home quietly and think no more about it we passed on and mounted our stairs something interesting in our conversation made me stop for a little while at hewitts office door on my way up and while i stood there the irishman we had seen in the street mounted the stairs he was a poorly dressed but sturdylooking fellow apparently a laborer in a badlyworn best suit of clothes his agitation still held him and without a pause he immediately burst out which of ye jintlemen will be misther hewitt sor this is mr hewitt i said do you want him its protecshin i want sorprotecshin i spake to the polis an they laff at me begob foive days have i lived in london an tis nothin but battle murdher an suddhen death for me here all day an ivery day an the polis say im dhrunk he gesticulated wildly and to me it seemed just possible that the police might be right they say im drunk sor he continued but begob i blieve they think im mad an me being thracked an folleyed an dogged an waylaid an poisoned an blandandhered an kidnapped an murdhered an for why i do not know and whos doing all this sthrangers sorsthrangers tis a sthranger here i am mesilf an fwy they do it bates me onless i do be so like the prince av wales or other crowned head they thry to slaughter me theyre layin for me in the sthreet now i misdoubt not and fwat they may thry next i can tell no more than the lord mayor an the polis wont listen to me this i thought must be one of the very common cases of mental hallucination which one hears of every daythe belief of the sufferer that he is surrounded by enemies and followed by spies it is probably the most usual delusion of the harmless lunatic but what have these people done hewitt asked looking rather interested although amused what actual assaults have they committed and when and who told you to come here who towld me is ut who but the payler outsidein the street below i explained to um an sez he ah you go an take a slape sez he you go an take a good slape an theyll be all gone whin ye wake up but theyll murdher me sez i oh no sez he smilin behind av his ugly face oh no they wont you take ut aisy me frind an go home take it aisy is ut an go home sez i why thats just where theyve been last aruinationin an aturnin av the place upside down an me strook on the head onsensible a mile away take ut aisy is ut ye say whin all the demons in this unholy place is jumpin on me every minut in places promiscuous till i cant tell where to turn descendin an vanishin marvelious an onaccountable take ut aisy is ut sez i well me frind sez he i cant help ye thats the marvelious an onaccountable departmint up the stairs forninst ye misther hewitt ut is sez he that attinds to the onaccountable departmint him as wint by a minut ago you go an bother him thats how i was towld sor hewitt smiled very good he said and now what are these extraordinary troubles of yours dont declaim he added as the irishman raised his hand and opened his mouth preparatory to another torrent of complaint just say in ten words if you can what theyve done to you i will sor wan day had i been in london sorwan day only an a low scutt thried to poison me dhrink next day some udther thief av sin shoved me off av a railway platform undher a train malicious and purposeful glory be he didnt kill me but the very docther that felt me bones thried to pick me pockut i du blieve sunday night i was grabbed outrageous in a darrk turnin rowled on the groun half strangled an me pockuts nigh ripped out av me trousies an this very blessed mornin av light i was strook onsensible an left a livin corpse an my lodgins penethrated an all the thruck mishandled an bruk up behind me back is that a panjandhery for the polis to laff at sor had hewitt not been there i think i should have done my best to quiet the poor fellow with a few soothing words and to persuade him to go home to his friends his excited and rather confused manner his fantastic story of a sort of general conspiracy to kill him and the absurd reference to the doctor who tried to pick his pocket seemed to me plainly to confirm my first impression that he was insane but hewitt appeared strangely interested did they steal anything he asked divil a shtick but me doorkey an that they tuk home an lift in the door hewitt opened his office door come in he said and tell me all about this you come too brett the irishman and i followed him into the inner office where shutting the door hewitt suddenly turned on the irishman and exclaimed sharply then youve still got it he looked keenly in the mans eyes but the only expression there was one of surprise got ut said the irishman got fwhat sor is ut youre thinkin ive got the horrors as well as the polis hewitts gaze relaxed sit down sit down he said youve still got your watch and money i suppose since you werent robbed oh that glory be i have ut still though for how longor me own head for that matterin this state of besiegement i can not say now said hewitt i want a full true and particular account of yourself and your

too by that same token what was his address twas in chelsea and twas gold or golden something which i know by the good token av fwhat he gave me but the number i misremember hewitt turned to his directory gold street is the place probably he said and it seems to be a street chiefly of private houses you would be able to point out the house if you were taken there i suppose i should that sor indade i was thinkin av goin there an tellin misther hollams all my throubles him havin been so kind now tell me exactly what instructions the man in the train gave you and what happened he sez you ask for misther hollams an see nobody else tell him yeve brought the sparks from misther w i fancied i could see a sudden twinkle in hewitts eye but he made no other sign and the irishman proceeded

wint straight there an tuk ut an there i do be stayin still sor i hadnt understood at first why hewitt took so much interest in the irishmans narrative but the latter part of it opened my eyes a little it seemed likely that leamy had in his innocence been made a conveyer of stolen property i knew enough of thieves slang to know that sparks meant diamonds or other jewels that regulars was the term used for a payment made to a brother thief who gave assistance in some small way such as carrying the booty and that the family was the timehonored expression for a gang of thieves this was all on wednesday i understand said hewitt now tell me what happened on thursdaythe poisoning or drugging you know well sor i was walking out an toward the evenin i lost mesilf up comes a man seeminly a

certainly been no laughing matter for you now tell mehave you anything in your possessiondocuments or valuables or anythingthat any other person to your knowledge is anxious to get hold of i have not sordivil a document as to valuables thim an me is the cowldest av sthrangers just call to mind now the face of the man who tried to put powder in your drink and that of the doctor who attended to you in the railway station were they at all alike or was either like anybody you have seen before leamy puckered his forehead and thought faith he said presently they were a bit alike though one had a beard an the udther whiskers only neither happened to look like mr hollams for instance leamy started begob but they did theyd ha been mortal like him if theyd been shaved then after a pause he suddenly added holy saints is ut the famly he talked av hewitt laughed perhaps it is he said now as to the man who sent you with the bag was it an old bag bran cracklin newa brown leather bag locked that i niver thried sor it was not my consarn true now as to this mr w himself hewitt had been rummaging for some few minutes in a portfolio and finally produced a photograph and held it before the irishmans eye is that like him he asked shure its the man himself is he a friend av yours sor no hes not exactly a friend of mine hewitt answered with a grim chuckle i fancy hes one of that very respectable family you heard about at mr hollams come along with me now to chelsea and see if you can point out that house in gold street ill send for a cab he made for the outer office and i went with him what is all this hewitt i asked a gang of thieves with stolen property hewitt looked in my face and replied its the quinton ruby what the ruby shall you take the case up then i shall it is no longer a speculation then do you expect to find it at hollams house in chelsea i asked no i dont because it isnt thereelse why are they trying to get it from this unlucky irishman there has been bad faith in hollams gang i expect and hollams has missed the ruby and suspects leamy of having taken it from the bag then who is this mr w whose portrait you have in your possession see here hewitt turned over a small pile of recent newspapers and selected one pointing at a particular paragraph i kept that in my mind because to me it seemed to be the most likely arrest of the lot he said it was an evening paper of the previous thursday and the paragraph was a very short one thus the man wilks who was arrested at euston station yesterday in connection with the robbery of lady quintons jewels has been released nothing being found to incriminate him how does that strike you asked hewitt wilks is a man well known to the policeone of the most accomplished burglars in this country in fact i have had no dealings with him as yet but i found means some time ago to add his portrait to my little collection in case i might want it and today it has been quite useful the thing was plain now wilks must have been bringing his booty to town and calculated on getting out at chalk farm and thus eluding the watch which he doubtless felt pretty sure would be kept by telegraphic instruction at euston for suspicious characters arriving from the direction of radcot his transaction with leamy was his only possible expedient to save himself from being hopelessly taken with the swag in his possession the paragraph told me why leamy had waited in vain for mr w in the cab what shall you do now i asked i shall go to the gold street house and find out what i can as soon as this cab turns up there seemed a possibility of some excitement in the adventure so i asked will you want any help hewitt smiled i think i can get through it alone he said then may i come to look on i said of course i dont want to be in your way and the result of the business whatever it is will be to your credit alone but i am curious come then by all means the cab will be a fourwheeler and there will be plenty of room gold street was a short street of private houses of very fair size and of a halfvanished pretension to gentility we drove slowly through and leamy had no difficulty in pointing out the house wherein he had been paid five pounds for carrying a bag at the end the cab turned the corner and stopped while hewitt wrote a short note to an official of scotland yard take this note he instructed leamy to scotland yard in the cab and then go home i will pay the cabman now i will sor an will i be protected oh yes stay at home for the rest of the day and i expect youll be left alone in future perhaps i shall have something to tell you in a day or two if i do ill send goodby the cab rolled off and hewitt and i strolled back along gold street i think hewitt said we will drop in on mr hollams for a few minutes while we can in a few hours i expect the police will have him and his house too if they attend promptly to my note have you ever seen him not to my knowledge though i may know him by some other name wilks i know by sight though he doesnt know me what shall we say that will depend on circumstances i may not get my cue till the door opens or even till later at worst i can easily apply for a reference as to leamy who you remember is looking for work but we were destined not to make mr hollams acquaintance after all as we approached the house a great uproar was heard from the lower part giving on to the area and suddenly a man hatless and with a sleeve of his coat nearly torn away burst through the door and up the area steps pursued by two others i had barely time to observe that one of the pursuers carried a revolver and that both hesitated and retired on seeing that several people were about the street when hewitt gripping my arm and exclaiming thats our man started at a run after the fugitive we turned the next corner and saw the man thirty yards before us walking and pulling up his sleeve at the shoulder so as to conceal the rent plainly he felt safe from further molestation thats sim wilks hewitt explained as we followed the juce of a foine jintleman who got leamy to carry his bag and the man who knows where the quinton ruby is unless i am more than usually mistaken dont stare after him in case he looks round presently when we get into the busier streets i shall have a little chat with him but for some time the man kept to the back streets in time however he emerged into the buckingham palace road and we saw him stop and look at a hatshop but after a general look over the window and a glance in at the door he went on good sign observed hewitt got no money with himmakes it easier for us in a little while wilks approached a small crowd gathered about a woman fiddler hewitt touched my arm and a few quick steps took us past our man and to the opposite side of the crowd when wilks emerged he met us coming in the opposite direction what sim burst out hewitt with apparent delight i havent piped your muga for a stretchb i thought youd fellc wheres your cadyd footnote a seen your face footnote b a year footnote c been imprisoned footnote d hat wilks looked astonished and suspicious i dont know you he said youve made a mistake hewitt laughed im glad you dont know me he said if you dont im pretty sure the reelersa wont i think ive faked my mug pretty well and my clobberb too look here ill stand you a new cady strange blokes dont do that eh footnote a police footnote b clothes wilks was still suspicious i dont know what you mean he said then after a pause he added who are you then hewitt winked and screwed his face genially aside hooky he said ive had a lucky toucha and im mr smith till ive melted the piecesb you come and damp it footnote a robbery footnote b spent the money im off wilks replied unless youre pal enough to lend me a quid he added laughing i am that responded hewitt plunging his hand in his pocket im flush my boy flush and ive been wetting it pretty well today i feel pretty jolly now and i shouldnt wonder if i went home cannona only a quid have two if you want emor three theres plenty more and youll do the same for me some day here yare footnote a drunk hewitt had of a sudden assumed the whole appearance manners and bearing of a slightly elevated rowdy now he pulled his hand from his pocket and extended it full of silver with five or six sovereigns interspersed toward wilks ill have three quid wilks said with decision taking the money but im blowed if i remember you whos your pal hewitt jerked his hand in my direction winked and said in a low voice hes all right having a rest cant stand manchester and winked again wilks laughed and nodded and i understood from that that hewitt had very flatteringly given me credit for being wanted by the manchester police we lurched into a public house and drank a very little very bad whisky and water wilks still regarded us curiously and i could see him again and again glancing doubtfully in hewitts face but the loan of three pounds had largely reassured him presently hewitt said how about our old pal down in gold street do anything with him now seen him lately wilks looked up at the ceiling and shook his head thats a good job it ud be awkward if you were about there today i can tell you why never mind so long as youre not there i know something if i have been away im glad i havent had any truck with gold street lately thats all dyou mean the reelers are on it hewitt looked cautiously over his shoulder leaned toward wilks and said look here this is the straight tip i know thisi got it from the very narka thats given the show away by six oclock no gold street will be turned inside out like an old glove and everyone in the place will be he finished the sentence by crossing his wrists like a handcuffed man whats more he went on they know all about whats gone on there lately and everybody thats been in or out for the last two moonsb will be wanted particularand will be found im told hewitt concluded with a confidential frown a nod and a wink and took another mouthful of whisky then he added as an afterthought so im glad you havent been there lately footnote a police spy footnote b months wilks looked in hewitts face and asked is that straight is it replied hewitt with emphasis you go and have a look if you aint afraid of being smugged yourself only i shant go near no just yeti know that wilks fidgeted finished his drink and expressed his intention of going very well if you wont have another replied hewitt but he had gone good said hewitt moving toward the door he has suddenly developed a hurry i shall keep him in sight but you had better take a cab and go straight to euston take tickets to the nearest station to radcotkedderby i think it isand look up the train arrangements dont show yourself too much and keep an eye on the entrance unless i am mistaken wilks will be there pretty soon and i shall be on his heels if i am wrong then you wont see the end of the fun thats all hewitt hurried after wilks and i took the cab and did as he wished there was an hour and a few minutes i found to wait for the next train and that time i occupied as best i might keeping a sharp lookout across the quadrangle barely five minutes before the train was to leave and just as i was beginning to think about the time of the next a cab dashed up and hewitt alighted he hurried in found me and drew me aside into a recess just as another cab arrived here he is hewitt said i followed him as far as euston road and then got my cabby to spurt up and pass him he had had his mustache shaved off and i feared you mightnt recognize him and so let him see you from our retreat we could see wilks hurry into the bookingoffice we watched him through to the platform and followed he wasted no time but made the best of his way to a thirdclass carriage at the extreme fore end of the train we have three minutes hewitt said and everything depends on his not seeing us get into this train take this cap fortunately were both in tweed suits he had bought a couple of tweed cricket caps and these we assumed sending our bowler hats to the cloakroom hewitt also put on a pair of blue spectacles and then walked boldly up the platform and entered a firstclass carriage i followed close on his heels in such a manner that a person looking from the fore end of the train would be able to see but very little of me so far so good said hewitt when we were seated and the train began to move off i must keep a lookout at each station in case our friend goes off unexpectedly i waited some time i said where did you both go to first he went and bought that hat he is wearing then he walked some distance dodging the main thoroughfares and keeping to the back streets in a way that made following difficult till he came to a little tailors shop there he entered and came out in a quarter of an hour with his coat mended this was in a street in westminster presently he worked his way up to tothill street and there he plunged into a barbers shop i took a cautious peep at the window saw two or three other customers also waiting and took the opportunity to rush over to a notion shop and buy these blue spectacles and to a hatters for these capsof which i regret to observe that yours is too big he was rather a long while in the barbers and finally came out as you saw him with no mustache this was a good indication it made it plainer than ever that he had believed my warning as to the police descent on the house in gold street and its frequenters which was right and proper for what i told him was quite true the rest you know he cabbed to the station and so did i and now perhaps i said after giving me the character of a thief wanted by the manchester police forcibly depriving me of my hat in exchange for this alltoolarge cap and rushing me off out of london without any definite idea of when im coming back perhaps youll tell me what were after hewitt laughed you wanted to join in you know he said and you must take your luck as it comes as a matter of fact there is scarcely anything in my profession so uninteresting and so difficult as this watching and following business often it lasts for weeks when we alight we shall have to follow wilks again under the most difficult possible conditions in the country there it is often quite impossible to follow a man unobserved it is only because it is the only way that i am undertaking it now as to what were after you know that as well as ithe quinton ruby wilks has hidden it and without his help it would be impossible to find it we are following him so that he will find it for us he must have hidden it i suppose to avoid sharing with hollams of course and availed himself of the fact of leamy having carried the bag to direct hollamss suspicion to him hollams found out by his repeated searches of leamy and his lodgings that this was wrong and this morning evidently tried to persuade the ruby out of wilks possession with a revolver we saw the upshot of that kedderby station was about forty miles out at each intermediate stopping station hewitt watched earnestly but wilks remained in the train what i fear hewitt observed is that at kedderby he may take a fly to stalk a man on foot in the country is difficult enough but you cant follow one vehicle in another without being spotted but if hes so smart as i think he wont do it a man traveling in a fly is noticed and remembered in these places he did not take a fly at kedderby we saw him jump out quickly and hasten from the station the train stood for a few minutes and he was out of the station before we alighted through the railings behind the platform we could see him walking briskly away to the right from the ticket collector we ascertained that radcot lay in that direction three miles off to my dying day i shall never forget that three miles they seemed three hundred in the still country almost every footfall seemed audible for any distance and in the long stretches of road one could see half a mile behind or before hewitt was cool and patient but i got into a fever of worry excitement want of breath and backache at first for a little the road zigzagged and then the chase was comparatively easy we waited behind one bend till wilks had passed the next and then hurried in his trail treading in the dustiest parts of the road or on the side grass when there was any to deaden the sound of our steps at the last of these short bends we looked ahead and saw a long white stretch of road with the dark form of wilks a couple of hundred yards in front it would never do to let him get to the end of this great stretch before following as he might turn off at some branch road out of sight and be lost so we jumped the hedge and scuttled along as we best might on the other side with backs bent and our feet often many inches deep in wet clay we had to make continual stoppages to listen and peep out and on one occasion happening incautiously to stand erect looking after him i was much startled to see wilks with his face toward me gazing down the road i ducked like lightning and fortunately he seemed not to have observed me but went on as before he had probably heard some slight noise but looked straight along the road for its explanation instead of over the hedge at hilly parts of the road there was extreme difficulty indeed on approaching a rise it was usually necessary to lie down under the hedge till wilks had passed the top since from the higher ground he could have seen us easily this improved neither my clothes my comfort nor my temper luckily we never encountered the difficulty of a long and high wall but once we were nearly betrayed by a man who shouted to order us off his field at last we saw just ahead the square tower of an old church set about with thick trees opposite this wilks paused looked irresolutely up and down the road and then went on we crossed the road availed ourselves of the opposite hedge and followed the village was to be seen some three or four hundred yards farther along the road and toward it wilks sauntered slowly before he actually reached the houses he stopped and turned back the churchyard exclaimed hewitt under his breath lie close and let him pass wilks reached the churchyard gate and again looked irresolutely about him at that moment a party of children who had been playing among the graves came chattering and laughing toward and out of the gate and wilks walked hastily away again this time in the opposite direction thats the place clearly hewitt said we must slip across quietly as soon as hes far enough down the road now we hurried stealthily across through the gate and into the churchyard where hewitt threw his blue spectacles away it was now nearly eight in the evening and the sun was setting once again wilks approached the gate and did not enter because a laborer passed at the time then he came back and slipped through the grass about the graves was long and under the trees it was already twilight hewitt and i two or three yards apart to avoid falling over one another in case of sudden movement watched from behind gravestones the form of wilks stood out large and black against the fading light in the west as he stealthily approached through the long grass a light cart came clattering along the road and wilks dropped at once and crouched on his knees till it had passed then staring warily about him he made straight for the stone behind which hewitt waited i saw hewitts dark form swing noiselessly round to the other side of the stone wilks passed on and dropped on his knee beside a large weatherworn slab that rested on a brick understructure a foot or so high the long grass largely hid the bricks and among it wilks plunged his hand feeling along the brick surface presently he drew out a loose brick and laid it on the slab he felt again in the place and brought forth a small dark object i saw hewitt rise erect in the gathering dusk and with extended arm step noiselessly toward the stooping man wilks made a motion to place the dark object in his pocket but checked himself and opened what appeared to be a lid as though to make sure of the safety of the contents the last light straggling under the trees fell on a brilliantly sparkling object within and like a flash hewitts hand shot over wilks shoulder and snatched the jewel the man actually screamedone of those curious sharp little screams that one may hear from a woman very suddenly alarmed but he sprang at hewitt like a cat only to meet a straight drive of the fist that stretched him on his back across the slab i sprang from behind my stone and helped hewitt to secure his wrists with a pockethandkerchief then we marched him struggling and swearing to the village when in the lights of the village he recognized us he had a perfect fit of rage but afterward he calmed down and admitted that it was a very clean cop there was some difficulty in finding the village constable and sir valentine quinton was dining out and did not arrive for at least an hour in the interval wilks grew communicative how much dye think ill get he asked cant guess hewitt replied and as we shall probably have to give evidence youll be giving yourself away if you talk too much oh i dont care thatll make no difference its a fair cop and im in for it you got at me nicely lending me three quid i never knew a reeler do that before that blinded me but was it kid about gold street no it wasnt mr hollams is safely shut up by this time i expect and you are avenged for your little trouble with him this afternoon what did you know about that well youve got it up nicely for me i must say spose youve been following me all the time well yes i havent been far off i guessed youd want to clear out of town if hollams was taken and i knew thishewitt tapped his breast pocketwas what youd take care to get hold of first you hid it of course because you knew that hollams would probably have you searched for it if he got suspicious yes he did too two blokes went over my pockets one night and somebody got into my room but i expected that hollams is such a greedy pig once hes got you under his thumb he dont give you half your makings and if you kick hell have you smugged so that i wasnt going to give him that if i could help it i spose it aint any good asking how you got put on to our mob no said hewitt it isnt we didnt get back till the next day staying for the night despite an inconvenient want of requisites at the hall there were in fact no late trains we told sir valentine the story of the irishman much to his amusement leamys tale sounded unlikely of course hewitt said but it was noticeable that every one of his misfortunes pointed in the same directionthat certain persons were tremendously anxious to get at something they supposed he had when he spoke of his adventure with the bag i at once remembered wilks arrest and subsequent release it was a curious coincidence to say the least that this should happen at the very station to which the proceeds of this robbery must come if they came to london at all and on the day following the robbery itself kedderby is one of the few stations on this line where no trains would stop after the time of the robbery so that the thief would have to wait till the next day to get back leamys recognition of wilks portrait made me feel pretty certain plainly he had carried stolen property the poor innocent fellows conversation with hollams showed that as in fact did the sum five pounds paid to him by way of regulars or customary toll from the plunder of services of carriage hollams obviously took leamy for a criminal friend of wilks because of his use of the thieves expressions sparks and regulars and suggested in terms which leamy misunderstood that he should sell any plunder he might obtain to himself hollams altogether it would have been very curious if the plunder were not that from radcot hall especially as no other robbery had been reported at the time now among the jewels taken only one was of a very preeminent valuethe famous ruby it was scarcely likely that hollams would go to so much trouble and risk attempting to drug injuring waylaying and burgling the rooms of the unfortunate leamy for a jewel of small valuefor any jewel in fact but the ruby so that i felt a pretty strong presumption at all events that it was the ruby hollams was after leamy had not had it i was convinced from his tale and his manner and from what i judged of the man himself the only other person was wilks and certainly he had a temptation to keep this to himself and avoid if possible sharing with his london director or principal while the carriage of the bag by the irishman gave him a capital opportunity to put suspicion on him with the results seen the most daring of hollams attacks on leamy was doubtless the attempted maiming or killing at the railway station so as to be able in the character of a medical man to search his pockets he was probably desperate at the time having i have no doubt been following leamy about all day at the crystal palace without finding an opportunity to get at his pockets the struggle and flight of wilks from hollams confirmed my previous impressions hollams finally satisfied that very morning that leamy certainly had not the jewel either on his person or at his lodging and knowing from having so closely watched him that he had been nowhere where it could be disposed of concluded that wilks was cheating him and attempted to extort the ruby from him by the aid of another ruffian and a pistol the rest of my way was plain wilks i knew would seize the opportunity of hollams being safely locked up to get at and dispose of the ruby i supplied him with funds and left him to lead us to his hidingplace he did it and i think thats all he must have walked straight away from my house to the churchyard sir valentine remarked to hide that pendant that was fairly cool only a cool hand could carry out such a robbery singlehanded hewitt answered i expect his tools were in the bag that leamy carried as well as the jewels they must have been a small and neat set they were we ascertained on our return to town the next day that the bag with all its contents intact including the tools had been taken by the police at their surprise visit to no gold street as well as much other stolen property hollams and wilks each got very wholesome doses of penal servitude to the intense delight of mick leamy leamy himself by the by is still to be seen clad in a noble uniform guarding the door of a wellknown london restaurant he has not had any more fivepound notes for carrying bags but knows london too well now to expect it vi the stanway cameo mystery it is now a fair number of years back since the loss of the famous stanway cameo made its sensation and the only person who had the least interest in keeping the real facts of the case secret has now been dead for some time leaving neither relatives nor other representatives therefore no harm will be done in making the inner history of the case public on the contrary it will afford an opportunity of vindicating the professional reputation of hewitt who is supposed to have completely failed to make anything of the mystery surrounding the case at the present time connoisseurs in ancient objects of art are often heard regretfully to wonder whether the wonderful cameo so suddenly discovered and so quickly stolen will ever again be visible to the public eye now this question need be asked no longer the cameo as may be remembered from the many descriptions published at the time was said to be absolutely the finest extant it was a sardonyx of three strataone of those rare sardonyx cameos in which it has been possible for the artist to avail himself of three different colors of superimposed stonethe lowest for the ground and the two others for the middle and high relief of the design in size it was for a cameo immense measuring seven and a half inches by nearly six in subject it was similar to the renowned gonzaga cameonow the property of the czar of russiaa male and a female head with imperial insignia but in this case supposed to represent tiberius claudius and messalina experts considered it probably to be the work of athenion a famous gemcutter of the first christian century whose most notable other work now extant is a smaller cameo with a mythological subject preserved in the vatican the stanway cameo had been discovered in an obscure italian village by one of those traveling agents who scour all europe for valuable antiquities and objects of art this man had hurried immediately to london with his prize and sold it to mr claridge of st james street eminent as a dealer in such objects mr claridge recognizing the importance and value of the article lost no opportunity of making its existence known and very soon the claudius cameo as it was at first usually called was as famous as any in the world many experts in ancient art examined it and several large bids were made for its purchase in the end it was bought by the marquis of stanway for five thousand pounds for the purpose of presentation to the british museum the marquis kept the cameo at his town house for a few days showing it to his friends and then returned it to mr claridge to be finally and carefully cleaned before passing into the national collection two nights after mr claridges premises were broken into and the cameo stolen such in outline was the generally known history of the stanway cameo the circumstances of the burglary in detail were these mr claridge had himself been the last to leave the premises at about eight in the evening at dusk and had locked the small side door as usual his assistant mr cutler had left an hour and a half earlier when mr claridge left everything was in order and the policeman on fixedpoint duty just opposite who bade mr claridge goodevening as he left saw nothing suspicious during the rest of his term of duty nor did his successors at the point throughout the night in the morning however mr cutler the assistant who arrived first soon after nine oclock at once perceived that something unlookedfor had happened the door of which he had a key was still fastened and had not been touched but in the room behind the shop mr claridges private desk had been broken open and the contents turned out in confusion the door leading on to the staircase had also been forced proceeding up the stairs mr cutler found another door open leading from the top landing to a small room this door had been opened by the simple expedient of unscrewing and taking off the lock which had been on the inside in the ceiling of this room was a trapdoor and this was six or eight inches open the edge resting on the halfwrenchedoff bolt which had been torn away when the trap was levered open from the outside plainly then this was the path of the thief or thieves entrance had been made through the trapdoor two more doors had been opened and then the desk had been ransacked mr cutler afterward explained that at this time he had no precise idea what had been stolen and did not know where the cameo had been left on the previous evening mr claridge had himself undertaken the cleaning and had been engaged on it the assistant said when he left there was no doubt however after mr claridges arrival at ten oclockthe cameo was gone mr claridge utterly confounded at his loss explained incoherently and with curses on his own carelessness that he had locked the precious article in his desk on relinquishing work on it the previous evening feeling rather tired and not taking the trouble to carry it as far as the safe in another part of the house the police were sent for at once of course and every investigation made mr claridge offering a reward of five hundred pounds for the recovery of the cameo the affair was scribbled off at large in the earliest editions of the evening papers and by noon all the world was aware of the extraordinary theft of the stanway cameo and many people were discussing the probabilities of the case with very indistinct ideas of what a sardonyx cameo precisely was it was in the afternoon of this day that lord stanway called on martin hewitt the marquis was a tall upstanding man of spare figure and active habits well known as a member of learned societies and a great patron of art he hurried into hewitts private room as soon as his name had been announced and as soon as hewitt had given him a chair plunged into business probably you already guess my business with you mr hewittyou have seen the early evening papers just so then i neednt tell you again what you already know my cameo is gone and i badly want it back of course the police are hard at work at claridges but im not quite satisfied i have been there myself for two or three hours and cant see that they know any more about it than i do myself then of course the police naturally and properly enough from their point of view look first to find the criminal regarding the recovery of the property almost as a secondary consideration now from my point of view the chief consideration is the property of course i want the thief caught if possible and properly punished but still more i want the cameo certainly it is a considerable loss five thousand pounds ah but dont misunderstand me it isnt the monetary value of the thing that i regret as a matter of fact i am indemnified for that already claridge has behaved most honorablymore than honorably indeed the first intimation i had of the loss was a check from him for five thousand pounds with a letter assuring me that the restoration to me of the amount i had paid was the least he could do to repair the result of what he called his unpardonable carelessness legally im not sure that i could demand anything of him unless i could prove very flagrant neglect indeed to guard against theft then i take it lord stanway hewitt observed that you much prefer the cameo to the money certainly else i should never have been willing to pay the money for the cameo it was an enormous priceperhaps much above the market value even for such a valuable thingbut i was particularly anxious that it should not go out of the country our public collections here are not so fortunate as they should be in the possession of the very finest examples of that class of work in short i had determined on the cameo and fortunately happen to be able to carry out determinations of that sort without regarding an extra thousand pounds or so as an obstacle so that you see what i want is not the value but the thing itself indeed i dont think i can possibly keep the money claridge has sent me the affair is more his misfortune than his fault but i shall say nothing about returning it for a little while it may possibly have the effect of sharpening everybody in the search just so do i understand that you would like me to look into the case independently on your behalf exactly i want you if you can to approach the matter entirely from my point of viewyour sole object being to find the cameo of course if you happen on the thief as well so much the better perhaps after all looking for the one is the same thing as looking for the other not always but usually it is or course even if they are not together they certainly have been at one time and to have one is a very long step toward having the other now to begin with is anybody suspected well the police are reserved but i believe the fact is theyve nothing to say claridge wont admit that he suspects any one though he believes that whoever it was must have watched him yesterday evening through the back window of his room and must have seen him put the cameo away in his desk because the thief would seem to have gone straight to the place but i half fancy that in his inner mind he is inclined to suspect one of two people you see a robbery of this sort is different from others that cameo would never be stolen i imagine with the view of its being soldit is much too famous a thing a man might as well walk about offering to sell the tower of london there are only a very few people who buy such things and every one of them knows all about it no dealer would touch it he could never even show it much less sell it without being called to account so that it really seems more likely that it has been taken by somebody who wishes to keep it for mere love of the thinga collector in factwho would then have to keep it secretly at home and never let a soul besides himself see it living in the consciousness that at his death it must be found and this theft known unless indeed an ordinary vulgar burglar has taken it without knowing its value that isnt likely hewitt replied an ordinary burglar ignorant of its value wouldnt have gone straight to the cameo and have taken it in preference to many other things of more apparent worth which must be lying near in such a place as claridges truei suppose he wouldnt although the police seem to think that the breaking in is clearly the work of a regular criminalfrom the jimmymarks you know and so on well but what of the two people you think mr claridge suspects of course i cant say that he does suspect themi only fancied from his tone that it might be possible he himself insists that he cant in justice suspect anybody one of these men is hahn the traveling agent who sold him the cameo this mans character does not appear to be absolutely irreproachable no dealer trusts him very far of course claridge doesnt say what he paid him for the cameo these dealers are very reticent about their profits which i believe are as often something like five hundred per cent as not but it seems hahn bargained to have something extra depending on the amount claridge could sell the carving for according to the appointment he should have turned up this morning but he hasnt been seen and nobody seems to know exactly where he is yes and the other person well i scarcely like mentioning him because he is certainly a gentleman and i believe in the ordinary way quite incapable of anything in the least degree dishonorable although of course they say a collector has no conscience in the matter of his own particular hobby and certainly mr wollett is as keen a collector as any man alive he lives in chambers in the next turning past claridges premisescan in fact look into claridges back windows if he likes he examined the cameo several times before i bought it and made several high offersappeared in fact very anxious indeed to get it after i had bought it he made i understand some rather strong remarks about people like myself spoiling the market by paying extravagant prices and altogether cut up crusty as they say at losing the specimen lord stanway paused a few seconds and then went on im not sure that i ought to mention mr woolletts name for a moment in connection with such a matter i am personally perfectly certain that he is as incapable of anything like theft as myself but i am telling you all i know precisely i cant know too much in a case like this it can do no harm if i know all about fifty innocent people and may save me from the risk of knowing nothing about the thief now let me see mr wolletts rooms you say are near mr claridges place of business is there any means of communication between the roofs yes i am told that it is perfectly possible to get from one place to the other by walking along the leads very good then unless you can think of any other information that may help me i think lord stanway i will go at once and look at the place do by all means i think ill come back with you somehow i dont like to feel idle in the matter though i suppose i cant do much as to more information i dont think there is any in regard to mr claridges assistant now do you know anything of him only that he has always seemed a very civil and decent sort of man honest i should say or claridge wouldnt have kept him so many yearsthere are a good many valuable things about at claridges besides the man has keys of the place himself and even if he were a thief he wouldnt need to go breaking in through the roof so that said hewitt we have directly connected with this cameo besides yourself these people mr claridge the dealer mr cutler the assistant in mr claridges business hahn who sold the article to claridge and mr woollett who made bids for it these are all all that i know of other gentlemen made bids i believe but i dont know them take these people in their order mr claridge is out of the question as a dealer with a reputation to keep up would be even if he hadnt immediately sent you this five thousand poundsmore than the market value i understand of the cameo the assistant is a reputable man against whom nothing is known who would never need to break in and who must understand his business well enough to know that he could never attempt to sell the missing stone without instant detection hahn is a man of shady antecedents probably clever enough to know as well as anybody how to dispose of such plunderif it be possible to dispose of it at all also hahn hasnt been to claridges today although he had an appointment to take money lastly mr woollett is a gentleman of the most honorable record but a perfectly rabid collector who had made every effort to secure the cameo before you bought it who moreover could have seen mr claridge working in his back room and who has perfectly easy access to mr claridges roof if we find it cant be none of these then we must look where circumstances indicate there was unwonted excitement at mr claridges place when hewitt and his client arrived it was a dull old building and in the windows there was never more show than an odd blue china vase or two or mayhap a few old silver shoebuckles and a curious small sword nine men out of ten would have passed it without a glance but the tenth at least would probably know it for a place famous through the world for the number and value of the old and curious objects of art that had passed through it on this day two or three loiterers having heard of the robbery extracted what gratification they might from staring at nothing between the railings guarding the windows within mr claridge a brisk stout little old man was talking earnestly to a burly policeinspector in uniform and mr cutler who had seized the opportunity to attempt amateur detective work on his own account was groveling perseveringly about the floor among old porcelain and loose pieces of armor in the futile hope of finding any clue that the thieves might have considerately dropped mr claridge came forward eagerly the leather case has been found i am pleased to be able to tell you lord stanway since you left empty of course unfortunately yes it had evidently been thrown away by the thief behind a chimneystack a roof or two away where the police have found it but it is a clue of course ah then this gentleman will give me his opinion of it lord stanway said turning to hewitt this mr claridge is mr martin hewitt who has been kind enough to come with me here at a moments notice with the police on the one hand and mr hewitt on the other we shall certainly recover that cameo if it is to be recovered i think mr claridge bowed and beamed on hewitt through his spectacles im very glad mr hewitt has come he said indeed i had already decided to give the police till this time tomorrow and then if they had found nothing to call in mr hewitt myself hewitt bowed in his turn and then asked will you let me see the various breakages i hope they have not been disturbed nothing whatever has been disturbed do exactly as seems best i need scarcely say that everything here is perfectly at your disposal you know all the circumstances of course in general yes i suppose i am right in the belief that you have no resident housekeeper no claridge replied i havent i had one housekeeper who sometimes pawned my property in the evening and then another who used to break my most valuable china till i could never sleep or take a moments ease at home for fear my stock was being ruined here so i gave up resident housekeepers i felt some confidence in doing it because of the policeman who is always on duty opposite can i see the broken desk mr claridge led the way into the room behind the shop the desk was really a sort of worktable with a lifting top and a lock the top had been forced roughly open by some instrument which had been pushed in below it and used as a lever so that the catch of the lock was torn away hewitt examined the damaged parts and the marks of the lever and then looked out at the back window there are several windows about here he remarked from which it might be possible to see into this room do you know any of the people who live behind them two or three i know mr claridge answered but there are two windowsthe pair almost immediately before usbelonging to a room or office which is to let any stranger might get in there and watch do the roofs above any of those windows communicate in any way with yours none of those directly opposite those at the left do you may walk all the way along the leads and whose windows are they mr claridge hesitated well he said theyre mr woolletts an excellent customer of mine but hes a gentleman andwell i really think its absurd to suspect him in a case like this hewitt answered one must disregard nothing but the impossible somebodywhether mr woollett himself or another personcould possibly have seen into this room from those windows and equally possibly could have reached this room from that one therefore we must not forget mr woollett have any of your neighbors been burgled during the night i mean that strangers anxious to get at your trapdoor would probably have to begin by getting into some other house close by so as to reach your roof no mr claridge replied there has been nothing of that sort it was the first thing the police ascertained hewitt examined the broken door and then made his way up the stairs with the others the unscrewed lock of the door of the top backroom required little examination in the room below the trapdoor was a dusty table on which stood a chair and at the other side of the table sat detectiveinspector plummer whom hewitt knew very well and who bade him goodday and then went on with his docket this chair and table were found as they are now i take it hewitt asked yes said mr claridge the thieves i should think dropped in through the trapdoor after breaking it open and had to place this chair where it is to be able to climb back hewitt scrambled up through the trapway and examined it from the top the door was hung on long external barndoor hinges and had been forced open in a similar manner to that practiced on the desk a jimmy had been pushed between the frame and the door near the bolt and the door had been pried open the bolt being torn away from the screws in the operation presently inspector plummer having finished his docket climbed up to the roof after hewitt and the two together went to the spot close under a chimneystack on the next roof but one where the case had been found plummer produced the case which he had in his coattail pocket for hewitts inspection i dont see anything particular about it do you he said it shows us the way they went though being found just here well yes hewitt said if we kept on in this direction we should be going toward mr woolletts house and his trapdoor shouldnt we the inspector pursed his lips smiled and shrugged his shoulders of course we havent waited till now to find that out he said no of course and as you say i didnt think there is much to be learned from this leather case it is almost new and there isnt a mark on it and hewitt handed it back to the inspector well said plummer as he returned the case to his pocket whats your opinion its rather an awkward case yes it is between ourselvesi dont mind telling youim having a sharp lookout kept over thereplummer jerked his head in the direction of mr woolletts chambersbecause the robberys an unusual one theres only two possible motivesthe sale of the cameo or the keeping of it the sales out of the question as you know the things only salable to those who would collar the thief at once and who wouldnt have the thing in their places now for anything so that it must be taken to keep and thats a thing nobody but the maddest of collectors would do just such persons as and the inspector nodded again toward mr woolletts quarters take that with the other circumstances he added and i think youll agree its worth while looking a little farther that way of course some of the worktaking off the lock and so onlooks rather like a regular burglar but its just possible that any one badly wanting the cameo would like to hire a man who was up to the work yes its possible do you know anything of hahn the agent plummer asked a moment later no i dont have you found him yet i havent yet but im after him ive found he was at charing cross a day or two ago booking a ticket for the continent that and his failing to turn up today seem to make it worth while not to miss him if we can help it he isnt the sort of man that lets a chance of drawing a bit of money go for nothing they returned to the room well said lord stanway whats the result of the consultation weve been waiting here very patiently while you two clever men have been discussing the matter on the roof on the wall just beneath the trapdoor a very dusty old tall hat hung on a peg this hewitt took down and examined very closely smearing his fingers with the dust from the inside lining is this one of your valuable and crusted old antiques he asked with a smile of mr claridge thats only an old hat that i used to keep here for use in bad weather mr claridge said with some surprise at the question i havent touched it for a year or more oh then it couldnt have been left here by your last nights visitor hewitt replied carelessly replacing it on the hook you left here at eight last night i think eight exactlyor within a minute or two just so i think ill look at the room on the opposite side of the landing if youll let me certainly if youd like to claridge replied but they havent been thereit is exactly as it was left only a lumberroom you see he concluded flinging the door open a number of partly brokenup packingcases littered about this room with much other rubbish hewitt took the lid of one of the newestlooking packingcases and glanced at the address label then he turned to a rusty old iron box that stood against a wall i should like to see behind this he said tugging at it with his hands it is heavy and dirty is there a small crowbar about the house or some similar lever mr claridge shook his head havent such a thing in the place he said never mind hewitt replied another time will do to shift that old box and perhaps after all theres little reason for moving it i will just walk round to the policestation i think and speak to the constables who were on duty opposite during the night i think lord stanway i have seen all that is necessary here i suppose asked mr claridge it is too soon yet to ask if you have formed any theory in the matter wellyes it is hewitt answered but perhaps i may be able to surprise you in an hour or two but that i dont promise by the by he added suddenly i suppose youre sure the trapdoor was bolted last night certainly mr claridge answered smiling else how could the bolt have been broken as a matter of fact i believe the trap hasnt been opened for months mr cutler do you remember when the trapdoor was last opened mr cutler shook his head certainly not for six months he said ah very well its not very important hewitt replied as they reached the front shop a fieryfaced old gentleman bounced in at the street door stumbling over an umbrella that stood in a dark corner and kicking it three yards away what the deuce do you mean he roared at mr claridge by sending these police people smelling about my rooms and asking questions of my servants what do you mean sir by treating me as a thief cant a gentleman come into this place to look at an article without being suspected of stealing it when it disappears through your wretched carelessness ill ask my solicitor sir if there isnt a remedy for this sort of thing and if i catch another of your spy fellows on my staircase or crawling about my roof illill shoot him really mr woollett began mr claridge somewhat abashed but the angry old man would hear nothing dont talk to me sir you shall talk to my solicitor and am i to understand my lordturning to lord stanwaythat these things are being done with your approval whatever is being done lord stanway answered is being done by the police on their own responsibility and entirely without prompting i believe by mr claridgecertainly without a suggestion of any sort from myself i think that the personal opinion of mr claridgecertainly my ownis that anything like a suspicion of your position in this wretched matter is ridiculous and if you will only consider the matter calmly consider it calmly imagine yourself considering such a thing calmly lord stanway i wont consider it calmly illilli wont have it and if i find another man on my roof ill pitch him off and mr woollett bounced into the street again mr woollett is annoyed hewitt observed with a smile im afraid plummer has a clumsy assistant somewhere mr claridge said nothing but looked rather glum for mr woollett was a most excellent customer lord stanwood and hewitt walked slowly down the street hewitt staring at the pavement in profound thought once or twice lord stanway glanced at his face but refrained from disturbing him presently however he observed you seem at least mr hewitt to have noticed something that has set you thinking does it look like a clue hewitt came out of his cogitation at once a clue he said the case bristles with clues the extraordinary thing to me is that plummer usually a smart man doesnt seem to have seen one of them he must be out of sorts im afraid but the case is decidedly a most remarkable one remarkable in what particular way in regard to motive now it would seem as plummer was saying to me just now on the roof that there were only two possible motives for such a robbery either the man who took all this trouble and risk to break into claridges place must have desired to sell the cameo at a good price or he must have desired to keep it for himself being a lover of such things but neither of these has been the actual motive perhaps he thinks he can extort a good sum from me by way of ransom no it isnt that nor is it jealousy nor spite nor anything of that kind i know the motive i thinkbut i wish we could get hold of hahn i will shut myself up alone and turn it over in my mind for half an hour presently meanwhile what i want to know is apart from all your professional subtletieswhich i confess i cant understandcan you get back the cameo that said hewitt stopping at the corner of the street i am rather afraid i can notnor anybody else but i am pretty sure i know the thief then surely that will lead you to the cameo it may of course but then it is just possible that by this evening you may not want to have it back after all lord stanway stared in amazement not want to have it back he exclaimed why of course i shall want to have it back i dont understand you in the least you talk in conundrums who is the thief you speak of i think lord stanway hewitt said that perhaps i had better not say until i have quite finished my inquiries in case of mistakes the case is quite an extraordinary one and of quite a different character from what one would at first naturally imagine and i must be very careful to guard against the possibility of error i have very little fear of a mistake however and i hope i may wait on you in a few hours at piccadilly with news i have only to see the policemen certainly come whenever you please but why see the policemen they have already most positively stated that they saw nothing whatever suspicious in the house or near it i shall not ask them anything at all about the house hewitt responded i shall just have a little chat with themabout the weather and with a smiling bow he turned away while lord stanway stood and gazed after him with an expression that implied a suspicion that his special detective was making a fool of him in rather more than an hour hewitt was back in mr claridges shop mr claridge he said i think i must ask you one or two questions in private may i see you in your own room they went there at once and hewitt pulling a chair before the window sat down with his back to the light the dealer shut the door and sat opposite him with the light full in his face mr claridge hewitt proceeded slowly when did you first find that lord stanways cameo was a forgery claridge literally bounced in his chair his face paled but he managed to stammer sharply whatwhatwhat dyou mean forgery do you mean to say i sell forgeries forgery it wasnt a forgery then continued hewitt in the same deliberate tone watching the others face the while if it wasnt a forgery why did you destroy it and burst your trapdoor and desk to imitate a burglary the sweat stood thick on the dealers face and he gasped but he struggled hard to keep his faculties together and ejaculated hoarsely destroy it whatwhati didntdidnt destroy it threw it into the river thendont prevaricate about details nonoits a lie who says that go away youre insulting me claridge almost screamed come come mr claridge hewitt said more placably for he had gained his point dont distress yourself and dont attempt to deceive meyou cant i assure you i know everything you did before you left here last nighteverything claridges face worked painfully once or twice he appeared to be on the point of returning an indignant reply but hesitated and finally broke down altogether dont expose me mr hewitt he pleaded i beg you wont expose me i havent harmed a soul but myself ive paid lord stanway every penny back and i never knew the thing was a forgery till i began to clean it im an old man mr hewitt and my professional reputation has been spotless until now i beg you wont expose me hewitts voice softened dont make an unnecessary trouble of it he said i see a decanter on your sideboardlet me give you a little brandy and water come theres nothing criminal i believe in a mans breaking open his own desk or his own trapdoor for that matter of course im acting for lord stanway in this affair and i must in duty report to him without reserve but lord stanway is a gentleman and ill undertake hell do nothing inconsiderate of your feelings if youre disposed to be frank let us talk the affair over tell me about it it was that swindler hahn who deceived me in the beginning claridge said i have never made a mistake with a cameo before and i never thought so close an imitation was possible i examined it most carefully and was perfectly satisfied and many experts examined it afterward and were all equally deceived i felt as sure as i possibly could feel that i had bought one of the finest if not actually the finest cameos known to exist it was not until after it had come back from lord stanways and i was cleaning it the evening before last that in course of my work it became apparent that the thing was nothing but a consummately clever forgery it was made of three layers of molded glass nothing more nor less but the glass was treated in a way i had never before known of and the surface had been cunningly worked on till it defied any ordinary examination some of the glass imitation cameos made in the latter part of the last century i may tell you are regarded as marvelous pieces of work and indeed command very fair prices but this was something quite beyond any of those i was amazed and horrified i put the thing away and went home all that night i lay awake in a state of distraction quite unable to decide what to do to let the cameo go out of my possession was impossible sooner or later the forgery would be discovered and my reputationthe highest in these matters in this country i may safely claim and the growth of nearly fifty years of honest application and good judgmentthis reputation would be gone forever but without considering this there was the fact that i had taken five thousand pounds of lord stanways money for a mere piece of glass and that money i must in mere common honesty as well as for my own sake return but how the name of the stanway cameo had become a household word and to confess that the whole thing was a sham would ruin my reputation and destroy all confidencepast present and futurein me and in my transactions either way spelled ruin even if i confided in lord stanway privately returned his money and destroyed the cameo what then the sudden disappearance of an article so famous would excite remark at once it had been presented to the british museum and if it never appeared in that collection and no news were to be got of it people would guess at the truth at once to make it known that i myself had been deceived would have availed nothing it is my business not to be deceived and to have it known that my most expensive specimens might be forgeries would equally mean ruin whether i sold them cunningly as a rogue or ignorantly as a fool indeed my pride my reputation as a connoisseur is a thing near to my heart and it would be an unspeakable humiliation to me to have it known that i had been imposed on by such a forgery what could i do every expedient seemed useless but onethe one i adopted it was not straightforward i admit but oh mr hewitt consider the temptationand remember that it couldnt do a soul any harm no matter who might be suspected i knew there could not possibly be evidence to make them suffer all the next dayyesterdayi was anxiously worrying out the thing in my mind and carefully devising thethe trick im afraid youll call it that you by some extraordinary means have seen through it seemed the only thingwhat else was there more i neednt tell you you know it i have only now to beg that you will use your best influence with lord stanway to save me from public derision and exposure i will do anythingpay anythinganything but exposure at my age and with my position well you see hewitt replied thoughtfully ive no doubt lord stanway will show you every consideration and certainly i will do what i can to save you in the circumstances though you must remember that you have done some harmyou have caused suspicions to rest on at least one honest man but as to reputation ive a professional reputation of my own if i help to conceal your professional failure i shall appear to have failed in my part of the business but the cases are different mr hewitt consider you are not expectedit would be impossibleto succeed invariably and there are only two or three who know you have looked into the case then your other conspicuous successes well well we shall see one thing i dont know thoughwhether you climbed out of a window to break open the trapdoor or whether you got up through the trapdoor itself and pulled the bolt with a string through the jamb so as to bolt it after you there was no available window i used the string as you say my poor little cunning must seem very transparent to you i fear i spent hours of thought over the question of the trapdoorhow to break it open so as to leave a genuine appearance and especially how to bolt it inside after i had reached the roof i thought i had succeeded beyond the possibility of suspicion how you penetrated the device surpasses my comprehension how to begin with could you possibly know that the cameo was a forgery did you ever see it never and if i had seen it i fear i should never have been able to express an opinion on it im not a connoisseur as a matter of fact i didnt know that the thing was a forgery in the first place what i knew in the first place was that it was you who had broken into the house it was from that that i arrived at the conclusion after a certain amount of thought that the cameo must have been forged gain was out of the question you beyond all men could never sell the stanway cameo again and besides you had paid back lord stanways money i knew enough of your reputation to know that you would never incur the scandal of a great theft at your place for the sake of getting the cameo for yourself when you might have kept it in the beginning with no trouble and mystery consequently i had to look for another motive and at first another motive seemed an impossibility why should you wish to take all this trouble to lose five thousand pounds you had nothing to gain perhaps you had something to saveyour professional reputation for instance looking at it so it was plain that you were suppressing the cameoburking it since once taken as you had taken it it could never come to light again that suggested the solution of the mystery at onceyou had discovered after the sale that the cameo was not genuine yes yesi see but you say you began with the knowledge that i broke into the place myself how did you know that i can not imagine a trace my dear sir you left traces everywhere in the first place it struck me as curious before i came here that you had sent off that check for five thousand pounds to lord stanway an hour or so after the robbery was discovered it looked so much as though you were sure of the cameo never coming back and were in a hurry to avert suspicion of course i understood that so far as i then knew the case you were the most unlikely person in the world and that your eagerness to repay lord stanway might be the most creditable thing possible but the point was worth remembering and i remembered it when i came here i saw suspicious indications in many directions but the conclusive piece of evidence was that old hat hanging below the trapdoor but i never touched it i assure you mr hewitt i never touched the hat havent touched it for months of course if you had touched it i might never have got the clue but well deal with the hat presently that wasnt what struck me at first the trapdoor first took my attention consider now here was a trapdoor most insecurely hung on external hinges the burglar had a screwdriver for he took off the doorlock below with it why then didnt he take this trap off by the hinges instead of making a noise and taking longer time and trouble to burst the bolt from its fastenings and why if he were a stranger was he able to plant his jimmy from the outside just exactly opposite the interior bolt there was only one mark on the frame and that precisely in the proper place after that i saw the leather case it had not been thrown away or some corner would have shown signs of the fall it had been put down carefully where it was found these things however were of small importance compared with the hat the hat as you know was exceedingly thick with dustthe accumulation of months but on the top side presented toward the trapdoor were a score or so of raindrop marks that was all they were new marks for there was no dust over them they had merely had time to dry and cake the dust they had fallen on now there had been no rain since a sharp shower just after seven oclock last night at that time you by your own statement were in the place you left at eight and the rain was all over at ten minutes or a quarter past seven the trapdoor you also told me had not been opened for months the thing was plain you or somebody who was here when you were had opened that trapdoor during or just before that shower i said little then but went as soon as i had left to the policestation there i made perfectly certain that there had been no rain during the night by questioning the policemen who were on duty outside all the time there had been none i knew everything the only other evidence there was pointed with all the rest there were no rainmarks on the leather case it had been put on the roof as an afterthought when there was no rain a very poor afterthought let me tell you for no thief would throw away a useful case that concealed his booty and protected it from breakage and throw it away just so as to leave a clue as to what direction he had gone in i also saw in the lumberroom a number of packingcasesone with a label dated two days backwhich had been opened with an iron lever and yet when i made an excuse to ask for it you said there was no such thing in the place inference you didnt want me to compare it with the marks on the desks and doors that is all i think mr claridge looked dolorously down at the floor im afraid he said that i took an unsuitable role when i undertook to rely on my wits to deceive men like you i thought there wasnt a single vulnerable spot in my defense but you walk calmly through it at the first attempt why did i never think of those raindrops come said hewitt with a smile that sounds unrepentant i am going now to lord stanways if i were you i think i should apologize to mr woollett in some way lord stanway who in the hour or two of reflection left him after parting with hewitt had come to the belief that he had employed a man whose mind was not always in order received hewitts story with natural astonishment for some time he was in doubt as to whether he would be doing right in acquiescing in anything but a straightforward public statement of the facts connected with the disappearance of the cameo but in the end was persuaded to let the affair drop on receiving an assurance from mr woollett that he unreservedly accepted the apology offered him by mr claridge as for the latter he was at least sufficiently punished in loss of money and personal humiliation for his escapade but the bitterest and last blow he sustained when the unblushing hahn walked smilingly into his office two days later to demand the extra payment agreed on in consideration of the sale he had been called suddenly away he exclaimed on the day he should have come and hoped his missing the appointment had occasioned no inconvenience as to the robbery of the cameo of course he was very sorry but pishness was pishness and he would be glad of a check for the sum agreed on and the unhappy claridge was obliged to pay it knowing that the man had swindled him but unable to open his mouth to say so the reward remained on offer for a long time indeed it was never publicly withdrawn i believe even at the time of claridges death and several intelligent newspapers enlarged upon the fact that an ordinary burglar had completely baffled and defeated the boasted acumen of mr martin hewitt the wellknown private detective vii the affair of the tortoise very often hewitt was tempted by the fascination of some particularly odd case to neglect his other affairs to follow up a matter that from a business point of view was of little or no value to him as a rule he had a sufficient regard for his own interests to resist such temptations but in one curious case at least i believe he allowed it largely to influence him it was certainly an extremely odd caseone of those affairs that coming to light at intervals but more often remaining unheard of by the general public convince one that after all there is very little extravagance about mr rl stevensons bizarre imaginings of doings in london in his new arabian nights there is nothing in this world that is at all possible i have often heard martin hewitt say that has not happened or is not happening in london certainly he had opportunities of knowing the case i have referred to occurred some time before my own acquaintance with him beganin in fact he had called one monday morning at an office in regard to something connected with one of those uninteresting though often difficult cases which formed perhaps the bulk of his practice when he was informed of a most mysterious murder that had taken place in another part of the same building on the previous saturday afternoon owing to the circumstances of the case only the vaguest account had appeared in the morning papers and even this as it chanced hewitt had not read the building was one of a new row in a partly rebuilt street near the national gallery the whole row had been built by a speculator for the purpose of letting out in flats suites of chambers and in one or two cases on the ground floors offices the rooms had let very well and to desirable tenants as a rule the least satisfactory tenant the proprietor reluctantly admitted was a mr rameau a negro gentleman single who had three rooms on the top floor but one of the particular building that hewitt was visiting his rent was paid regularly but his behavior had produced complaints from other tenants he got uproariously drunk and screamed and howled in unknown tongues he fell asleep on the staircase and ladies were afraid to pass he bawled rough chaff down the stairs and along the corridors at butcherboys and messengers and played on errandboys brutal practical jokes that ended in policecourt summonses he once had a way of sliding down the balusters shouting ho ho ho yah as he went but as he was a big heavy man and the balusters had been built for different treatment he had very soon and very firmly been requested to stop it he had plenty of money and spent it freely but it was generally felt that there was too much of the lighthearted savage about him to fit him to live among quiet people how much longer the landlord would have stood this sort of thing hewitts informant said was a matter of conjecture for on the saturday afternoon in question the tenancy had come to a startling fullstop rameau had been murdered in his room and the body had in the most unaccountable fashion been secretly removed from the premises the strongest possible suspicion pointed to a man who had been employed in shoveling and carrying coals cleaning windows and chopping wood for several of the buildings and who had left that very saturday the crime had in fact been committed with this mans chopper and the man himself had been heard again and again to threaten rameau who in his brutal fashion had made a butt of him this man was a frenchman victor goujon by name who had lost his employment as a watchmaker by reason of an injury to his right hand which destroyed its steadiness and so he had fallen upon evil days and odd jobs he was a little man of no great strength but extraordinarily excitable and the coarse gibes and horseplay of the big negro drove him almost to madness rameau would often after some more than ordinarily outrageous attack contemptuously fling goujon a shilling which the little frenchman although wanting a shilling badly enough would hurl back in his face almost weeping with impotent rage pig canaille he would scream dirty pig of africa take your sheelin to vere you ave stole it voleur pig there was a tortoise living in the basement of which goujon had made rather a pet and the negro would sometimes use this animal as a missile flinging it at the little frenchmans head on one such occasion the tortoise struck the wall so forcibly as to break its shell and then goujon seized a shovel and rushed at his tormentor with such blind fury that the latter made a bolt of it these were but a few of the passages between rameau and the fuelporter but they illustrate the state of feeling between them goujon after correspondence with a relative in france who offered him work gave notice to leave which expired on the day of the crime at about three that afternoon a housemaid proceeding toward rameaus rooms met goujon as he was going away goujon bade her goodby and pointing in the direction of rameaus rooms said exultantly dere shall be no more of the black pig for me vit im i ave done for zut i mock me of im e vill never tracasser me no more and he went away the girl went to the outer door of rameaus rooms knocked and got no reply concluding that the tenant was out she was about to use her keys when she found that the door was unlocked she passed through the lobby and into the sittingroom and there fell in a dead faint at the sight that met her eyes rameau lay with his back across the sofa and his headdrooping within an inch of the ground on the head was a fearful gash and below it was a pool of blood the girl must have lain unconscious for about ten minutes when she came to her senses she dragged herself terrified from the room and up to the housekeepers apartments where being an excitable and nervous creature she only screamed murder and immediately fell in a fit of hysterics that lasted threequarters of an hour when at last she came to herself she told her story and the hallporter having been summoned rameaus rooms were again approached the blood still lay on the floor and the chopper with which the crime had evidently been committed rested against the fender but the body had vanished a search was at once made but no trace of it could be seen anywhere it seemed impossible that it could have been carried out of the building for the hallporter must at once have noticed anybody leaving with so bulky a burden still in the building it was not to be found when hewitt was informed of these things on monday the police were of course still in possession of rameaus rooms inspector nettings hewitt was told was in charge of the case and as the inspector was an acquaintance of his and was then in the rooms upstairs hewitt went up to see him nettings was pleased to see hewitt and invited him to look around the rooms perhaps you can spot something we have overlooked he said though its not a case there can be much doubt about you think its goujon dont you think well rather look here as soon as we got here on saturday we found this piece of paper and pin on the floor we showed it to the housemaid and then she rememberedshe was too much upset to think of it beforethat when she was in the room the paper was laying on the dead mans chestpinned there evidently it must have dropped off when they removed the body its a case of halfmad revenge on goujons part plainly see it you read french dont you the paper was a plain large halfsheet of notepaper on which a sentence in french was scrawled in red ink in a large clumsy hand thus puni par un vengeur de la tortue puni par un vengeur de la tortue hewitt repeated musingly punished by an avenger of the tortoise that seems odd well rather odd but you understand the reference of course have they told you about rameaus treatment of goujons pet tortoise i think it was mentioned among his other pranks but this is an extreme revenge for a thing of that sort and a queer way of announcing it oh hes madmad with rameaus continual ragging and baiting nettings answered anyway this is a plain indicationplain as though hed left his own signature besides its in his own languagefrench and theres his chopper too speaking of signatures hewitt remarked perhaps you have already compared this with other specimens of goujons writing i did think of it but they dont seem to have a specimen to hand and anyway it doesnt seem very important theres avenger of the tortoise plain enough in the mans own language and that tells everything besides handwritings are easily disguised have you got goujon well no we havent there seems to be some little difficulty about that but i expect to have him by this time tomorrow here comes mr styles the landlord mr styles was a thin querulous and witheredlooking little man who twitched his eyebrows as he spoke and spoke in short jerky phrases no news eh inspector eh eh found out nothing else eh terrible thing for my propertyterrible whos your friend nettings introduced hewitt shocking thing this eh mr hewitt terrible comes of having anything to do with these bloodthirsty foreigners eh new buildings and allcharacter ruined no one come to live here now eh tenantsnoisy niggersmurdered by my own servantsterrible you formed any opinion eh i dare say i might if i went into the case yes yessame opinion as inspectors eh i mean an opinion of your own the old man scrutinized hewitts face sharply if youd like me to look into the matter hewitt began eh oh look into it well i cant commission you you knowmatter for the police mischiefs done police doing very well i thinkmust be goujon but look about the place certainly if you like if you see anything likely to serve my interests tell me andandperhaps ill employ you eh eh goodafternoon the landlord vanished and the inspector laughed likes to see what hes buying does mr styles he said hewitts first impulse was to walk out of the place at once but his interest in the case had been roused and he determined at any rate to examine the rooms and this he did very minutely by the side of the lobby was a bathroom and in this was fitted a tipup washbasin which hewitt inspected with particular attention then he called the housekeeper and made inquiries about rameaus clothes and linen the housekeeper could give no idea of how many overcoats or how much linen he had had he had all a negros love of display and was continually buying new clothes which indeed were lying hanging littering and choking up the bedroom in all directions the housekeeper however on hewitts inquiring after such a garment in particular did remember one heavy black ulster which rameau had very rarely wornonly in the coldest weather after the body was discovered hewitt asked the housekeeper was any stranger observed about the placewhether carrying anything or not no sir the housekeeper replied theres been particular inquiries about that of course after we knew what was wrong and the body was gone nobody was seen or hed have been stopped but the hallporter says hes certain no stranger came or went for half an hour or more before thatthe time about when the housemaid saw the body and fainted at this moment a clerk from the landlords office arrived and handed nettings a paper here you are said nettings to hewitt theyve found a specimen of goujons handwriting at last if youd like to see it i dont want it im not a graphologist and the case is clear enough for me anyway hewitt took the paper this he said is a different sort of handwriting from that on the paper the redink note about the avenger of the tortoise is in a crude large clumsy untaught style of writing this is small neat and well formedexcept that it is a trifle shaky probably because of the hand injury thats nothing contended nettings handwriting clues are worse than useless as a rule its so easy to disguise and imitate writing and besides if goujon is such a good penman as you seem to say why he could all the easier alter his style say now yourself can any fiddling question of handwriting get over this thing about avenging the tortoisepractically a written confessionto say nothing of the chopper and what he said to the housemaid as he left well said hewitt perhaps not but well see meantimeturning to the landlords clerkpossibly you will be good enough to tell me one or two things first what was goujons character excellent as far as we know we never had a complaint about him except for little matters of carelessnessleaving coalscuttles on the staircases for people to fall over losing shovels and so on he was certainly a bit careless but as far as we could see quite a decent little fellow one would never have thought him capable of committing murder for the sake of a tortoise though he was rather fond of the animal the tortoise is dead now i understand yes have you a lift in this building only for coals and heavy parcels goujon used to work it sometimes going up and down in it himself with coals and so on it goes into the basement and are the coals kept under this building no the store for the whole row is under the next two housesthe basements communicate do you know rameaus other name cesar rameau he signed in our agreement did he ever mention his relations no that is to say he did say something one day when he was very drunk but of course it was all rot some one told him not to make such a rowhe was a beastly tenantand he said he was the best man in the place and his brother was prime minister and all sorts of things mere drunken rant i never heard of his saying anything sensible about relations we know nothing of his connections he came here on a bankers reference thanks i think thats all i want to ask you notice hewitt proceeded turning to nettings the only ink in this place is scented and violet and the only paper is tinted and scented too with a monogramcharacteristic of a negro with money the paper that was pinned on rameaus breast is in red ink on common and rather grubby paper therefore it was written somewhere else and brought here inference premeditation yes yes but are you an inch nearer with all these speculations can you get nearer than i am now without them well perhaps not hewitt replied i dont profess at this moment to know the criminal you do ill concede you that point for the present but you dont offer an opinion as to who removed rameaus bodywhich i think i know who was it then come try and guess that yourself it wasnt goujon i dont mind letting you know that but it was a person quite within your knowledge of the case youve mentioned the persons name more than once nettings stared blankly i dont understand you in the least he said but of course you mean that this mysterious person you speak of as having moved the body committed the murder no i dont nobody could have been more innocent of that well nettings concluded with resignation im afraid one of us is rather thickheaded what will you do interview the person who took away the body hewitt replied with a smile but man alive why why bother about the person if it isnt the criminal never mindnever mind probably the person will be a most valuable witness do you mean you think this personwhoever it issaw the crime i think it very probable indeed well i wont ask you any more i shall get hold of goujon thats simple and direct enough for me i prefer to deal with the heart of the casethe murder itselfwhen theres such clear evidence as i have i shall look a little into that too perhaps hewitt said and if you like ill tell you the first thing i shall do whats that i shall have a good look at a map of the west indies and i advise you to do the same goodmorning nettings stared down the corridor after hewitt and continued staring for nearly two minutes after he had disappeared then he said to the clerk who had remained what was he talking about dont know replied the clerk couldnt make head nor tail of it i dont believe there is a head to it declared nettings nor a tail either hes kidding us nettings was better than his word for within two hours of his conversation with hewitt goujon was captured and safe in a cab bound for bow street he had been stopped at newhaven in the morning on his way to dieppe and was brought back to london but now nettings met a check late that afternoon he called on hewitt to explain matters weve got goujon he said gloomily but theres a difficulty hes got two friends who can swear an alibi rameau was seen alive at halfpast one on saturday and the girl found him dead about three now goujons two friends it seems were with him from one oclock till four in the afternoon with the exception of five minutes when the girl saw him and then he left them to take a key or something to the housekeeper before finally leaving they were waiting on the landing below when goujon spoke to the housemaid heard him speaking and had seen him go all the way up to the housekeepers room and back as they looked up the wide well of the staircase they are men employed near the place and seem to have good characters but perhaps we shall find something unfavorable about them they were drinking with goujon it seems by way of seeing him off well hewitt said i scarcely think you need trouble to damage these mens characters they are probably telling the truth come now be plain youve come here to get a hint as to whether my theory of the case helps you havent you well if you can give me a friendly hint although of course i may be right after all still i wish youd explain a bit as to what you meant by looking at a map and all that mystery nice thing for me to be taking a lesson in my own business after all these years but perhaps i deserve it see now quoth hewitt you remember what map i told you to look at the west indies right well here you are hewitt reached an atlas from his bookshelf now look here the biggest island of the lot on this map barring cuba is hayti you know as well as i do that the western part of that island is peopled by the black republic of hayti and that the country is in a degenerate state of almost unexampled savagery with a ridiculous show of civilization there are revolutions all the time the south american republics are peaceful and prosperous compared to hayti the state of the country is simply awfulread sir spenser st johns book on it president after president of the vilest sort forces his way to power and commits the most horrible and bloodthirsty excesses murdering his opponents by the hundred and seizing their property for himself and his satellites who are usually as bad if not worse than the president himself whole familiesmen women and childrenare murdered at the instance of these ruffians and as a consequence the most deadly feuds spring up and the presidents and their followers are always themselves in danger of reprisals from others perhaps the very worst of these presidents in recent times has been the notorious domingue who was overthrown by an insurrection as they all are sooner or later and compelled to fly the country domingue and his nephews one of whom was chief minister while in power committed the cruellest bloodshed and many members of the opposite party sought refuge in a small island lying just to the north of hayti but were sought out there and almost exterminated now i will show you that island on the map what is its name tortuga it is tortuga however is only the old spanish name the haytians speak frenchcreole french here is a french atlas now see the name of that island la tortue la tortue it isthe tortoise tortuga means the same thing in spanish but that island is always spoken of in hayti as la tortue now do you see the drift of that paper pinned to rameaus breast punished by an avenger ofor fromthe tortoise or la tortueclear enough it would seem that the dead man had something to do with the massacre there and somebody from the island is avenging it the things most extraordinary and now listen the name of domingues nephew who was chief minister was septimus rameau and this was cesar rameauhis brother probably i see well this is a case i think the relationship probable now you understand why i was inclined to doubt that goujon was the man you wanted of course of course and now i suppose i must try to get a niggerthe chap who wrote that paper i wish he hadnt been such an ignorant nigger if hed only have put the capitals to the words la tortue i might have thought a little more about them instead of taking it for granted that they meant that wretched tortoise in the basement of the house well ive made a fool of a start but ill be after that nigger now and i as i said before said hewitt shall be after the person that carried off rameaus body i have had something else to do this afternoon or i should have begun already you said you thought he saw the crime how did you judge that hewitt smiled i think ill keep that little secret to myself for the present he said you shall know soon very well nettings replied with resignation i suppose i mustnt grumble if you dont tell me everything i feel too great a fool altogether over this case to see any farther than you show me and inspector nettings left on his search while martin hewitt as soon as he was alone laughed joyously and slapped his thigh there was a cabrank and shelter at the end of the street where mr styles building stood and early that evening a man approached it and hailed the cabmen and the waterman any one would have known the newcomer at once for a cabman taking a holiday the brim of the hat the birdseye neckerchief the immense coatbuttons and more than all the rolling walk and the wrinkled trousers marked him out distinctly watcheer he exclaimed affably with the selfpossessed nod only possible to cabbies and busmen im alookin for a bilker im told one o the blokes off this rank carried im last saturday and i want to know where he went i aint ad a chance o gettin is address yet took a cab just as it got dark im told tallish chap muffled up a lot in a long black overcoat any of ye seen im the cabbies looked at one another and shook their heads it chanced that none of them had been on that particular rank at that time but the waterman said old oni bet es the bloke wot old bill stammers took yorkey was fust on the rank but the bloke wouldnt ave a ansomwanted a fourwheeler so old bill took im biggish chap in a long black coat collar up an muffled thick soft wideawake at pulled over is eyes and he was in a urry too jumped in sharp as a weasel didnt see is face did ye nonot an inch of it too much muffled couldnt tell if he ad a face was his arm in a sling ay it looked so had it stuffed through the breast of his coat like as though there might be a sling inside thats im any of ye tell me where i might run across old bill stammers hell tell me where my precious bilker went to as to this there was plenty of information and in five minutes martin hewitt who had become an unoccupied cabman for the occasion was on his way to find old bill stammers that respectable old man gave him full particulars as to the place in the east end where he had driven his muffled fare on saturday and hewitt then begun an eighteen or twenty hours search beyond whitechapel at about three on tuesday afternoon as nettings was in the act of leaving bow street police station hewitt drove up in a fourwheeler some prisoner appeared to be crouching low in the vehicle but leaving him to take care of himself hewitt hurried into the station and shook nettings by the hand well he said have you got the murderer of rameau yet no nettings growled unlesswell goujons under remand still and after all ive been thinking that he may know something pooh nonsense hewitt answered youd better let him go now i have got somebody hewitt laughed and slapped the inspectors shoulder ive got the man who carried rameaus body away the deuce you have where bring him in we must have him all right dont be in a hurry he wont bolt and hewitt stepped out to the cab and produced his prisoner who pulling his hat farther over his eyes hurried furtively into the station one hand was stowed in the breast of his long coat and below the wide brim of his hat a small piece of white bandage could be seen and as he lifted his face it was seen to be that of a negro inspector nettings hewitt said ceremoniously allow me to introduce mr cesar rameau nettings gasped what he at length ejaculated what youyoure rameau the negro looked round nervously and shrank farther from the door yes he said but please not so loudplease not loud zey may be near and im fraid you will certify will you not asked hewitt with malicious glee not only that you were not murdered last saturday by victor goujon but that in fact you were not murdered at all also that you carried your own body away in the usual fashion on your own legs yes yes responded rameau looking haggardly about but is not ziszis room publique i should not be seen nonsense replied hewitt rather testily you exaggerate your danger and your own importance and your enemies abilities as well youre safe enough i suppose then nettings remarked slowly like a man on whose mind something vast was beginning to dawn i supposewhy hang it you must have just got up while that fool of a girl was screaming and fainting upstairs and walked out they say theres nothing so hard as a niggers skull and yours has certainly made a fool of me but then somebody must have chopped you over the head who was it my enemiesmy great enemiesenemies politique i am a great manthis with a faint revival of vanity amid his feara great man in my countree zey have great secret clubsieties to kill meme and my frens and one enemy coming in my rooms does zisone twohe indicated wrist and headwiz a choppa rameau made the case plain to nettings so far as the actual circumstances of the assault on himself were concerned a negro whom he had noticed near the place more than once during the previous day or two had attacked him suddenly in his rooms dealing him two savage blows with a chopper the first he had caught on his wrist which was seriously damaged as well as excruciatingly painful but the second had taken effect on his head his assailant had evidently gone away then leaving him for dead but as a matter of fact he was only stunned by the shock and had thanks to the adamantine thickness of the negro skull and the illdirection of the chopper only a very bad scalpwound the bone being no more than grazed he had lain insensible for some time and must have come to his senses soon after the housemaid had left the room terrified at the knowledge that his enemies had found him out his only thought was to get away and hide himself he hastily washed and tied up his head enveloped himself in the biggest coat he could find and let himself down into the basement by the coallift for fear of observation he waited in the basement of one of the adjoining buildings till dark and then got away in a cab with the idea of hiding himself in the east end he had had very little money with him on his flight and it was by reason of this circumstance that hewitt when he found him had prevailed on him to leave his hidingplace since it would be impossible for him to touch any of the large sums of money in the keeping of his bank so long as he was supposed to be dead with much difficulty and the promise of ample police protection he was at last convinced that it would be safe to declare himself and get his property and then run away and hide wherever he pleased nettings and hewitt strolled off together for a few minutes and chatted leaving the wretched rameau to cower in a corner among several policemen well mr hewitt nettings said this case has certainly been a shocking beating for me i must have been as blind as a bat when i started on it and yet i dont see that you had a deal to go on even now what struck you first well in the beginning it seemed rather odd to me that the body should have been taken away as i had been told it was after the written paper had been pinned on it why should the murderer pin a label on the body of his victim if he meant carrying that body away who would read the label and learn of the nature of the revenge gratified plainly that indicated that the person who had carried away the body was not the person who had committed the murder but as soon as i began to examine the place i saw the probability that there was no murder after all there were any number of indications of this fact and i cant understand your not observing them first although there was a good deal of blood on the floor just below where the housemaid had seen rameau lying there was none between that place and the door now if the body had been dragged or even carried to the door blood must have become smeared about the floor or at least there would have been drops but there were none and this seemed to hint that the corpse might have come to itself sat up on the sofa stanched the wound and walked out i reflected at once that rameau was a fullblooded negro and that a negros head is very nearly invulnerable to anything short of bullets then if the body had been dragged outas such a heavy body must have beenalmost of necessity the carpet and rugs would show signs of the fact but there were no such signs but beyond these there was the fact that no long black overcoat was left with the other clothes although the housekeeper distinctly remembered rameaus possession of such a garment i judged he would use some such thing to assist his disguise which was why i asked her why he would want to disguise was plain as you shall see presently there were no towels left in the bathroom inference used for bandages everything seemed to show that the only person responsible for rameaus removal was rameau himself why then had he gone away secretly and hurriedly without making complaint and why had he stayed away what reason would he have for doing this if it had been goujon that had attacked him none goujon was going to france clearly rameau was afraid of another attack from some implacable enemy whom he was anxious to avoidone against whom he feared legal complaint or defense would be useless this brought me at once to the paper found on the floor if this were the work of goujon and an open reference to his tortoise why should he be at such pains to disguise his handwriting he would have been already pointing himself out by the mere mention of the tortoise and if he could not avoid a shake in his natural small handwriting how could he have avoided it in a large clumsy slowly drawn assumed hand no the paper was not goujons as to the writing on the paper nettings interposed ive told you how i made that mistake i took the readiest explanation of the words since they seemed so pat and i wouldnt let anything else outweigh that as to the other thingsthe evidences of rameaus having gone off by himselfwell i dont usually miss such obvious things but i never thought of the possibility of the victim going away on the quiet and not coming back as though hed done something wrong comes of starting with a set of fixed notions well answered hewitt i fancy you must have been rather out of form as they say everybody has his stupid days and you cant keep up to concert pitch forever to return to the case the evidence of the chopper was very untrustworthy especially when i had heard of goujons careless habitslosing shovels and leaving coalscuttles on stairs nothing more likely than for the chopper to be left lying about and a criminal who had calculated his chances would know the advantage to himself of using a weapon that belonged to the place and leaving it behind to divert suspicion it is quite possible by the way that the man who attacked rameau got away down the coallift and out by an adjoining basement just as did rameau himself this however is mere conjecture the wouldbe murderer had plainly prepared for the crime witness the previous preparation of the paper declaring his revenge an indication of his pride at having run his enemy to earth at such a distant place as thisalthough i expect he was only in england by chance for haytians are not a persistently energetic race in regard to the use of small instead of capital letters in the words la tortue on the paper i observed in the beginning that the first letter of the whole sentencethe p in puniwas a small one clearly the writer was an illiterate man and it was at once plain that he may have made the same mistake with ensuing words on the whole it was plain that everybody had begun with a too ready disposition to assume that goujon was guilty everybody insisted too that the body had been carried awaywhich was true of course although not in the sense intendedso i didnt trouble to contradict or to say more than that i guessed who had carried the body off and to tell you the truth i was a little piqued at mr styles manner and indisposed interested in the case as i was to give away my theories too freely the rest of the job was not very difficult i found out the cabman who had taken rameau awayyou can always get readier help from cabbies if you go as one of themselves especially if you are after a bilkerand from him got a sufficiently near east end direction to find rameau after inquiries i ventured by the way on a rather long shot i described my man to the cabman as having an injured arm or wristand it turned out a correct guess you see a man making an attack with a chopper is pretty certain to make more than a single blow and as there appeared to have been only a single wound on the head it seemed probable that another had fallen somewhere elsealmost certainly on the arm as it would be raised to defend the head at limehouse i found he had had his head and wrist attended to at a local medicos and a big nigger in a fright with a long black coat a broken head and a lame hand is not so difficult to find in a small area how i persuaded him up here you know already i think i frightened him a little too by explaining how easily i had tracked him and giving him a hint that others might do the same he is in a great funk he seems to have quite lost faith in england as a safe asylum the police failed to catch rameaus assailantchiefly because rameau could not be got to give a proper description of him nor to do anything except get out of the country in a hurry in truth he was glad to be quit of the matter with nothing worse than his broken head little goujon made a wild storm about his arrest and before he did go to france managed to extract twenty pounds from rameau by way of compensation in spite of the absence of any strictly legal claim against his old tormentor so that on the whole goujon was about the only person who derived any particular profit from the tortoise mystery the end
