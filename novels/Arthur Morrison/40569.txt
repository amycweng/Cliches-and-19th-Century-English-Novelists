squire napper a poor stick a conversion all that messuage introduction to the american edition it was considered an intrepid thing for walter besant to do when twelve or thirteen years ago he invaded the great east end of london and drew upon its unknown wealth of varied material to people that most charming novel all sorts and conditions of men until then the west end knew little of its contiguous neighbor in the east dickenss kaleidoscopic views of low life in the south of london were manifestly caricatures of the slum specimens of human nature which he purposely sought and often distorted to suit his bizarre humor mr besant may be fairly considered as the pioneer of those who have since descended to the great unchartered region of east london about which so far as our knowledge of the existing conditions of human life in that community are concerned we remained until as it were yesterday almost as ignorant as of the undiscovered territories in central africa contemporaneous with mr besants discovery of east london began the eastward march of the salvation army which has since honeycombed this quarter of the metropolis with its militant camps gradually the barriers were thrown down and the east has become accessible to literature and to civilization as it never had been to the various charity and church missionary organizations it was as the secretary of an old charity trust that mr arthur morrison first made his acquaintance with east london and by dint of several years residence and attentive study acquired his knowledge of the east end and its myriad denizens right in the midst of the great square bounded by the thames the lea the city kingsland and the hackney open spaces lie the dreary mean streets which mr morrison has described with uncommon power and vigor and among which the operations of his secretaryship engaged him laboriously for years the possibility of presenting his observations of east london in narrative form began to grow upon him while casting around for literary pabulum to convert into magazine articles and in october appeared his first sketch entitled a street in macmillans magazine this in a remodelled form now serves as an introductory chapter to the present collection the article in macmillans attracted a good deal of attention and won for its author the good fellowship of mr w e henley who encouraged him in his idea of writing a series of short stories and studies which should describe east end life with austerity restraint and frankness a large number of the tales appeared in the national observer and several followed in the pall mall budget the dedication to mr henley of tales of mean streets is a grateful acknowledgment by the author of the kindly and frank counsel of his friendly critic whose criticism it may be added has been mainly directed towards the authors craftsmanshiphis conceptions of the life he was portraying the critic was wise enough to let alone mr morrison has also been indebted on the side of art in fiction to mr walter besant whom he met in the east end mr morrison has been fortunate in his literary experience he is another witness to the fact that merit makes its way from the outside without necessarily receiving aid or having influence brought to bear on editors or publishers it is curious to note that a manuscript of his which happened to be rejected once was accepted on the day following and now has a place in this book some cycling verses contributed as a lad to a cycling magazine began his literary career and for some years he continued to write on what was then a novel sport he drifted into broader channels and became a frequent contributor to popular papers and magazines during this period he was working on the charity commission and wrote only by way of relaxation about five years ago he resigned his office on the trust and occupying chambers near the strand joined the editorial staff of an oldestablished evening paper where for some months he continued to write leaderettes and miscellaneous articles and notes until becoming convinced that he could not do justice to such ability for better work which he might possess amidst the grinding routine of newspaper scribbling he gave up his post and applied himself to more serious writing contributing to the strand and other magazines and reviews about this time he began the series which is now gathered under the common title tales of mean streets on its recent publication in england it was received with instant recognition as a book of extraordinary merit and it has met with signal success some idea of the strong impression which it has made in england may be gathered from mr arthur waughs warm tribute to the authors distinction in a recent letter to the critic he deals exclusively writes mr waugh with life in the east end of london and he does so with a fearlessness and originality which are of more value than many sermons i do not know whether his book is published in america but if so i strongly advise every reader of this letter to secure it those who do so will learn from its pages more of the degradation and misery of a certain side of london life than they could in many weeks of philanthropic slumming mr morrisons will be a name to conjure with in another season mr arthur morrison is but thirtyone and has just stepped on to the threshold of literary fame as a writer of decided promise and strength he has only broken ground as yet in the field which has brought him his spurs and is at present contemplating a longer story of east end life the number of those who have attempted to write familiarly of the seamy side of our great cities from close observation and laborious study of its life in a firsthand fashion is so small that it is easy to believe that the author of tales of mean streets possessing as he does the prime qualities of a novelist has a future before him in an unprecedented form of literature james macarthur new york march introduction a street this street is in the east end there is no need to say in the east end of what the east end is a vast city as famous in its way as any the hand of man has made but who knows the east end it is down through cornhill and out beyond leadenhall street and aldgate pump one will say a shocking place where he once went with a curate an evil plexus of slums that hide human creeping things where filthy men and women live on pennorths of gin where collars and clean shirts are decencies unknown where every citizen wears a black eye and none ever combs his hair the east end is a place says another which is given over to the unemployed and the unemployed is a race whose token is a clay pipe and whose enemy is soap now and again it migrates bodily to hyde park with banners and furnishes adjacent police courts with disorderly drunks still another knows the east end only as the place whence begging letters come there are coal and blanket funds there all perennially insolvent and everybody always wants a day in the country many and misty are peoples notions of the east end and each is commonly but the distorted shadow of a minor feature foul slums there are in the east end of course as there are in the west want and misery there are as wherever a host is gathered together to fight for food but they are not often spectacular in kind of this street there are about one hundred and fifty yardson the same pattern all it is not pretty to look at a dingy little brick house twenty feet high with three square holes to carry the windows and an oblong hole to carry the door is not a pleasing object and each side of this street is formed by two or three score of such houses in a row with one front wall in common and the effect is as of stables round the corner there are a bakers a chandlers and a beershop they are not included in the view from any of the rectangular holes but they are well known to every denizen and the chandler goes to church on sunday and pays for his seat at the opposite end turnings lead to streets less rigidly respectable some where mangling done here stares from windows and where doors are left carelessly open others where squalid women sit on doorsteps and girls go to factories in white aprons many such turnings of as many grades of decency are set between this and the nearest slum they are not a very noisy or obtrusive lot in this street they do not go to hyde park with banners and they seldom fight it is just possible that one or two among them at some point in a life of ups and downs may have been indebted to a coal and blanket fund but whosoever these may be they would rather die than publish the disgrace and it is probable that they very nearly did so ere submitting to it some who inhabit this street are in the docks some in the gasworks some in one or other of the few shipbuilding yards that yet survive on the thames two families in a house is the general rule for there are six rooms behind each set of holes this unless young men lodgers are taken in or there are grown sons paying for bed and board as for the grown daughters they marry as soon as may be domestic service is a social descent and little under millinery and dressmaking is compatible with selfrespect the general servant may be caught young among the turnings at the end where mangling is done and the factory girls live still further off in places skirting slums every morning at halfpast five there is a curious demonstration the street resounds with thunderous knockings repeated upon door after door and acknowledged ever by a muffled shout from within these signals are the work of the nightwatchman or the early policeman or both and they summon the sleepers to go forth to the docks the gasworks and the shipyards to be awakened in this wise costs fourpence a week and for this fourpence a fierce rivalry rages between nightwatchmen and policemen the nightwatchmana sort of byblow of the ancient charley and himself a fast vanishing quantityis the real professional performer but he goes to the wall because a large connection must be worked if the pursuit is to pay at fourpence a knocker now it is not easy to bang at two knockers threequarters of a mile apart and a hundred others lying between all punctually at halfpast five wherefore the policeman to whom the fourpence is but a perquisite and who is content with a smaller round is rapidly supplanting the nightwatchman whose cry of past nine oclock as he collects orders in the evening is now seldom heard the knocking and the shouting pass and there comes the noise of opening and shutting of doors and a clattering away to the docks the gasworks and the shipyards later more doorshutting is heard and then the trotting of sorrowladen little feet along the grim street to the grim board school three grim streets off then silence save for a subdued sound of scrubbing here and there and the puny squall of croupy infants after this a new trotting of little feet to docks gasworks and shipyards with fathers dinner in a basin and a red handkerchief and so to the board school again more muffled scrubbing and more squalling and perhaps a feeble attempt or two at decorating the blankness of a square hole here and there by pouring water into a grimy flowerpot full of dirt then comes the trot of little feet toward the oblong holes heralding the slower tread of sooty artisans a smell of bloater up and down nightfall the fighting of boys in the street perhaps of men at the corner near the beershop sleep and this is the record of a day in this street and every day is hopelessly the same every day that is but sunday on sunday morning a smell of cooking floats round the corner from the halfshut bakers and the little feet trot down the street under steaming burdens of beef potatoes and batter puddingthe lucky little feet these with sunday boots on them when father is in good work and has brought home all his money not the poor little feet in worn shoes carrying little bodies in the threadbare clothes of all the week when father is out of work or ill or drunk and the sunday cooking may very easily be done at homeif any there be to do on sunday morning one or two heads of families appear in wonderful black suits with unnumbered creases and wrinklings at the seams at their sides and about their heels trot the unresting little feet and from under painful little velvet caps and straw hats stare solemn little faces towelled to a polish thus disposed and arrayed they fare gravely through the grim little streets to a grim little bethel where are gathered together others in like garb and attendance and for two hours they endure the frantic menace of hellfire most of the men however lie in shirt and trousers on their beds and read the sunday paper while some are driven forthfor they hinder the houseworkto loaf and await the opening of the beershop round the corner thus goes sunday in this street and every sunday is the same as every other sunday so that one monotony is broken with another for the women however sunday is much as other days except that there is rather more work for them the break in their round of the week is washing day no event in the outer world makes any impression in this street nations may rise or may totter in ruin but here the colorless day will work through its twentyfour hours just as it did yesterday and just as it will tomorrow without there may be party strife wars and rumors of wars public rejoicings but the trotting of the little feet will be neither quickened nor stayed those quaint little women the girlchildren of this street who use a motherly management toward all girlthings younger than themselves and toward all boys as old or older with bless the child or drat the childrenthose quaint little women will still go marketing with big baskets and will regard the price of bacon as chief among human considerations nothing disturbs this streetnothing but a strike nobody laughs herelife is too serious a thing nobody sings there was once a woman who sanga young wife from the country but she bore children and her voice cracked then her man died and she sang no more they took away her home and with her children about her skirts she left this street forever the other women did not think much of her she was helpless one of the square holes in this streetone of the single groundfloor holesis found on individual examination to differ from the others there has been an attempt to make it into a shopwindow half a dozen candles a few sickly sugarsticks certain shrivelled bloaters some bootlaces and a bundle or two of firewood compose a stock which at night is sometimes lighted by a little paraffine lamp in a tin sconce and sometimes by a candle a widow lives herea gaunt bony widow with sunken red eyes she has other sources of income than the candles and the bootlaces she washes and chars all day and she sews cheap shirts at night two young men lodgers moreover sleep upstairs and the children sleep in the back room she herself is supposed not to sleep at all the policeman does not knock here in the morningthe widow wakes the lodgers herself and nobody in the street behind ever looks out of window before going to bed no matter how late without seeing a light in the widows room where she plies her needle she is a quiet woman who speaks little with her neighbors having other things to do a woman of pronounced character to whom it would be unadvisableeven dangerousto offer coals or blankets hers was the strongest contempt for the helpless woman who sang a contempt whose added bitterness might be traced to its source for when the singing woman was marketing from which door of the pawnshop had she twice met the widow coming forth this is not a dirty street taken as a whole the widows house is one of the cleanest and the widows children match the house the one house cleaner than the widows is ruled by a despotic scotchwoman who drives every hawker off her whitened step and rubs her door handle if a hand have rested on it the scotchwoman has made several attempts to accommodate young men lodgers but they have ended in shrill rows there is no house without children in this street and the number of them grows ever and ever greater ninetenths of the doctors visits are on this account alone and his appearances are the chief matter of such conversation as the women make across the fences one after another the little strangers come to live through lives as flat and colorless as the days life in this street existence dawns and the doctorwatchmans door knock resounds along the row of rectangular holes then a muffled cry announces that a small new being has come to trudge and sweat its way in the appointed groove later the trotting of little feet and the school the midday play hour when love peeps even into this street after that more trotting of little feetstrange little feet new little feetand the scrubbing and the squalling and the barren flowerpot the end of the sooty days work the last homecoming nightfall sleep when loves light falls into some corner of the street it falls at an early hour of this mean life and is itself but a dusty ray it falls early because it is the sole bright thing which the street sees and is watched for and counted on lads and lasses awkwardly arm in arm go pacing up and down this street before the natural interest in marbles and dolls houses would have left them in a brighter place they are keeping company the manner of which proceeding is indigenousis a custom native to the place the young people first walk out in pairs there is no exchange of promises no trothplight no engagement no lovetalk they patrol the street side by side usually in silence sometimes with fatuous chatter there are no dances no tennis no waterparties no picnics to bring them together so they must walk out or be unacquainted if two of them grow dissatisfied with each others company nothing is easier than to separate and walk out with somebody else when by these means each has found a fit mate or thinks so a ring is bought and the odd association becomes a regular engagement but this is not until the walking out has endured for many months the two stages of courtship are spoken of indiscriminately as keeping company but a very careful distinction is drawn between them by the parties concerned nevertheless in the walking out period it would be almost as great a breach of faith for either to walk out with more than one as it would be if the full engagement had been made and lovemaking in this street is a dreary thing when one thinks of lovemaking in other places it beginsand it endstoo soon nobody from this street goes to the theatre that would mean a long journey and it would cost money which might buy bread and beer and boots for those too who wear black sunday suits it would be sinful nobody reads poetry or romance the very words are foreign a sunday paper in some few houses provides such reading as this street is disposed to achieve now and again a penny novel has been found among the private treasures of a growing daughter and has been wrathfully confiscated for the air of this street is unfavorable to the ideal yet there are aspirations there has lately come into the street a young man lodger who belongs to a mutual improvement society membership in this society is regarded as a sort of learned degree and at its meetings debates are held and papers smugly read by lamentably selfsatisfied young men lodgers whose only preparation for debating and writing is a fathomless ignorance for ignorance is the inevitable portion of dwellers here seeing nothing reading nothing and considering nothing where in the east end lies this street everywhere the hundred and fifty yards is only a link in a long and a mightily tangled chainis only a turn in a tortuous maze this street of the square holes is hundreds of miles long that it is planned in short lengths is true but there is no other way in the world that can more properly be called a single street because of its dismal lack of accent its sordid uniformity its utter remoteness from delight lizerunt i lizers wooing somewhere in the register was written the name elizabeth hunt but seventeen years after the entry the spoken name was lizerunt lizerunt worked at a pickle factory and appeared abroad in an elaborate and shabby costume usually supplemented by a white apron withal she was something of a beauty that is to say her cheeks were very red her teeth were very large and white her nose was small and snub and her fringe was long and shiny while her face newwashed was susceptible of a high polish many such girls are married at sixteen but lizerunt was belated and had never a bloke at all billy chope was a year older than lizerunt he wore a billycock with a thin brim and a permanent dent in the crown he had a bobtail coat with the collar turned up at one side and down at the other as an expression of independence between his meals he carried his hands in his breeches pockets and he lived with his mother who mangled his conversation with lizerunt consisted long of perfunctory nods but great things happened this especial thursday evening as lizerunt making for home followed the fading red beyond the furthermost end of commercial road for billy chope slouching in the opposite direction lurched across the pavement as they met and taking the nearer hand from his pocket caught and twisted her arm bumping her against the wall garn said lizerunt greatly pleased le go for she knew that this was love where yer auf to lizer ome o course cheeky le go and she snatchedin vainat billys hat billy let go and capered in front of her she feigned to dodge by him careful not to be too quick because affairs were developing i say lizer said billy stopping his dance and becoming businesslike goin anywhere monday not along o you cheeky you go long o beller dawson like wot you did easter blow beller dawson she aint no good im goin on the flats come lizerunt delighted but derisive ended with a promise to see the bloke had come at last and she walked home with the feeling of having taken her degree she had half assured herself of it two days before when sam cardew threw an orange peel at her but went away after a little prancing on the pavement sam was a smarter fellow than billy and earned his own living probably his attentions were serious but one must prefer the bird in hand as for billy chope he went his way resolved himself to take home what mangling he should find his mother had finished and stick to the money also to get all he could from her by blandishing and bullying that the jaunt to wanstead flats might be adequately done there is no other fair like whit mondays on wanstead flats here is a square mile and more of open land where you may howl at large here is no danger of losing yourself as in epping forest the public houses are always with you shows shies swings merrygorounds fried fish stalls donkeys are packed closer than on hampstead heath the ladies tormentors are larger and their contents smell worse than at any other fair also you may be drunk and disorderly without being locked upfor the stations wont hold everybodyand when all else has palled you may set fire to the turf hereinto billy and lizerunt projected themselves from the doors of the holly tree on whit monday morning but through hours on hours of fried fish and halfpints both were conscious of a deficiency for the hat of lizerunt was brown and old plush it was not and its feather was a mere foot long and of a very rusty black now it is not decent for a factory girl from limehouse to go bankholidaying under any but a hat of plush very high in the crown of a wild blue or a wilder green and carrying withal an ostrich feather pink or scarlet or what not a feather that springs from the fore part climbs the crown and drops as far down the shoulders as may be lizerunt knew this and had she had no bloke would have stayed at home but a chance is a chance as it was only another such hapless girl could measure her bitter envy of the feathers about her or would so joyfully have given an ear for the proper splendor billy too had a vague impression muddled by but not drowned in halfpints that some degree of plush was condign to the occasion and to his own expenditure still there was no quarrel and the pair walked and ran with arms about each others necks and lizerunt thumped her bloke on the back at proper intervals so that the affair went regularly on the whole although in view of lizerunts shortcomings billy did not insist on the customary exchange of hats everything i say went well and well enough until billy bought a ladies tormentor and began to squirt it at lizerunt for then lizerunt went scampering madly with piercing shrieks until her bloke was left some little way behind and sam cardew turning up at that moment and seeing her running alone in the crowd threw his arms about her waist and swung her round him again and again as he floundered gallantly this way and that among the shies and the hokeypokey barrows ulloo lizer where are y acomin to if i adnt laid old o ye but here billy chope arrived to demand what the ell sam cardew was doing with his gal now sam was ever readier for a fight than billy was but the sum of billys halfpints was large wherefore the fight began on the skirt of an hilarious ring lizerunt after some small outcry triumphed aloud four days before she had no bloke and here she stood with two and those two fighting for her here in the public gaze on the flats for almost five minutes she was helen of troy and in much less time billy tasted repentance the haze of halfpints was dispelled and some teeth went with it presently whimpering and with a bloody muzzle he rose and made a running kick at the other then being thwarted in a bolt he flung himself down and it was like to go hard with him at the hands of the crowd punch you may on wanstead flats but execration and worse is your portion if you kick anybody except your wife but as the ring closed the helmets of two policemen were seen to be working in over the surrounding heads and sam cardew quickly assuming his coat turned away with such an air of blamelessness as is practicable with a damaged eye while billy went off unheeded in an opposite direction lizerunt and her new bloke went the routine of halfpints and merrygorounds and were soon on right thumping terms and lizerunt was as well satisfied with the issue as she was proud of the adventure billy was all very well but sam was better she resolved to draw him for a feathered hat before next bank holiday so the sun went down on her and her bloke hanging on each others necks and straggling toward the romford road with shouts and choruses the rest was tramcar bow music hall halfpints and darkness billy took home his wounds and his mother having moved his wrath by asking their origin sought refuge with a neighbor he accomplished his revenge in two instalments two nights later lizerunt was going with a jug of beer when somebody sprang from a dark corner landed her under the ear knocked her sprawling and made off to the sound of her lamentations she did not see who it was but she knew and next day sam cardew was swearing hed break billys back he did not however for that same evening a gang of seven or eight fell on him with sticks and belts they were causeway chaps while sam was a bradys laner which would have been reason enough by itself even if billy chope had not been one of them sam did his best for a burst through and a run but they pulled and battered him down and they kicked him about the head and they kicked him about the belly and they took to their heels when he was speechless and still he lay at home for near four weeks and when he stood up again it was in many bandages lizerunt came often to his bedside and twice she brought an orange on these occasions there was much talk of vengeance but the weeks went on it was a month since sam had left his bed and lizerunt was getting a little tired of bandages also she had begun to doubt and to consider bank holidayscarce a fortnight off for sam was stonebroke and a plush hat was further away than ever and all through the later of these weeks billy chope was harder than ever on his mother and she well knowing that if he helped her by taking home he would pocket the money at the other end had taken to finishing and delivering in his absence and threats failing to get at the money billy chope was impelled to punch her head and gripe her by the throat there was a milliners window with a show of nothing but fashionable plushandfeather hats and lizerunt was lingering hereabouts one evening when some one took her by the waist and some one said which dyer like lizerthe yuller un lizerunt turned and saw that it was billy she pulled herself away and backed off sullen and distrustful garn she said straight said billy ill sport yer oneno kid i will garn said lizerunt once more wot yer gittin at now but presently being convinced that bashing wasnt in it she approached less guardedly and she went away with a paper bag and the reddest of all the plushes and the bluest of all the feathers a hat that challenged all the flats the next bank holiday a hat for which no girl need have hesitated to sell her soul as for billy why he was as good as another and you cant have everything and sam cardew with his bandages and his grunts and groans was no great catch after all this was the wooing of lizerunt for in a few months she and billy married under the blessing of a benignant rector who periodically set aside a day for free weddings and on principle encouraged early matrimony and they lived with billys mother ii lizers first when billy chope married lizerunt there was a small rejoicing there was no weddingparty because it was considered that what there might be to drink would be better in the family lizerunts father was not and her mother felt no interest in the affair not having seen her daughter for a year and happening at the time to have a months engagement in respect of a drunk and disorderly so that there were but three of them and billy chope got exceedingly tipsy early in the day and in the evening his bride bawled a continual chorus while his mother influenced by that unwonted quartern of gin the occasion sanctioned wept dismally over her boy who was much too far gone to resent it his was the chief reason for rejoicing for lizerunt had always been able to extract ten shillings a week from the pickle factory and it was to be presumed that as lizer chope her earning capacity would not diminish and the wages would make a very respectable addition to the precarious revenue depending on the mangle that billy extorted from his mother as for lizer she was married that was the considerable thing for she was but a few months short of eighteen and that as you know is a little late of course there were quarrels very soon for the new mrs chope less submissive at first than her motherinlaw took a little breaking in and a liberal renewal of the manual treatment once applied in her courting days but the quarrels between the women were comforting to billy a diversion and a source of better service as soon as might be lizer took the way of womankind this circumstance brought an unexpected halfcrown from the evangelical rector who had married the couple gratis for recognizing billy in the street by accident and being told of mrs chopes prospects as well as that billy was out of work a fact undeniable he reflected that his principles did on occasion lead to discomfort of a material sort and billy to whose comprehension the halfcrown opened a new field of receipt would doubtless have long remained a client of the rector had not that zealot hastened to discover a vacancy for a warehouse porter the offer of presentation whereunto alienated billy chope forever but there were meetings and demonstrations of the unemployed and it was said that shillings had been given away and as being at a meeting in a street was at least as amusing as being in a street where there was no meeting billy often went on the off chance but his lot was chiefly disappointment wherefore he became more especially careful to furnish himself ere he left home for certain weeks cash came less freely than ever from the two women lizer spoke of providing for the necessities of the expected child a manifestly absurd procedure as billy pointed out since if they were unable to clothe or feed it the duty would fall on its grandmother that was law and nobody could get over it but even with this argument a shilling cost him many more demands and threats than it had used and a deal more general trouble at last lizer ceased from going to the pickle factory and could not even help billys mother at the mangle for long this lasted for near a week when billy rising at ten with a bad mouth resolved to stand no nonsense and demanded two shillings two bob wot for lizer asked cos i want it none o yer lip aint got it said lizer sulkily thats a bleedn lie lie yerself ill break y in arves ye blasted eifer he ran at her throat and forced her back over a chair ill pull yer face auf if y dont give me the money gawblimy ill do for ye lizer strained and squalled le go youll kill me an the kid too she grunted hoarsely billys mother ran in and threw her arms about him dragging him away dont billy she said in terror dont billynot now youll get in trouble come away she might go auf an youd get in trouble billy chope flung his wife over and turned to his mother take yer ands auf me he said go on or ill gi ye somethin for yerself and he punched her in the breast by way of illustration you shall ave what ive got billy if its money the mother said but dont go an git yerself in trouble dont will a shillin do no it wont think im a bloomin kid i mean avin two bob this mornin i was akeepin it for the rent billy but yus think o the bleedn lanlord fore me doncher and he pocketed the two shillings i aint settled with you yut my gal he added to lizer mikin about at ome an idin money you wait a bit lizer had climbed into an erect position and gravid and slow had got as far as the passage mistaking this for a safe distance she replied with defiant railings billy made for her with a kick that laid her on the lower stairs and swinging his legs round his mother as she obstructed him entreating him not to get in trouble he attempted to kick again in a more telling spot but a movement among the family upstairs and a tap at the door hinted of interference and he took himself off lizer lay doubled upon the stairs howling but her only articulate cry was gawd elp me its comin billy went to the meeting of the unemployed and cheered a proposal to storm the tower of london but he did not join the procession following a man with a handkerchief on a stick who promised destruction to every policeman in his path for he knew the fate of such processions with a few others he hung about the nearest tavern for a while on the chance of the advent of a flush sailor from st katharines disposed to treat outoworkers then he went alone to a quieter beerhouse and took a pint or two at his own expense a glance down the musichall bills hanging in the bar having given him a notion for the evening he bethought himself of dinner and made for home the front door was open and in the first room where the mangle stood there were no signs of dinner and this was at three oclock billy pushed into the room behind demanding why billy lizer said faintly from her bed look at the baby something was moving feebly under a flannel petticoat billy pulled the petticoat aside and said that well it is a measly snipe it was a blind hairless homunculus short of a foot long with a skinny face set in a great skull there was a black bruise on one side from hip to armpit billy dropped the petticoat and said wheres my dinner i dunno lizer responded hazily wots the time time dont try to kid me you git up go on i want my dinner mothers gittin it i think said lizer doctor had to slap im like anythink fore ed cry e dont cry now much e go on out ye git i do want no more damn jaw git my dinner im agittin of it billy his mother said at the door she had begun when he first entered it wont be a minute you come ere y aint alwis s ready to do er work are ye she aint no call to stop there no longer an i owe er one for this mornin will ye git out or shall i kick ye she cant billy his mother said and lizer snivelled and said youre a damn brute y ought to be bleedin well booted but billy had her by the shoulders and began to haul and again his mother besought him to remember what he might bring upon himself at this moment the doctors dispenser a fourthyear london hospital student of many inches who had been washing his hands in the kitchen came in for a moment he failed to comprehend the scene then he took billy chope by the collar hauled him pellmell along the passage kicked him hard into the gutter and shut the door when he returned to the room lizer sitting up and holding on by the bedframe gasped hysterically ye bleedin makeshift id ave yer liver out if i could reach ye you touch my usband ye long pisenin ound you ow and infirm of aim she flung a cracked teacup at his head billys mother said y ought to be ashamed of yourself you low blaggard if is father was alive ed knock yer ead auf call yourself a doctora passel o boysgit out go out o my ouse or ill give y in charge butwhy hang it hed have killed her then to lizer lie down shant lay down keep auf if you come near me ill corpse ye you go while yere safe the dispenser appealed to billys mother for gods sake make her lie down shell kill herself ill go perhaps the doctor had better come and he went leaving the coast clear for billy chope to return and avenge his kicking iii a change of circumstances lizer was some months short of twentyone when her third child was born the pickle factory had discarded her some time before and since that her trade had consisted in odd jobs of charing odd jobs of charing have a shade the better of a pickle factory in the matter of respectability but they are precarious and they are worse paid at that in the east end they are sporadic and few moreover it is in the household where paid help is a rarity that the bitterness of servitude is felt also the uncertainty and irregularity of the returns were a trouble to billy chope he was never sure of having got them all it might be ninepence or a shilling or eighteenpence once or twice to his knowledge it had been halfacrown from a chance job at a doctors or a parsons and once it was three shillings that it might be halfacrown or three shillings again and that some of it was being kept back was ever the suspicion evoked by lizers evening homing plainly with these fluctuating and uncertain revenues more bashing than ever was needed to insure the extraction of the last copper emptyhandedness called for bashing on its own account so that it was often lizers hap to be refused a job because of a black eye lizers self was scarcely what it had been the red of her cheeks once bounded only by the eyes and the mouth had shrunk to a spot in the depth of each hollow gaps had been driven in her big white teeth even the snub nose had run to a point and the fringe hung dry and ragged while the bodily outline was as a sacks at home the children lay in her arms or tumbled at her heels puling and foul whenever she was near it there was the mangle to be turned for lately billys mother had exhibited a strange weakness sometimes collapsing with a gasp in the act of brisk or prolonged exertion and often leaning on whatever stood hard by and grasping at her side this ailment she treated when she had twopence in such terms as made her smell of gin and peppermint and more than once this circumstance had inflamed the breast of billy her son who was morally angered by this boozing away of money that was really his lizers youngest being seven or eight months old was mostly taking care of itself when billy made a welcome discovery after a hard and pinching day the night was full of blinding wet and the rain beat on the window as on a drum billy sat over a small fire in the front room smoking his pipe while his mother folded clothes for delivery he stamped twice on the hearth and then drawing off his boot he felt inside it it was a nail the pokerhead made a good anvil and looking about for a hammer billy bethought him of a brick from the mangle he rose and lifting the lid of the weightbox groped about among the clinkers and the other ballast till he came upon a small but rather heavy paper parcel erewots this he said and pulled it out his mother whose back had been turned hastened across the room hand to breast it had got to be her habit what is it billy she said not that theres nothing there ill get anything you want billy and she made a nervous catch at the screw of paper but billy fended her off and tore the package open it was money arranged in little columns of farthings halfpence and threepenny pieces with a few sixpences a shilling or two and a single halfsovereign o said billy this is the game is itidin money in the mangle got any more and he hastily turned the brickbats no billy dont take thatdont implored his mother therell be some money for them things when they go omeave that im savin it billy for something particler selp me gawd i am billy yus replied billy raking diligently among the clinkers savin it for a good ol booze an now you wont ave one bleedin nice thing idin money away from yer own son it aint for that billyselp me it aint its case anythink appens to me ony to put me away decent billy thats all we never know an youll be glad of it telp bury me if i should go any time ill be glad of it now answered billy who had it in his pocket an ive got it you aint a dyin sort you aint an if you was the parish ud soon tuck you up praps youll be straighter about money after this let me ave some thenyou cant want it all give me some an then ave the money for the things theres ten dozen and seven and you can take em yerself if ye like wotin this ere rain not me i bet id ave the money if i wanted it without that erechange these ere fardens at the drapers wen you go out theres two bobs worth an a pennorth i dont want to bust my pockets wi them while they spoke lizer had come in from the back room but she said nothing she rather busied herself with a child she had in her arms when billys mother despondent and tearful had tramped out into the rain with a pile of clothes in an oilcloth wrapper she said sulkily without looking up you might a let er kep that you git all you want at another time this remonstrance would have provoked active hostilities but now with the money about him billy was complacently disposed you shutcher ead he said i got this anyow she can make it up out o my rent if she likes this last remark was a joke and he chuckled as he made it for billys rent was a simple fiction devised on the suggestion of a smart canvasser to give him a parliamentary vote that night billy and lizer slept as usual in the bed in the back room where the two younger children also were billys mother made a bedstead nightly with three chairs and an old trunk in the front room by the mangle and the eldest child lay in a floorbed near her early in the morning lizer awoke at a sudden outcry of the little creature he clawed at the handle till he opened the door and came staggering and tumbling into the room with screams of terror wring is blasted neck his father grunted sleepily wots the kid owlin for is faid o gannyis faid o ganny was all the child could say and when he had said it he fell to screaming once more lizer rose and went to the next room and straightway came a scream from her also oobilly billy o my gawd billy come ere and billy fully startled followed in lizers wake he blundered in rubbing his eyes and saw stark on her back in the huddled bed of old wrappers and shawls lay his mother the outline of her poor facestrained in an upward stare of painful surprisestood sharp and meagre against the black of the grate beyond but the muddy old skin was white and looked cleaner than its wont and many of the wrinkles were gone billy chope halfway across the floor recoiled from the corpse and glared at it pallidly from the doorway good gawd he croaked faintly is she dead seized by a fit of shuddering breaths lizer sank on the floor and with her head across the body presently broke into a storm of hysterical blubbering while billy white and dazed dressed hurriedly and got out of the house he was at home as little as might be until the coroners officer carried away the body two days later when he came for his meals he sat doubtful and querulous in the matter of the front room doors being shut the dead once clear away however he resumed his faculties and clearly saw that here was a bad change for the worse there was the mangle but who was to work it if lizer did there would be no more charing jobsa clear loss of onethird of his income and it was not at all certain that the people who had given their mangling to his mother would give it to lizer indeed it was pretty sure that many would not because mangling is a thing given by preference to widows and many widows of the neighborhood were perpetually competing for it widows moreover had the first call in most odd jobs whereunto lizer might turn her hand an injustice whereon billy meditated with bitterness the inquest was formal and unremarked the medical officer having no difficulty in certifying a natural death from heart disease the bright idea of a collection among the jury which billy communicated with pitiful representations to the coroners officer was brutally swept aside by that functionary made cunning by much experience so the inquest brought him nought save disappointment and a sense of injury the mangling orders fell away as suddenly and completely as he had feared they were duly absorbed among the local widows neglect the children as lizer might she could no longer leave them as she had done things then were bad with billy and neither threats nor thumps could evoke a shilling now it was more than billy could bear so that ere he said one night ive ad enough o this you go and get some money go on go an git it replied lizer o yus thats easy aint it go an git it says you ow anyowi dont care go on wy replied lizer looking up with wide eyes dye think i can go an pick it up in the street course you can plenty others does dont they gawd billy wot dye mean wot i say plenty others does it go onyou aint so bleedn innocent as all that go an see sam cardew go onook it lizer who had been kneeling at the childs floorbed rose to her feet palefaced and bright of eye stow kiddin billy she said you dont mean that ill go round to the factry in the mornin praps theyll take me on tempry damn the factry he pushed her into the passage go onyou git me some money if ye dont want yer bleedn ead knocked auf there was a scuffle in the dark passage with certain blows a few broken words and a sob then the door slammed and lizer chope was in the windy street without visible means all east london idled or walked in a procession or waylaid and bashed or cried in an empty kitchen for it was the autumn of the great strikes one army of men having been prepared was ordered to strikeand struck other smaller armies of men with no preparation were ordered to strike to express sympathyand struck other armies still were ordered to strike because it was the fashionand struck then many hands were discharged because the strikes in other trades left them no work many others came from other parts in regiments to work but remained to loaf in gangs taught by the example of earlier regiments which the situation being explained an expression devised to include mobbings and kickings and flingings into docks had returned whence they came so that east london was very noisy and largely hungry and the rest of the world looked on with intense interest making earnest suggestions and comprehending nothing lots of strikers having no strike pay and finding little nourishment in processions started off to walk to manchester birmingham liverpool or newcastle where work might be got along the great north road such men might be seen in silent companies of a dozen or twenty now and again singly or in couples at the tail of one such gang which gathered in the burdett road and found its way into the enfield road by way of victoria park clapton and stamford hill walked a little group of three a voluble young man of thirty a stolid workman rather older and a pale anxious little fellow with a nasty spasmic cough and a canvas bag of tools the little crowd straggled over the footpath and the road few of its members speaking most of them keeping to their places and themselves as yet there was nothing of the tramp in the aspect of these mechanics with their washed faces and wellmended clothes they might have been taken for a jury coming from a local inquest as the streets got broken and detached with patches of field between they began to look about them one young fellow in front with no family to think of who looked upon the enterprise as an amusing sort of tour and had even brought an accordion began to rebel against the general depression and attempted a joke about going to the alexandra palace but in the rear the little man with the canvas bag putting his hand abstractedly into his pocket suddenly stared and stopped he drew out the hand and saw in it three shillings selp me he said the missis is done thatshoved it in unbeknown when i come away an shes ony got a bob for erself an the kids he broke into a sweat of uneasiness ill ave to send it back at the next postoffice thats all send it back not you thus with deep scorn the voluble young man at his side shell be all right you lay your life a woman allus knows ow to look after erself youll bleedn soon want it an bad you do as i tell you joey stick to it thats right dave aint it matter o fancy replied the stolid man my missis cleared my pockets out fore i got away shouldnt wonder at bein sent after for leavin er chargeable if i dont soon send some more womens different the march continued and grew dustier the cheerful pilgrim in front produced his accordion at palmers green four went straight ahead to try for work at the enfield arms factory the others knowing the thing hopeless turned off to the left for potters bar after a long silence whichll be nearest dave asked little joey clayton newcastle or middlesborough middlesborough said dave i done it afore trampin aint so rough on a man is it after all asked joey wistfully you done all right didnt you got through all depends though its rough enough matter o luck iad the bad weather if i dont get a good easy job where were goin remarked the voluble young man ill ave a strike there too ave a strike there exclaimed joey ow whod call em out wy i would i think im equal to doin it aint i an when workin men stand idle an ungry in the midst o the wealth an the lukshry an the igstravagance theyve produced with the sweat of their brow why then fellerworkmen its time to act its time to bring the niggerdrivin bloated capitalists to their knees ear ear applauded joey clayton tamely perhaps for the words were not new good on yer newman newman had a habit of practising this sort of thing in snatches whenever he saw the chance he had learnt the trick in a debating society and joey clayton was always an applausive audience there was a pause the accordion started another tune and newman tried a different passage of his harangue in the shop they call me skulky newman why cos i skulk o course ear ear dreamilyfrom dave this time i aint ashamed of it my friends im a miker out an out an i ope i shall always remain a miker the less a worker does the more as to be imployed dont they an the more the toilers wrings out o the capitalists dont they very well then i mike an i do it as a sacred dooty youll ave all the mikin you want for a week or two said dave burge placidly stow it at potters bar the party halted and sat under a hedge to eat hunks of bread and cheese or hunks of bread and nothing else and to drink cold tea out of cans skulky newman who had brought nothing stood in with his two friends as they started anew and turned into the great north road he said stretching himself and looking slyly at joey clayton if id got a bob or two id stand you two blokes a pint apiece joey looked troubled well as you aint i suppose i ought to he said uneasily turning toward the little inn hard by dave he cried to burge who was walking on wont you ave a drink and well if you are goin to do the toff i aint proud was the slow reply afterward joey was inclined to stop at the postoffice to send away at least two shillings but newman wouldnt he enlarged on the improvidence of putting out of reach that which might be required on an emergency he repeated his axiom as to a womans knack of keeping alive in spite of all things and joey determined not to sendfor a day or so at any rate the road got looser and dustier the symptoms of the tramp came out stronger and stronger on the gang the accordion struck up from time to time but ceased toward the end of the afternoon the player wearied and some of the older men soon tired of walking were worried by the noise joey clayton whose cough was aggravated by the dust was especially tortured after every fit to hear the thing drawling and whooping the tune it had drawled and whooped a dozen times before but he said nothing scarce knowing what annoyed him at hatfield station two of the foremost picked up a few coppers by helping with a heavy trapload of luggage up digswell hill the party tailed out lengthily and newman who had been letting off a set speech was fain to save his wind the night came clear to see and sweet to smell between welwyn and codicote the company broke up to roost in such barns as they might possess all but the master of the accordion who had stayed at a little publichouse at welwyn with the notion of earning a pot of beer and a stablecorner or better by a tune in the taproom dave burge lighted on a lone shed of thatched hurdles with loose hay in it and newman straightway curled in the snuggest corner on most of the hay dave burge pulled some from under him and having helped joey clayton to build a nest in the best place left was soon snoring but joey lay awake all night and sat up and coughed and turned restlessly being unused to the circumstances and apprehensive of those months in jail which it is well known are rancorously dealt forth among all them that sleep in barns luck provided a breakfast next morning at codicote for three bicyclists going north stood cold beef and bread round at the anchor the man with the accordion caught up he had made his lodging and breakfast and eightpence this had determined him to stay at hitchin and work it for at least a day and then to diverge into the towns and let the rest go their way so beyond hitchin there was no music joey clayton soon fell slow newman had his idea and the three were left behind and joey staggered after his mates with difficulty he lacked sleep and he lacked stamina dave burge took the canvas bag and there were many rests when newman expressing a resolve to stick by his fellowman through thick and thin hinted at drinks dave burge made twopence at henlow level crossing by holding an unsteady horse while a train passed joey saw little of the rest of the day the road was yellow and dazzling his cough tore him and things were red sometimes and sometimes blue he walked without knowing it now helped now lurching on alone the others of the party were far ahead and forgotten there was talk of a windmill ahead where there would be rest and the three men camped in an old boathouse by the river just outside biggleswade joey sleeping as he tottered fell in a heap and lay without moving from sunset to broad morning when he woke dave burge was sitting at the door but newman was gone also there was no sign of the canvas bag no use lookin said dave es done it eh skulkys opped the twig an sneaked your tools gawd knows where e is by now no the little man gasped sitting up in a pale sweat not sneaked em is e selp me theres a set o callipers worth fifteen bob in that bag e aint gawn dave burge nodded inexorably best feel in your pockets he said praps es bin there he had the little man broke down i was agoin to send ome that two bobselp me i was an what can i do without my tools if id got no job i could a pawned eman then id a sent ome the moneyselp me i would o its crool the walking with the long sleep after it had left him sore and stiff and dave had work to put him on the road again he had forgotten yesterday afternoon and asked at first for the others they tramped in silence for a few miles when joey suddenly flung himself upon a tussock by the wayside why wont nobody let me live he snivelled im a armless bloke enough i worked at rittersons man and boy very nigh twenty year when they come an ordered us out i come out with the others peaceful enough i didnt want to chuck it up gawd knows but i come out promp when they told me and when i found another job on the island four big blokes set about me an arf killed me i didnt know the place was blocked and when two o the blokes was took up they said id get strikepay again if i didnt identify em so i didnt but they never give me no strikepaythey laughed an chucked me out an now im astarvin on the igh road an skulky blimy es done me too there were days wherein joey learned to eat a swede pulled from behind a wagon and to feel thankful for an early turnip might have learned too just what tramping means in many ways to a man unskilled both in begging and in theft but was never equal to it he coughedand worse holding to posts and gates and often spitting blood he had little to say but trudged mechanically taking note of nothing once as though aroused from a reverie he asked wasnt there some others others said dave for a moment taken aback o yes there was some others theyre gone on ahead yknow joey tramped for half a mile in silence then he said expect theyre avin a rough time too ahvery like said dave for a space joey was silent save for the cough then he went on comes o not bringing cordions with em every one ought to take a cordion what goes trampin i knew a man once that went trampin an e took a cordion he done all right it aint so rough for them as plays on the cordion and dave burge rubbed his cap about his head and stared but answered nothing it was a bad day crusts were begged at cottages every rise and every turn the eternal yellow road lay stretch on stretch before them flouting their unrest joey now unimpressionable endured more placidly than even dave burge late in the afternoon no he said it aint so rough for them as plays the cordion they as the best of it selp me he added suddenly were all cordions he sniggered thoughtfully and then burst into a cough that left him panting were nothin but a bloomin lot o cordions ourselves he went on having got his breath an they play any toon they like on us an thats ow they make their livin selp me dave were all cordions and he laughed umyus the other man grunted and he looked curiously at his mate for he had never heard that sort of laugh before but joey fondled the conceit and returned to it from time to time now aloud now to himself all cordions playin any toon as is ordered blimy are we cordions i dont blieve were as much as that no selp me were ony the footlin little keys shoved about to soot the toon little tin keys blimy footlin little keys ive bin played on plenty i ave dave burge listened with alarm and tried to talk of other things but joey rarely heard him ive bin played on plenty i ave he persisted i was played on once by a pal an my spring broke at nightfall there was more bad luck they were driven from a likely barn by a leathergaitered man with a dog and for some distance no dormitory could be found then it was a cut haystack with a nest near the top and steps to reach it in the night burge was wakened by a clammy hand upon his face there was a thick mist its you dave aint it clayton was saying good gawd i thought id lawst you whats all this erenot the water is itnot the dock im soppin wet burge himself was wet to the skin he made joey lie down and told him to sleep but a coughing fit prevented that it was them cordions woke me he explained when it was over so the night put on the shuddering gray of the foredawn and the two tramps left their perch and betook them shivering and stamping to the road that morning joey had short fits of dizziness and faintness its my spring broke he would say after such an attack bloomin little tin key put out o toon and once he added im up to one toon though now this ere bloomin dead march just at the outskirts of a town where he stopped to cough over a gate a stout old lady walking out with a shaggy little dog gave him a shilling dave burge picked it up as it dropped from his incapable hand and joey eres a bob he said a lady give it you you come an git a drop o beer they carried a twopenny loaf into the taproom of a small tavern and dave had mild ale himself but saw that joey was served with stout with a pennorth of gin in it soon the gin and stout reached joeys head and drew it to the table and he slept leaving the rest of the shilling where it lay dave arose and stuffed the last of the twopenny loaf into his pocket he took a piece of chalk from the bagatelle board in the corner and wrote this on the tabledr sir for god sake take him to the work house then he gathered up the coppers where they lay and stepped quietly into the street to bow bridge the elevenfive tramcar from stratford started for bow a trifle before its time the conductor knew what he might escape by stealing a march on the closing publichouses as also what was in store for all the conductors in his wake till there were no more revellers left to swarm the cars for it was saturday night and many a weeks wages were aknocking down and the publicans this side of bow bridge shut their doors at eleven under act of parliament whereas beyond the bridge which is the county of london the law gives them another hour and a man may drink many pots therein and for this at eleven every saturday there is a great rush westward a vast migration over lea from all the length of high street from the nearer parts they walk or do their best to walk but from further stratford by the town hall the church and the martyrs memorial they crowd the cars for one thing it is a long halfmile and the weeks work is over also the car being swamped it is odds that a man shall save his fare since no conductor may fight his way a quarter through his passengers before bow bridge where the vehicle is emptied at a rush and that means yet another halfpint so the elevenfive car started sooner than it might have done as it was spattering with rain i boarded it sharing the conductors forlorn hope but taking care to sit at the extreme foreend inside in the broad street the market clamored and flared its lights and shadows flickering and fading about the long churchyard and the steeple in the midst thereof and toward the distant lights the shining road sparkled in long reaches like a blackguard river a gap fell here and there among the lights where a publican put his gas out and at these points the crowds thickened a quiet mechanic came in and sat near a decent woman with children a bundle a basket and a cabbage thirty yards on the car rumbled and suddenly its hinder end was taken in a mass of peoplehowling struggling and blasphemingwho stormed and wrangled in at the door and up the stairs there were lads and men whooping and flushed there were girls and women screaming choruses and in a moment the seats were packed knees were taken and there was not an inch of standing room the conductor cried all full and tugged at his bellstrap whereunto many were hanging by the hand but he was swept from his feet and made to push hard for his own place and there was no more foothold on the back platform nor the front nor any vacant step upon the stairway and the roof was thronged and the rest of the crowd was fain to waylay the next car this one moved off slowly with shrieks and howls that were racking to the wits from divers quarters of the roof came a bumping thunder as of cellarflapping clogs profanity was sluiced down as it were by pailfuls from above and was swilled back as it were in pailfuls from below blowses in feathered bonnets bawled hilarious obscenity at the jiggers a little maid with a marketbasket hustled and jostled and elbowed at the far end listened eagerly and laughed when she could understand and the quiet mechanic whose knees had been invaded by an unsteady young woman in a crushed hat tried to look pleased my own knees were saved from capture by the near neighborhood of an enormous female seated partly on the seat and partly on myself snorting and gulping with sleep her head upon the next mans shoulder to offer your seat to a standing woman would as beseems a foreign antic have been visited by the ribaldry of the whole crowd in the midst of the riot the decent woman sat silent and indifferent her children on and about her knees further along two women ate fish with their fingers and discoursed personalities in voices which ran strident through the uproar as the odor of their snack asserted itself in the general fetor and opposite the decent woman there sat a bonnetless drab who said nothing but looked at the decent womans children as a shoeless brat looks at the dolls in a toyshop window so i ses to er i sesthis from the snackstersim a respectable married woman i ses moren you can say you barefaced hussey i ses then a shower of curses a shout and a roar of laughter and the conductor making slow and laborious progress with the fares nearest him turned his head a man had jumped upon the footboard and a passengers toes a scuffle and a fight and both had rolled off into the mire and got left behind aint they fond o one another cried a girl theyre agoin for a walk together and there was a guffaw the silly bleedersll be too late for the pubs said a male voice and there was another for the general understanding was touched thenan effect of sympathy perhapsa scuffle broke out on the roof but this disturbed not the insides the conductor went on his plaguy task to save time he passed over the one or two that asked now or not seemed likely to pay at the journeys end the snacking women resumed their talk the choristers their singing the rumble of the wheels was lost in a babel of vacant ribaldry the enormous woman choked and gasped and snuggled lower down upon her neighbors shoulder and the shabby strumpet looked at the children a man by the door vomited his liquor whereat was more hilarity and his neighbors with many yaups shoved further up the middle but one of the little ones standing before her mother was pushed almost to falling and the harlot seeing her chance snatched the child upon her knee the child looked up something in wonder and smiled and the woman leered as honestly as she might saying a hoarse word or two presently the conflict overhead waxing and waning to an accompaniment of angry shouts afforded another brief diversion to those within and something persuaded the standing passengers to shove toward the door the child had fallen asleep in the streetwalkers arms jinny cried the mother reaching forth and shaking her jinny wake up nowyou mustnt go to sleep and she pulled the little thing from her perch to where she had been standing the bonnetless creature bent forward and in her curious voice like that of one sick with shouting she can set on my knee mm if she likes she said shes tired the mother busied herself with a jerky adjustment of the childs hat and shawl she mustnt go to sleep was all she said sharply and without looking up the hoarse woman bent further forward with a propitiatory grin ow old is she id like togive er a penny the mother answered nothing but drew the child close by the side of her knee where a younger one was sitting and looked steadily through the fore windows the hoarse woman sat back unquestioning and unresentful and turned her eyes upon them that were crowding over the conductor for the car was rising over bow bridge front and back they surged down from the roof and the insides made for the door as one man the big womans neighbor rose and let her fall over on the seat whence awaking with a loud grunt and an incoherent curse she rolled after the rest the conductor clamant and bedevilled was caught between the two pellmells and demanding fares and gripping his satchel was carried over the footboard in the rush the stramash overhead came tangled and swearing down the stairs gaining volume and force in random punches as it came and the crowd on the pavement streamed vocally toward a brightness at the bridge footthe lights of the bombay grab the woman with the children waited till the footboard was clear and then carrying one child and leading another her marketings attached about her by indeterminate means she set the two youngsters on the pavement leaving the third on the step of the car the harlot lingering lifted the child againlifted her rather highand set her on the path with the others then she walked away toward the bombay grab a man in a blue serge suit was footing it down the turning between the publichouse and the bridge with drunken swiftness and an intermittent stagger and tightening her shawl she went in chase the quiet mechanic stood and stretched himself and took a corner seat near the door and the tramcar quiet and vacant bumped on westward that brute simmons simmonss infamous behavior toward his wife is still matter for profound wonderment among the neighbors the other women had all along regarded him as a model husband and certainly mrs simmons was a most conscientious wife she toiled and slaved for that man as any woman in the whole street would have maintained far more than any husband had a right to expect and now this was what she got for it perhaps he had suddenly gone mad before she married simmons mrs simmons had been the widowed mrs ford ford had got a berth as donkeyman on a tramp steamer and that steamer had gone down with all hands off the cape a judgment the widow woman feared for long years of contumacy which had culminated in the wickedness of taking to the sea and taking to it as a donkeymanan immeasurable fall for a capable enginefitter twelve years as mrs ford had left her still childless and childless she remained as mrs simmons as for simmons he it was held was fortunate in that capable wife he was a moderately good carpenter and joiner but no man of the world and he wanted one nobody could tell what might not have happened to tommy simmons if there had been no mrs simmons to take care of him he was a meek and quiet man with a boyish face and sparse limp whiskers he had no vices even his pipe departed him after his marriage and mrs simmons had engrafted on him divers exotic virtues he went solemnly to chapel every sunday under a tall hat and put a pennyone returned to him for the purpose out of his weeks wagesin the plate then mrs simmons overseeing he took off his best clothes and brushed them with solicitude and pains on saturday afternoons he cleaned the knives the forks the boots the kettles and the windows patiently and conscientiously on tuesday evenings he took the clothes to the mangling and on saturday nights he attended mrs simmons in her marketing to carry the parcels mrs simmonss own virtues were native and numerous she was a wonderful manager every penny of tommys thirtysix or thirtyeight shillings a week was bestowed to the greatest advantage and tommy never ventured to guess how much of it she saved her cleanliness in housewifery was distracting to behold she met simmons at the front door whenever he came home and then and there he changed his boots for slippers balancing himself painfully on alternate feet on the cold flags this was because she scrubbed the passage and doorstep turn about with the wife of the downstairs family and because the staircarpet was her own she vigilantly supervised her husband all through the process of cleaning himself after work so as to come between her walls and the possibility of random splashes and if in spite of her diligence a spot remained to tell the tale she was at pains to impress the fact on simmonss memory and to set forth at length all the circumstances of his ungrateful selfishness in the beginning she had always escorted him to the readymade clothes shop and had selected and paid for his clothes for the reason that men are such perfect fools and shopkeepers do as they like with them but she presently improved on that she found a man selling cheap remnants at a street corner and straightway she conceived the idea of making simmonss clothes herself decision was one of her virtues and a suit of uproarious check tweeds was begun that afternoon from the pattern furnished by an old one more it was finished by sunday when simmons overcome by astonishment at the feat was indued in it and pushed off to chapel ere he could recover his senses the things were not altogether comfortable he found the trousers clung tight against his shins but hung loose behind his heels and when he sat it was on a wilderness of hard folds and seams also his waistcoat collar tickled his nape but his coat collar went straining across from shoulder to shoulder while the main garment bagged generously below his waist use made a habit of his discomfort but it never reconciled him to the chaff of his shopmates for as mrs simmons elaborated successive suits each one modelled on the last the primal accidents of her design developed into principles and grew even bolder and more hideously pronounced it was vain for simmons to hintas hint he didthat he shouldnt like her to overwork herself tailoring being bad for the eyes and there was a new tailors in the mile end road very cheap where ho yus she retorted youre very considrit i dessay sittin there actin a livin lie before your own wife thomas simmons as though i couldnt see through you like a book a lot you care about overworkin me as long as your turns served throwin away money like dirt in the street on a lot o swindlin tailors an me workin an slavin ere to save a apenny an this is my return for it any one ud think you could pick up money in the orseroad an i blieve id be thought better of if i laid in bed all day like some would that i do so that thomas simmons avoided the subject nor even murmured when she resolved to cut his hair so his placid fortune endured for years then there came a golden summer evening when mrs simmons betook herself with a basket to do some small shopping and simmons was left at home he washed and put away the teathings and then he fell to meditating on a new pair of trousers finished that day and hanging behind the parlor door there they hung in all their decent innocence of shape in the seat and they were shorter of leg longer of waist and wilder of pattern than he had ever worn before and as he looked on them the small devil of original sin awoke and clamored in his breast he was ashamed of it of course for well he knew the gratitude he owed his wife for those same trousers among other blessings still there the small devil was and the small devil was fertile in base suggestions and could not be kept from hinting at the new crop of workshop gibes that would spring at tommys first public appearance in such things pitch em in the dustbin said the small devil at last its all theyre fit for simmons turned away in sheer horror of his wicked self and for a moment thought of washing the teathings over again by way of discipline then he made for the back room but saw from the landing that the front door was standing open probably by the fault of the child downstairs now a front door standing open was a thing that mrs simmons would not abide it looked low so simmons went down that she might not be wroth with him for the thing when she came back and as he shut the door he looked forth into the street a man was loitering on the pavement and prying curiously about the door his face was tanned his hands were deep in the pockets of his unbraced blue trousers and well back on his head he wore the highcrowned peaked cap topped with a knob of wool which is affected by jack ashore about the docks he lurched a step nearer to the door and mrs ford aint in is she he said simmons stared at him for a matter of five seconds and then said eh mrs ford as was thensimmons now aint it he said this with a furtive leer that simmons neither liked nor understood no said simmons she aint in now you aint her usband are ye yus the man took his pipe from his mouth and grinned silently and long blimy he said at length you look the sort o bloke shed likeand with that he grinned again then seeing that simmons made ready to shut the door he put a foot on the sill and a hand against the panel dont be in a urry matey he said i come ere tave a little talk with you man to man dye see and he frowned fiercely tommy simmons felt uncomfortable but the door would not shut so he parleyed wotjer want he asked i dunno you then if youll excuse the liberty ill interdooce meself in a manner of speaking he touched his cap with a bob of mock humility im bob ford he said come back out o kingdomcome so to say me as went down with the mooltansafe dead five year gone i come to see my wife during this speech thomas simmonss jaw was dropping lower and lower at the end of it he poked his fingers up through his hair looked down at the mat then up at the fanlight then out into the street then hard at his visitor but he found nothing to say come to see my wife the man repeated so now we can talk it overas man to man simmons slowly shut his mouth and led the way upstairs mechanically his fingers still in his hair a sense of the state of affairs sank gradually into his brain and the small devil woke again suppose this man was ford suppose he did claim his wife would it be a knockdown blow would it hit him outor not he thought of the trousers the teathings the mangling the knives the kettles and the windows and he thought of them in the way of a backslider on the landing ford clutched at his arm and asked in a hoarse whisper ow long fore shes back bout a hour i expect simmons replied having first of all repeated the question in his own mind and then he opened the parlor door ah said ford looking about him youve bin pretty comftable them chairs an thingsjerking his pipe toward themwas hersmine that is to say speaking straight and man to man he sat down puffing meditatively at his pipe and presently well he continued ere i am agin ol bob ford dead an done forgawn down in the mooltan ony i aint done for seeand he pointed the stem of his pipe at simmonss waistcoati aint done for cause why conskence o bein picked up by a ol german sailinutch an took to frisco fore the

an the knives too i bet an the bloomin kittles i know wyhe rose and bent to look behind simmonss headselp me i blieve she cuts yer air well im damned jes wot she would do too he inspected the blushing simmons from divers points of vantage then he lifted a leg of the trousers hanging behind the door id bet a trifle he said she made these ere trucks nobody else ud do em like that dammetheyre wussn wot youre got on the small devil began to have the argument all its own way if this man took his wife back perhaps hed have to wear those trousers ah ford pursued she aint got no milder an my davy wot a jore simmons began to feel that this was no longer his business plainly anner was this other mans wife and he was bound in honor to acknowledge the fact the small devil put it to him as a matter of

easy raise a quidthe clock ud pretty nigh do it a quid does it an ill there was a loud doubleknock at the front door in the east end a doubleknock is always for the upstairs lodgers oos that asked bob ford apprehensively ill see said thomas simmons in reply and he made a rush for the staircase bob ford heard him open the front door then he went to the window and just below him he saw the crown of a bonnet it vanished and borne to him from within the door there fell upon his ear the sound of a wellremembered female voice where ye goin now with no at asked the voice sharply awright annertherestheres somebody upstairs to see you simmons answered and as bob ford could see a man went scuttling down the street in the gathering dusk and behold it was thomas simmons ford reached the landing in three strides his wife was still at the front door staring after simmons he flung into the back room threw open the window dropped from the washhouse roof into the backyard scrambled desperately over the fence and disappeared into the gloom he was seen by no living soul and that is why simmonss base desertionunder his wifes very eyes toois still an astonishment to the neighbors behind the shade the street was the common east end streettwo parallels of brick pierced with windows and doors but at the end of one where the builder had found a remnant of land too small for another sixroomer there stood an odd box of a cottage with three rooms and a washhouse it had a green door with a wellblacked knocker round the corner and in the lower window in front stood a shade of fruita cone of waxen grapes and apples under a glass cover although the house was smaller than the others and was built upon a remnant it was always a house of some consideration in a street like this mere independence of pattern gives distinction and a house inhabited by one sole family makes a figure among houses inhabited by two or more even though it be the smallest of all and here the seal of respectability was set by the shade of fruita sign accepted in those parts now when people keep a house to themselves and keep it clean when they neither stand at the doors nor gossip across backfences when moreover they have a welldusted shade of fruit in the front window and especially when they are two women who tell nobody their business they are known at once for welltodo and are regarded with the admixture of spite and respect that is proper to the circumstances they are also watched still the neighbors knew the history of the perkinses mother and daughter in its main features with little disagreement having told it to each other filling in the details when occasion seemed to serve perkins ere he died had been a shipwright and this was when the shipwrights were the aristocracy of the workshops and he that worked more than three or four days a week was counted a mean slave it was long in fact before depression strikes iron plates and collective blindness had driven shipbuilding to the clyde perkins had labored no harder than his fellows had married a tradesmans daughter and had spent his money with freedom and some while after his death his widow and daughter came to live in the small house and kept a school for tradesmens little girls in a back room over the washhouse but as the school board waxed in power and the tradesmens pride in regard thereunto waned the attendance never large came down to twos and threes then mrs perkins met with her accident a dweller in stidders rents overtook her one night and having vigorously punched her in the face and the breast kicked her and jumped on her for five minutes as she lay on the pavement in the dark it afterwards appeared he had mistaken her for his mother the one distinct opinion the adventure bred in the street was mrs websters the little bethelite who considered it a judgment for sinful pridefor mrs perkins had been a churchgoer but the neighbors never saw mrs perkins again the doctor left his patient as well as she ever would be but bedridden and helpless her daughter was a scraggy sharpfaced woman of thirty or so whose black dress hung from her hips as from a wooden frame and some people got into the way of calling her mrs perkins seeing no other thus to honor and meantime the school had ceased although miss perkins essayed a revival and joined a dissenting chapel to that end then one day a card appeared in the window over the shade of fruit with the legend pianoforte lessons it was not approved by the street it was a standing advertisement of the fact that the perkinses had a piano which others had not it also revealed a grasping spirit on the part of people able to keep a house to themselves with red curtains and a shade of fruit in the parlor window who moreover had been able to give up keeping a school because of illhealth the pianoforte lessons were eightandsixpence a quarter two a week nobody was ever known to take them but the relieving officers daughter and she paid sixpence a lesson to see how she got on and left off in three weeks the card stayed in the window a fortnight longer and none of the neighbors saw the cart that came in the night and took away the old cabinet piano with the channelled keys that had been fourthhand when perkins bought it twenty years ago mrs clark the widow who sewed far into the night may possibly have heard a noise and looked but she said nothing if she did there was no card in the window next morning but the shade of fruit stood primly respectable as ever the curtains were drawn a little closer across for some of the children playing in the street were used to flatten their faces against the lower panes and to discuss the piano the stuffbottomed chairs the antimacassars the mantelpiece ornaments and the loo table with the family bible and the album on it it was soon after this that the perkinses altogether ceased from shoppingceased at any rate in that neighborhood trade with them had already been dwindling and it was said that miss perkins was getting stingier than her motherwho had been stingy enough herself indeed the perkins demeanor began to change for the worse to be significant of a miserly retirement and an offensive alienation from the rest of the street one day the deacon called as was his practice now and then but being invited no further than the doorstep he went away in dudgeon and did not return nor indeed was miss perkins seen again at chapel then there was a discovery the spare figure of miss perkins was seldom seen in the streets and then almost always at night but on these occasions she was observed to carry parcels of varying wrappings and shapes once in broad daylight with a package in newspaper she made such haste past a shopwindow where stood mrs webster and mrs jones that she tripped on the broken sole of one shoe and fell headlong the newspaper broke away from its pins and although the woman reached and recovered her parcel before she rose it was plain to see that it was made up of cheap shirts cut out ready for the stitching the street had the news the same hour and it was generally held that such a taking of the bread out of the mouths of them that wanted it by them that had plenty was a scandal and a shame and ought to be put a stop to and mrs webster foremost in the setting right of things undertook to find out whence the work came and to say a few plain words in the right quarter all this while nobody watched closely enough to note that the parcels brought in were fewer than the parcels taken out even a handtruck late one evening went unremarked the door being round the corner and most people within one morning though miss perkins her best foot foremost was venturing along a near street with an outgoing parcellarge and triangular and wrapped in white druggetwhen the relieving officer turned the corner across the way the relieving officer was a man in whose system of etiquette the perkinses had caused some little disturbance his ordinary female acquaintances not of course professional he was in the habit of recognizing by a gracious nod when he met the ministers wife he lifted his hat instantly assuming an intense frown in the event of irreverent observation now he quite felt that the perkinses were entitled to some advance upon the nod although it would be absurd to raise them to a level with the ministers wife so he had long since established a compromise he closed his finger and thumb upon the brim of his hat and let his hand fall forthwith preparing now to accomplish this salute he was astounded to see that miss perkins as soon as she was aware of his approach turned her face which was rather flushed away from him and went hurrying onward looking at the wall on her side of the street the relieving officer checking his hand on its way to his hat stopped and looked after her as she turned the corner hugging her parcel on the side next the wall then he shouldered his umbrella and pursued his way holding his head high and staring fiercely straight before him for a relieving officer is not used to being cut it was a little after this that mr crouch the landlord called he had not been calling regularly because of late miss perkins had left her five shillings of rent with mrs crouch every saturday evening he noted with satisfaction the whitened sills and the shade of fruit behind which the curtains were now drawn close and pinned together he turned the corner and lifted the bright knocker miss perkins half opened the door stood in the opening and began to speak his jaw dropped beg pardonforgot something wont waitcall next weekdo just as well and he hurried round the corner and down the street puffing and blowing and staring why the woman frightened me he afterward explained to mrs crouch theres something wrong with her eyes and she looked like a corpse the rent wasnt readyi could see that before she spoke so i cleared out praps somethings happened to the old lady suggested mrs crouch anyhow i should think the rent ud be all right and he thought it would nobody saw the perkinses that week the shade of fruit stood in its old place but was thought not to have been dusted after tuesday certainly the sills and the doorstep were neglected friday saturday and sunday were swallowed up in a choking brown fog wherein men lost their bearings and fell into docks and stepped over embankment edges it was as though a great blot had fallen and had obliterated three days from the calendar it cleared on monday morning and just as the women in the street were sweeping their steps mr crouch was seen at the green door he lifted the knocker dull and sticky now with the foul vapor and knocked a gentle rattat there was no answer he knocked again a little louder and waited listening but there was neither voice nor movement within he gave three heavy knocks and then came round to the front window there was the shade of fruit the glass a little duller on the top the curtains pinned close about it and nothing to see beyond them he tapped at the window with his knuckles and backed into the roadway to look at the one above this was a window with a striped holland blind and a short net curtain but never a face was there the sweepers stopped to look and one from opposite came and reported that she had seen nothing of miss perkins for a week and that certainly nobody had left the house that morning and mr crouch grew excited and bellowed through the keyhole in the end they opened the sashfastening with a knife moved the shade of fruit and got in the room was bare and empty and their steps and voices resounded as those of people in an unfurnished house the washhouse was vacant but it was clean and there was a little net curtain in the window the short passage and the stairs were bare boards in the back room by the stairhead was a drawn windowblind and that was all in the front room with the striped blind and the short curtain there was a bed of rags and old newspapers also a wooden box and on each of these was a dead woman both deaths the doctor found were from syncope the result of inanition and the betternourished womanshe on the bedhad died the sooner perhaps by a day or two the other case was rather curious it exhibited a degree of shrinkage in the digestive organs unprecedented in his experience after the inquest the street had an evenings fame for the papers printed coarse drawings of the house and in leaderettes demanded the abolition of something then it became its wonted self and it was doubted if the waxen apples and the curtains fetched enough to pay mr crouch his fortnights rent three rounds at six oclock the back streets were dank and black but once in the bethnal green road blots and flares of gas and naphtha shook and flickered till every slimy cobble in the cartway was silvertipped neddy milton was not quite fightingfit a days questing for an odd job had left him weary in the feet and a lad of eighteen cannot comfortably go unfed from breakfast to nightfall but box he must for the shilling was irrecoverable and so costly a chance must not be thrown away it was by a bout with the gloves that he looked to mend his fortunes that was his only avenue of advancement he could read and write quite decently and in the beginning might even have been an officeboy if only the widow his mother had been able to give him a good sendoff in the matter of clothes also he had had one chance of picking up a trade but the firm already employed as many boys as the union was disposed to allow so neddy had to go and pick up such stray jobs as he might it had been a bad day without a doubt things were bad generally it was nearly a fortnight since ned had lost his last job and there seemed to be no other in the world his mother had had no slopwaistcoat finishing to do for three or four days and he distinctly remembered that rather less than half a loaf was left after breakfast so that it would never do to go home for at such a time the old woman had a trick of pretending not to be hungry and of starving herself he almost wished that shilling of entrancemoney back in his pocket there is a deal of stuff to be bought for a shilling fried fish for instance whereof the aromas warm and rank met him thrice in a hundred yards and the frizzle loud or faint sang in his ears all along the bethnal green road his shilling had been paid over but two days before the last job gave out and it would be useful now still the investment might turn out a gold mine luck must change meanwhile as to being hungrywell there was always another hole in the belt the landlord of the prince regent publichouse had a large room behind his premises which being moved by considerations of sport and profit in doubtful proportions he devoted two nights a week to the uses of the regent boxing club here neddy milton through a long baptism of pummellings had learned the trick of a straight lead a quick counter and a timely duck and here in the ninestone competition to open this very night he might perchance punch wide the gates of fortune for some sporting publican or discriminating bookmaker from bow might see and approve his sparring and start him fairly with money behind hima professional that would mean a match in six or eight weeks time with good living in the mean while a match that would have to be won of course and after that twice before he had boxed in a competition once he won his bout in the first round and was beaten in the second and once he was beaten in the first but that was by the final winner tab rosser who was now matched for a hundred a side sparred exhibition bouts up west wore a light newmarket coat and could stand whiskey and soda with anybody to be taken up on the strength of these early performances was more than he could reasonably expect there might be luck in the third trial but he would like to feel a little fitter breakfast what there was of it had been ten hours ago and since there had been but a halfpint of fourale it was the treat of a wellmeaning friend but it lay cold on the stomach for want of solid company turning into cambridge road he crossed and went on among the bystreets leading toward globe road now and again a slight aspersion of fine rain came down the gusts and further damped his cap and shoulders and the ragged hair that hung over his collar also a cold spot under one foot gave him fears of a hole in his bootsole as he tramped in the chilly mud in the prince regent there were many at the bar and the most of them knew neddy wayo ned said one lad with a pitted face you dont look much of a bleedn champion ave a drop o beer ned took a sparing pull at the pot and wiped his mouth on his sleeve a large man behind him guffawed and neddy reddened high he had heard the joke the man himself was one of the very backers that might make ones fortune and the mans companion thought it would be unsafe to back neddy to fight anything but a beefsteak youre drawed with patsy beard one of neds friends informed him youll ave to buck up this was bad patsy beard on known form stood best chance of winning the competition and to have to meet him at first setoff was ill luck and no mistake he was a thickset little butcher and there was just the ghost of a hope that he might be found to be a bit over the weight a lad by the bar looked inquiringly in neds face and then came toward him shouldering him quietly out of the group it was sam young whom neddy had beaten in an earlier competition ungry neddy he asked in a corner it was with a shamed face that neddy confessed for among those in peril of hunger it is disgraceful to be hungry sam unpocketed a greasy paper enveloping a pallid sausageroll ave alf o this he said it was a heavy and a clammy thing but ned took it furtively swallowed a large piece and returned the rest with sheepish thanks he did not turn again toward the others but went through to the room where the ring was pitched the proceedings began first there were exhibition bouts to play in the company neddy fidgeted why couldnt they begin the competition at once when they did his bout would be number five that would mean at least an hour of waiting and the longer he waited the less fit he would feel in time the exhibition sparring was ended and the real business began he watched the early bouts feverishly feeling unaccountably anxious the lads looked strong and healthy patsy beard was as strong as any of them and heavy could he stand it this excited nervousness was new and difficult to understand he had never felt like it before he was almost trembling and that lump of sausageroll had stuck halfway and made breathing painful work patsy beard was at the opposite corner surrounded by admirers he was redfaced wellfed fleshy and confident his short hair clung shinily about his bullet head neddy noted a small piece of courtplaster at the side of his nose plainly there was a tender spot and it must be gone for be it cut or scratch or only pimple on the left side too quite handy come there was some comfort in that he fell to watching the bout it was a hard fight and both the lads were swinging the right again and again for a knockout but the pace was too hot and they were soon breathing like men about to sneeze wearily pawing at each other while their heads hung forward somebody jogged him in the back and he found he must get ready his dressing was simple an illconditioned old pair of rubber gymnasium shoes replaced his equally illconditioned bluchers and a cotton singlet his shirt but his baggy corduroys ragged at the ankles and doubtful at the seat remained presently the last pair of boxers was brought into the dressingroom and one of the seconds a battered old pug with one eye at once seized neddy come along young un he said im your bloke got no flannels awright jump on the scales there was no doubt as to the weight he had scaled at eight stone thirteen now it was eight stone bare patsy beard on the other hand weighed the full nine without an ounce to spare youre givin im a stone said the old pug all the more credit idin of im ere lets shove em on feel em he grinned and blinked his solitary eye as he pulled on neddys hand one of a very black and longworn pair of boxinggloves they were soft and flaccid neddys heart warmed toward the oneeyed man for well he knew from many knocks that the softer the glove the harder the fist feels through it sawftest pair in the place selp me grunted the second with one glove hanging from his teeth my lad ad em last time come on he snatched a towel and a bottle of water and hurried neddy from the dressingroom to the ring neddy sat in his chair in the ringcorner and spread his arms on the ropes while his second arms uplifted stood before him and ducked solemnly forward and back with the towel flicking overhead while he was fanning neddy was still conscious of the lump of sausageroll in his chest also he fell to wondering idly why they called beard patsy when his first name was joe the same reflection applied to tab rosser and hocko jones and tiggy magson but certainly he felt hollow and sick in the belly could he stand punching it would never do to chuck it half through still ready sang the timekeeper the old pug threw the towel over his arm ave a moistener he said presenting the waterbottle to neddys mouth dont swaller any he added as his principal took a large gulp spit it out seconds out of the ring the old prizefighter took his bottle and climbed through the ropes dont go infightin he whispered from behind mark im on the stickinplaster an if you dont give im a idin bli me ill give you one time the seconds seized the chairs and dragged them out of the ring as the lads advanced and shook hands patsy beard flung back his right foot and made a flashy prance with his left knee as they began to spar for an opening it was patsys way all neddys anxiety was gone the moment his right foot dropped behind his left and his left hand rocked knuckles up before him he was a competent workman with all his tools in order even the lump of dough on his chest he felt no more buy buy bawled a wag in the crowd as a delicate allusion to beards more ordinary occupation patsy grinned at the compliment but neddy confined his attention to business he feinted with his left and got back but patsy was not to be drawn then neddy stepped in and led quickly ducking the counter and repeating before getting away patsy came with a rush and fought for the body but neddy slipped him and got in one for nothing on the ear the company howled they sparred in the middle patsy led perfunctorily with the left now and again while his right elbow undulated nervously that foretold an attempt to knock out with the right precautions a straight and persistent left and a wary eye so neddy kept poking out his left and never lost sight of the courtplaster never of the shifty right give and take was the order of the round and they fought all over the ring patsy beard making for close quarters and neddy keeping off and stopping him with the left neddy met a straight punch on the nose that made his eyes water but through the tears he saw the plaster displaced and a tiny stream of blood trickling toward the corner of patsys mouth plainly it was a cut he broke ground stopped halfway and banged in left and right he got a sharp rive on the neck for his pains and took the right on his elbow but he had landed on the spot and the tiny streak of blood was smeared out wide across patsys face the company roared and whistled with enthusiasm it was a capital rally but now neddys left grew slower and was heavy to lift from time to time patsy got in one for nothing and soon began to drive him about the ring neddy fought on weak and gasping and longed for the call of time his arms felt as if they were hung with lead and he could do little more than push feebly he heard the yell of many voices now then patsy hout him ave im out thats it patsy another like that keep on patsy patsy kept on right and left above and below neddy could see the blows coming but he was powerless to guard or to return he could but stagger about and now and again swing an ineffectual arm as it hung from the shoulder presently a flush hit on the nose drove him against the ropes another in the ribs almost through them but a desperate wide whirl of his right brought it heavily on patsys tender spot and tore open the cut patsy winced and time neddy was grabbed at the waist and put in his chair good lad said the oneeyed pug in his ear as he sponged his face nothink like pluck but you mustnt go to pieces alf through the round was it a awkard poke upsetcher neddy lying back and panting wildly shook his head as he gazed at the ceiling awright try an save yourself a bit keep yer left goinyou roasted im good with that ell want a yard o plaster tonight an when e gits leadin loose take it auf an give him the right straight from the guardif you know the trick point o the jaw thats for mind ave a cooler he took a mouthful of water and blew it in a fine spray in neddys face wiped it down and began another overhead fanning seconds out of the ring called the timekeeper go it my ladthus a whisper from behindyou can walk over im and neddy felt the wet sponge squeezed against the back of his neck and the cool water trickling down his spine time neddy was better though there was a worn feeling in his armmuscles patsys cut had been well sponged but it still bled and patsy meant giving neddy no rest he rushed at once but was met by a clean righthander slap on the sore spot bravo neddy came a voice and the company howled as before patsy was steadied he sparred with some caution twitching the cheek next the cut neddy would not lead for he must save himself and so the two sparred for a few seconds then patsy rushed again and neddy got busy with both hands once he managed to get the right in from the guard as his second had advised but not heavily he could feel his strength goingearlier than in the last roundand patsy was as strong and determined as ever another rush carried neddy against the ropes where he got two heavy body blows and a bad jawrattler he floundered to the right in an attempt to slip and fell on his face he rolled on his side however and was up again breathless and unsteady there was a sickening throbbing in the crown of his head and he could scarce lift his arms but there was no respite the other lad was at him again and he was driven across the ring and back blindly pushing his aching arms before him while punch followed punch on nose ears jaws and body till something began to beat inside his head louder and harder than all beside stunning and sickening him he could hear the crowd roaring still but it seemed further off and the yells of thats it patsy now youve got im keep at im hout im this time came from some other building close by where somebody was getting a bad licking somebody with no control of his legs and no breath to spit away the blood from his nose as it ran and stuck over his lips somebody praying for the end of the three minutes that seemed three hours and groaning inwardly because of a lump of cold lead in his belly that had once been sausageroll somebody to whom a few calledstill in the other buildingchuck it neddy its no good why doncher chuck it while others said take im away tyke im away then something hit him between the eyes and some other thing behind the head that was one of the posts he swung an arm but it met nothing then the other and it struck somewhere and then there was a bang that twisted his head and hard boards were against his face o it was bad but it was a rest cold water was on his face and somebody spoke he was in his chair again and the oneeyed man was sponging him it was the call o time as saved ye then he said youd never a got up in the ten seconds y aint up to another round are ye better chuck it its no disgrace after the way youve stood up but neddy shook his head he had got through two of the three rounds and didnt mean throwing away a chance of saving the bout awright if you wont his mentor said nothink like pluck but youre no good on pointsa knockouts the ony chance nurse yer right an give it im good on the point es none so fresh isself es blowed with the work an you pasted im fine when you did it last thing just before e sent ye down ye dropped a ot un on is beak didnt see it didjer the old bruiser rubbed vigorously at his arms and gave him a small but welcome drink of water seconds out of the ring the oneeyed man was gone once more but again his voice came from behind mindgive it im ard and give it im soon an if you feel groggy chuck it dreckly if ye dont ill drag ye out by the slack o yer trousis an disgrace ye time neddy knew there was little more than half a minutes boxing left in himperhaps not so much he must do his best at once patsy was showing signs of hard wear and still blew a little his nose was encouragingly crimson at the nostrils and the cut was open and raw he rushed in with a lead which neddy ducked and crosscountered though ineffectually there were a few vigorous exchanges and then neddy staggered back from a straight drive on the mouth there was a shout of patsy and patsy sprang in right elbow all ajerk and flung in the left neddy guarded wildly and banged in the right from the guard had he hit he had felt no shock but there was patsy lying on his face the crowd roared and roared again the old pug stuffed his chair hastily through the ropes and neddy sank into it panting with bloodshot eyes patsy lay still the timekeeper watched the secondshand pass its ten points and gave the word but patsy only moved a leg neddy milton had won brayvo young un said the old fighter as he threw his arm about neddys waist and helped him to the dressingroom cleanest knockout i ever seesmack on the point o the jaw never thought youd a done it i said there was nothink like pluck didn i ave a wash now an youll be all the better for the exercise give us them glovesim off for the next bout and he seized another lad and marched him out ave a drop o beer said one of neddys newwon friends extending a tankard he took it though he scarcely felt awake he was listless and weak and would not have moved for an hour had he been left alone but patsy was brought to and sneezed loudly and neddy was hauled over to shake hands with him you give me a ell of a doin said neddy i never thought id beat you beat me well you aint ave you ow knockout answered several at once well im damned said patsy beard in the bar after the evenings business neddy sat and looked wistfully at the stout redfaced men who smoked fourpenny cigars and drank special scotch but not one noticed him his luck had not come after all but there was the second round of bouts and the final in a weeks timeperhaps it would come then if he could only win the finalthen it must come meanwhile he was sick and faint and felt doubtful about getting home outside it was raining hard he laid his head on the bar table at which he was sitting and at closing time there they found him asleep in business there was a great effervescence of rumor in cubitt town when ted munsey came into money ted munsey commonly alluded to as mrs munseys usband was a moulder with a regular job at moffats a large quiet man of fortyfive the uncomplaining appurtenance of his wife this was fitting for she had married beneath her her father having been a dock timekeeper to come into money is an unusual feat in cubitt town a feat nevertheless continually contemplated among possibilities by all cubitt towners who find nothing else in the sunday paper so refreshing as the paragraphs headed windfall for a cabman and a fortune for a pauper and who cut them out to pin over the mantelpiece the handsome coloring of such paragraphs was responsible for many bold flights of fancy in regard to ted munseys fortune cubitt town left to itself being sterile soil for the imagination some said that the munseys had come in for chests packed with bank notes on the decease of one of mrs munseys relations of whom she was wont to hint others put it at a street full of houses as being the higher ideal of wealth a few more romantically given imagined vaguely of ancestral lands and halls which mrs munsey and her forbears had been done out of for many years by the lawyers all which mrs munsey in her hour of triumph was at little pains to discount although in simple fact the fortune was no more than a legacy of a hundred pounds from teds uncle who had kept a publichouse in deptford of the hundred pounds mrs munsey took immediate custody there was no guessing what would have become of it in teds hands probably it would have been in chief part irrecoverably lent certainly it would have gone and left ted a moulder at moffats as before with mrs munsey there was neither hesitation nor difficulty the obvious use of a hundred pounds was to put its possessors into businesswhich meant a shop to elevate them socially at a single bound beyond the many grades lying between the moulder and the small tradesman wherefore the munseys straightway went into business being equally ignorant of every sort of shopkeeping they were free to choose the sort they pleased and thus it was that mrs munsey decided upon drapery and haberdashery teds contribution to the discussion being limited to a mild hint of greengrocery and coals instantly suppressed as low nothing could be more genteel than drapery and it would suit the girls general chandlery sweetstuff oil and firewoodall these were low comparatively drapery it was and quickly for mrs munsey was not wont to shillyshally an empty shop was found in bromley was rented and was stocked as far as possible tickets were hung upon everything bearing a very large main figure with a very small threefarthings beside it and the thing was done the stain of moulding was washed from the scutcheon the descent thereunto from dock timekeeping was redeemed fivefold dock timekeeping itself was left far below with carpentering shipwrighting and enginefitting the munseys were in business ted munsey stood about helplessly and stared irksomely striving not to put his hands in his pockets which was low any lapse being instantly detected by mrs munsey who rushed from all sorts of unexpected places and corrected the fault vigorously i didnt go for to do it marier he explained penitently its abit ill get out of it soon it dont look well i know in a business but it do seem a comfort somehow o you an your comfort a lot you study my comfort hedwardfor he was ted no moreatoilin an amoilin with everything to think of myself while you look on with your ands in your pockets do try an not look like a stuck ninny do and hedward whose every attempt at help or suggestion had been severely repulsed slouched uneasily to the door and strove to look as businesslike as possible there you go again stickin in the doorway and starin up an down the street as though there was no business dointhere was none but that might not be confessed dy expect people to come in with you afillin up the door do come in do youd be better out o the shop altogether hedward thought so too but said nothing he had been invested with his sunday clothes of lustrous black and brought into the shop to give such impression of a shopwalker as he might he stood uneasily on alternate feet and stared at the ceiling the floor or the space before him with an unhappy sense of being on show and not knowing what was expected of him he moved his hands purposelessly and knocked things down with his elbows he rubbed his hair all up behind and furtively wiped the resulting oil from his hand on his trousers never looking in the least degree like a shopwalker the first customer was a very small child who came for a haporth of pins and on whom hedward gazed with much interest and respect while mrs munsey handed over the purchase abating not a jot of his appreciation when the child returned later to explain that what she really wanted was sewing cotton other customers were disappointingly few several old neighbors came in from curiosity to talk and buy nothing one woman who looked at many things without buying was discovered after her departure to have stolen a pair of stockings and hedward was duly abused for not keeping a sharp lookout while his wifes back was turned finally the shutters went up on a days takings of three and sevenpence farthing including a most dubious threepenny bit but then as mrs munsey said when you are in business you must expect trade to vary and of course there would be more customers when the shop got known although hedward certainly might have taken the trouble to find one in a busier thoroughfare hedward whose opinion in that matter as in others had never been asked retired to the backyard to smoke a pipea thing he had been pining for all day but was quickly recalled the pipe being a clay upon mrs munseys discovery that the act could be observed from a neighbors window he was continually bringing the family into disgrace and mrs munsey despaired aloud over him far into the night the days came and went and trade varied as a fact very little indeed between three and sevenpence farthing and nothing the scope for fluctuation is small and for some time the first days record was never exceeded but on the fifth day a customer bought nearly seven shillings worth all at once her husband had that day returned from sea with money and she after months of stint indulged in an orgie of haberdashery at the nearest shop mrs munsey was reassured trade was increasing perhaps an assistant would be needed soon in addition to the two girls only the younger of the girls by the bye had as yet taken any active interest in the business emma the elder spending much of her time in a bedroom making herself unpresentable by inordinate blubbering this was because of mrs munseys prohibition of more companykeeping with jack page jack was a plumber just out of his timerather a catch for a moulders daughter but impossible of course for the daughter of people in business as emma should have had the proper feeling to see for herself this emma had not she wallowed in a luxury of woe exacerbated on occasions to poignancy by the scoldings and sometimes by the thumpings of her mar and neglected even the select weekly quadrille class membership whereof was part of the novel splendor but there was never again a sevenshilling customer the state of trade perplexed mrs munsey beyond telling being in business one must by the circumstance have a genteel competence this was an elementary axiom in cubitt town but where was the money what was the difference between this and other shops was a screw loose anywhere in that case it certainly could not be her fault wherefore she nagged hedward one day a polite young man called in a large ponytrap and explained the whole mystery nobody could reasonably expect to succeed in a business of this sort who did not keep a good stock of the fancy aprons and lace bows made by the firm he was charged to represent of course he knew what business was and that cash was not always free but that need never hinder transactions with him three months credit was the regular thing with any respectable wellestablished business concern and in three months one would certainly sell all the fancy aprons and lace bows of this especial kind and price that one had room for and he need scarcely remind a lady of mrs munseys business experience that fancy aprons and lace bowsof the right sortwere by far the most profitable goods known to the trade everybody knew that should they say a gross of each just to go on with no well then half a gross these prices were cut so near that it really did not pay to split the gross but this time to secure a good customer he would stretch a point mrs munsey was enlightened plainly the secret of success in business was to buy advantageously in the way the polite young man suggested sell at a good price and live on the profits merely paying over the remainder at the end of three months nothing could be simpler so she began the system forthwith other polite young men called and further certain profits were arranged for on similar terms the weak spot in the plan was the absence of any binding arrangement with the general public and this was not long in discovering itself nobody came to buy the fancy aprons and the lace bows tempting as they might seem moreover after they had hung a week or more alice reported that a large shop in the commercial road was offering by retail aprons and bows of precisely the same sort at a less price than the polite young man had charged for a wholesale purchase mrs munsey grew desperate and hedwards life became a horror unto him he was set to stand at the door with a fancy apron in one hand and a lace bow in the other and capture customers as they passed a function wherein he achieved detestable failure alarming passing women who considered him dangerously drunk as greatly as his situation distressed himself mrs munsey grew more desperate and drove hedward to the rear of the house with bitter revilings money must be got out of the stock somehow that a shop could in any circumstances be unremunerative puzzled as much as it dismayed her the goods were marked down to low pricesoften lower than cost still mrs munsey had the abiding conviction that the affair must pay as others did if only she might hold out long enough hedwards suggestion that he should return to the moulding coming and going as little in sight as possible she repelled savagely a nice notion youve got o keepin up a proper position you aint content with disgracin me and yourself too playin the fool in the shop till trades ruined an nobody wont come near the placean i dont wonder at it youre a nice sort of usband i must say what are you goin to do now with the business in this pretty mess an your wife an children ready to starve what are you goin to do where are you goin to turn thats what i want to know well im athinkin it out marier in a legal point praps you know my dear oh dont dear me i ate a fool marked as low as they might be none of the aprons nor the bows nor the towels nor the stockings nor any other of the goods were boughtnever a thing beyond a haporth of thread or a farthing bodkin rent had to be paid and even food cost money there was a flavor of blank disappointment about saturdaythe pay day of less anxious times and quarter day when all these polite young men would demand the money that was notthat day was coming black and soon mrs munsey grew more desperate than ever sharp of feature and aged alone she would probably have wept having hedward at hand she poured forth her bitterness of spirit upon him till at last he was nagged out of his normal stolidity and there came upon his face the look of a bullock that is harried on all hands through unfamiliar streets on a night when from sheer weariness of soul she fell from clatter toward sleep of a sudden hedward spoke marier he said well you aint give me a kiss lately kiss me now dont be a fool im sick an tired go to sleep if you can sleep with everything kiss me i tell you he had never commanded like that before she marvelled feared a little and obeyed in the morning when she awoke he had already gone downstairs this was as usual when she followed however he was not to be found in the house the shop shutters had been taken down and the windows carefully cleaned although it was not the regular windowcleaning day but the door was shut on the sittingroom table were two papers one within the other the first was written with many faults and smudges and this was how it ran the deed and testiment of ed munsey this is to cirtiffy that i make over all my

love to emma and alice this one must be burnt keep the other near the papers lay ted munseys large silver watch and chain the silver ring that he used to fasten his best tie three keys and a few coppers upstairs the girls began to move about mrs munsey sat with her frightened face on the table the red cow group the red cow anarchist group no longer exists its leading spirit appears no more among his devoted comrades and without him they are ineffectual he was but a young man this leading spirit his name by the bye was sotcher but of his commanding influence among the older but unlettered men about him read and judge for themselves they had long been plunged in a beery apathy neither regarding nor caring for the fearful iniquities of the social system that oppressed them a red cow group they had always been before the coming of sotcher to make anarchists of them forgathering in a remote compartment of the red cow bar reached by a side door in an alley a compartment uninvaded and almost undiscovered by any but themselves where night after night they drank their beer and smoked their pipes sunk in a stagnant ignorance of their manifold wrongs during the day old baker remained to garrison the stronghold he was a longbankrupt tradesman with invisible resources and no occupation but this and no known lodging but the red cow snuggery there he remained all day and every day holding the fort as he put it with his nose a fiery signal of possession never two feet from the rim of his pot while jerry shand was carrying heavy loads in columbia market while gunno polson was running for a bookmaker in fleet street while snorkey was wherever his instinct took him doing whatever paid best and keeping out of trouble as long as he could and while the rest of the grouptwo or threepicked a living out of the london heap in ways and places unspecified but at evening they joined old baker and they filled their snuggery their talk was rarely of politics and never of social problems present and immediate facts filled their whole field of contemplation their accounts were kept and their references to pecuniary matters were always stated in terms of liquid measure thus fourpence was never spoken of in the common way it was a quart and a quart was the monetary standard of the community even as twopence was a pint and eightpence was halfagallon it was snorkey who discovered sotcher and it was with snorkey that that revolutionary appeared before the red cow group with his message of enlightenment snorkey who was christened something else that nobody knew or cared about had a trick of getting into extraordinary and unheardof places in his daily quest of quarts and he had met sotcher in a loft at the top of a house in berners street shadwell it was a loft where the elect of anarchism congregated nightly and where everybody lectured all the others sotcher was a very young anarchist restless by reason of not being sufficiently listened to and glad to find outsiders to instruct and to impress with a full sense of his sombre mystic daredevilry therefore he came to the red cow with snorkey to spread as he said the light he was not received with enthusiasm perhaps because of a certain unlaundered aspect of person remarkable even to them of the red cow group grease was his chief exterior characteristic and his thick hair turning up over his collar seemed to have lain for long unharried of brush or comb his face was a sebaceous trickle of long features and on his hands there was a murky deposit that looked like scales he wore in all weathers a long black coat with a rectangular rent in the skirt and his throat he clipped in a brown neckerchief that on a time had been of the right anarchist red but no want of welcome could abash him here indeed he had an audience an audience that did not lecture on its own account a crude audience that might take him at his own valuation so he gave it to that crude audience hot and strong they and he were the salt of the earth bullied plundered and abused down with everything that wasnt down already and so forth and so on his lectures were continued every night it was the same as every other and each several chapter of his discourse was a repetition of the one before slowly the red cow group came around plainly other people were better off than they and certainly each man found it hard to believe that anybody else was more deserving than himself wy are we pore asked sotcher leaning forward and jerking his extended palm from one to another as though attempting a hasty collection i ask you straight wy are we pore why is it my friens that awften and awften you find you aint got a penny in yer pocket not for to git a crust o bread or alf a pint o reasonable refreshment ow is it that appens agin i ask ow snorkey with a feeling that an answer was expected from somebody presently murmured no mugs which encouraged gunno polson to suggest backers all stonybroke jerry shand said nothing but reflected on the occasional result of a day on the loose old baker neither spoke nor thought ill tell you me friens its cos o the rotten state o sciety wy dyou allow the lazy idle dirty donothing upper classes as they call emselves to reap all the benefits o your toil wile you slave an slave to keep em in lukshry an starve yerselves wy dont you go an take your shares o the wealth lyin round you there was another pause gunno polson looked at his friends one after another spat emphatically and said coppers becos o the brute force as the privileged classes is edged theirselves in with thats all becos o the paid myrmidons armed an kep to make slaves o the people becos o the magistrates an plice then wy not git rid o the magistrates an plice theyre no good are they oo wants em i ask oo they are a noosance admitted snorkey who had done a little time himself he was a mere groundling and persisted in regarding the proceedings as simple conversation instead of as an oration with pauses at the proper places nobody wants emnobody as is any good then dont ave em me friensdont ave em it all rests with you dont ave no magistrates nor plice nor goverment nor parliament nor monarchy nor county council nor nothink make a clean sweep of em blow em up then youll ave yer rights the times comin i tell you its comin take my word for it now you toil an slave then everybodyll ave to work wether e likes it or not and two hours work a dayll be all youll ave to do old baker looked a little alarmed and for a moment paused in his smoking two hours a day at most thats all an all yer wants provided for free an liberal some of the group gave a lickerish look across the bar no athority no goverment no privilege an nothink to interfere free contrack between man an man subjick to free revision an change wots that demanded jerry shand who was the slowest convert wy that sotcher explained means that everybody can make wot arrangements with is fellermen e likes for to carry on the business of life but nothink cant bind you you chuck over the arrangement if it suits best ah said gunno polson musingly rotating his pot horizontally before him to stir the beer that ud be andy sometimes they call it welshin now the light spread fast and free and in a few nights the red cow group was a very promising little bed of anarchy sotcher was at pains to have it reported at two places west of tottenham court road and at another in dean street soho that at last a comrade had secured an excellent footing with a party of the proletariat of east london hitherto looked on as hopeless material more that an early manifestation of activity might be expected in that quarter such activity had been held advisable of late in view of certain extraditions and sotchers discourse at the red cow turned lightly and easily toward the question of explosives anybody could make them he explained nothing simpler with care and here he posed at large in the character of mysterious desperado the wonder and admiration of all the red cow group they should buy nitric acid he said of the strongest sort and twice as much sulphuric acid the shops where they sold photographic materials were best and cheapest for these things and no questions were asked they should mix the acids and then add gently drop by drop the best glycerine taking care to keep everything cool after which the whole lot must be poured into water to stand for an hour then a thick yellowish oily stuff would be found to have sunk to the bottom which must be passed through several pails of water to be cleansed and there it was a terrible explosive you handled it with care and poured it on brickdust or dry sand or anything of that sort that would soak it up and then it could be used with safety to the operator the group listened with rapt attention more than one pot stopping halfway on its passage mouthwards then jerry shand wanted to know if sotcher had ever blown up anything or anybody himself the missionary admitted that that glory had not been his im one o the teachers me friensone o the pioneers that goes to show the way for the active workers like you i ony come to explain the principles an set you in the right road to the social revolution so as you may get yer rights at last its for you to act then he explained that action might be taken in two ways either individually or by mutual aid in the group individual work was much to be preferred being safer but a particular undertaking often necessitated cooperation but that was for the workers to settle as the occasion arose however one thing must be remembered if the group operated each man must be watchful of the rest there must be no half measures no timorousness any comrade wavering temporizing or behaving in any way suspiciously must be straightway suppressed there must be no mistake about that it was desperate and glorious work and there must be desperate and rapid methods both of striking and guarding these things he made clear in his best conspirators manner with nods and scowls and a shaken forefinger as of one accustomed to oversetting empires the men of the red cow group looked at each other and spat thoughtfully then a comrade asked what had better be blown up first sotchers opinion was that there was most glory in blowing up people in a crowd or at a theatre but a building was safer as there was more chance of getting away of buildings a public office was probably to be preferredsomething in whitehall say or a banknobody seemed to have tried a bank he offered the suggestion now of course there were not many public buildings in the east end but possibly the group would like to act in their own neighborhood it would be a novelty and would attract notice the question was one for their own decision independent freedom of judgment being the right thing in these matters there were churches of course and the factories of the bloated capitalist particularly he might suggest the gasworks close by there was a large gasometer abutting on the street and probably an explosion there would prove tremendously effective putting the lights out everywhere and attracting great attention in the papers that was glory jerry shand hazarded a remark about the lives of the men in the gasworks but sotcher explained that that was a trivial matter revolutions were never accomplished without bloodshed and a few casual lives were not to be weighed in the balance against the glorious consummation of the social upheaval he repeated his contention when some weaker comrade spoke of the chance of danger to the operator and repeated it with a proper scorn of the softhanded pusillanimity that shrank from danger to life and limb in the cause look at the glory and consider the hundredfold vengeance on the enemy in the day to come the martyrs crown was his who should die at the post of duty his eloquence prevailed there were murmurs no more ere tell us the name of the stuff agin broke out gunno polson resolutely feeling for a pencil and paper blimy ill make some tomorrer he wrote down the name of the ingredients with much spelling thick yuller oily stuff aint it wot you make he asked yusan keep it cool the group broke up stern and resolute and sotcher strode to his home exultant a man of power for the next night or two the enthusiasm at the red cow was unbounded there was no longer any questioning of principles or actionevery man was an eager anarchiststrong and devoted in the cause the little chemical experiment was going on well gunno polson reported with confident nods and winks sotcher repeated his discourse as a matter of routine to maintain the general ardor which had however to endure a temporary check as the result of a delicate inquiry of snorkeys as to what funds might be expected from headquarters for there were no funds said sotcher somewhat surprised at the question wot demanded jerry shand opening his mouth and putting down his pipe aint we goin to get nothink for all this they would get the glory sotcher assured him and the consciousness of striking a mighty blow at this and that and the other but that was all and instantly the faces of the group grew long but said old baker i thought all you blokes always got somethink from thethe committee there was no committee and no funds there was nothing but glory and victory and triumph and the social revolution and things of that kind for a little the comrades looked at each other awkwardly but they soon regained their cheerfulness with zeal no whit abated the sitting closed with promises of an early gathering for the next night but when the next night came sotcher was later than usual ullo shouted gunno polson as he entered ere you are at last weve ad to do important business without you see he added in a lower tone eres the stuff and he produced an old physicbottle nearly full of a thick yellowish fluid sotcher started back half a pace and slightly paled dont shake it he whispered hoarsely dont shake it for gawds sake wotwotjer bring it ere for like that itsits awful stuff blimy he looked uneasily about the group and wiped his forehead with the back of his hand ii thought youd git the job over soon as the stuff was ready ere my gawd he squeaked under his breath dont put it down ard on the table like that its sichsich awful stuff he wiped his forehead again and still standing glanced once more apprehensively round the circle of impassive faces then after a pause he asked with an effort wotwotjer goin to do now blow up the bleedn gasworks o course answered gunno polson complacently eres a pennorth o silver sand an a bacca canister an some wire an a big cracker with a long touchpaper so as to stick out o the canisterlid that ought to set it auf oughtnt it ere you pour the stuff over the sand doncher and he pulled out the cork and made ready to mix old onold ondont wait a bit for gawds sake cried sotcher in a sweat of terror youyou dunno wot awful stuff it isselp me you dont youyoull blow us all up if you dont keep it still yyoull want someother things ill go an but jerry shand stood grimly against the door this ere conspiracyll ave to be gawn through proper he said we cant ave no waverers nor blokes wot want to clear out in the middle of it and praps go an tell the plice them sort we as to suppress see theres all the stuff there me lad an you know it wots more its you as is got to put it up agin the gasworks an set it auf the hapless sotcher turned a yellower pallor and asked faintly me wy me all done reglar and proper jerry replied fore you come we voted itby ballot all square if youd a come earlier youd a ad a vote yerself sotcher pushed at jerrys shoulder despairingly i wont i wont he gasped lemme goit aint fairi wasnt erelemme go none o yer shovin young man said jerry severely none o yer shovin else ill ave to punch you on the jore youre a bleedn nice conspirator you are its pretty plain we cant depend on you an you know wot that meanseh doncher youre one o the sort as as to be suppressed thats wot it means ere ave a drink o this ere beer an see if that cant put a little art in ye you got to do it so you may as well do it cheerful snorkey give im a drink but the wretched revolutionary would not drink he sank in a cornerthe furthest from the table where gunno polson was packing his dreadful canistera picture of stupefied affright presently he thought of the bara mere yard of counter in an angle of the room with a screen standing above itand conceived a wild notion of escape by scrambling over but scarce had he risen ere the watchful jerry divined his purpose old im snorkey he said keep im in the corner an if e wont drink that beer pour it over is ead snorkey obeyed gravely and conscientiously and the bedraggled sotcher cowed from protest whined and sobbed desolately when all was ready jerry shand said i spose its no good askin you to do it willin like a man o let me go ii aint wellselp me i aint ii might do it wrongananim aa teachera speaker not the active branch selp me put it auffor tonightwait till tomorrer i aint well anan youre very ard on me desprit work desprit ways jerry replied laconically youre beavin very suspicious an youre rebellin agin the orders o the group theres only one physic for that aint there in the rules youre got to be suppressed question is ow well ave to kill im quiet somehow he proceeded turning to the group quiet an quick its my belief es spyin for the plice an wants to git out to split on us question is ow to do for im sotcher rose a staring spectre he opened his mouth to call but there came forth from it only a dry murmur hands were across his mouth at once and he was forced back into the corner one suggested a claspknife at the throat another a stick in his neckerchief twisted to throttlingpoint but in the end it was settled that it would be simpler and would better destroy all traces to despatch him in the explosionto tie him to the canister in fact a convulsive movement under the mens hands decided them to throw more beer on sotchers face for he seemed to be fainting then his pockets were invaded by gunno polson who turned out each in succession you wont ave no use for money where youre goin he observed callously besides it ud be blowed to bits an no use to nobody look at the bloke at greenwich ow is things was blowed away ullo eres two arfcrowns an some tanners seven an thrippence altogether with the browns this is the bloke wot adnt got no funds thisll be divided on free an equal principles to elp pay for that beer youve wasted old up ol man think o the glory praps youre all right but its best to be on the safe side an dead blokes cant split to the coppers an you mustnt forget the glory you ave to shed blood in a revolution an a few odd lives more or less dont matternot a single damn keep your eye on the bleedn glory theyll ave photos of you in the papers all the broken bits in a eap facsimiliar as found on the spot wot a comfort thatll be but the doomed creature was obliviousprostratea swooning heap they ran a piece of clothesline under his elbows and pulled them together tight they then hobbled his ankles and took him among them through the alley and down the quiet street singing and shouting their loudest as they went in case he might sufficiently recover his powers to call for help but he did not and there in the shadow at the foot of the great gasometer they flung him down with a parting kick and a barbarous knock on the head to keep him quiet for those few necessary moments then the murderous canister bound with wire was put in place the extruding touchpaper was set going with a match and the red cow anarchists disappeared at a run leaving their victim to his fate presently the policeman on that beat heard a sudden report from the neighborhood of the gasworks and ran to see what it might mean the next morning alfred sotcher was charged at the thames police court as a drunk and incapable he had been found in a helpless state near the gasworks and appeared to have been tied at the elbows and ankles by mischievous boys who had also it seemed ignited a cracker near by where he lay the divisional surgeon stated that he was called to the prisoner and found him tearful and incoherent and smelling strongly of drink he complained of having been assaulted in a publichouse but could give no intelligible account of himself a canister found by his side appeared to contain a mixture of sand and castor oil but prisoner could not explain how it came there the magistrate fined him five shillings with the alternative of seven days and as he had no money he was removed to the cells on the stairs the house had been genteel when trade was prospering in the east end and the shipfitter or blockmaker thought it no shame to live in the parish where his workshop lay such a master had lived here now it was a tall solid wellbricked ugly house grimy and paintless in the joinery cracked and patched in the windows where the front door stood open all day long and the womankind sat on the steps talking of sickness and deaths and the cost of things and treacherous holes lurked in the carpet of roadsoil on the stairs and in the passage for when eight families live in a house nobody buys a doormat and the street was one of those streets that are always muddy it smelt too of many things none of them pleasant one was fried fish but for all that it was not a slum three flights up a gaunt woman with bare forearms stayed on her way to listen at a door which opening let out a warm fetid waft from a close sickroom a bent and tottering old woman stood on the threshold holding the door behind her an is e no better now mrs curtis the gaunt woman asked with a nod at the opening the old woman shook her head and pulled the door closer her jaw waggled loosely in her withered chaps nor wont be till es gone then after a certain pause es goin she said dont doctor give no ope lor bless ye i dont want to ast no doctors mrs curtis replied with something not unlike a chuckle ive seed too many on em the boys agoin fast i can see that an thenshe gave the handle another tug and whisperedhes been called she nodded amain three seprit knocks at the bedhead las night an i know what that means the gaunt woman raised her brows and nodded ah well she said we all on us comes to it some day sooner or later an its often a appy release the two looked into space beyond each other the elder with a nod and a croak presently the other pursued es been a very good son aint e ay ay well enough son to me responded the old woman a little peevishly an ill ave im put away decent though theres ony the union for me after i can do that thank gawd she added meditatively as chin on fist she stared into the thickening dark over the stairs when i lost my pore usband said the gaunt woman with a certain brightening i give im a ansome funeral e was a oddfeller an i got twelve pound i ad a oak caufin an a open earse there was a kerridge for the famly an one for is matestwo orses each an feathers an mutes an it went the furthest way round to the cimitry wotever appens mrs manders says the undertaker youll feel as youre treated im proper nobody cant reproach you over that an they couldnt e was a good usband to me an i buried im respectable the gaunt woman exulted the old old story of manderss funeral fell upon the other ones ears with a freshened interest and she mumbled her gums ruminantly bobll ave a ansome buryin too she said i can make it up with the insurance money an this an that ony i dunno about mutes its a expense in the east end when a woman has not enough money to buy a thing much desired she does not say so in plain words she says the thing is an expense or a great expense it means the same thing but it sounds better mrs curtis had reckoned her resources and found that mutes would be an expense at a cheap funeral mutes cost halfasovereign and their liquor mrs manders said as much yus yus arfasovereign the old woman assented within the sick man feebly beat the floor with a stick im acomin she cried shrilly yus arfasovereign but its a lot an i dont see ow im to do itnot at present she reached for the doorhandle again but stopped and added by afterthought unless i dont ave no plooms it ud be a pity not to ave plooms i ad there were footsteps on the stairs then a stumble and a testy word mrs curtis peered over into the gathering dark is it the doctor sir she asked it was the doctors assistant and mrs manders tramped up to the next landing as the door of the sickroom took him in for five minutes the stairs were darker than ever then the assistant a very young man came out again followed by the old woman with a candle mrs manders listened in the upper dark hes sinking fast said the assistant he must have a stimulant dr mansell ordered port wine where is it mrs curtis mumbled dolorously i tell you he must have it he averred with unprofessional emphasis his qualification was only a month old the man cant take solid food and his strength must be kept up somehow another day may make all the difference is it because you cant afford it its a expensesich a expense doctor the old woman pleaded an wot with arfpints o milk an she grew inarticulate and mumbled dismally but he must have it mrs curtis if its your last shilling its the only way if you mean you absolutely havent the money and he paused a little awkwardly he was not a wealthy young manwealthy young men do not devil for east end doctorsbut he was conscious of a certain haul of sixpences at nap the night before and being inexperienced he did not foresee the career of persecution whereon he was entering at his own expense and of his own motion he produced five shillings if you absolutely havent the money whytake this and get a bottlegood not at a publichouse but mind at once he should have had it before it would have interested him as a matter of coincidence to know that his principal had been guilty of the selfsame indiscretioneven the amount was identicalon that landing the day before but as mrs curtis said nothing of this he floundered down the stair and out into the wetter mud pondering whether or not the beloved son of a congregational minister might take full credit for a deed of charity on the proceeds of sixpenny nap but mrs curtis puffed her wrinkles and shook her head sagaciously as she carried in her candle from the room came a clink as of money falling into a teapot and mrs manders went about her business the door was shut and the stair a pit of blackness twice a lodger passed down and up and down and still it did not open men and women walked on the lower flights and out at the door and in again from the street a shout or a snatch of laughter floated up the pit on the pavement footsteps rang crisper and fewer and from the bottom passage there were sounds of stagger and sprawl a demented old clock buzzed divers hours at random and was rebuked every twenty minutes by the regular tread of a policeman on his beat finally somebody shut the streetdoor with a great bang and the street was muffled a key turned inside the door on the landing but that was all a feeble light shone for hours along the crack below and then went out the crazy old clock went buzzing on but nothing left that room all night nothing that opened the door when next the key turned it was to mrs manderss knock in the full morning and soon the two women came out on the landing together mrs curtis with a shapeless clump of bonnet ah es a lovely corpse said mrs manders like wax so was my usband i must be stirrin croaked the old woman an go about the insurance an the measurin an that theres lots to do ah there is oo are you goin to avewilkins i ad wilkins better than kedge i think kedges mutes dresses rusty an their trousis is frayed if you was thinkin of avin mutes yus yuswith a palsied noddingim agoin to ave mutes i can do it respectable thank gawd and the plooms ay yus and the plooms too they aint sich a great expense after all squire napper i bill napper was a heavy man of something between thirtyfive and forty his moleskin trousers were strapped below the knees and he wore his coat loose on his back with the sleeves tied across his chest the casual observer set him down a navvy but mrs napper punctiliously made it known that he was in the paving which meant that he was a pavior he lived in canning town and was on a footpath job at west ham allen was the contractor when he won and began to wear the nickname squire daily at the stroke of twelve from the neighboring church bill nappers mates let drop rammer trowel spade and pick and turned toward a row of basins tied in blueandred handkerchiefs and accompanied of divers tin cans with smoky bottoms bill himself looked toward the street corner for the punctual polly bearing his own dinner fresh and hot for home was not far and polly being thirteen had no school now one day polly was nearly ten minutes late bill at first impatient grew savage and thought wrathfully on the strap on its nail by the kitchendresser but at the end of the ten minutes polly came bringing a letter as well as the basinload of beef and cabbage a young man had left it she said after asking many illmannered questions the letter was addressed w napper esq with a flourish the words by hand stood in the corner of the envelope and on the flap at the back were the embossed characters t n these things bill napper noted several times over as he turned the letter about in his hand seems to me youll ave to open it after all said one of bills mates and he opened it setting back his hat as a preparation to serious study the letter was dated from old jewry and ran thus re b napper deceased dear sirwe have a communication in this matter from our correspondents at sydney new south wales in respect to testamentary dispositions under which you benefit we shall be obliged if you can make it convenient to call at this office any day except saturday between two and fouryour obedient servants tims norton the dinner hour had gone by before the full inner meaning had been wrested from this letter b napper deceased bill accepted with a little assistance as an announcement of the death of his brother ben who had gone to australia nearly twenty years ago and had been forgotten testamentary dispositions nobody would tackle with confidence although its distinct suggestion of biblical study was duly remarked benefit was right enough and led one of the younger men after some thought to the opinion that bill nappers brother might have left him something a theory instantly accepted as the most probable although some thought it foolish of him not to leave it direct instead of authorizing the interference of a lawyer who would want to do bill out of it bill napper put up his tools and went home there the missis put an end to doubt by repeating what the lawyers clerk said which was nothing more definite than that bill had been left a bit and the clerk only acknowledged so much when he had satisfied himself by sinuous questionings that he had found the real legatee he further advised the bringing of certain evidence on the visit to the office thus it was plain that the napper fortunes were in good case for as a bit means money all the world over the thing was clearly no worthless keepsake ii on the afternoon of the next day bill napper in clean moleskins and black coat made for old jewry on mature consideration he had decided to go through it alone there was not merely one lawyer which would be bad enough but two of them in a partnership and to take the missis whose intellects being somewhat flighty were quickly divertible by the palaver of which a lawyer was master would be to distract and impede his own faculties a male friend might not have been so bad but bill could not call to mind one quite cute enough to be of any use and in any case such a friend would have to be paid for the loss of his days work moreover he might imagine himself to hold a sort of interest in the proceeds so bill napper went alone having waited the proper time without the bar in the clerks office he was shown into a room where a middleaged man sat at a writingtable there was no other lawyer to be seen this was a stratagem for which bill napper was not prepared he looked suspiciously about the room but without discovering anything that looked like a hidingplace plainly there were two lawyers because their names were on the door and on the letter itself and the letter said we why one should hide it was hard to guess unless it were to bear witness to some unguarded expression bill napper resolved to speak little and not loud the lawyer addressed him affably inviting him to sit then he asked to see the papers that bill had brought these were an old testimonial reciting that bill had been employed with his brother benjamin as a boy in a brickfield and had given satisfaction a letter from a parish guardian the son of an old employer of bills father certifying that bill was his fathers son and his brothers brother copies of the birth registry of both bill and his brother procured that morning and a letter from australia the last word from benjamin dated eighteen years back these bill produced in succession keeping a firm grip on each as he placed it beneath the lawyers nose the lawyer behaved somewhat testily under this restraint but bill knew better than to let the papers out of his possession and would not be done when he had seen all well mr napper said the lawyer rather snappishly obviously he was balked these things seem all right and with the inquiries i have already made i suppose i may proceed to pay you the money it is a legacy of three hundred pounds your brother was married and i believe his business and other property goes to his wife and children the money is intact the estate paying legacy duty and expenses in cases of this sort there is sometimes an arrangement for the amount to be paid a little at a time as required that however i judge would not be an arrangement to please you i hope at any rate you will be able to invest the money in a profitable way i will draw a check three hundred pounds was beyond bill nappers wildest dreams but he would not be dazzled out of his caution presently the lawyer tore the check from the book and pushed it across the table with another paper he offered bill a pen pointing with his other hand at the bottom of the second paper and saying this is the receipt sign just there please bill took up the check but made no movement toward the pen receipt he grunted softly receipt wot for i aint ad no money theres the check in your handthe same thing its an order to the bank to hand you the amountthe usual way of paying money in business affairs if you would rather have the money paid here i can send a clerk to the bank to get it give me the check but again bill was not to be done the lawyer finding him sharper than he expected now wanted to get this tricky piece of paper back so bill only grinned at him keeping a good hold of the check the lawyer lost his temper why damn it he said youre a curious person to deal with dye want the money and the check too he rang a bell twice and a clerk appeared mr dixon said the lawyer i have given this person a check for three hundred pounds just take him round to the bank and get it cashed let him sign the receipt at the bank i suppose he added turning to bill that you wont object to giving a receipt when you get the money eh bill napper conscious of his victory expressed his willingness to do the proper thing at the proper time and went out with the clerk at the bank there was little difficulty except at the clerks advice to take the money chiefly in notes which instantly confirmed bill in a determination to accept nothing but gold when all was done and the three hundred sovereigns carefully counted over for the third and fourth time were stowed in small bags about his person bill much relieved after his spell of watchfulness insisted on standing the clerk a drink ah he said all you city lawyers an clurks are pretty bleedn sharp i know but you aint done me an i dont bear no malice ave wot you likeave wine or a six o irishi aint goin to be stingy im goin to do it open an free i am an set a example to men o property iii bill napper went home in a hansom ordering a barrel of beer on the way one of the chief comforts of affluence is that you may have beer in by the barrel for then sundays and closing times vex not and you have but to reach the length of your arm for another pot whenever moved thereunto nobody in canning town had beer by the barrel except the tradesmen and for that bill had long envied the man who kept shop and now at his first opportunity he bought a barrel of thirtysix gallons once home with the news and canning town was ablaze bill napper had come in for three thousand thirty thousand three hundred thousandany number of thousands that were within the compass of the gossips command of enumeration bill napper was called w napper esqhe was to be knightedhe was a longlost baronetanything bill napper came home in a hansoma broughama state coach mrs napper went that very evening to the grove at stratford to buy silk and satin green red and yellowcutting her neighbors dead right and left and by the next morning tradesmen had sent circulars and samples of goods mrs napper was for taking a proper position in society and a house in a fashionable partbarking road for instance or even east india road poplar but bill would none of such foolishness he wasnt proud and canning town was quite good enough for him this much though he conceded that the family should take a whole house of five rooms in the next street instead of the two rooms and a cellule upstairs now rented that morning bill lit his pipe stuck his hands in his pockets and strolled as far as his job wayo squire shouted one of the men as he approached ere comes the bleedn toff remarked another tcheer tcheer mates bill responded calmly complacent im agoin to wet it and all the fourteen men left their paving for the beerhouse close by the foreman made some demur but was helpless and ended by coming himself now then gaffer said bill none o your sulks no one aint agoin to stand out of a drink o mineunless e wants to fight as for the jobdamn the job id buy up fifty jobs like that ere and not stop for the change you send the guvnor to me if e says anythink unnerstand you send im to me and he laid hands on the foreman who was not a big man and hauled him after the others they wetted it for two or three hours from many quart pots then there appeared between the swing doors the wrathful face of the guvnor the guvnors position was difficult he was only a small master and but a few years back had been a working mason this deserted job was his first for the parish and by contract he was bound to end it quickly under penalty moreover he much desired something on account that week and must stand well with the vestry on the other hand this was a time of strikes and the air was electrical several large and successful movements had quickened a spirit of restlessness in the neighborhood and no master was sure of his men some slight was fancied something was not done as it should have been done from the point of view of the workshop and there was a strike picketing and bashing now the worst thing that could have happened to the guvnor at this moment was one of those tiny unrecorded strikes that were bursting out weekly and daily about him with the picketing of his two or three jobs furious therefore as he was he dared not discharge every man on the spot so he stood in the door and said look here i wont stand this sort of thingits a damn robbery ill thats all right ol cock roared bill napper reaching toward the guvnor you come an ave a tiddley im a bleedn millionaire meself now but i aint proud what you wontfor the guvnor unenthusiastic remained at the door youre a sulky old bleeder these ere friends o mine are avin arf a day auf at my expense unnerstand my expense im apayin for their time if you dock em an i can give you a bob me fine feller if youre ard up see the guvnor addressed himself to the foreman whats the meaning o this walker he said what game dye call it bill napper whom a succession of pots had made uproarious slapped the foreman violently on the shoulder this eres the gaffer he shouted es all right e come ere cos e couldnt elp isself i made im come forcible dont you bear no spite agin the gaffer dy ear es my mate is the gaffer an i could buy you up forty times selp mebut i aint proud an youre a bleedn gawblimy slackbaked well said the guvnor to the assembled company but still ignoring bill dont you think theres been about enough of this a few of the men glanced at one another and one or two rose awright guvnor said one were auf and two more echoed awright guvnor and began to move away ah said bill napper with disgust as he turned to finish his pot youre a blasted niggerdriver you are an a sulky beast he added as he set the pot down never mind he pursued im awright an i aint a arfpaid kerbwhacker no more under you you was a damn sight better kerbwhacker than you are a millionaire the guvnor retorted feeling safer now that his men were getting back to work none o your lip replied bill rising and reaching for a pipespill none o your lip you workus stonebreaker then turning with a sudden access of fury ill knock yer face off blimy he shouted and raised his fist now then none o that here please cried the landlord from behind the bar unto whom bill napper with all his wonted obedience in that quarter answered only all right guvnor and subsided left alone he soon followed the masterpavior and his men through the swing doors and so went home in his own street observing two small boys in the prelusory stages of a fight he put up sixpence by way of stakes and supervised the battle from the seat afforded by a convenient windowsill after that he bought a morning paper and lay upon his bed to read it with a pipe and a jug for he was beginning a life of leisure and comfort wherein every day should be a superior sunday iv thus far the outward and visible signs of the napper wealth were these the separate house the barrel of beer a pianonot bought as a musical instrument but as one of the visible signs a daily paper also primarily a sign the bonnets and dresses of the missis and the perpetual possession of bill napper by a varying degree of fuddlement an inward and dissembled sign was a regiment continually reinforced of mostly empty bottles in a cupboard kept sacred by the missis and the faculties of that good lady herself experienced a fluctuating confusion from causes not always made plain to bill for the money was kept in the bedroom chest of drawers and it was easy to lay hands on a halfsovereign as required without unnecessary disturbance now and again bill napper would discuss the abstract question of entering upon some investment or business pursuit land had its advantages great advantages and he had been told that it was very cheap just now in some places houses were good too and a suitable possession for a man of consideration not so desirable on the whole however as land you bought your land andwell there it was and you could take things easily but with houses there was rent to collect and repairs to see to and so forth it was a vastly paying thing for any man with capital to be a merchant but there was work even in that and you had to be perpetually on guard against sharp chaps in the city a publichouse suggested by one of his old mates on the occasion of wetting it was out of the question there was tick and long hours and a sharp lookout and all kinds of trouble which a man with money would be a fool to encounter altogether perhaps land seemed to be the thing although there was no need to bother now and plenty of time to turn things over even if the matter were worth pondering at all when it was so easy for a man to live on his means after all to take your boots off and lie on the bed with a pipe and a pot and the paper was very comfortable and you could always stroll out and meet a mate or bring him in when so disposed of an evening the albert music hall was close at hand and the queens not very far away and on sundays and saturday afternoons bill would often take a turn down by the dock gates or even in victoria park or mile end waste where there were speakers of all sorts at the dock gates it was mostly labor and anarchy but at the other places there was a fine variety you could always be sure of a few minutes of teetotalism evangelism atheism republicanism salvationism socialism antivaccinationism and social purity with now and again some mormonism or another curious exotic most of the speakers denounced something and if the denunciations of one speaker were not sufficiently picturesque and lively you passed on to the next indeed you might always judge afar off where the best denouncing was going on by the size of the crowds at least until the hat went round it was at mile end waste that a good notion occurred to bill napper he had always vastly admired the denunciations of one speakera little man shabbier if anything than most of the others and surpassingly tempestuous of antic he was an unattached orator not confining himself to any particular creed but denouncing whatever seemed advisable considering the audience and circumstances he was always denouncing something somewhere and was ever in a crisis that demanded the circulation of a hat bill esteemed this speaker for his versatility as well as for the freshness of his abuse and bills sudden notion was to engage him for private addresses the orator did not take kindly to the proposal at first strongly suspecting something in the nature of guy or kid but a serious assurance of a shilling for an occasional hour and the payment of one in advance brought him over after this squire napper never troubled to go to mile end waste he sat at ease in his parlor with his pot on the piano while the orator with another pot on the mantelpiece stood up and denounced to order tip us the teetotal an downwiththepublicouse bill would request and the orator his name was minns would oblige in that line till most of the strong phrases had run out and had begun to recur then bill would say now come the rights o labor caper whereupon minns would take a pull at the pot and proceed to denounce capital bill napper applauding or groaning at the pauses provided for those purposes and so on with whatever subjects appealed to the patrons fancy it was a fancy that sometimes put the orators invention to grievous straits but for bill the whole performance was peculiarly privileged and dignified for to have an orator gesticulating and speechifying all to ones self on ones own order and choice of subject is a thing not given to all men one day minns turned up not having been invited with a friend bill did not take to the friend he was a lankjawed man with a shifty eye who smiled as he spoke and showed a top row of irregular and dirty teeth this friend minns explained was a journalista writer of newspapers and between them they had an idea which idea the friend set forth everybody he said who knew the history of mr napper admired his sturdy independence and democratic simplicity he was of the people and not ashamed of it well no i aint proud bill interjected wondering what was coming with all the advantages of wealth he preferred to remain one of the people living among them plainly conforming to their simple habits and sympathizing with their sorrows this chap thought bill wants to be took on to hold forth turn about with the other and hes showing his capers but i aint on it it was the knowledge of these things so greatly to mr nappers honor that had induced minns and minnss friend to place before him a means by which he might do the cause of toiling humanity a very great service a new weekly paper was wantedwanted very badly a paper that should rear its head on behalf of the downtrodden toilers and make its mighty voice heard with dread by the bloated circles of class and privilege that paper would prove a marvellously paying investment to its proprietor bringing him enormous profits every week he would have a vast fortune in that paper alone besides the glory and satisfaction of striking the great blow that should pave the way to the emancipation of the masses and the destruction of the vile system of society whose whole and sole effect was the accumulation of wealth in the hands of the grasping few being professionally disengaged at present he the speaker in conjunction with his friend minns had decided to give mr napper the opportunity of becoming its proprietor bill was more than surprised he was also a little bewildered what he said after two draws of his pipe dye mean you want me to go in the printin line that was not at all necessary the printing would be done by contract mr napper would only have to find the money the paper with a couple of thousand pounds behind itor even one thousand minnss friend read a difficulty in bills facewould be established forever even five hundred would do and many successful papers had been floated with no more than a couple of hundred or so suppose they said just a couple of hundred to go on with till the paper found its legs and began to pay how would that do bill napper smoked a dozen whiffs then he said an what should i ave to do with the two undred pound buy anythink not directly that the promoters explained it would finance the thingjust finance it ood ave the money then that was perfectly simple it would simply be handed over to minns and his friend and they would attend to all the details bill napper continued to smoke then beginning with a slight chuckle at the back of his throat he said wen i got my money i went to a lawyers for it there was two lawyersone layin low there was two fustrate lawyers an a lot o clurkscity clurksan a bank an all an they couldnt ave me not for a single fardennot a farden try an fiddle as they would well arter that it aint much good you atryin it on is it and he chuckled again louder minns was indignant and minnss friend was deeply hurt both protested bill napper laughed aloud awright youll do he said youll do my abits may be simple but they aint as simple as all that haha ere ave a drinkyou aint done no arm an i aint spiteful haha it was on an evening a fortnight after this that as bill napper lay very full of beer and rather sleepy on the bedthe rest of his household being out of doorsa ladder was quietly planted against the outer wall from the backyard bill heard nothing until the window already a little open was slowly pushed up and from the twilight outside a head and an arm plunged into the thicker darkness of the room and a hand went feeling along the edge of the chest of drawers by the window bill rolled over on the bed and reached from the floor one of a pair of heavy ironset boots taking the toe in his right hand and grasping the footrail of the bedstead with his left he raised himself on his knees and brought the bootheel down heavily on the intruding head there was a gasp and the first breath of a yell and head arm shoulders and body vanished with a bump and a rattle bill napper let the boot fall dropped back on the bed and took no further heed neither minns nor his friend ever came back again but for some time after at victoria park minns inciting an outraged populace to rise and sweep police and army from the earth was able to point to an honorable scar on his own forehead the proof and sign of a police bludgeoning at tower hillor trafalgar square v things went placidly on for near ten months many barrels of beer had come in full and been sent empty away also the missis had got a gold watch and divers new bonnets and gowns some by gift from bill some by applying privily to the drawer her private collection of bottles too had been cleared out twice and was respectable for the third time everybody was not friendly with her and one bonnet had been torn off her head by a neighbor who disliked her airs so it stood when on a certain morning bill being minded to go out found but two shillings in his pocket he called upstairs to the missis as was his custom in such a pass asking her to fetch a sovereign or two when she came down and as she was long in coming he went up himself the missis left the room hurriedly and bill after raking out every corner of the drawer which he himself had not opened for some time saw not a single coin the missis had no better explanation than that there must have been thieves in the house some time lately a suggestion deprived of some value by the subsequent protest that bill couldnt expect money to last forever and that he had had the last three days ago in the end there was a vehement row and the missis was severely thumped the thumping over bill napper conceived a great idea perhaps after all the lawyers had done him by understating the amount his brother had left it might well have been five hundred poundsa thousand poundsanything probably it was and the lawyers had had the difference plainly three hundred pounds was a suspiciously small sum to inherit from a welltodo brother he would go to the lawyers and demand the rest of his money he would not reveal his purpose till he saw the lawyers face to face and then he would make his demand suddenly so that surprise and consternation should overwhelm and betray them he would give them to understand that he had complete evidence of the whole swindle in any case he could lose nothing he went after carefully preparing his part and was turned out by a policeman after that mused squire napper going home i suppose id better see about getting a job at allens again he cant but make me gaffer considering ive been a man of property a poor stick mrs jennings or jinnins as the neighbors would have it ruled absolutely at home when she took so much trouble as to do anything at all therewhich was less often than might have been as for robert her husband he was a poor stick said the neighbors and yet he was a man with enough of hardihood to remain a nonunionist in the erectors shop at maidments all the years of his service no mean test of a mans fortitude and resolution as many a sufferer for independent opinion might testify the truth was that bob never grew out of his courtshipblindness mrs jennings governed as she pleased stayed out or came home as she chose and cooked a dinner or didnt as her inclination stood thus it was for ten years during which time there were no children and bob bore all things uncomplaining cooking his own dinner when he found none cooked and sewing on his own buttons then of a sudden came children till in three years there were three and bob jennings had to nurse and to wash them as often as not mrs jennings at this time was what is called rather a fine woman a woman of large scale and full development whose slatternly habit left her coarse black hair to tumble in snakelocks about her face and shoulders half the day who clad in halfhooked clothes bore herself notoriously and unabashed in her fulness and of whom ill things were said regarding the lodger the gossips had their excuse the lodger was an irregular young cabinetmaker who lost quarters and halves and whole days who had been seen abroad with his landlady what time bob jennings was putting the children to bed at home who on his frequent holidays brought in much beer which he and the woman shared while bob was at work to carry the tale to bob would have been a thankless errand for he would have none of anybodys sympathy even in regard to miseries plain to his eye but the thing got about in the workshop and there his days were made bitter at home things grew worse to return at halfpast five and find the children still undressed screaming hungry and dirty was a matter of habit to get them food to wash them to tend the cuts and bumps sustained through the day of neglect before lighting a fire and getting tea for himself were matters of daily duty ah he said to his sister who came at intervals to say plain things about mrs jennings you shouldnt go for to set a man agin is wife jin melier don like work i know but thats nachral to er she ought to married a swell stead o me she might a done easy if she liked bein sich a fine gal but shes goodarted is melier an she cant elp bein a bit thoughtless whereat his sister called him a fool it was her customary goodby at such times and took herself off bob jenningss intelligence was sufficient for his common needs but it was never a vast intelligence now under a daily burden of dull misery it clouded and stooped the base wit of the workshop he comprehended less and realized more slowly than before and the gaffer cursed him for a sleepy dolt mrs jennings ceased from any pretence of housewifery and would sometimes sitperchance not quite soberwhile bob washed the children in the evening opening her mouth only to express her contempt for him and his establishment and to make him understand that she was sick of both once exasperated by his quietness she struck at him and for a moment he was another man dont do that melier he said else i might forget myself his manner surprised his wife and it was such that she never did do that again so was bob jennings without a friend in the world except his sister who chid him and the children who squalled at him when his wife vanished with the lodger the clock a shade of wax flowers bobs best boots which fitted the lodger and his silver watch bob had returned as usual to the dirt and the children and it was only when he struck a light that he found the clock was gone mummy tooked ve tock said milly the eldest child who had followed him in from the door and now gravely observed his movements she tooked ve tock an went tata an she tooked ve fyowers bob lit the paraffin lamp with the green glass reservoir and carried it and its evil smell about the house some things had been turned over and others had gone plainly all meliers clothes were gone the lodger was not in and under his bedroom window where his box had stood there was naught but an oblong patch of conspicuously clean wallpaper in a muddle of doubt and perplexity bob found himself at the front door staring up and down the street divers womenneighbors stood at their doors and eyed him curiously for mrs webster moralist opposite had not watched the days proceedings nor those of many other days for nothing nor had she kept her story to herself he turned back into the house a vague notion of what had befallen percolating feebly through his bewilderment i dunnoi dunno he faltered rubbing his ear his mouth was dry and he moved his lips uneasily as he gazed with aimless looks about the walls and ceiling presently his eyes rested on the child and milly he said decisively come an ave yer face washed he put the children to bed early and went out in the morning when his sister came because she had heard the news in common with everybody else he had not returned bob jennings had never lost more than two quarters in his life but he was not seen at the workshop all this day his sister stayed in the house and in the evening at his regular homingtime he appeared haggard and dusty and began his preparations for washing the children when he was made to understand that they had been already attended to he looked doubtful and troubled for a moment presently he said i aint found er yet jin i was in opes she might a bin back by this ii dont expect shell be very long she was alwis a bit larky was melier but very goodarted his sister had prepared a strenuous lecture on the theme of i told you so but the man was so broken so meek and so plainly unhinged in his faculties that she suppressed it instead she gave him comfortable talk and made him promise in the end to sleep that night and take up his customary work in the morning he did these things and could have worked placidly enough had he been alone but the tale had reached the workshop and there was no lack of brutish chaff to disorder him this the decenter men would have no part in and even protested against but the illconditioned kept their way till at the cry of bell o when all were starting for dinner one of the worst shouted the cruellest gibe of all bob jennings turned on him and knocked him over a scrapheap a shout went up from the hurrying workmen with a chorus of serve ye right and the fallen joker found himself awkwardly confronted by the shop bruiser but bob had turned to a corner and buried his eyes in the bend of his arm while his shoulders heaved and shook he slunk away home and stayed there walking restlessly to and fro and often peeping down the street from the window when at twilight his sister came again he had become almost cheerful and said with some briskness im agoin to meet er jin at seven i know where shell be waitin he went upstairs and after a little while came down again in his best black coat carefully smoothing a tall hat of obsolete shape with his pockethandkerchief i aint wore it for years he said i ought to a wore itit might a pleased er she used to say she wouldnt walk with me in no otherwhen i used to meet er in the evenin at seven oclock he brushed assiduously and put the hat on id better ave a shave round the corner as i go along he added fingering his stubbly chin he received as one not comprehending his sisters persuasion to remain at home but when he went she followed at a little distance after his penny shave he made for the main road where companykeeping couples walked up and down all evening he stopped at a church and began pacing slowly to and fro before it eagerly looking out each way as he went his sister watched him for nearly half an hour and then went home in two hours more she came back with her husband bob was still there walking to and fro ullo bob said his brotherinlaw come along ome an get to bed theres a good chap youll be awright in the mornin she aint turned up bob complained or else ive missed er this is the reglar placewhere i alwis used to meet er but shell come tomorrer she used to

jennings howbeit depressed and anxious was always confident somethinks prevented er tonight he would say but shell come tomorrer ill buy a blue tie tomorrershe used to like me in a blue tie i wont miss er tomorrer ill come a little earlier so it went the black coat grew ragged in the service and hobbledehoys finding him safe sport smashed the tall hat over his eyes time after time he wept over the hat and straightened it as best he might was she coming night after night and night and night but tomorrow a conversion there are some poor criminals that never have a chance circumstances are against them from the first as they explain with tears to sympathetic missionreaders circumstances had always been against scuddy lond the gun the word gun it may be explained is a friendly synonym for thief his first name was properly james but that had been long forgotten scuddy meant nothing in particular was derived from nothing and was not apparently the invention of any distinct person still it was commonly his only name and most of his acquaintances had also nicknames of similarly vague origin scuddy was a man of fine feelings capable of a most creditable hour of rapturous misery after hearing perhaps at a singsong put me in my little bed or any other ditty that was rank enough in sentiment wherefore the missionreaders never really despaired of him he was a small shabby man of twentysix but looking younger with a runaway chin a sharp yellow face and tremulously sly eyes with but faint traces of hair on his face he had a great deal of it straight and ragged and dirty on his head scuddy londs misfortunes began early temptation had prevailed against him when he was at school but that was nothing he became errand boy in a grocers shop and complications with the till brought him a howling penitent to the police court here while his mother hid her head in the waitingroom he set forth the villainy of older boys who had prompted him to sin and got away with no worse than a lecture on the evils of bad company so that a philanthropist found him a better situation at a distance where the evil influence could no longer move him here he stayed a good whilelonger than some who had been there before him but who had to leave because of vanishing postal orders nevertheless the postal orders still went and in the end he confessed to another magistrate and fervently promised to lead a better life if his false start were only forgiven betting he protested was this time the author of his fall and as that pernicious institution was clearly to blame for the unhappy young mans ruin the lamenting magistrate let him off with a simple month in consideration of his misfortune and the intercession of his employer who had never heard of the grocer and his till after his month scuddy went regularly into business as a lobcrawler that is to say he returned to his first love the till not narrowly to any individual till but broadmindedly to the till as a general institution to be approached in unattended shops by stealthy grovelling on the belly this he did until he perceived the greater security and comfort of waiting without while a small boy did the actual work within from this and with this he ventured on peterclaiming laying hands nonchalantly on unconsidered parcels and bags at railway stations until a day when bearing a fat portmanteau he ran against its owner by the door of a refreshment bar this time the responsibility lay with drink strong drink he declared with deep emotion had been his ruin he dated his downfall from the day when a false friend persuaded him to take a social glass he would still have been an honest upright selfrespecting young man but for the cursed drink from that moment he would never touch it more the case was met with three months with hard labor and for all that scuddy lond had so clearly pointed out the culpability of drink he had to do the drag himself but the missionreaders were comforted for clearly there was hope for one whose eyes were so fully opened to the causes of his degradation after the drag scuddy for long made a comfortable living free from injurious overwork in the several branches of lobcrawling and peterclaiming with an occasional deviation into parlorjumping it is true that this last did sometimes involve unpleasant exertion when the window was high and the boy heavy to bunk up and it was necessary at times to run but scuddy was out of work and hunger drove him to anything so long as it was light and not too risky and it is marvellous to reflect how much may be picked up in the streets and at the sidedoors of london and the suburbs without danger or vulgar violence and so scuddys life went on with occasional misfortunes in the way of a moon or another drag or perhaps a sixer and the missionreaders never despaired because the real cause was always hunger or thirst or betting or a sudden temptation or something quite exceptionalnever anything like real hardened unblushing wickedness and the man himself was always truly penitent he made such touching references to his innocent childhood and was so grateful for good advice or anything else you might give him one bold attempt scuddy made to realize his desire for better things he resolved to depart from his evil ways and to become a narka coppers narkwhich is a police spy or informer the work was not hard there was no imprisonment and he would make amends for the past but hardly had he begun his narking when some of the kate street mob dropped on him in brick lane and bashed him full sore this would never do so once more implacable circumstance drove him to his old courses and there was this added discomfort that no boy would parlorjump nor dip the lob for him indeed they bawled aloud yah scuddy lond the coppers nark so that the hand of all flower and dean street was against him scuddy grew very sad these and other matters were heavy upon his heart on an evening when with nothing in his pockets but the piece of coal that he carried for luck he turned aimlessly up bakers row things were very bad it was as though the whole world knew himand watched shopkeepers stood frowningly at their doors people sat defiantly on piles of luggage at the railway stations and there was never a peter to touch for all the areas were empty and there were no sidedoors left unguarded where failing the more desirable wedge one might claim a pair or two of daisies put out for cleaning all the hundred trifling things that commonly come freely to hand in a mile or two of streets were somehow swept out of the worlds economy and scuddy tramped into bakers row in melting mood why were things so hard for some and so easy for others it was not as though he were to blamehe a man of feeling and sentiment why were others living comfortable lives unvexed of any dread of the police and apart from that why did other gonophs get lucky touches for half a century of quids at a time while he but there the world was one brutal oppression and he was its most pitiable victim and he slunk along dank with the pathos of things at a corner a group was standing about a woman whose voice was uplifted to a mans accompaniment on a standaccordion scuddy listened she sang with a harsh tremble an sang a song of ome sweet ome the song that reached my art ome ome sweet sweet ome she sang the song of ome sweet ome the song that reached my art here indeed was something in tune with scuddys fine feelings he looked up from the darkening sky the evening star winked through the smoke from a factory chimney from anear came an exquisite scent of saveloys plaintive influences all he tried to think of ome himselfof ome strictly in the abstract so that it might reach his art he stood for some minutes torpid and mindless oozing with sentiment till the song ended and he went on fine feelingsfine he crossed the road and took a turning a lame old woman sat in a recess selling trotters where a dark passage led back to a missionhall about the opening a man hoveredfervent watchfuland darted forth on passersby he laid his hand on scuddys shoulder and said my dear friend will you come in an ear the word of the lord jesus christ scuddy turned the sound of an harmonium and many strenuous voices came faintly down the passage it was his mood why not give his fine feelings another little run he would he would go in trotters quavered the lame old woman looking up wistfully two a penny two a penny but no he went up the passage and she turned patiently to her board along the passage the singing grew louder and burst on his ears unchecked as he pushed open the door at the end oosoever will oosoever will send the proclamation over vale an ill tis a lovin father calls the wandrer ome oosoever will may come a man by the door knew him at once for a stranger and found him a seat the hymn went quavering to an end and the preacher in charge a small brighteyed man with rebellious hair and a surprisingly deep voice announced that brother spyers would offer a prayer the man prayed with his every faculty he was a sturdy rednecked artisan great of hand and wiry of beard a smith perhaps or a bricklayer he spread his arms wide and his head thrown back brought forth with passion and pain his fervid disordered sentences as he went on his throat swelled and convulsed in desperate knots and the sweat hung thick on his face he called for grace that every unsaved soul there might come to the fold and believe that night or if not all then someeven a few that at least one only one poor soul might be plucked as a brand from the burning and as he flung together with clumsy travail his endless formless unconsidered vehemences of uttermost cockney the man stood transfigured admirable from here and there came deep amens then more with gasps groans and sobs scuddy lond carried away luxuriously on a tide of grievous sensation groaned with the others the prayer ended in a chorus of ejaculations then there was a hymn somebody stuffed an open hymnbook into scuddys hand but he scarce saw it abandoning himself to the mesmeric influence of the many who were singing about him he plunged and revelled in a debauch of emotion he heard he even joined in but understood nothing for his feelings filled him to overflowing i ave a robe tis resplendent in witeness awaitin in glory my wonderin view oh wen i receive it all shinin in brightness dear friend could i see you receivin one too for you i am prayin for you i am prayin for you i am prayin im prayin for you the hymn ceased all sat down and the preacher began his discourse quietly at first and then though in a different way with all the choking fervor of the man who had prayed for the preacher was fluent as well as zealous and his words except when emotion stayed them poured in a torrent he preached faithsalvation in faithdeclaiming beseeching commanding comecome now is the appointed time only believeonly come onlyonly come to impassioned broken entreaty he added sudden command and the menace of eternity but broke away pitifully again in urgent pleadings pantings gasps pointing above spreading his arms abroad stretching them forth imploringly come only come sobs broke out in more than one place a woman bowed her head and rocked while her shoulders shook again brother spyerss face was alight with joy a tremor a throe of the senses ran through the assembly as through a single body the preacher nearing his peroration rose to a last frenzy of adjuration then ending in a steadier key he summoned any to stand forth who had found grace that night his bright strenuous eyes were on the sobbers charging them drawing them first rose the woman who had bowed her head her face uncovered but distorted and twitching still weeping but rapt and unashamed she tottered out between the seats and sank at last on the vacant form in front next a child a little maid of ten lanklegged and outgrown of her short skirts her eyes squeezed down on a tight knot of pockethandkerchief crying wildly brokenheartedly sobbed and blundered over seatcorners and toes and sat down forlorn and solitary at the other end of the form and after her came scuddy lond why he knew notnor cared in the full enjoyment of a surfeit of indefinite emotion tearful rapturous he had accepted the command put on him by the preacher and he had come forth walking on clouds regenerate compact of fine feelings there was a short prayer of thanks and then a final hymn ring the bells of eaven there is joy today for a soul returnin from the wild scuddy felt a curious equable lightness of spiritsa serene cheerfulness his emotional orgasm was spent and in its place was a numb calm pleasant enough glory glory ow the angels sing glory glory ow the loud arps ring tis the ransomed army like a mighty sea pealin forth the anthem of the free the service ended the congregation trooped forth into the evening but scuddy sat where he was for the preacher wanted a few words with his converts ere he would let them go he shook hands with scuddy lond and spoke with grave smiling confidence about his soul brother spyers also shook hands with him and bespoke his return on sunday in the cool air of the empty passage scuddys ordinary faculties began to assert themselves still in an atmosphere of calm cheer fine feelingsfine and as he turned the piece of coal in his pocket he reflected that after all the day had not been altogether unluckynot in every sense a blank emerging into the street he saw that the lame old woman who was almost alone in view had risen on her crutch and turned her back to roll her white cloth over her remaining trotters on the ledge behind stood her little pile of coppers just reckoned scuddy londs practised eye took the case in a flash with two long tiptoed steps he reached the coppers lifted them silently and hurried away up the street he did not run for the woman was lame and had not heard him no decidedly the day had not been blank for here was a hot supper all that messuage i all that messuage dwellinghouse and premises now standing on part of the said parcel of ground was the phrase in the assignment of lease although it only meant number twentyseven mulberry street old ford containing five rooms and a washhouse and sharing a dirty front wall with the rest of the street on the same side the phrase was a very fine one and with others more intricate lent not a little to the triumph and the perplexity the transaction filled old jack randall withal the business was a conjunction of purchase and mortgage whereby old jack randall having thirty pounds of his own had after halfanhour of helpless stupefaction in a solicitors office in cornhill bought a house for two hundred and twenty pounds and paid ten pounds for stamps and lawyers fees the remaining two hundred pounds had been furnished by the indubitable perpetual building society on the security of a mortgage and the loan with its interest was to be repaid in monthly instalments of two pounds and fourpence during twelve years thus old jack randall designed to provide for the wants and infirmities of age and the outright purchase he argued was a thing of mighty easy accomplishment for the house let at nine shillings a week which was twentythree pounds eight shillings a year and the mortgage instalments with the ground rent of three pounds a year only came to twentyseven pounds four leaving a difference of three pounds sixteen which would be more than covered by a saving of eighteenpence a week certainly not a difficult saving for a man with a regular job and no young family who had put by thirty pounds in little more than three years thus on many evenings old jack randall and his wife would figure out the thing wholly forgetting rates and taxes and repairs old jack stood on the pavement of cornhill and stared at the traffic when he remembered that mrs randall was by his side he said well mother we done it and his wife replied yus fa youre a lanlord now hereat he chuckled and began to walk eastward for to be a landlord is the ultimate dignity there is no trouble no anxiety in the world if you are a landlord and there is no work you just walk round on monday mornings or maybe you even drive in a trap and you collect your rents eight and six or nine shillings or ten shillings as the case may be and there you are it is better than shopkeeping because the money comes by itself and it is infinitely more genteel also it is better than having money in a bank and drawing interest because the house cannot run away as is the manner of directors nor dissolve into nothingness as is the way of banks and here was he jack randall walking down leadenhall street a landlord he mounted a tramcar at aldgate and all things were real ii old jack had always been old jack since at fourteen young jack had come prentice in the same engineturners shop young jack was a married man himself now at another shop and old jack was near fifty and had set himself toward thrift all along whitechapel road mile end road and bow road he considered the shops and houses from the tramroof madly estimating rents and values near bow road end he and his wife alighted and went inspecting twentyseven mulberry street once more old jack remarked that the scraper was of a different shape from that he had carried in his mind since their last examination and he mentioned it to mrs randall who considered the scraper of fact rather better than the scraper of memory they walked to and fro several times judging the door and three windows from each side of the street and in the end they knocked with a purpose of reporting the completed purchase but the tenants wife peeping from behind a blind and seeing only the people who had already come spying about the house some two or three times retired to the back and went on with her weekly washing they waited a little repeated the knock and then went away the whole day was off and a stroll in the tower hamlets cemetery was decided on victoria park was as near but was not in the direction of home moreover there was less interest for mrs randall in victoria park because there were no funerals in the cemetery mrs randall solaced herself and old jack with the more sentimental among the inscriptions in the poor part whose miscellaneous graves are marked by mounds alone they stopped to look at a very cheap funeral lor jack mrs randall said under her breath with a nudge wot a common caufin why the bodys very nigh adroppin through the bottom the thin underboard had in fact a bulge pore chap aint it shockin the ignominy of a funeral with no feathers was a thing accepted of course but the horror of a cheap coffin they had never realized till now they turned away in the main path they met the turgid funeral of a bow road bookmaker after the dozen mourning coaches there were cars and pony traps and behind these came a fagend of carts and donkeybarrows ahead of all was the glazed hearse with attendants in weepers and by it full of the pride of artistry walked the undertaker himself now that said old jack is somethin like a caufin it was heavy and polished and beset with bright fittings ah sighed his missis aint it lovely the hearse drew up at the chapel door where the undertaker turned to the rightabout and placidly surveyed the movements of his forces mrs randall murmured again lovelylovely and kept her eyes on the coffin then she edged gently up to the undertaker and whispered what would that kind o caufin be called mister the undertaker looked at her from the sides of his eyes and answered briskly twoinch polished oak solid extry brass fittins mrs randall returned to old jacks side and repeated the words that must cost a lot she said what a thing though to be certain you wont be buried in a trumpery box like that other ah its well to be rich old jack gazed on the coffin and thought surely a landlord if anybody was entitled to indulge in an expensive coffin all day he had nursed a fancy that some small indulgence something a little heavier than usual in the matter of expense would be proper to celebrate the occasion but he reflected that his savings were gone and his pockets no fuller than had always been their wednesday wont though of course in that matter the future would be different the bearers carried the coffin into the chapel and mrs randall turned away among the graves old jack put his hands in his pockets and looking at the ground said that was a nobby caufin mother wasnt it whereunto mrs randall murmured lovelylovely yet again old jack walked a little further and asked twoinch polished oak e said didnt e solid an extry brass fittins beautiful ill remember it thats what you shall ave if it appens you go fust there and old jack sat on the guardchain of a flowery grave with the air of one giving a handsome order me git out look at the expense matter o circumstances look at jenkinss gardens jenkins was a benchand at the limited got is ouses one under another through building sieties that there caufin ud be none too dear for im were beginnin an i promise you that same if youd like it like it the missis ejaculated course i should wouldnt you wy yus any one ud prefer somethin a bit nobby an thick and the missis reciprocated old jacks promise in case he died first if a twoinch polished oak solid could be got for everything she had to offer and teatime approaching they made well pleased for home iii in two days old jack was known as a landlord all about on the third day which was saturday young jack called to borrow half a sovereign but succeeded only to the extent of five shillings work was slack with him and three days of it was all he had had that week this had happened before and he had got on as best he could but now with a father buying houseproperty it was absurd to economize for lack of half a sovereign when he brought the five shillings home his wife asked why he had not thrown them at his fathers head a course of procedure which young jack confessed had never occurred to his mind stingy old unks she scolded agoin about buyin ouses an wont lend is own son ten shillins much good may all is money do im with is ateful mean ways this was the beginning of old jacks estrangement from his relatives for young jacks missis expressed her opinion in other places and young jack was soon ready to share it rigidly abstaining from another attempt at a loan though he never repaid the five shillings in the course of the succeeding week two of his shopmates took old jack aside at different times to explain that the loan of a pound or two would make the greatest imaginable difference to the whole course of their future lives while the temporary absence of the money would be imperceptible to a capitalist like himself when he roundly declared that he had as few loose sovereigns as themselves he was set down as an uncommon liar as well as a wretched old miser this was the beginning of old jacks unpopularity in the workshop iv he took a halfday off to receive the first weeks rent in state and mrs randall went with him he showed his written authority from the last landlord and the tenants wife paid over the sum of nine shillings giving him at the same time the rentbook to sign and a slip of written paper this last was a weeks notice to terminate the tenancy were very well satisfied with the ouse the tenants wife said she was a painfully clean angular woman with a notable flavor of yellow soap and scrubbingbrush about her but my usband finds it too far to get to an from albert docks mornin and night so were goin to west am and she politely ejected her visitors by opening the door and crowding them through it the want of a tenant was a contingency that old jack had never contemplated as long as it lasted it would necessitate the setting by of ten and sixpence a week for the building society payments and the groundrent this was serious it meant knocking off some of the butchers meat all the beer and tobacco and perhaps a little firing old jack resolved to waste no more halfdays in collecting but to send his missis on the following monday therefore while the tenants wife kept a sharp eye on the man who was piling a greengrocers van with chairs and tables mrs randall fixed a to let bill in the front window in the leaves of the rentbook she found another thing of chagrin to wit a notice demanding payment of poor highway and general rates to the amount of one pound eighteen and sevenpence now no thought of rates and taxes had ever vexed the soul of old jack of course he might have known that his own landlord paid the rates for his house but indeed he had never once thought of the thing being content with faithfully paying the rent and troubling no more about it that night was one of dismal wakefulness for old jack and his missis if he had understood the transaction at the lawyers office he would have known that a large proportion of the sum due had been allowed him in the final adjustment of payment to the day and if he had known something of the ways of ratecollecting he would have understood that payment was not expected for at least a month as it was the glories of leasepossession grew dim in his eyes and a landlord seemed a poor creature spending his substance to keep roofs over the heads of strangers v on wednesday afternoon a man called about taking the house and returned in the evening when old jack was home he was a largefeatured quickeyed man with a loud harsh voice and a selfassertive manner quickly old jack recognized him as a speaker he had heard at certain streetcorners a man who was secretary or delegate or that sort of thing to something that old jack had forgotten he began with the announcement i am joe parsons delivered with a stare for emphasis and followed by a pause to permit assimilation old jack had some recollection of the name but it was indefinite he wondered whether or not he should address the man as sir considering the street speeches and the evident importance of the name but then after all he was a landlord himself so he only said yus i am joe parsons the man repeated and im looking for a ouse there was another pause which lasted till old jack felt obliged to say something so he said yus again im looking for a ouse the man repeated and if we can arrange things satisfactory i might take yours mr joe parsons was far above haggling about the rent but he had certain ideas as to painting and repairs that looked expensive in the end old jack promised the paint a touchup privily resolving to do the work himself in his evenings and on the whole mr joe parsons was wonderfully easy to come to terms with considering his eminent public character and anything in the nature of a reference in his case would have been absurd as himself observed his name was enough for that vi old jack did the painting and the new tenant took possession when mrs randall called for the first week a draggletailed little woman with a black eye meekly informed her that mr parsons was not at home and had left no money nor any message as to the rent this was awkward because the first building society instalment would be due before next rentdayto say nothing of the rates but it would never do to offend mr parsons so the money was scraped together by heroic means the missis produced an unsuspected twelve and sixpence from a gallipot on the kitchen dresser and the first instalment was paid mrs randall called twice at mulberry street next rentday but nobody answered her knocks old jack possessed by a misty notion born of use that rent was constitutionally demandable only on monday morning called no more for a week but on thursday evening a stout little stranger with a bald head which he wiped continually came to the randalls to ask if the tenant of twentyseven mulberry street was mr joe parsons assured that it was he nodded said thanks thats all wiped his head again and started to go then he paused and pay his rent regular he asked old jack hesitated ah thought so said the little stranger hes a wrong un ive got a bit o paper for im and he clapped on his hat with the handkerchief in it and vanished vii old jack felt unhappy for a landlord he and the missis reproached themselves for not asking the little stranger certain questions but he had gone next monday morning old jack took another halfday and went to mulberry street himself from appearances he assured himself that a belief entertained by his missis that the upper part of his house was being sublet was well founded he watched awhile from a corner until a dirty child kicked at the door and it was opened then he went across and found the draggletailed woman who had answered mrs randall before in every respect the same to look at except that not one eye was black but two old jack with some abruptness demanded his rent of her addressing her as mrs parsons without disclaiming the name she pleaded with meek uneasiness that mr parsons really wasnt at home and she didnt know when to expect him at last finding this ineffectual she produced four and sixpence begging him with increasing agitation to take that on account and call again old jack took the money and called again at seven custom or law or whatnot he would wait for no monday morning now the door was open and a group of listening children stood about it from within came a noise of knocks and thuds and cursessometimes a gurgle old jack asked a small boy whose position in the passage betokened residence what was going forward its the man downstairs said the boy agivin of it to is wife for payin awy the lodgers rent at this moment mr joe parsons appeared in the passage the children who had once or twice commented in shouts dispersed ive come for my rent said old jack mr joe parsons saw no retreat so he said rent aint you ad it i dont bother about things in the ouse come again when my wifes in she is in rejoined old jack an youve been alandin of er for payin me what little she as come you pay me what you owe me and take a weeks notice now i want my house kep respectable mr joe parsons had no other shift you be damned he said git out what gasped old jackfor to tell a landlord to get out of his own house what why git out y ought to know better than comin ere askin for money you aint earnt aint earnt what dye mean what i say y aint earnt it its you blasted lanlords as sucks the blood o the workers you go an work for your money old jack was confounded whywhathow dye think i can pay the rates an everythink i dont care youll ave to pay em an i wish they was igher they ought to be the same as the rent an that ud do away with fellers like you go on you do your damdest an get your rent best way you can but what about upstairs youre lettin it out an takin the rent there i thats none o your business git out will ye they had gradually worked over the doorstep and randall was on the pavement i shant pay an i shant go an ye can do what ye like so its no good your stoppinunless you want to fight ehdo ye and mr parsons put a foot over the threshold old jack had not fought for many years it was low for a landlord outside his own house it was indeed disgraceful but it was quite dark now and there was scarcely a soul in the street perhaps nobody would know and this man deserved something for himself he looked up the street again and then well i aint so young as i was he said but i wont disappoint ye come on mr joe parsons stepped within and slammed the door viii old jack went home less happy than ever he had no notion what to do difficulties of private life were often discussed and argued out in the workshop but there he had become too unpopular to ask for anything in the nature of sympathy or advice not only would he lend no money but he refused to stand treat on rent days also there was a collection on behalf of men on strike at another factory to which he gave nothing and he had expressed the strongest disapproval of an extension of that strike and his own intention to continue working if it happened for what would become of all his plans and his savings if his wages ceased wherefore there was no other man in the shop so unpopular as old jack and in a workshop unpopularity is a bad thing he called on a professional rentreceiver and sellerup this man knew mr joe parsons very well he never had furniture upon which a profitable distress might be levied but if he took lodgers and they were quiet people something might be got out of themif the job were made worth while but this was not at all what old jack wanted soon after it occurred to him to ask advice of the secretary of the building society this was a superficial young man an auctioneers clerk until evening who had no disposition to trouble himself about matters outside his duties still he went so far as to assure old jack that turning out a tenant who meant to stay was not a simple job if you didnt mind losing the rent it might be done by watching until the house was left ungarrisoned getting in putting the furniture into the street and keeping the tenant out with this forlorn hope old jack began to spend his leisure about mulberry street ineffectually for mrs parsons never came out while he was there once he saw the man and offered to forgive him the rent if he would leave a proposal which mr parsons received with ostentatious merriment at this old jacks patience gave out and he punched his tenant on the ear whereat the latter suddenly whitening in the face said something about the police and walked away at a good pace ix the strike extended as it was expected and designed to do the men at old jacks factory were ordered out and came excepting only old jack himself he was desperate since he had ventured on that cursed investment everything had gone wrong but he would not lose his savings if mere personal risk would preserve them moreover a man of fifty is not readily reemployed once out and as the firm was quite ready to keep one hand on to oil and see that things were in order old jack stayed making his comings and goings late to dodge the pickets and approaching subtly by a railwayarch stable and a lane thereunto it was not as yet a very great strike and with care these things could be done still he was sighted and chased twice and he knew that if the strike lasted and feeling grew hotter he would be attacked in his own house if only he could hold on through the strike and by hook or crook keep the outgoings paid he would attend to mr parsons afterward x one saturday afternoon as mrs randall was buying greens and potatoes old jack waiting without strolled toward a crowd standing about a speaker a near approach discovered the speaker to be mr joe parsons who was saying strike pay is little enough at the time of course but dont forget what it will lead to an strike pay does very well my friens when the party knows ow to lay it out an dont go passin it on to the lanlord dont give it away when the lanlord comes o monday mornin tell im polite as you like that theres nothink for im till theres more for you let the lanlord earn is money like me an you let the lanlords pay a bit towards this ere strike as well as the other blaggards the imployers lanlords gits quite enough out o you my feller workers when they dont git much out o you shouted old jack in his wrath and then felt sorry he had spoken for everybody looked at him and he knew some of the faces ho rejoined the speaker mincingly theres a gent there as seems to want to address this ere meetin praps youll ave the kindness to step up ere my friend an say wot you got to say plain and he looked full at old jack pointing with his finger old jack fidgeted wishing himself out of it you pay me what you owe me he growled sulkily as this ere individual after intruding isself on this peaceful meetin aint got anythink to say for isself pursued mr joe parsons ill explain things for im thats my lanlord that is look at im e comes angin round my door waitin for a chance to turn my pore wife an children out o ouse and ome e follers me in the street an tries to intimidate me e comes ere my feller workers as a spy an to try an poison your minds agin me as devotes my ole life to your intrests thats the sort o man thats the sort o lanlord e is but es somethink more than a greedy thievin overfed lanlord my friens an ill tell you wot es a dirty crawlin blackleg thats wot else e is es the ony man as wouldnt come out o maidments an es workin there now skulkin in an out in the darka dirty rat now you all know very well i wont ave nothink to do with any violence or intimidation its agin my principles although i know theres very often great temptation an its
