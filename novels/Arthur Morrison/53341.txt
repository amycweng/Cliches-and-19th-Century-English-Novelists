james rigby i shall here set down in language as simple and straightforward as i can command the events which followed my recent return to england and i shall leave it to others to judge whether or not my conduct has been characterised by foolish fear and ill considered credulity at the same time i have my own opinion as to what would have been the behaviour of any other man of average intelligence and courage in the same circumstances more especially a man of my exceptional upbringing and retired habits i was born in australia and i have lived there all my life till quite recently save for a single trip to europe as a boy in company with my father and mother it was then that i lost my father i was less than nine years old at the time but my memory of the events of that european trip is singularly vivid my father had emigrated to australia at the time of his marriage and had become a rich man by singularly fortunate speculations in land in and about sydney as a family we were most uncommonly self centred and isolated from my parents i never heard a word as to their relatives in england indeed to this day i do not as much as know what was the christian name of my grandfather i have often supposed that some serious family quarrel or great misfortune must have preceded or accompanied my father's marriage be that as it may i was never able to learn anything of my relatives either on my mother's or my father's side both parents however were educated people and indeed i fancy that their habit of seclusion must first have arisen from this circumstance since the colonists about them in the early days excellent people as they were were not as a class distinguished for extreme intellectual culture my father had his library stocked from england and added to by fresh arrivals from time to time and among his books he would pass most of his days taking however now and again an excursion with a gun in search of some new specimen to add to his museum of natural history which occupied three long rooms in our house by the lane cove river i was as i have said eight years of age when i started with my parents on a european tour and it was in the year we stayed but a short while in england at first arrival intending to make a longer stay on our return from the continent we made our tour taking italy last and it was here that my father encountered a dangerous adventure we were at naples and my father had taken an odd fancy for a picturesque looking ruffian who had attracted his attention by a complexion unusually fair for an italian and in whom he professed to recognise a likeness to tasso the poet this man became his guide in excursions about the neighbourhood of naples though he was not one of the regular corps of guides and indeed seemed to have no regular occupation of a definite sort tasso as my father always called him seemed a civil fellow enough and was fairly intelligent but my mother disliked him extremely from the first without being able to offer any very distinct reason for her aversion in the event her instinct was proved true illustration his assailant fell dead tasso his correct name by the way was tommaso marino persuaded my father that something interesting was to be seen at the astroni crater four miles west of the city or thereabout persuaded him moreover to make the journey on foot and the two accordingly set out all went well enough till the crater was reached and then in a lonely and broken part of the hill the guide suddenly turned and attacked my father with a knife his intention without a doubt being murder and the acquisition of the englishman's valuables fortunately my father had a hip pocket with a revolver in it for he had been warned of the danger a stranger might at that time run wandering in the country about naples he received a wound in the flesh of his left arm in an attempt to ward off a stab and fired at wrestling distance with the result that his assailant fell dead on the spot he left the place with all speed tying up his arm as he went sought the british consul at naples and informed him of the whole circumstances from the authorities there was no great difficulty an examination or two a few signatures some particular exertions on the part of the consul and my father was free so far as the officers of the law were concerned but while these formalities were in progress no less than three attempts were made on his life two by the knife and one by shooting and in each his escape was little short of miraculous for the dead ruffian marino had been a member of the dreaded camorra and the camorristi were eager to avenge his death to anybody acquainted with the internal history of italy more particularly the history of the old kingdom of naples the name of the camorra will be familiar enough it was one of the worst and most powerful of the many powerful and evil secret societies of italy and had none of the excuses for existence which have been from time to time put forward on behalf of the others it was a gigantic club for the commission of crime and the extortion of money so powerful was it that it actually imposed a regular tax on all food material entering naples a tax collected and paid with far more regularity than were any of the taxes due to the lawful government of the country the carrying of smuggled goods was a monopoly of the camorra a perfect organisation existing for the purpose throughout the kingdom the whole population was terrorised by this detestable society which had no less than twelve centres in the city of naples alone it contracted for the commission of crime just as systematically and calmly as a railway company contracts for the carriage of merchandise a murder was so much according to circumstances with extras for disposing of the body arson was dealt in profitably maimings and kidnappings were carried out with promptitude and despatch and any diabolical outrage imaginable was a mere matter of price one of the staple vocations of the concern was of course brigandage after the coming of victor emanuel and the fusion of italy into one kingdom the camorra lost some of its power but for a long time gave considerable trouble i have heard that in the year after the matters i am describing two hundred camorristi were banished from italy as soon as the legal forms were complied with my father received the broadest possible official hint that the sooner and the more secretly he left the country the better it would be for himself and his family the british consul too impressed it upon him that the law would be entirely unable to protect him against the machinations of the camorra and indeed it needed but little persuasion to induce us to leave for my poor mother was in a state of constant terror lest we were murdered together in our hotel so that we lost no time in returning to england and bringing our european trip to a close in london we stayed at a well known private hotel near bond street we had been but three days here when my father came in one evening with a firm conviction that he had been followed for something like two hours and followed very skilfully too more than once he had doubled suddenly with a view to confront the pursuers who he felt were at his heels but he had met nobody of a suspicious appearance the next afternoon i heard my mother telling my governess who was travelling with us of an unpleasant looking man who had been hanging about opposite the hotel door and who she felt sure had afterwards been following her and my father as they were walking my mother grew nervous and communicated her fears to my father he however pooh poohed the thing and took little thought of its meaning nevertheless the dogging continued and my father who was never able to fix upon the persons who caused the annoyance indeed he rather felt their presence by instinct as one does in such cases than otherwise grew extremely angry and had some idea of consulting the police then one morning my mother discovered a little paper label stuck on the outside of the door of the bedroom occupied by herself and my father it was a small thing circular and about the size of a sixpenny piece or even smaller but my mother was quite certain that it had not been there when she last entered the door the night before and she was much terrified for the label carried a tiny device drawn awkwardly in ink a pair of knives of curious shape crossed the sign of the camorra nobody knew anything of this label or how it came where it had been found my mother urged my father to place himself under the protection of the police at once but he delayed indeed i fancy he had a suspicion that the label might be the production of some practical joker staying at the hotel who had heard of his neapolitan adventure it was reported in many newspapers and designed to give him a fright but that very evening my poor father was found dead stabbed in a dozen places in a short quiet street not forty yards from the hotel he had merely gone out to buy a few cigars of a particular brand which he fancied at a shop two streets away and in less than half an hour of his departure the police were at the hotel door with the news of his death having got his address from letters in his pockets it is no part of my present design to enlarge on my mother's grief or to describe in detail the incidents that followed my father's death for i am going back to this early period of my life merely to make more clear the bearings of what has recently happened to myself it will be sufficient therefore to say that at the inquest the jury returned a verdict of wilful murder against some person or persons unknown that it was several times reported that the police had obtained a most important clue and that being so very naturally there was never any arrest we returned to sydney and there i grew up i should perhaps have mentioned ere this that my profession or i should rather say my hobby is that of an artist fortunately or unfortunately as you may please to consider it i have no need to follow any profession as a means of livelihood but since i was sixteen years of age my whole time has been engrossed in drawing and painting were it not for my mother's invincible objection to parting with me even for the shortest space of time i should long ago have come to europe to work and to study in the regular schools as it was i made shift to do my best in australia and wandered about pretty freely struggling with the difficulties of moulding into artistic form the curious australian landscape there is an odd desolate uncanny note in characteristic australian scenery which most people are apt to regard as of little value for the purposes of the landscape painter but with which i have always been convinced that an able painter could do great things so i did my feeble best two years ago my mother died my age was then twenty eight and i was left without a friend in the world and so far as i know without a relative i soon found it impossible any longer to inhabit the large house by the lane cove river it was beyond my simple needs and the whole thing was an embarrassment to say nothing of the associations of the house with my dead mother which exercised a painful and depressing effect on me so i sold the house and cut myself adrift for a year or more i pursued the life of a lonely vagabond in new south wales painting as well as i could its scattered forests of magnificent trees with their curious upturned foliage then miserably dissatisfied with my performance and altogether filled with a restless spirit i determined to quit the colony and live in england or at any rate somewhere in europe i would paint at the paris schools i promised myself and acquire that technical mastery of my material that i now felt the lack of the thing was no sooner resolved on than begun i instructed my solicitors in sydney to wind up my affairs and to communicate with their london correspondents in order that on my arrival in england i might deal with business matters through them i had more than half resolved to transfer all my property to england and to make the old country my permanent headquarters and in three weeks from the date of my resolve i had started i carried with me the necessary letters of introduction to the london solicitors and the deeds appertaining to certain land in south australia which my father had bought just before his departure on the fatal european trip there was workable copper in this land it had since been ascertained and i believed i might profitably dispose of the property to a company in london i found myself to some extent out of my element on board a great passenger steamer it seemed no longer possible for me in the constant association of shipboard to maintain that reserve which had become with me a second nature but so much had it become my nature that i shrank ridiculously from breaking it for grown man as i was it must be confessed that i was absurdly shy and indeed i fear little better than an overgrown schoolboy in my manner but somehow i was scarce a day at sea before falling into a most pleasant acquaintanceship with another passenger a man of thirty eight or forty whose name was dorrington he was a tall well built fellow rather handsome perhaps except for a certain extreme roundness of face and fulness of feature he had a dark military moustache and carried himself erect with a swing as of a cavalryman and his eyes had i think the most penetrating quality i ever saw his manners were extremely engaging and he was the only good talker i had ever met he knew everybody and had been everywhere his fund of illustration and anecdote was inexhaustible and during all my acquaintance with him i never heard him tell the same story twice nothing could happen not a bird could fly by the ship not a dish could be put on the table but dorrington was ready with a pungent remark and the appropriate anecdote and he never bored nor wearied one with all his ready talk he never appeared unduly obtrusive nor in the least egotistic mr horace dorrington was altogether the most charming person i had ever met moreover we discovered a community of taste in cigars by the way said dorrington to me one magnificent evening as we leaned on the rail and smoked rigby isn't a very common name in australia is it i seem to remember a case twenty years ago or more of an australian gentleman of that name being very badly treated in london indeed now i think of it i'm not sure that he wasn't murdered ever hear anything of it yes i said i heard a great deal unfortunately he was my father and he was murdered your father there i'm awfully sorry perhaps i shouldn't have mentioned it but of course i didn't know oh i replied that's all right it's so far back now that i don't mind speaking about it it was a very extraordinary thing altogether and then feeling that i owed dorrington a story of some sort after listening to the many he had been telling me i described to him the whole circumstances of my father's death ah said dorrington when i had finished i have heard of the camorra before this i know a thing or two about it indeed as a matter of fact it still exists not quite the widespread and open thing it once was of course and much smaller but pretty active in a quiet way and pretty mischievous they were a mighty bad lot those camorristi personally i'm rather surprised that you heard no more of them they were the sort of people who would rather any day murder three people than one and their usual idea of revenge went a good way beyond the mere murder of the offending party they had a way of including his wife and family and as many relatives as possible but at any rate you seem to have got off all right though i'm inclined to call it rather a piece of luck than otherwise then as was his invariable habit he launched into anecdote he told me of the crimes of the maffia that italian secret society larger even and more powerful than the camorra and almost as criminal tales of implacable revenge visited on father son and grandson in succession till the race was extirpated then he talked of the methods of the large funds at the disposal of the camorra and the maffia and of the cunning patience with which their schemes were carried into execution of the victims who had discovered too late that their most trusted servants were sworn to their destruction and of those who had fled to remote parts of the earth and hoped to be lost and forgotten but who had been shadowed and slain with barbarous ferocity in their most trusted hiding places wherever italians were there was apt to be a branch of one of the societies and one could never tell where they might or might not turn up the two italian forecastle hands on board at that moment might be members and might or might not have some business in hand not included in their signed articles i asked if he had ever come into personal contact with either of these societies or their doings with the camorra no though i know things about them that would probably surprise some of them not a little but i have had professional dealings with the maffia and that without coming off second best too but it was not so serious a case as your father's one of a robbery of documents and blackmail professional dealings i queried dorrington laughed yes he answered i find i've come very near to letting the cat out of the bag i don't generally tell people who i am when i travel about and indeed i don't always use my own name as i am doing now surely you've heard the name at some time or another i had to confess that i did not remember it but i excused myself by citing my secluded life and the fact that i had never left australia since i was a child ah he said of course we should be less heard of in australia but in england we're really pretty well known my partner and i but come now look me all over and consider and i'll give you a dozen guesses and bet you a sovereign you can't tell me my trade and it's not such an uncommon or unheard of trade neither guessing would have been hopeless and i said so he did not seem the sort of man who would trouble himself about a trade at all i gave it up well he said i've no particular desire to have it known all over the ship but i don't mind telling you you'd find it out probably before long if you settle in the old country that we are what is called private inquiry agents detectives secret service men whatever you like to call it indeed yes indeed and i think i may claim that we stand as high as any if not a trifle higher of course i can't tell you but you'd be rather astonished if you heard the names of some of our clients we have had dealings with certain royalties european and asiatic that would startle you a bit if i could tell them dorrington hicks is the name of the firm and we are both pretty busy men though we keep going a regiment of assistants and correspondents i have been in australia three months over a rather awkward and complicated matter but i fancy i've pulled it through pretty well and i mean to reward myself with a little holiday when i get back there now you know the worst of me and d h present their respectful compliments and trust that by unfailing punctuality and a strict attention to business they may hope to receive your esteemed commands whenever you may be so unfortunate as to require their services family secrets extracted cleaned scaled or stopped with gold special attention given to wholesale orders he laughed and pulled out his cigar case you haven't another cigar in your pocket he said or you wouldn't smoke that stump so low try one of these i took the cigar and lit it at my remainder ah then i said i take it that it is the practice of your profession that has given you such a command of curious and out of the way information and anecdote plainly you must have been in the midst of many curious affairs yes i believe you dorrington replied but as it happens the most curious of my experiences i am unable to relate since they are matters of professional confidence such as i can tell i usually tell with altered names dates and places one learns discretion in such a trade as mine as to your adventure with the maffia now is there any secrecy about that dorrington shrugged his shoulders no he said none in particular but the case was not particularly interesting it was in florence the documents were the property of a wealthy american and some of the maffia rascals managed to steal them it doesn't matter what the documents were that's a private matter but their owner would have parted with a great deal to get them back and the maffia held them for ransom but they had such a fearful notion of the american's wealth and of what he ought to pay that badly as he wanted the papers back he couldn't stand their demands and employed us to negotiate and to do our best for him i think i might have managed to get the things stolen back again indeed i spent some time thinking a plan over but i decided in the end that it wouldn't pay if the maffia were tricked in that way they might consider it appropriate to stick somebody with a knife and that was not an easy thing to provide against so i took a little time and went another way to work the details don't matter they're quite uninteresting and to tell you them would be to talk mere professional 'shop' there's a deal of dull and patient work to be done in my business anyhow i contrived to find out exactly in whose hands the documents lay he wasn't altogether a blameless creature and there were two or three little things that properly handled might have brought him into awkward complications with the law so i delayed the negotiations while i got my nets effectually round this gentleman who was the president of that particular branch of the maffia and when all was ready i had a friendly interview with him and just showed him my hand of cards they served as no other argument would have done and in the end we concluded quite an amicable arrangement on easy terms for both parties and my client got his property back including all expenses at about a fifth of the price he expected to have to pay that's all i learnt a deal about the maffia while the business lasted and at that and other times i learnt a good deal about the camorra too dorrington and i grew more intimate every day of the voyage till he knew every detail of my uneventful little history and i knew many of his own most curious experiences in truth he was a man with an irresistible fascination for a dull home bird like myself with all his gaiety he never forgot business and at most of our stopping places he sent off messages by cable to his partner as the voyage drew near its end he grew anxious and impatient lest he should not arrive in time to enable him to get to scotland for grouse shooting on the twelfth of august his one amusement it seemed was shooting and the holiday he had promised himself was to be spent on a grouse moor which he rented in perthshire it would be a great nuisance to miss the twelfth he said but it would apparently be a near shave he thought however that in any case it might be done by leaving the ship at plymouth and rushing up to london by the first train yes he said i think i shall be able to do it that way even if the boat is a couple of days late by the way he added suddenly why not come along to scotland with me you haven't any particular business in hand and i can promise you a week or two of good fun the invitation pleased me it's very good of you i said and as a matter of fact i haven't any very urgent business in london i must see those solicitors i told you of but that's not a matter of hurry indeed an hour or two on my way through london would be enough but as i don't know any of your party and pooh pooh my dear fellow answered dorrington with a snap of his fingers that's all right i shan't have a party there won't be time to get it together one or two might come down a little later but if they do they'll be capital fellows delighted to make your acquaintance i'm sure indeed you'll do me a great favour if you'll come else i shall be all alone without a soul to say a word to anyway i won't miss the twelfth if it's to be done by any possibility you'll really have to come you know you've no excuse i can lend you guns and anything you want though i believe you've such things with you who is your london solicitor by the way mowbray of lincoln's inn fields oh mowbray we know him well his partner died last year when i say we know him well i mean as a firm i have never met him personally though my partner who does the office work has regular dealings with him he's an excellent man but his managing clerk's frightful i wonder mowbray keeps him don't you let him do anything for you on his own hook he makes the most disastrous messes and i rather fancy he drinks deal with mowbray himself there's nobody better in london and by the way now i think of it it's lucky you've nothing urgent for him for he's sure to be off out of town for the twelfth he's a rare old gunner and never misses a season so that now you haven't a shade of an excuse for leaving me in the lurch and we'll consider the thing settled settled accordingly it was and the voyage ended uneventfully but the steamer was late and we left it at plymouth and rushed up to town on the tenth we had three or four hours to prepare before leaving euston by the night train dorrington's moor was a long drive from crieff station and he calculated that at best we could not arrive there before the early evening of the following day which would however give us comfortable time for a good long night's rest before the morning's sport opened fortunately i had plenty of loose cash with me so that there was nothing to delay us in that regard we made ready in dorrington's rooms he was a bachelor in conduit street and got off comfortably by the ten o'clock train from euston then followed a most delightful eight days the weather was fine the birds were plentiful and my first taste of grouse shooting was a complete success i resolved for the future to come out of my shell and mix in the world that contained such charming fellows as dorrington and such delightful sports as that i was then enjoying but on the eighth day dorrington received a telegram calling him instantly to london it's a shocking nuisance he said here's my holiday either knocked on the head altogether or cut in two and i fear it's the first rather than the second it's just the way in such an uncertain profession as mine there's no possible help for it however i must go as you'd understand at once if you knew the case but what chiefly annoys me is leaving you all alone i reassured him on this point and pointed out that i had for a long time been used to a good deal of my own company though indeed with dorrington away life at the shooting lodge threatened to be less pleasant than it had been but you'll be bored to death here dorrington said his thoughts jumping with my own but on the other hand it won't be much good going up to town yet everybody's out of town and mowbray among them there's a little business of ours that's waiting for him at this moment my partner mentioned it in his letter yesterday why not put in the time with a little tour round or you might work up to london by irregular stages and look about you as an artist you'd like to see a few of the old towns probably edinburgh chester warwick and so on it isn't a great programme perhaps but i hardly know what else to suggest as for myself i must be off as i am by the first train i can get i begged him not to trouble about me but to attend to his business as a matter of fact i was disposed to get to london and take chambers at any rate for a little while but chester was a place i much wanted to see a real old town with walls round it and i was not indisposed to take a day at warwick so in the end i resolved to pack up and make for chester the following day and from there to take train for warwick and in half an hour dorrington was gone chester was all delight to me my recollections of the trip to europe in my childhood were vivid enough as to the misfortunes that followed my father but of the ancient buildings we visited i remembered little now in chester i found the medival town i had so often read of i wandered for hours together in the quaint old rows and walked on the city wall the evening after my arrival was fine and moonlight and i was tempted from my hotel i took a stroll about the town and finished by a walk along the wall from the watergate toward the cathedral the moon flecked over now and again by scraps of cloud and at times obscured for half a minute together lighted up all the roodee in the intervals and touched with silver the river beyond but as i walked i presently grew aware of a quiet shuffling footstep some little way behind me i took little heed of it at first though i could see nobody near me from whom the sound might come but soon i perceived that when i stopped as i did from time to time to gaze over the parapet the mysterious footsteps stopped also and when i resumed my walk the quiet shuffling tread began again at first i thought it might be an echo but a moment's reflection dispelled that idea mine was an even distinct walk and this which followed was a soft quick shuffling step a mere scuffle moreover when by way of test i took a few silent steps on tip toe the shuffle still persisted i was being followed now i do not know whether or not it may sound like a childish fancy but i confess i thought of my father when last i had been in england as a child my father's violent death had been preceded by just such followings and now after all these years on my return on the very first night i walked abroad alone there were strange footsteps in my track the walk was narrow and nobody could possibly pass me unseen i turned suddenly therefore and hastened back at once i saw a dark figure rise from the shadow of the parapet and run i ran too but i could not gain on the figure which receded farther and more indistinctly before me one reason was that i felt doubtful of my footing on the unfamiliar track i ceased my chase and continued my stroll it might easily have been some vagrant thief i thought who had a notion to rush at a convenient opportunity and snatch my watch but here i was far past the spot where i had turned there was the shuffling footstep behind me again for a little while i feigned not to notice it then swinging round as swiftly as i could i made a quick rush useless again for there in the distance scuttled that same indistinct figure more rapidly than i could run what did it mean i liked the affair so little that i left the walls and walked toward my hotel the streets were quiet i had traversed two and was about emerging into one of the two main streets where the rows are when from the farther part of the dark street behind me there came once more the sound of the now unmistakable footstep i stopped the footsteps stopped also i turned and walked back a few steps and as i did it the sounds went scuffling away at the far end of the street illustration i made a quick rush it could not be fancy it could not be chance for a single incident perhaps such an explanation might serve but not for this persistent recurrence i hurried away to my hotel resolved since i could not come at my pursuer to turn back no more but before i reached the hotel there were the shuffling footsteps again and not far behind it would not be true to say that i was alarmed at this stage of the adventure but i was troubled to know what it all might mean and altogether puzzled to account for it i thought a great deal but i went to bed and rose in the morning no wiser than ever whether or not it was a mere fancy induced by the last night's experience i cannot say but i went about that day with a haunting feeling that i was watched and to me the impression was very real indeed i listened often but in the bustle of the day even in quiet old chester the individual characters of different footsteps were not easily recognisable once however as i descended a flight of steps from the rows i fancied i heard the quick shuffle in the curious old gallery i had just quitted i turned up the steps again and looked there was a shabby sort of man looking in one of the windows and leaning so far as to hide his head behind the heavy oaken pilaster that supported the building above it might have been his footstep or it might have been my fancy at any rate i would have a look at him i mounted the top stair but as i turned in his direction the man ran off with his face averted and his head ducked and vanished down another stair i made all speed after him but when i reached the street he was nowhere to be seen what could it all mean the man was rather above the middle height and he wore one of those soft felt hats familiar on the head of the london organ grinder also his hair was black and bushy and protruded over the back of his coat collar surely this was no delusion surely i was not imagining an italian aspect for this man simply because of the recollection of my father's fate perhaps i was foolish but i took no more pleasure in chester the embarrassment was a novel one for me and i could not forget it i went back to my hotel paid my bill sent my bag to the railway station and took train for warwick by way of crewe it was dark when i arrived but the night was near as fine as last night had been at chester i took a very little late dinner at my hotel and fell into a doubt what to do with myself one rather fat and very sleepy commercial traveller was the only other customer visible and the billiard room was empty there seemed to be nothing to do but to light a cigar and take a walk i could just see enough of the old town to give me good hopes of to morrow's sight seeing there was nothing visible of quite such an interesting character as one might meet in chester but there were a good few fine old sixteenth century houses and there were the two gates with the chapels above them but of course the castle was the great show place and that i should visit on the morrow if there were no difficulties as to permission there were some very fine pictures there if i remembered aright what i had read i was walking down the incline from one of the gates trying to remember who the painters of these pictures were besides van dyck and holbein when that shuffling step was behind me again i admit that it cost me an effort this time to turn on my pursuer there was something uncanny in that persistent elusive footstep and indeed there was something alarming in my circumstances dogged thus from place to place and unable to shake off my enemy or to understand his movements or his motive turn i did however and straightway the shuffling step went off at a hastened pace in the shadow of the gate this time i made no more than half a dozen steps back i turned again and pushed my way to the hotel and as i went the shuffling step came after the thing was serious there must be some object in this unceasing watching and the object could bode no good to me plainly some unseen eye had been on me the whole of that day had noted my goings and comings and my journey from chester again and irresistibly the watchings that preceded my father's death came to mind and i could not forget them i could have no doubt now that i had been closely watched from the moment i had set foot at plymouth but who could have been waiting to watch me at plymouth when indeed i had only decided to land at the last moment then i thought of the two italian forecastle hands on the steamer the very men whom dorrington had used to illustrate in what unexpected quarters members of the terrible italian secret societies might be found and the camorra was not satisfied with single revenge it destroyed the son after the father and it waited for many years with infinite patience and cunning dogged by the steps i reached the hotel and went to bed i slept but fitfully at first though better rest came as the night wore on in the early morning i woke with a sudden shock and with an indefinite sense of being disturbed by somebody about me the window was directly opposite the foot of the bed and there as i looked was the face of a man dark evil and grinning with a bush of black hair about his uncovered head and small rings in his ears it was but a flash and the face vanished i was struck by the terror that one so often feels on a sudden and violent awakening from sleep and it was some seconds ere i could leave my bed and get to the window my room was on the first floor and the window looked down on a stable yard i had a momentary glimpse of a human figure leaving the gate of the yard and it was the figure that had fled before me in the rows at chester a ladder belonging to the yard stood under the window and that was all i rose and dressed i could stand this sort of thing no longer if it were only something tangible if there were only somebody i could take hold of and fight with if necessary it would not have been so bad but i was surrounded by some mysterious machination persistent unexplainable that it was altogether impossible to tackle or to face to complain to the police would have been absurd they would take me for a lunatic they are indeed just such complaints that lunatics so often make to the police complaints of being followed by indefinite enemies and of being besieged by faces that look in at windows even if they did not set me down a lunatic what could the police of a provincial town do for me in a case like this no i must go and consult dorrington i had my breakfast and then decided that i would at any rate try the castle before leaving try it i did accordingly and was allowed to go over it but through the whole morning i was oppressed by the horrible sense of being watched by malignant eyes clearly there was no comfort for me while this lasted so after lunch i caught a train which brought me to euston soon after half past six i took a cab straight to dorrington's rooms but he was out and was not expected home till late so i drove to a large hotel near charing cross i avoid mentioning its name for reasons which will presently be understood sent in my bag and dined i had not the smallest doubt but that i was still under the observation of the man or the men who had so far pursued me i had indeed no hope of eluding them except by the contrivance of dorrington's expert brain so as i had no desire to hear that shuffling footstep again indeed it had seemed at warwick to have a physically painful effect on my nerves i stayed within and got to bed early i had no fear of waking face to face with a grinning italian here my window was four floors up out of reach of anything but a fire escape and in fact i woke comfortably and naturally and saw nothing from my window but the bright sky the buildings opposite and the traffic below but as i turned to close my door behind me as i emerged into the corridor there on the muntin of the frame just below the bedroom number was a little round paper label perhaps a trifle smaller than a sixpence and on the label drawn awkwardly in ink was a device of two crossed knives of curious crooked shape the sign of the camorra i will not attempt to describe the effect of this sign upon me it may best be imagined in view of what i have said of the incidents preceding the murder of my father it was the sign of an inexorable fate creeping nearer step by step implacable inevitable and mysterious in little more than twelve hours after seeing that sign my father had been a mangled corpse one of the hotel servants passed as i stood by the door and i made shift to ask him if he knew anything of the label he looked at the paper and then more curiously at me but he could offer no explanation i spent little time over breakfast and then went by cab to conduit street i paid my bill and took my bag with me dorrington had gone to his office but he had left a message that if i called i was to follow him and the office was in bedford street covent garden i turned the cab in that direction forthwith why said dorrington as we shook hands i believe you look a bit out of sorts doesn't england agree with you well i answered it has proved rather trying so far and then i described in exact detail my adventures as i have set them down here dorrington looked grave it's really extraordinary he said most extraordinary and it isn't often that i call a thing extraordinary neither with my experience but it's plain something must be done something to gain time at any rate we're in the dark at present of course and i expect i shall have to fish about a little before i get at anything to go on in the meantime i think you must disappear as artfully as we can manage it he sat silent for a little while thoughtfully tapping his forehead with his finger tips i wonder he said presently whether or not those italian fellows on the steamer are in it or not i suppose you haven't made yourself known anywhere have you nowhere as you know you've been with me all the time till you left the moor and since then i have been with nobody and called on nobody now there's no doubt it's the camorra dorrington said that's pretty plain i think i told you on the steamer that it was rather wonderful that you had heard nothing of them after your father's death what has caused them all this delay there's no telling they know best themselves it's been lucky for you anyway so far what i'd like to find out now is how they have identified you and got on your track so promptly there's no guessing where these fellows get their information it's just wonderful but if we can find out then perhaps we can stop the supply or turn on something that will lead them into a pit if you had called anywhere on business and declared yourself as you might have done for instance at mowbray's i might be inclined to suspect that they got the tip in some crooked way from there but you haven't of course if those italian chaps on the steamer are in it you're probably identified pretty certainly but if they're not they may only have made a guess we two landed together and kept together till a day or two ago as far as any outsider would know i might be rigby and you might be dorrington come we'll work on those lines i think i smell a plan are you staying anywhere no i paid my bill at the hotel and came along here with my bag very well now there's a house at highgate kept by a very trustworthy man whom i know very well where a man might be pretty comfortable for a few days or even for a week if he doesn't mind staying indoors and keeping himself out of sight i expect your friends of the camorra are watching in the street outside at this moment but i think it will be fairly easy to get you away to highgate without letting them into the secret if you don't mind secluding yourself for a bit in the circumstances i take it you won't object at all object i should think not very well that's settled you can call yourself dorrington or not as you please though perhaps it will be safest not to shout 'rigby' too loud but as for myself for a day or two at least i'm going to be mr james rigby have you your card case handy yes here it is but then as to taking my name won't you run serious risk dorrington winked merrily i've run a risk or two before now he said in course of my business and if i don't mind the risk you needn't grumble for i warn you i shall charge for risk when i send you my bill and i think i can take care of myself fairly well even with the camorra about i shall take you to this place at highgate and then you won't see me for a few days it won't do for me in the character of mr james rigby to go dragging a trail up and down between this place and your retreat you've got some other identifying papers haven't you yes i have i produced the letter from my sydney lawyers to mowbray and the deeds of the south australian property from my bag ah said dorrington i'll just give you a formal receipt for these since they're valuable it's a matter of business and we'll do it in a business like way i may want something solid like this to support any bluff i may have to make a mere case of cards won't always act you know it's a pity old mowbray's out of town for there's a way in which he might give a little help i fancy but never mind leave it all to me there's your receipt keep it snug away somewhere where inquisitive people can't read it he handed me the receipt and then took me to his partner's room and introduced me mr hicks was a small wrinkled man older than dorrington i should think by fifteen or twenty years and with all the aspect and manner of a quiet old professional man dorrington left the room and presently returned with his hat in his hand yes he said there's a charming dark gentleman with a head like a mop and rings in his ears skulking about at the next corner if it was he who looked in at your window i don't wonder you were startled his dress suggests the organ grinding interest but he looks as though cutting a throat would be more in his line than grinding a tune and no doubt he has friends as engaging as himself close at call if you'll come with me now i think we shall give him the slip i have a growler ready for you a hansom's a bit too glassy and public pull down the blinds and sit back when you get inside he led me to a yard at the back of the building wherein the office stood from which a short flight of steps led to a basement we followed a passage in this basement till we reached another flight and ascending these we emerged into the corridor of another building out at the door at the end of this and we passed a large block of model dwellings and were in bedfordbury here a four wheeler was waiting and i shut myself in it without delay i was to proceed as far as king's cross in this cab dorrington had arranged and there he would overtake me in a swift hansom it fell out as he had settled and dismissing the hansom he came the rest of the journey with me in the four wheeler we stopped at length before one of a row of houses apparently recently built houses of the over ornamented gabled and tiled sort that abound in the suburbs crofting is the man's name dorrington said as we alighted he's rather an odd sort of customer but quite decent in the main and his wife makes coffee such as money won't buy in most places a woman answered dorrington's ring a woman of most extreme thinness dorrington greeted her as mrs crofting and we entered we've just lost our servant again mr dorrington the woman said in a shrill voice and mr crofting ain't at home but i'm expecting him before long i don't think i need wait to see him mrs crofting dorrington answered i'm sure i can't leave my friend in better hands than yours i hope you've a vacant room well for a friend of yours mr dorrington no doubt we can find room that's right my friend mr dorrington gave me a meaning look mr phelps would like to stay here for a few days he wants to be quite quiet for a little do you understand oh yes mr dorrington i understand very well then make him as comfortable as you can and give him some of your very best coffee i believe you've got quite a little library of books and mr phelps will be glad of them have you got any cigars dorrington added turning to me yes there are some in my bag then i think you'll be pretty comfortable now goodbye i expect you'll see me in a few days or at any rate you'll get a message meantime be as happy as you can dorrington left and the woman showed me to a room upstairs where i placed my bag in front on the same floor was a sitting room with i suppose some two or three hundred books mostly novels on shelves the furniture of the place was of the sort one expects to find in an ordinary lodging house horsehair sofas loo tables lustres and so forth mrs crofting explained to me that the customary dinner hour was two but that i might dine when i liked i elected however to follow the custom of the house and sat down to a cigar and a book at two o'clock the dinner came and i was agreeably surprised to find it a very good one much above what the appointments of the house had led me to expect plainly mrs crofting was a capital cook there was no soup but there was a very excellent sole and some well done cutlets with peas and an omelet also a bottle of bass come i felt that i should not do so badly in this place after all i trusted that dorrington would be as comfortable in his half of the transaction bearing my responsibilities and troubles i had heard a heavy blundering tread on the floor below and judged from this that mr crofting had returned after dinner i lit a cigar and mrs crofting brought her coffee truly it was excellent coffee and brewed as i like it strong and black and plenty of it it had a flavour of its own too novel but not unpleasing i took one cupful and brought another to my side as i lay on the sofa with my book i had not read six lines before i was asleep i woke with a sensation of numbing cold in my right side a terrible stiffness in my limbs and a sound of loud splashing in my ears all was pitch dark and what was this water water all about me i was lying in six inches of cold water and more was pouring down upon me from above my head was afflicted with a splitting ache but where was i why was it dark and whence all the water i staggered to my feet and instantly struck my head against a hard roof above me i raised my hand there was the roof or whatever place it was hard smooth and cold and little more than five feet from the floor so that i bent as i stood i spread my hand to the side that was hard smooth and cold too and then the conviction struck me like a blow i was in a covered iron tank and the water was pouring in to drown me i dashed my hands frantically against the lid and strove to raise it it would not move i shouted at the top of my voice and turned about to feel the extent of my prison one way i could touch the opposite sides at once easily with my hands the other way it was wider perhaps a little more than six feet altogether what was this was this to be my fearful end cooped in this tank while the water rose by inches to choke me already the water was a foot deep i flung myself at the sides i beat the pitiless iron with fists face and head i screamed and implored then it struck me that i might at least stop the inlet of water i put out my hand and felt the falling stream then found the inlet and stopped it with my fingers but water still poured in with a resounding splash there was another opening at the opposite end which i could not reach without releasing the one i now held i was but prolonging my agony oh the devilish cunning that had devised those two inlets so far apart again i beat the sides broke my nails with tearing at the corners screamed and entreated in my agony i was mad but with no dulling of the senses for the horrors of my awful helpless state overwhelmed my brain keen and perceptive to every ripple of the unceasing water in the height of my frenzy i held my breath for i heard a sound from outside i shouted again implored some quicker death then there was a scraping on the lid above me and it was raised at one edge and let in the light of a candle i sprang from my knees and forced the lid back and the candle flame danced before me the candle was held by a dusty man a workman apparently who stared at me with scared eyes and said nothing but goo' lor' overhead were the rafters of a gabled roof and tilted against them was the thick beam which jammed across from one sloping rafter to another had held the tank lid fast help me i gasped help me out the man took me by the armpits and hauled me dripping and half dead over the edge of the tank into which the water still poured making a noise in the hollow iron that half drowned our voices the man had been at work on the cistern of a neighbouring house and hearing an uncommon noise he had climbed through the spaces left in the party walls to give passage along under the roofs to the builders' men among the joists at our feet was the trap door through which drugged and insensible i had been carried to be flung into that horrible cistern with the help of my friend the workman i made shift to climb through by the way he had come we got back to the house where he had been at work and there the people gave me brandy and lent me dry clothes i made haste to send for the police but when they arrived mrs crofting and her respectable spouse had gone some unusual noise in the roof must have warned them and when the police following my directions further got to the offices of dorrington and hicks those acute professional men had gone too but in such haste that the contents of the office papers and everything else had been left just as they stood the plot was clear now the followings the footsteps the face at the window the label on the door all were a mere humbug arranged by dorrington for his own purpose which was to drive me into his power and get my papers from me armed with these and with his consummate address and knowledge of affairs he could go to mr mowbray in the character of mr james rigby sell my land in south australia and have the whole of my property transferred to himself from sydney the rest of my baggage was at his rooms if any further proof were required it might be found there he had taken good care that i should not meet mr mowbray who by the way i afterwards found had not left his office and had never fired a gun in his life at first i wondered that dorrington had not made some murderous attempt on me at the shooting place in scotland but a little thought convinced me that that would have been bad policy for him the disposal of the body would be difficult and he would have to account somehow for my sudden disappearance whereas by the use of his italian assistant and his murder apparatus at highgate i was made to efface my own trail and could be got rid of in the end with little trouble for my body stripped of everything that might identify me would be simply that of a drowned man unknown whom nobody could identify the whole plot was contrived upon the information i myself had afforded dorrington during the voyage home and it all sprang from his remembering the report of my father's death when the papers in the office came to be examined there each step in the operations was plainly revealed there was a code telegram from suez directing hicks to hire a grouse moor there were telegrams and letters from scotland giving directions as to the later movements indeed the thing was displayed completely the business of dorrington and hicks had really been that of private inquiry agents and they had done much bon fide business but many of their operations had been of a more than questionable sort and among their papers were found complete sets neatly arranged in dockets each containing in skeleton a complete history of a case many of these cases were of a most interesting character and i have been enabled to piece together out of the material thus supplied the narratives which will follow this as to my own case it only remains to say that as yet neither dorrington hicks nor the croftings have been caught they played in the end for a high stake they might have made six figures of me if they had killed me and the first figure would not have been a one and they lost by a mere accident but i have often wondered how many of the bodies which the coroners' juries of london have returned to be found drowned were drowned not where they were picked up but in that horrible tank at highgate what the drug was that gave mrs crofting's coffee its value in dorrington's eyes i do not know but plainly it had not been sufficient in my case to keep me unconscious against the shock of cold water till i could be drowned altogether months have passed since my adventure but even now i sweat at the sight of an iron tank the case of janissary ii the case of janissary i in this case and indeed in most of the others the notes and other documents found in the dockets would by themselves give but a faint outline of the facts and indeed might easily be unintelligible to many people especially as for much of my information i have been indebted to outside inquiries therefore i offer no excuse for presenting the whole thing digested into plain narrative form with little reference to my authorities though i knew none of the actors in it with the exception of the astute dorrington the case was especially interesting to me as will be gathered from the narrative itself the only paper in the bundle which i shall particularly allude to was a newspaper cutting of a date anterior by nine or ten months to the events i am to write of it had evidently been cut at the time it appeared and saved in case it might be useful in a box in the form of a book containing many hundreds of others from this receptacle it had been taken and attached to the bundle during the progress of the case i may say at once that the facts recorded had no direct concern with the case of the horse janissary but had been useful in affording a suggestion to dorrington in connection therewith the matter is the short report of an ordinary sort of inquest and i here transcribe it dr mcculloch held an inquest yesterday on the body of mr henry lawrence whose body was found on tuesday morning last in the river near vauxhall bridge the deceased was well known in certain sporting circles sophia lawrence the widow said that deceased had left home on monday afternoon at about five in his usual health saying that he was to dine at a friend's and she saw nothing more of him till called upon to identify the body he had no reason for suicide and so far as witness knew was free from pecuniary embarrassments he had indeed been very successful in betting recently he habitually carried a large pocket book with papers in it mr robert naylor commission agent said that deceased dined with him that evening at his house in gold street chelsea and left for home at about half past eleven he had at the time a sum of nearly four hundred pounds upon him chiefly in notes which had been paid him by witness in settlement of a bet it was a fine night and deceased walked in the direction of chelsea embankment that was the last witness saw of him he might not have been perfectly sober but he was not drunk and was capable of taking care of himself the evidence of the thames police went to show that no money was on the body when found except a few coppers and no pocket book dr william hodgetts said that death was due to drowning there were some bruises on the arms and head which might have been caused before death the body was a very healthy one the coroner said that there seemed to be a very strong suspicion of foul play unless the pocket book of the deceased had got out of his pocket in the water but the evidence was very meagre although the police appeared to have made every possible inquiry the jury returned a verdict of 'found drowned though how the deceased came into the water there was no evidence to show' i know no more of the unfortunate man lawrence than this and i have only printed the cutting here because it probably induced dorrington to take certain steps in the case i am dealing with with that case the fate of the man lawrence has nothing whatever to do he passes out of the story entirely ii mr warren telfer was a gentleman of means and the owner of a few very few racehorses but he had a great knack of buying hidden prizes in yearlings and what his stable lacked in quantity it often more than made up for in quality thus he had once bought a st leger winner for as little as a hundred and fifty pounds many will remember his bitter disappointment of ten or a dozen years back when his horse matfelon starting an odds on favourite for the two thousand never even got among the crowd and ambled in streets behind everything it was freely rumoured and no doubt with cause that matfelon had been got at and in some way nobbled there were hints of a certain bucket of water administered just before the race a bucket of water observed in the hands some said of one some said of another person connected with ritter's training establishment there was no suspicion of pulling for plainly the jockey was doing his best with the animal all the way along and never had a tight rein so a nobbling it must have been said the knowing ones and mr warren telfer said so too with much bitterness more he immediately removed his horses from ritter's stables and started a small training place of his own for his own horses merely putting an old steeplechase jockey in charge who had come out of a bad accident permanently lame and had fallen on evil days the owner was an impulsive and violent tempered man who once a notion was in his head held to it through everything and in spite of everything his misfortune with matfelon made him the most insanely distrustful man alive in everything he fancied he saw a trick and to him every man seemed a scoundrel he could scarce bear to let the very stable boys touch his horses and although for years all went as well as could be expected in his stables his suspicious distrust lost nothing of its virulence he was perpetually fussing about the stables making surprise visits and laying futile traps that convicted nobody the sole tangible result of this behaviour was a violent quarrel between mr warren telfer and his nephew richard who had been making a lengthened stay with his uncle young telfer to tell the truth was neither so discreet nor so exemplary in behaviour as he might have been but his temper was that characteristic of the family and when he conceived that his uncle had an idea that he was communicating stable secrets to friends outside there was an animated row and the nephew betook himself and his luggage somewhere else young telfer always insisted however that his uncle was not a bad fellow on the whole though he had habits of thought and conduct that made him altogether intolerable at times but the uncle had no good word for his graceless nephew and indeed richard telfer betted more than he could afford and was not so particular in his choice of sporting acquaintances as a gentleman should have been mr warren telfer's house blackhall and his stables were little more than two miles from redbury in hampshire and after the quarrel mr richard telfer was not seen near the place for many months not indeed till excitement was high over the forthcoming race for the redbury stakes for which there was an entry from the stable janissary for long ranked second favourite and then the owner's nephew did not enter the premises and in fact made his visit as secret as possible i have said that janissary was long ranked second favourite for the redbury stakes but a little more than a week before the race he became first favourite owing to a training mishap to the horse fancied first which made its chances so poor that it might have been scratched at any moment and so far was janissary above the class of the field though it was a two year old race and there might be a surprise that it at once went to far shorter odds than the previous favourite which indeed had it run fit and well would have found janissary no easy colt to beat mr telfer's nephew was seen near the stables but two or three days before the race and that day the owner despatched a telegram to the firm of dorrington hicks in response to this telegram dorrington caught the first available train for redbury and was with mr warren telfer in his library by five in the afternoon it is about my horse janissary that i want to consult you mr dorrington said mr telfer it's right enough now or at least was right at exercise this morning but i feel certain that there's some diabolical plot on hand somewhere to interfere with the horse before the redbury stakes day and i'm sorry to have to say that i suspect my own nephew to be mixed up in it in some way in the first place i may tell you that there is no doubt whatever that the colt if let alone and bar accident can win in a canter he could have won even if herald the late favourite had kept well for i can tell you that janissary is a far greater horse than anybody is aware of outside my establishment or at any rate than anybody ought to be aware of if the stable secrets are properly kept his pedigree is nothing very great and he never showed his quality till quite lately in private trials of course it has leaked out somehow that the colt is exceptionally good i don't believe i can trust a soul in the place how should the price have gone up to five to four unless somebody had been telling what he's paid not to tell but that isn't all as i have said i've a conviction that something's on foot somebody wants to interfere with the horse of course we get a tout about now and again but the downs are pretty big and we generally manage to dodge them if we want to on the last three or four mornings however wherever janissary might be taking his gallop there was a big hulking fellow with a red beard and spectacles not so much watching the horse as trying to get hold of the lad i am always up and out at five for i've found to my cost you remember about matfelon that if a man doesn't want to be ramped he must never take his eye off things well i have scarcely seen the lad ease the colt once on the last three or four mornings without that red bearded fellow bobbing up from a knoll or a clump of bushes or something close by especially if janissary was a bit away from the other horses and not under my nose or the head lad's for a moment i rode at the fellow of course when i saw what he was after but he was artful as a cartload of monkeys and vanished somehow before i could get near him the head lad believes he has seen him about just after dark too but i am keeping the stable lads in when they're not riding and i suppose he finds he has no chance of getting at them except when they're out with the horses this morning not only did i see this fellow about as usual but i am ashamed to say i observed my own nephew acting the part of a common tout he certainly had the decency to avoid me and clear out but that was not all as you shall see this morning happening to approach the stables from the back i suddenly came upon the red bearded man giving money to a groom of mine he ran off at once as you may guess and i discharged the groom where he stood and would not allow him into the stables again he offered no explanation or excuse but took himself off and half an hour afterward i almost sent away my head boy too for when i told him of the dismissal he admitted that he had seen that same groom taking money of my nephew at the back of the stables an hour before and had not informed me he said that he thought that as it was 'only mr richard' it didn't matter fool anyway the groom has gone and so far as i can tell as yet the colt is all right i examined him at once of course and i also turned over a box that weeks the groom used to keep brushes and odd things in there i found this paper full of powder i don't yet know what it is but it's certainly nothing he had any business with in the stable will you take it and now mr telfer went on i'm in such an uneasy state that i want your advice and assistance quite apart from the suspicious more than suspicious circumstances i have informed you of i am certain i know it without being able to give precise reasons i am certain that some attempt is being made at disabling janissary before thursday's race i feel it in my bones so to speak i had the same suspicion just before that two thousand when matfelon was got at the thing was in the air as it is now perhaps it's a sort of instinct but i rather think it is the result of an unconscious absorption of a number of little indications about me be it as it may i am resolved to leave no opening to the enemy if i can help it and i want you to see if you can suggest any further precautions beyond those i am taking come and look at the stables dorrington could see no opening for any piece of rascality by which he might make more of the case than by serving his client loyally so he resolved to do the latter he followed mr telfer through the training stables where eight or nine thoroughbreds stood and could suggest no improvement upon the exceptional precautions that already existed no said dorrington i don't think you can do any better than this at least on this the inner line of defence but it is best to make the outer lines secure first by the way this isn't janissary is it we saw him farther up the row didn't we oh no that's a very different sort of colt though he does look like doesn't he people who've been up and down the stables once or twice often confuse them they're both bays much of a build and about the same height and both have a bit of stocking on the same leg though janissary's is bigger and this animal has a white star but you never saw two creatures look so like and run so differently this is a dead loss not worth his feed if i can manage to wind him up to something like a gallop i shall try to work him off in a selling plate somewhere but as far as i can see he isn't good enough even for that he's a disappointment and his stock's far better than janissary's too and he cost half as much again yearlings are a lottery still i've drawn a prize or two among them at one time or another ah yes so i've heard but now as to the outer defences i was speaking of let us find out who is trying to interfere with your horse do you mind letting me into the secrets of the stable commissions oh no we're talking in confidence of course i've backed the colt pretty heavily all round but not too much anywhere there's a good slice with barker you know barker of course mullins has a thousand down for him and that was at five to one before herald went amiss then there's ford and lascelles both good men and naylor he's the smallest man of them all and there's only a hundred or two with him though he's been laying the horse pretty freely everywhere at least until herald went wrong and there's pedder but there must have been a deal of money laid to outside backers and there's no telling who may contemplate a ramp just so now as to your nephew what of your suspicions in that direction perhaps i'm a little hasty as to that mr telfer answered a little ashamed of what he had previously said but i'm worried and mystified as you see and hardly know what to think my nephew richard is a little erratic and he has a foolish habit of betting more than he can afford he and i quarrelled some time back while he was staying here because i had an idea that he had been talking too freely outside he had in fact and i regarded it as a breach of confidence so there was a quarrel and he went away very well i wonder if i can get a bed at the 'crown' at redbury i'm afraid it'll be crowded but i'll try but why trouble why not stay with me and be near the stables because then i should be of no more use to you than one of your lads people who come out here every morning are probably staying at redbury and i must go there after them iii the crown at redbury was full in anticipation of the races but dorrington managed to get a room ordinarily occupied by one of the landlord's family who undertook to sleep at a friend's for a night or two this settled he strolled into the yard and soon fell into animated talk with the hostler on the subject of the forthcoming races all the town was backing janissary for the stakes the hostler said and he advised dorrington to do the same during this conversation two men stopped in the street just outside the yard gate talking one was a big heavy vulgar looking fellow in a box cloth coat and with a shaven face and hoarse voice the other was a slighter slimmer younger and more gentlemanlike man though there was a certain patchy colour about his face that seemed to hint of anything but teetotalism there said the hostler indicating the younger of these two men that's young mr telfer him as whose uncle's owner o' janissary he's a young plunger he is and he's on janissary too he give me the tip straight this mornin' 'you put your little bit on my uncle's colt' he said 'it's all right i ain't such pals with the old man as i was but i've got the tip that his money's down on it so don't neglect your opportunities thomas' he says and i haven't he's stoppin' in our house is young mr richard and who is that he is talking to a bookmaker yes sir that's naylor bob naylor he's got mr richard's bets p'raps he's puttin' on a bit more now the men at the gate separated and the bookmaker walked off down the street in the fast gathering dusk richard telfer however entered the house and dorrington followed him telfer mounted the stairs and went into his room dorrington lingered a moment on the stairs and then went and knocked at telfer's door hullo cried telfer coming to the door and peering out into the gloomy corridor i beg pardon dorrington replied courteously i thought this was naylor's room no it's no by the end but i believe he's just gone down the street dorrington expressed his thanks and went to his own room he took one or two small instruments from his bag and hurried stealthily to the door of no all was quiet and the door opened at once to dorrington's picklock for there was nothing but the common tumbler rim lock to secure it dorrington being altogether an unscrupulous scoundrel would have thought nothing of entering a man's room thus for purposes of mere robbery much less scruple had he in doing so in the present circumstances he lit the candle in a little pocket lantern and having secured the door looked quickly about the room there was nothing unusual to attract his attention and he turned to two bags lying near the dressing table one was the usual bookmaker's satchel and the other was a leather travelling bag both were locked dorrington unbuckled the straps of the large bag and produced a slender picklock of steel wire with a sliding joint which with a little skilful humouring turned the lock in the course of a minute or two one glance inside was enough there on the top lay a large false beard of strong red and upon the shirts below was a pair of spectacles but dorrington went farther and felt carefully below the linen till his hand met a small flat mahogany box this he withdrew and opened within on a velvet lining lay a small silver instrument resembling a syringe he shut and replaced the box and having rearranged the contents of the bag shut locked and strapped it and blew out his light he had found what he came to look for in another minute mr bob naylor's door was locked behind him and dorrington took his picklocks to his own room it was a noisy evening in the commercial room at the crown chaff and laughter flew thick and richard telfer threatened naylor with a terrible settling day more was drunk than thirst strictly justified and everybody grew friendly with everybody else dorrington sober and keenly alert affected the reverse and exhibited especial and extreme affection for mr bob naylor his advances were unsuccessful at first but dorrington's manner and the crown whisky overcame the bookmaker's reserve and at about eleven o'clock the two left the house arm in arm for a cooling stroll in the high street dorrington blabbed and chattered with great success and soon began about janissary so you've pretty well done all you want with janissary eh book full ah nothing like keeping a book even all round it's the safest way 'specially with such a colt as janissary about eh my boy he nudged naylor genially ah no doubt it's a good colt but old telfer has rum notions about preparation hasn't he i dunno replied naylor how do you mean why what does he have the horse led up and down behind the stable for half an hour every afternoon didn't know he did ah but he does i came across it only this afternoon i was coming over the downs and just as i got round behind telfer's stables there i saw a fine bay colt with a white stocking on the off hind leg well covered up in a suit of clothes being led up and down by a lad like a sentry up and down up and down about twenty yards each way and nobody else about 'hullo' says i to the lad 'hullo what horse is this' 'janissary' says the boy pretty free for a stable lad 'ah' says i 'and what are you walking him like that for' 'dunno' says the boy 'but it's guv'nor's orders every afternoon at two to the minute i have to bring him out here and walk him like this for half an hour exactly neither more nor less and then he goes in and has a handful of malt but i dunno why' 'well' says i 'i never heard of that being done before but he's a fine colt' and i put my hand under the cloth and felt him hard as nails and smooth as silk and the boy let you touch him yes he struck me as a bit easy for a stable boy but it's an odd trick isn't it that of the half hour's walk and the handful of malt never hear of anybody else doing it did you no i never did they talked and strolled for another quarter of an hour and then finished up with one more drink iv the next was the day before the race and in the morning dorrington making a circuit came to mr warren telfer's from the farther side as soon as they were assured of privacy have you seen the man with the red beard this morning asked dorrington no i looked out pretty sharply too that's right if you like to fall in with my suggestions however you shall see him at about two o'clock and take a handsome rise out of him very well mr telfer replied what's your suggestion i'll tell you in the first place what's the value of that other horse that looks so like janissary hamid is his name he's worth well what he will fetch i'll sell him for fifty and be glad of the chance very good then you'll no doubt be glad to risk his health temporarily to make sure of the redbury stakes and to get longer prices for anything you may like to put on between now and to morrow afternoon come to the stables and i'll tell you but first is there a place where we may command a view of the ground behind the stables without being seen yes there's a ventilation grating at the back of each stall good then we'll watch from hamid's stall which will be empty select your most wooden faced and most careful boy and send him out behind the stable with hamid at two o'clock to the moment put the horse in a full suit of clothes it is necessary to cover up that white star and tell the lad he must lead it up and down slowly for twenty yards or so i rather expect the red bearded man will be coming along between two o'clock and half past two you will understand that hamid is to be janissary for the occasion you must drill your boy to appear a bit of a fool and to overcome his stable education sufficiently to chatter freely so long as it is the proper chatter the man may ask the horse's name or he may not any way the boy mustn't forget it is janissary he is leading you have an odd fad you must know and the boy must know it too in the matter of training this ridiculous fad is to have your colt walked up and down for half an hour exactly at two o'clock every afternoon and then given a handful of malt as he comes in the boy can talk as freely about this as he pleases and also about the colt's chances and anything else he likes and he is to let the stranger come up talk to the horse pat him in short to do as he pleases is that plain perfectly you have found out something about this red bearded chap then oh yes it's naylor the bookmaker as a matter of fact with a false beard what naylor yes you see the idea of course once naylor thinks he has nobbled the favourite he will lay it to any extent and the odds will get longer then you can make him pay for his little games well yes of course though i wouldn't put too much with naylor in any case he's not a big man and he might break and lose me the lot but i can get it out of the others just so you'd better see about schooling your boy now i think i'll tell you more presently a minute or two before two o'clock dorrington and telfer mounted on a pair of steps were gazing through the ventilation grating of hamid's stall while the colt clothed completely was led round then dorrington described his operations of the previous evening no matter what he may think of my tale he said naylor will be pretty sure to come he has tried to bribe your stablemen and has been baffled every attempt to get hold of the boy in charge of janissary has failed and he will be glad to clutch at any shadow of a chance to save his money now once he is here and the favourite apparently at his mercy the thing is done by the way i expect your nephew's little present to the man you sacked was a fairly innocent one no doubt he merely asked the man whether janissary was keeping well and was thought good enough to win for i find he is backing it pretty heavily naylor came afterwards with much less innocent intentions but fortunately you were down on him in time several considerations induced me to go to naylor's room in the first place i have heard rather shady tales of his doings on one or two occasions and he did not seem a sufficiently big man to stand to lose a great deal over your horse then when i saw him i observed that his figure bore a considerable resemblance to that of the man you had described except as regards the red beard and the spectacles articles easily enough assumed and indeed often enough used by the scum of the ring whose trade is welshing and apart from these considerations here at any rate was one man who had an interest in keeping your colt from winning and here was his room waiting for me to explore so i explored it and the card turned up trumps as he was speaking the stable boy a stolid looking youngster was leading hamid back and forth on the turf before their eyes there's somebody said dorrington suddenly over in that clump of trees yes our man sure enough i felt pretty sure of him after you had told me that he hadn't thought it worth while to turn up this morning here he comes naylor with his red beard sticking out over the collar of his big coat came slouching along with an awkwardly assumed air of carelessness and absence of mind hullo he said suddenly as he came abreast of the horse turning as though but now aware of its presence that's a valuable sort of horse ain't it my lad yes said the boy it is he's goin' to win the redbury stakes to morrow it's janissary oh janey sairey is it naylor answered with a quaint affectation of gaping ignorance janey sairey eh well she do look a fine 'orse what i can see of 'er what a suit o' clo'es an' so she's one o' the 'orses that runs in races is she well i never pretty much like other 'orses too to look at ain't she only a bit thin in the legs the boy stood carelessly by the colt's side and the man approached his hand came quickly from an inner pocket and then he passed it under hamid's cloths near the shoulder ah it do feel a lovely skin to be sure he said an' so there's goin' to be races at redbury to morrow is there i dunno anythin' about races myself an' oo my naylor sprang back as the horse flinging back its ears started suddenly swung round and reared lor he said what a vicious brute jist because i stroked her i'll be careful about touching racehorses again his hand passed stealthily to the pocket again and he hurried on his way while the stable boy steadied and soothed hamid illustration the horse started suddenly swung round and reared telfer and dorrington sniggered quietly in their concealment he's taken a deal of trouble hasn't he dorrington remarked it's a sad case of the biter bit for mr naylor i'm afraid that was a prick the colt felt hypodermic injection with the syringe i saw in the bag no doubt the boy won't be such a fool as to come in again at once will he if naylor's taking a look back from anywhere that may make him suspicious no fear i've told him to keep out for the half hour and he'll do it dear dear what an innocent person mr bob naylor is 'well i never pretty much like other horses' he didn't know there were to be races at redbury 'janey sairey' too it's really very funny ere the half hour was quite over hamid came stumbling and dragging into the stable yard plainly all amiss and collapsed on his litter as soon as he gained his stall there he lay shivering and drowsy i expect he'll get over it in a day or two dorrington remarked i don't suppose a vet could do much for him just now except perhaps give him a drench and let him take a rest certainly the effect will last over to morrow that's what it is calculated for v the redbury stakes were run at three in the afternoon after two or three minor events had been disposed of the betting had undergone considerable fluctuations during the morning but in general it ruled heavily against janissary the story had got about too that mr warren telfer's colt would not start so that when the numbers went up and it was seen that janissary was starting after all there was much astonishment and a good deal of uneasiness in the ring it's a pity we can't see our friend naylor's face just now isn't it dorrington remarked to his client as they looked on from mr telfer's drag yes it would be interesting telfer replied he was quite confident last night you say quite i tested him by an offer of a small bet on your colt asking some points over the odds and he took it at once indeed i believe he has been going about gathering up all the wagers he could about janissary and the market has felt it your nephew has risked some more with him i believe and altogether it looks as though the town would spoil the 'bookies' badly as the horses came from the weighing enclosure janissary was seen conspicuous among them bright clean and firm and a good many faces lengthened at the sight the start was not so good as it might have been but the favourite the starting price had gone to evens was not left and got away well in the crowd of ten starters there he lay till rounding the bend when the telfer blue and chocolate was seen among the foremost and near the rails mr telfer almost trembled as he watched through his glasses hang that willett he said almost to himself he's too clever against those rails before getting clear all right though all right he's coming illustration came in three lengths the winner janissary indeed was showing in front and as the horses came along the straight it was plain that mr telfer's colt was holding the field comfortably there were changes in the crowd some dropped away some came out and attempted to challenge for the lead but the favourite striding easily was never seriously threatened and in the end being a little let out came in a three lengths winner never once having been made to show his best i congratulate you mr telfer said dorrington and you may congratulate me certainly certainly said mr telfer hastily hurrying off to lead in the winner it was a bad race for the ring and in the open parts of the course many a humble fielder grabbed his satchel ere the shouting was over and made his best pace for the horizon and more than one pair of false whiskers as red as naylor's came off suddenly while the owner betook himself to a fresh stand unless a good many outsiders sailed home before the end of the week there would be a bad monday for layers but all sporting redbury was jubilant they had all been on the local favourite for the local race and it had won vi mr bob naylor got a bit back in his own phrase on other races by the end of the week but all the same he saw a black settling day ahead he had been done done for a certainty he had realised this as soon as he saw the numbers go up for the redbury stakes janissary had not been drugged after all that meant that another horse had been substituted for him and that the whole thing was an elaborate plant he thought he knew janissary pretty well by sight too and rather prided himself on having an eye for a horse but clearly it was a plant a complete do telfer was in it and so of course was that gentlemanly stranger who had strolled along redbury high street with him that night telling that cock and bull story about the afternoon walks and the handful of malt there was a nice schoolboy tale to take in a man who thought himself broad as cheapside he cursed himself high and low to be done and to know it was a galling thing but this would be worse the tale would get about they would boast of a clever stroke like that and that would injure him with everybody with honest men because his reputation as it was would bear no worsening and with knaves like himself because they would laugh at him and leave him out when any little co operative swindle was in contemplation but though the chagrin of the defeat was bitter bad enough his losses were worse he had taken everything offered on janissary after he had nobbled the wrong horse and had given almost any odds demanded do as he might he could see nothing but a balance against him on monday which though he might pay out his last cent he could not cover by several hundred pounds but on the day he met his customers at his club as usual and paid out freely young richard telfer however with whom he was heavily in he put off till the evening i've been a bit disappointed this morning over some ready that was to be paid over he said and i've used the last cheque form in my book you might come and have a bit of dinner with me to night mr telfer and take it then telfer assented without difficulty all right then that's settled you know the place gold street seven sharp the missis 'll be pleased to see you i'm sure mr telfer let's see it's fifteen hundred and thirty altogether isn't it yes that's it i'll come young telfer left the club and at the corner of the street ran against dorrington telfer of course knew him but as his late fellow guest at the crown at redbury and this was their first meeting in london after their return from the races ah said telfer going to draw a bit of janissary money eh oh i haven't much to draw dorrington answered but i expect your pockets are pretty heavy if you've just come from naylor yes i've just come from naylor but i haven't touched the merry sovs just yet replied telfer cheerfully there's been a run on naylor and i'm going to dine with him and his respectable missis this evening and draw the plunder then i feel rather curious to see what sort of establishment a man like naylor keeps going his place is in gold street chelsea yes i believe so anyhow i congratulate you on your haul and wish you a merry evening and the two men parted dorrington had indeed a few pounds to draw as the result of his fishing bet with naylor but now he resolved to ask for the money at his own time this invitation to telfer took his attention and it reminded him oddly of the circumstances detailed in the report of the inquest on lawrence transcribed at the beginning of this paper he had cut out this report at the time it appeared because he saw certain singularities about the case and he had filed it as he had done hundreds of other such cuttings and now certain things led him to fancy that he might be much interested to observe the proceedings at naylor's house on the evening after a bad settling day he resolved to gratify himself with a strict professional watch in gold street that evening on chance of something coming of it for it was an important thing in dorrington's rascally trade to get hold of as much of other people's private business as possible and to know exactly in what cupboard to find every man's skeleton for there was no knowing but it might be turned into money sooner or later so he found the number of naylor's house from the handiest directory and at six o'clock a little disguised by a humbler style of dress than usual he began his watch naylor's house was at the corner of a turning with the flank wall blank of windows except for one at the top and a public house stood at the opposite corner dorrington skilled in watching without attracting attention to himself now lounged in the public house bar now stood at the street corner and now sauntered along the street a picture of vacancy of mind and looking apparently at everything in turn except the house at the corner the first thing he noted was the issuing forth from the area steps of a healthy looking girl in much gaily be ribboned finery plainly a servant taking an evening out this was an odd thing that a servant should be allowed out on an evening when a guest was expected to dinner and the house looked like one where it was more likely that one servant would be kept than two dorrington hurried after the girl and changing his manner of address to that of a civil labourer said beg pardon miss but is mary walker still in service at your 'ouse mary walker said the girl why no i never 'eard the name and there ain't nobody in service there but me beg pardon it must be the wrong 'ouse it's my cousin miss that's all dorrington left the girl and returned to the public house as he reached it he perceived a second noticeable thing although it was broad daylight there was now a light behind the solitary window at the top of the side wall of naylor's house dorrington slipped through the swing doors of the public house and watched through the glass it was a bare room behind the high window it might have been a bathroom and its interior was made but dimly visible from outside by the light a tall thin woman was setting up an ordinary pair of house steps in the middle of the room this done she turned to the window and pulled down the blind and as she did so dorrington noted her very extreme thinness both of face and body when the blind was down the light still remained within again there seemed some significance in this it appeared that the thin woman had waited until her servant had gone before doing whatever she had to do in that room presently the watcher came again into gold street and from there caught a passing glimpse of the thin woman as she moved busily about the front room over the breakfast parlour clearly then the light above had been left for future use dorrington thought for a minute and then suddenly stopped with a snap of the fingers he saw it all now here was something altogether in his way he would take a daring course he withdrew once more to the public house and ordering another drink took up a position in a compartment from which he could command a view both of gold street and the side turning the time now he saw by his watch was ten minutes to seven he had to wait rather more than a quarter of an hour before seeing richard telfer come walking jauntily down gold street mount the steps and knock at naylor's door there was a momentary glimpse of the thin woman's face at the door and then telfer entered it now began to grow dusk and in about twenty minutes more dorrington took to the street again the room over the breakfast parlour was clearly the dining room it was lighted brightly and by intent listening the watcher could distinguish now and again a sudden burst of laughter from telfer followed by the deeper grunts of naylor's voice and once by sharp tones that it seemed natural to suppose were the thin woman's dorrington waited no longer but slipped a pair of thick sock feet over his shoes and after a quick look along the two streets to make sure nobody was near he descended the area steps there was no light in the breakfast parlour with his knife he opened the window catch raised the sash quietly and stepped over the sill and stood in the dark room within all was quiet except for the talking in the room above he had done but what many thieves parlour jumpers do every day but there was more ahead he made his way silently to the basement passage and passed into the kitchen the room was lighted and cookery utensils were scattered about but nobody was there he waited till he heard a request in naylor's gruff voice for another slice of something and noiselessly mounted the stairs he noticed that the dining room door was ajar but passed quickly on to the second flight and rested on the landing above mrs naylor would probably have to go downstairs once or twice again but he did not expect anybody in the upper part of the house just yet there was a small flight of stairs above the landing whereon he stood leading to the servant's bedroom and the bathroom he took a glance at the bathroom with its feeble lamp its steps and its open ceiling trap and returned again to the bedroom landing there he stood waiting watchfully twice the thin woman emerged from the dining room went downstairs and came up again each time with food and plates then she went down once more and was longer gone meantime naylor and telfer were talking and joking loudly at the table when once again dorrington saw the crown of the thin woman's head rising over the bottom stair he perceived that she bore a tray set with cups already filled with coffee these she carried into the dining room whence presently came the sound of striking matches after this the conversation seemed to flag and telfer's part in it grew less and less till it ceased altogether and the house was silent except for a sound of heavy breathing soon this became almost a snore and then there was a sudden noisy tumble as of a drunken man but still the snoring went on and the naylors were talking in whispers there was a shuffling and heaving sound and a chair was knocked over then at the dining room door appeared naylor walking backward and carrying the inert form of telfer by the shoulders while the thin woman followed supporting the feet dorrington retreated up the small stair flight cocking a pocket revolver as he went up the stairs they came naylor puffing and grunting with the exertion and telfer still snoring soundly on till at last having mounted the top flight they came in at the bathroom door where dorrington stood to receive them smiling and bowing pleasantly with his hat in one hand and his revolver in the other the woman from her position saw him first and dropped telfer's legs with a scream naylor turned his head and then also dropped his end the drugged man fell in a heap snoring still naylor astounded and choking made as if to rush at the interloper but dorrington thrust the revolver into his face and exclaimed still smiling courteously mind mind it's a dangerous thing is a revolver and apt to go off if you run against it he stood thus for a second and then stepped forward and took the woman who seemed like to swoon by the arm and pulled her into the room come mrs naylor he said you're not one of the fainting sort and i think i'd better keep two such clever people as you under my eye or one of you may get into mischief come now naylor we'll talk business naylor now white as a ghost sat on the edge of the bath and stared at dorrington as though in a fascination of terror his hands rested on the bath at each side and an odd sound of gurgling came from his thick throat we will talk business dorrington resumed come you've met me before now you know at redbury you can't have forgotten janissary and the walking exercise and the handful of malt i'm afraid you're a clumsy sort of rascal naylor though you do your best i'm a rascal myself though i don't often confess it and i assure you that your conceptions are crude as yet still that isn't a bad notion in its way that of drugging a man and drowning him in your cistern up there in the roof when you prefer not to pay him his winnings it has the very considerable merit that after the body has been fished out of any river you may choose to fling it into the stupid coroner's jury will never suspect that it was drowned in any other water but that just as happened in the lawrence case for instance you remember that eh so do i very well and it was because i remembered that that i paid you this visit to night but you do the thing much too clumsily really when i saw a light up here in broad daylight i knew at once it must be left for some purpose to be executed later in the evening and when i saw the steps carefully placed at the same time after the servant had been sent out why the thing was plain remembering as i did the curious coincidence that mr lawrence was drowned the very evening he had been here to take away his winnings the steps must be intended to give access to the roof where there was probably a tank to feed the bath and what more secret place to drown a man than there and what easier place so long as the man was well drugged and there was a strong lid to the tank as i say naylor your notion was meritorious but your execution was wretched perhaps because you had no notion that i was watching you he paused and then went on come he said collect your scattered faculties both of you i shan't hand you over to the police for this little invention of yours it's too useful an invention to give away to the police i shan't hand you over that is to say as long as you do as i tell you if you get mutinous you shall hang both of you for the lawrence business i may as well tell you that i'm a bit of a scoundrel myself by way of profession i don't boast about it but it's well to be frank in making arrangements of this sort i'm going to take you into my service i employ a few agents and you and your tank may come in very handy from time to time but we must set it up with a few improvements in another house a house which hasn't quite such an awkward window and we mustn't execute our little suppressions so regularly on settling day it looks suspicious so as soon as you can get your faculties together we'll talk over this thing the man and the woman had exchanged glances during this speech and now naylor asked huskily jerking his thumb toward the man on the floor an' an' what about 'im what about him why get rid of him as soon as you like not that way though he pointed toward the ceiling trap it doesn't pay me and i'm master now besides what will people say when you tell the same tale at his inquest that you told at lawrence's no my friend bookmaking and murder don't assort together profitable as the combination may seem settling days are too regular and i'm not going to be your accomplice mind you are going to be mine do what you please with telfer leave him on somebody's doorstep if you like but i owe him fifteen hundred and i ain't got more than half of it i'll be ruined very likely dorrington returned placidly be ruined as soon as possible then and devote all your time to my business you're not to ornament the ring any longer remember you're to assist a private inquiry agent you and your wife and your charming tank repudiate the debt if you like it's a mere gaming transaction and there is no legal claim or leave him in the street and tell him he's been robbed please yourself as to this little roguery you may as well for it's the last you will do on your own account for the future your respectable talents will be devoted to the service of dorrington hicks private inquiry agents and if you don't give satisfaction that eminent firm will hang you with the assistance of the judge at the old bailey so settle your business yourselves and quickly for i've a good many things to arrange with you and dorrington watching them continually they took telfer out by the side gate in the garden wall and left him in a dark corner thus i learnt the history of the horrible tank that had so nearly ended my own life as i have already related clearly the naylors had changed their name to crofting on taking compulsory service with dorrington and mrs naylor was the repulsively thin woman who had drugged me with her coffee in the house at highgate the events i have just recorded took place about three years before i came to england in the meantime how many people whose deaths might be turned to profit had fallen victims to the murderous cunning of dorrington and his tools the case of the mirror of portugal iii the case of the mirror of portugal i whether or not this case has an historical interest is a matter of conjecture if it has none then the title i have given it is a misnomer but i think the conjecture that some historical interest attaches to it is by no means an empty one and all that can be urged against it is the common though not always declared error that romance expired fifty years at least ago and history with it this makes it seem improbable that the answer to an unsolved riddle of a century since should be found to day in an inquiry agent's dingy office in bedford street covent garden whether or not it has so been found the reader may judge for himself though the evidence stops far short of actual proof of the identity of the mirror of portugal with the stone wherewith this case was concerned but first as to the mirror of portugal this was a diamond of much and ancient fame it was of indian origin and it had lain in the possession of the royal family of portugal in the time of portugal's ancient splendour but three hundred years ago after the extinction of the early line of succession the diamond with other jewels fell into the possession of don antonio one of the half dozen pretenders who were then scrambling for the throne don antonio badly in want of money deposited the stone in pledge with queen elizabeth of england and never redeemed it thus it took its place as one of the english crown jewels and so remained till the overthrow and death of charles the first queen henrietta then carried it with her to france and there to obtain money to satisfy her creditors she sold it to the great cardinal mazarin he bequeathed it at his death to the french crown and among the crown jewels of france it once more found a temporary abiding place but once more it brought disaster with it in the shape of a revolution and again a king lost his head at the executioner's hands and in the riot and confusion of the great revolution of the mirror of portugal with other jewels vanished utterly where it went to and who took it nobody ever knew the mirror of portugal disappeared as suddenly and effectually as though fused to vapour by electric combustion so much for the famous mirror whether or not its history is germane to the narrative which follows probably nobody will ever certainly know but that dorrington considered that it was his notes on the case abundantly testify for some days before dorrington's attention was in any way given to this matter a poorly dressed and not altogether prepossessing frenchman had been haunting the staircase and tapping at the office door unsuccessfully attempting an interview with dorrington who happened to be out or busy whenever he called the man never asked for hicks dorrington's partner but this was very natural in the first place it was always dorrington who met all strangers and conducted all negotiations and in the second dorrington had just lately in a case regarding a secret society in soho made his name much known and respected not to say feared in the foreign colony of that quarter wherefore it was likely that a man who bore evidence of residence in that neighbourhood should come with the name of dorrington on his tongue the weather was cold but the man's clothes were thin and threadbare and he had no overcoat his face was of a broad low type coarse in feature and small in forehead and he wore the baggy black linen peaked cap familiar on the heads of men of his class in parts of paris he had called unsuccessfully as i have said sometimes once sometimes more frequently on each of three or four days before he succeeded in seeing dorrington at last however he intercepted him on the stairs as dorrington arrived at about eleven in the morning pardon m'sieu he said laying his finger on dorrington's arm it is m dorrington not well suppose it is what then dorrington never admitted his identity to a stranger without first seeing good cause i 'ave beesness very great beesness beesness of a large profit for you if you please to take it where shall i tell it come in here dorrington replied leading the way to his private room the man did not look like a wealthy client but that signified nothing dorrington had made profitable strokes after introductions even less promising the man followed dorrington pulled off his cap and sat in the chair dorrington pointed at in the first place said dorrington what's your name ah yas but before all that i tell is for ourselves alone is it not it is all in confidence eh yes yes of course dorrington answered with virtuous impatience whatever is said in this room is regarded as strictly confidential what's your name jacques bouvier living at little norham street soho and now the business you speak of the beesness is this my cousin lon bouvier he is coquin a rrrascal very likely he has a great jewel it is i have no doubt a diamond of a great value it is not his there is no right of him to it it should be mine if you get it for me one quarter of it in money shall be yours and it is of a great value where does your cousin live what is he beck street soho he has a shop a caf caf des bons camarades and he give me not a crrrust if i starve it scarcely seemed likely that the keeper of a little foreign caf in a back street of soho would be possessed of a jewel a quarter of whose value would be prize enough to tempt dorrington to take a new case up but dorrington bore with the man a little longer what is this jewel you talk of he asked and if you don't know enough about it to be quite sure whether it is a diamond or not what do you know listen the stone i have never seen but that it is a diamond makes probable what else so much value and it is much value that gives my cousin so great care and trouble cochon listen i relate to you my father he was charcoal burner at bonneuil department of seine my uncle the father of my cousin also was charcoal burner the grandfather charcoal burner also and his father and his grandfather before him all burners of charcoal at bonneuil now perceive the father of my grandfather was of the great revolution a young man great among those who stormed the bastille the tuileries the htel de ville brave and a leader now when palaces were burnt and heads were falling there was naturally much confusion things were lost things of large value what more natural while so many were losing the head from the shoulders it was not strange that some should lose jewels from the neck and when these things were lost who might have a greater right to keep them than the young men of the revolution the brave and the leaders they who did the work if you mean that your respectable great grandfather stole something you needn't explain it any more dorrington said i quite understand i do not say stole when there is a great revolution a thing is anybody's but it would not be convenient to tell of it at the time for the new government might believe everything to be its own these things i do not know you will understand i suggest an explanation that is all after the great revolution my great grandfather lives alone and quiet and burns the charcoal as before why the jewel is too great to sell so soon so he gives it to his son and dies he also my grandfather still burns the charcoal again why because as i believe he is too poor too common a man to go about openly to sell so great a stone more he loves the stone for with that he is always rich and so he burns his charcoal and lives contented as his father had done and he is rich and nobody knows it what then he has two sons when he dies which son does he leave the stone to each one says it is for himself that is natural i say it was for my father but however that may make itself my father dies suddenly he falls in a pit by accident says his brother not by accident says my mother and soon after she dies too by accident too perhaps you ask oh yes by accident too no doubt the man laughed disagreeably so i am left alone a little boy to burn charcoal when i am a bigger boy there comes the great war and the prussians besiege paris my uncle he burning charcoal no more goes at night and takes things from the dead prussians perhaps they are not always quite dead when he finds them perhaps he makes them so be that as it will the prussians take him one dark night and they stand him against a garden wall and pif paf they shoot him that is all of my uncle but he dies a rich man and nobody knows what does his wife do she has the jewel and she has a little money that has been got from the dead prussians so when the war is over she comes to london with my cousin the bad lon and she has the caf caf des bons camarades and lon grows up and his mother dies and he has the caf and with the jewel is a rich man nobody knowing nobody but me but figure to yourself shall i burn charcoal and starve at bonneuil with a rich cousin in london rich with a diamond that should be mine not so i come over and lon at first he lets me wait at the caf but i do not want that there is the stone and i can never see it never find it so one day lon finds me looking in a box and chut out i go i tell lon that i will share the jewel with him or i will tell the police he laughs at me there is no jewel he says i am mad i do not tell the police for that is to lose it altogether but i come here and i offer you one quarter of the diamond if you shall get it steal it for you eh jacques bouvier shrugged his shoulders the word is as you please he said the jewel is not his and if there is delay it will be gone already he goes each day to hatton garden leaving his wife to keep the caf des bons camarades perhaps he is selling the jewel to day who can tell so that it will be well that you begin at once very well my fee in advance will be twenty guineas what dieu i have no money i tell you get the diamond and there is one quarter twenty five per cent for you but what guarantee do you give that this story of yours isn't all a hoax can you expect me to take everything on trust and work for nothing the man rose and waved his arms excitedly it is true i say he exclaimed it is a fortune there is much for you and it will pay i have no money or you should have some what can i do you will lose the chance if you are foolish it rather seems to me my friend that i shall be foolish to give valuable time to gratifying your cock and bull fancies see here now i'm a man of business and my time is fully occupied you come here and waste half an hour or more of it with a long rigmarole about some valuable article that you say yourself you have never seen and you don't even know whether it is a diamond or not you wander at large over family traditions which you may believe yourself or may not you have no money and you offer no fee as a guarantee of your bon fides and the sum of the thing is that you ask me to go and commit a theft to purloin an article you can't even describe and then to give you three quarters of the proceeds no my man you have made a mistake you must go away from here at once and if i find you hanging about my door again i shall have you taken away very summarily do you understand now go away mon dieu but i've no more time to waste dorrington answered opening the door and pointing to the stairs if you stay here any longer you'll get into trouble illustration sir you are a ver' big fool a fool jacques bouvier walked out muttering and agitating his hands at the top stair he turned and almost too angry for words burst out sir you are a ver' big fool a fool but dorrington slammed the door he determined however if he could find a little time to learn a little more of lon bouvier perhaps to put a man to watch at the caf des bons camarades that the keeper of this place in soho should go regularly to hatton garden the diamond market was curious and dorrington had met and analysed too many extraordinary romances to put aside unexamined jacques bouvier's seemingly improbable story but having heard all the man had to say it had clearly been his policy to get rid of him in the way he had done dorrington was quite ready to steal a diamond or anything else of value if it could be done quite safely but he was no such fool as to give three quarters of his plunder or any of it to somebody else so that the politic plan was to send jacques bouvier away with the impression that his story was altogether pooh poohed and was to be forgotten ii dorrington left his office late that day and the evening being clear though dark he walked toward conduit street by way of soho he thought to take a glance at the caf des bons camarades on his way without being observed should jacques bouvier be in the vicinity beck street soho was a short and narrow street lying east and west and joining two of the larger streets that stretch north and south across the district it was even a trifle dirtier than these by streets in that quarter are wont to be the caf des bons camarades was a little green painted shop the window whereof was backed by muslin curtains while upon the window itself appeared in florid painted letters the words cuisine franaise it was the only shop in the street with the exception of a small coal and firewood shed at one end the other buildings consisting of the side wall of a factory now closed for the night and a few tenement houses an alley entrance apparently the gate of a stable yard stood next the caf as dorrington walked by the steamy window he was startled to hear his own name and some part of his office address spoken in excited tones somewhere in this dark alley entrance and suddenly a man rather well dressed and cramming a damaged tall hat on his head as he went darted from the entrance and ran in the direction from which dorrington had come a stoutly built frenchwoman carrying on her face every indication of extreme excitement watched him from the gateway and dorrington made no doubt that it was in her voice that he had heard his name mentioned he walked briskly to the end of the short street turned at the end and hurried round the block of houses in hope to catch another sight of the man presently he saw him running in old compton street and making in the direction of charing cross road dorrington mended his pace and followed the man emerged where shaftesbury avenue meets charing cross road and as he crossed hesitated once or twice as though he thought of hailing a cab but decided rather to trust his own legs he hastened through the byways to st martin's lane and dorrington now perceived that one side and half the back of his coat was dripping with wet mud also it was plain as dorrington had suspected that his destination was dorrington's own office in bedford street so the follower broke into a trot and at last came upon the muddy man wrenching at the bell and pounding at the closed door of the house in bedford street just as the housekeeper began to turn the lock m'sieu dorrington m'sieu dorrington the man exclaimed excitedly as the door was opened 'e's gawn 'ome long ago the caretaker growled you might 'a known that oh 'ere 'e is though good evenin' sir i am mr dorrington the inquiry agent said politely can i do anything for you ah yes it is important at once i am robbed just step upstairs then and tell me about it dorrington had but begun to light the gas in his office when his visitor broke out i am robbed m'sieu dorrington robbed by my cousin coquin rrrobbed of everything rrrobbed i tell you he seemed astonished to find the other so little excited by the intelligence let me take your coat dorrington said calmly you've had a downer in the mud i see why what's this he smelt the collar as he went toward a hat peg chloroform ah yes it is that rrrascal jacques i will tell you this evening i go into the gateway next my house caf des bons camarades to enter by the side door and paf a shawl is fling across my face from behind it is pull tight there is a knee in my back i can catch nothing with my hand it smell all hot in my throat i choke and i fall over there is no more i wake up and i see my wife and she take me into the house i am all muddy and tired but i feel and i have lost my property it is a diamond and my cousin jacques he has done it are you sure of that sure oh yes it is certain i tell you certain then why not inform the police the visitor was clearly taken aback by this question he faltered and looked searchingly in dorrington's face that is not always the convenient way he said i would rather that you do it it is the diamond that i want not to punish my cousin thief that he is dorrington mended a quill with ostentatious care saying encouragingly as he did so i can quite understand that you may not wish to prosecute your cousin only to recover the diamond you speak of also i can quite understand that there may be reasons family reasons perhaps perhaps others which may render it inadvisable to make even the existence of the jewel known more than absolutely necessary for instance there may be other claimants monsieur lon bouvier the visitor started you know my name then he asked how is that dorrington smiled the smile of a sphinx m bouvier he said it is my trade to know everything everything he put the pen down and gazed whimsically at the other my agents are everywhere you talk of the secret agent of the russian police they are nothing it is my trade to know all things for instance dorrington unlocked a drawer and produced a book it was but an office diary and turning its pages went on let me see b it is my trade for instance to know about the caf des bons camarades established by the late madame bouvier now unhappily deceased it is my trade to know of madame bouvier at bonneuil where the charcoal was burnt and where madame bouvier was unfortunately left a widow at the time of the siege of paris because of some lamentable misunderstanding of her husband's with a file of prussian soldiers by an orchard wall it is my trade moreover to know something of the sad death of that husband's brother in a pit and of the later death of his widow oh yes more turning a page attentively as though following detailed notes it is my trade to know of a little quarrel between those brothers it might even have been about a diamond just such a diamond as you have come about to night and of jewels missed from the tuileries in the great revolution a hundred years ago he shut the book with a bang and returned it to its place and there are other things too many to talk about he said crossing his legs and smiling calmly at the frenchman during this long pretence at reading bouvier had slid farther and farther forward on his chair till he sat on the edge his eyes staring wide and his chin dropped he had been pale when he arrived but now he was of a leaden gray he said not a word dorrington laughed lightly come he said i see you are astonished very likely very few of the people and families whose dossiers we have here he waved his hand generally about the room are aware of what we know but we don't make a song of it i assure you unless it is for the benefit of clients a client's affairs are sacred of course and our resources are at his disposal do i understand that you become a client bouvier sat a little farther back on his chair and closed his mouth a a yes he answered at length with an effort moistening his lips as he spoke that is why i come ah now we shall understand each other dorrington replied genially opening an ink pot and clearing his blotting pad we're not connected with the police here or anything of that sort and except so far as we can help them we leave our client's affairs alone you wish to be a client and you wish me to recover your lost diamond very well that is business the first thing is the usual fee in advance twenty guineas will you write a cheque bouvier had recovered some of his self possession and he hesitated it is a large fee he said large nonsense it is the sort of fee that might easily be swallowed up in half a day's expenses and besides a rich diamond merchant like yourself bouvier looked up quickly diamond merchant he said i do not understand i have lost my diamond there was but one and yet you go to hatton garden every day what cried bouvier letting his hand fall from the table you know that too of course dorrington laughed easily it is my trade i tell you but write the cheque bouvier produced a crumpled and dirty cheque book and complied with many pauses looking up dazedly from time to time into dorrington's face now said dorrington tell me where you kept your diamond and all about it it was in an old little wooden box so bouvier not yet quite master of himself sketched an oblong of something less than three inches long by two broad the box was old and black my grandfather may have made it or his father the lid fitted very tight and the inside was packed with fine charcoal powder with the diamond resting in it the diamond oh it was great like that so he made another sketch roughly square an inch and a quarter across but it looked even much greater still so bright so wonderful it is easy to understand that my grandfather did not sell it beside the danger it is so beautiful a thing and it is such great riches all in one little box why should not a poor charcoal burner be rich in secret and look at his diamond and get all the few things he wants by burning his charcoal and there was the danger but that is long ago i am a man of beesness and i desired to sell it and be rich and that jacques he has stolen it let us keep to the point the diamond was in a box well where was the box on the outside of the box there were notches so and so round the box at each place there was a tight strong silk cord that is two cords the cords were round my neck under my shirt so and the box was under my arm just as a boy carries his satchel but high up in the armpit where i could feel it at all times to night when i come to myself my collar was broken at the stud see the cords were cut and all was gone you say your cousin jacques has done this how do you know ah but who else who else could know and he has always tried to steal it at first i let him wait at the caf des bons camarades what does he do he prys about my house and opens drawers and i catch him at last looking in a box and i turn him out and he calls me a thief sacr he goes i have no more of him and so he does this very well write down his name and address on this piece of paper and your own bouvier did so and now tell me what you have been doing at hatton garden well it was a very great diamond i could not go to the first man and show it to sell i must make myself known it never struck you to get the stone cut in two did it eh what nom de chien no he struck his knee with his hand fool why did i not think of that but still he grew more thoughtful i should have to show it to get it cut and i did not know where to go and the value would have been less just so but it's the regular thing to do i may tell you in cases like this but go on about hatton garden you know i thought that i must make myself known among the merchants of diamonds and then perhaps i should learn the ways and one day be able to sell as it was i knew nothing nothing at all i waited and i saved money in the caf then when i could do it i dressed well and went and bought some diamonds of a dealer very little diamonds a little trayful for twenty pounds and i try to sell them again but i have paid too much i can only sell for fifteen pounds then i buy more and sell them for what i give then i take an office in hatton garden that is i share a room with a dealer and there is a partition between our desks my wife attends the caf i go to hatton garden to buy and sell it loses me money but i must lose till i can sell the great diamond i get to know the dealers more and more and then to night as i go home he finished with an expressive shrug and a wave of the hand yes yes i think i see dorrington said as to the diamond again it doesn't happen to be a blue diamond does it no pure white perfect dorrington had asked because two especially famous diamonds disappeared from among the french crown jewels at the time of the great revolution one blue the greatest coloured diamond ever known and the other the mirror of portugal bouvier's reply made it plain that it was certainly not the first which he had just lost come dorrington said i will call and inspect the scene of your disaster i haven't dined yet and it must be well past nine o'clock now they returned to beck street there were gates at the dark entry by the side of the caf des bons camarades but they were never shut bouvier explained dorrington had them shut now however and a lantern was produced the paving was of rough cobble stones deep in mud do many people come down here in the course of an evening dorrington asked never anybody but myself very well stand away at your side door illustration dorrington with the lantern explored the muddy cobble stones bouvier and his wife stood huddled and staring on the threshold of the side door while dorrington with the lantern explored the muddy cobble stones the pieces of a broken bottle lay in a little heap and a cork lay a yard away from them dorrington smelt the cork and then collected together the broken glass there were but four or five pieces from the little heap another piece of glass lay by itself a little way off and this also dorrington took up scrutinising it narrowly then he traversed the whole passage carefully stepping from bare stone to bare stone and skimming the ground with the lantern the mud lay confused and trackless in most places though the place where bouvier had been lying was indicated by an appearance of sweeping caused no doubt by his wife dragging him to his feet only one other thing beside the glass and cork did dorrington carry away as evidence and that the bouviers knew nothing of for it was the remembrance of the mark of a sharp small boot heel in more than one patch of mud between the stones will you object madame bouvier he asked as he handed back the lantern to show me the shoes you wore when you found your husband lying out here madame bouvier had no objection at all they were what she was then wearing and had worn all day she lifted her foot and exhibited one there was no need for a second glance it was a loose easy cashmere boot with spring sides and heels cut down flat for indoor comfort and this was at what time it was between seven and eight o'clock both agreed though they differed a little as to the exact time bouvier had recovered when his wife raised him had entered the house with her at once discovered his loss and immediately on his wife's advice set out to find dorrington whose name the woman had heard spoken of frequently among the visitors to the caf in connection with the affair of the secret society already alluded to he had felt certain that dorrington would not be at his office but trusted to be directed where to find him now dorrington asked of bouvier the woman had been called away tell me some more about your cousin where does he live in little norham street the third house from this end on the right and the back room at the top that is unless he has moved just lately has he been ill recently ill bouvier considered not that i can say no i have never heard of jacques being ill it seemed to strike him as an incongruous and new idea nothing has made him ill all his life he is too good in constitution i think does he wear spectacles spectacles mais non never why should he wear spectacles his eyes are good as mine very well now attend to morrow you must not go to hatton garden i will go for you if you see your cousin jacques you must say nothing take no notice let everything proceed as though nothing had happened leave all to me give me your address at hatton garden but what is it you must do there that is my business i do my business in my own way still i will give you a hint where is it that diamonds are sold in hatton garden as you so well know as i expect your cousin knows if he has been watching you then where will your cousin go to sell it hatton garden of course never mind what i shall do there to intercept it i am to be your new partner you understand bringing money into the business you must be ill and stay at home till you hear from me go now and write me a letter of introduction to the man who shares the office with you or i will write it if you like and you shall sign it what sort of a man is he very quiet a tall man perhaps english but perhaps not ever buy or sell diamonds with him once only it was the first time that is how i learned of the half office to let the letter was written and dorrington stuffed it carelessly into his pocket mr hamer is the name is it he said i fancy i have met him somewhere he is short sighted isn't he oh yes he is short sighted with pince nez not very well lately no i think not he takes medicine in the office but you will be careful eh he must not know do you think so perhaps i may tell him though tell him ciel no you must not tell people no shall i throw the whole case over and keep your deposit fee no no not that but it is foolish to tell to people i am to judge what is foolish and what wise m bouvier good evening good evening m dorrington good evening bouvier followed him out to the gate and will you tell me do you think there is a way to get the diamond have you any plan oh yes m bouvier i have a plan but as i have said that is my business it may be a successful plan or it may not that we shall see and and the dossier the notes that you so marvellously have written out in the book you read when this business is over you will destroy them eh you will not leave a clue the notes that i have in my books answered dorrington without relaxing a muscle of his face are my property for my own purposes and were mine before you came to me those relating to you are a mere item in thousands so long as you behave well m bouvier they will not harm you and as i said the confidences of a client are sacred to dorrington hicks but as to keeping them certainly i shall once more good evening even the stony faced dorrington could not repress a smile and something very like a chuckle as he turned the end of the street and struck out across golden square towards his rooms in conduit street the simple frenchman only half a rogue even less than half was now bamboozled and put aside as effectually as his cousin had been certainly there was a diamond and an immense one if only the bouvier tradition were true probably the famous mirror of portugal and nothing stood between dorrington and absolute possession of that diamond but an ordinary sort of case such as he dealt with every day and he had made bouvier pay a fee for the privilege of putting him completely on the track of it dorrington smiled again his dinner was spoilt by waiting but he troubled little of that he spread before him and examined again the pieces of glass and the cork the bottle had been a druggist's ordinary flat bottle graduated with dose marks and altogether seven inches high or thereabout it had without a doubt contained the chloroform wherewith lon bouvier had been assaulted as dorrington had judged from the smell of the cork the fact of the bottle being corked showed that the chloroform had not been bought all at once since in that case it would have been put up in a stoppered bottle more probably it had been procured in very small quantities ostensibly for toothache or something of that kind at different druggists and put together in this larger bottle which had originally been used for something else the bottle had been distinguished by a label the usual white label affixed by the druggist with directions as to taking the medicine and this label had been scraped off all except a small piece at the bottom edge by the right hand side whereon might be just distinguished the greater part of the letters n e the piece of glass that had lain a little way apart from the bottle was not a part of it as a casual observer might have supposed it was a fragment of a concave lens with a channel ground in the edge iii at ten precisely next morning as usual mr ludwig hamer mounted the stairs of the house in hatton garden wherein he rented half a room as office he was a tall fair man wearing thick convex pince nez he spoke english like a native and indeed he called himself an englishman though there were those who doubted the briticism of his name scarce had he entered his office when dorrington followed him the room had never been a very large one and now a partition divided it in two leaving a passage at one side only by the window on each side of this partition stood a small pedestal table a couple of chairs a copying press and the other articles usual in a meagrely furnished office dorrington strode past bouvier's half of the room and came upon hamer as he was hanging his coat on a peg the letter of introduction had been burnt since dorrington had only asked for it in order to get hamer's name and the hatton garden address without betraying to bouvier the fact that he did not already know all about it good morning mr hamer said dorrington loudly sorry to see you're not well he pointed familiarly with his stick at a range of medicine bottles on the mantelpiece but it's very trying weather of course you've been suffering from toothache i believe hamer seemed at first disposed to resent the loudness and familiarity of this speech but at the reference to toothache he started suddenly and set his lips chloroform's a capital thing for toothache mr hamer and for for other things i'm not in your line of business myself but i believe it has even been used in the diamond trade what do you mean asked hamer flushing angrily mean why bless me nothing more than i said by the way i'm afraid you dropped one of your medicine bottles last night i've brought it back though i'm afraid it's past repair it's a good job you didn't quite clear the label off before you took it out with you else i might have had a difficulty dorrington placed the fragments on the table you see you've just left the first letter of 'ec' in the druggist's address and the last 'n' of hatton garden just before it there doesn't happen to be any other garden in ec district that i know of nor does the name of any other thoroughfare end in n they are mostly streets or lanes or courts you see and there seems to be only one druggist in hatton garden capital fellow no doubt the one whose name and address i observe on those bottles on the mantelpiece dorrington stood with his foot on a chair and tapped his knee carelessly with his stick hamer dropped into the other chair and regarded him with a frown though his face was pale presently he said in a strained voice well yes there is something else mr hamer as you appear to suggest i see you're wearing a new pair of glasses this morning pity you broke the others last night but i've brought the piece you left behind he gathered up the broken bottle and held up the piece of concave lens i think after all it's really best to use a cord with pince nez it's awkward and it catches in things i know but it saves a breakage and you're liable to get the glasses knocked off you know in certain circumstances hamer sprang to his feet with a snarl slammed the door locked it and turned on dorrington but now dorrington had a revolver in his hand though his manner was as genial as ever illustration dorrington had a revolver in his hand yes yes he said best to shut the door of course people listen don't they but sit down again i'm not anxious to hurt you and as you will perceive you're quite unable to hurt me what i chiefly came to say is this last evening my client m lon bouvier of this office and the caf des bons camarades was attacked in the passage adjoining his house by a man who was waiting for him with a woman was it really mrs hamer but there i won't ask keeping watch he was robbed of a small old wooden box containing charcoal and a diamond my name is dorrington firm of dorrington hicks which you may have heard of that's my card i've come to take away that diamond hamer was pale and angry but in his way was almost as calm as dorrington he put down the card without looking at it i don't understand you he said how do you know i've got it come come mr hamer dorrington replied rubbing the barrel of his revolver on his knee that's hardly worthy of you you're a man of business with a head on your shoulders the sort of man i like doing business with in fact men like ourselves needn't trifle i've shown you most of the cards i hold though not all i assure you i'll tell you if you like all about your little tour round among the druggists with the convenient toothache all about the evenings on which you watched bouvier home and so on but really need we as men of the world descend to such peddling detail well suppose i have got it and suppose i refuse to give it you what then what then but why should we talk of unpleasant things you won't refuse you know do you mean you'd get it out of me by help of that pistol well said dorrington deliberately the pistol is noisy and it makes a mess and all that but it's a useful thing and i might do it with that you know in certain circumstances but i wasn't thinking of it there's a much less troublesome way which you're a slower man than i took you for mr hamer or perhaps you haven't quite appreciated me yet if i were to go to that window and call the police what with the little bits of evidence in my pocket and the other little bits that the druggists who sold the chloroform would give and the other bits in reserve that i prefer not to talk about just now there would be rather an awkwardly complete case of robbery with violence wouldn't there and you'd have to lose the diamond after all to say nothing of a little rest in gaol and general ruination that sounds very well but what about your client come now you call me a man of the world and i am one how will your client account for the possession of a diamond worth eighty thousand pounds or so he doesn't seem a millionaire the police would want to know about him as well as about me if you were such a fool as to bring them in where did he steal it eh dorrington smiled and bowed at the question that's a very good card to play mr hamer he said a capital card really to a superficial observer it might look like winning the trick but i think i can trump it he bent farther forward and tapped the table with the pistol barrel suppose i don't care one solitary dump what becomes of my client suppose i don't care whether he goes to gaol or stays out of it in short suppose i prefer my own interests to his ho ho hamer cried i begin to understand you want to grab the diamond for yourself then i haven't said anything of the kind mr hamer dorrington replied suavely i have simply demanded the diamond which you stole last night and i have mentioned an alternative oh yes yes but we understand one another come we'll arrange this how much do you want dorrington stared at him stonily i i beg your pardon he said but i don't understand i want the diamond you stole but come now we'll divide bouvier had no right to it and he's out you and i perhaps haven't much right to it legally but it's between us and we're both in the same position pardon me dorrington replied silkily but there you mistake we are not in the same position by a long way you are liable to an instant criminal prosecution i have simply come authorised by my client who bears all the responsibility to demand a piece of property which you have stolen that is the difference between our positions mr hamer come now a policeman is just standing opposite shall i open the window and call him or do you give in oh i give in i suppose hamer groaned but you're a deal too hard a man of your abilities shouldn't be so mean that's right and reasonable dorrington answered briskly the wise man is the man who knows when he is beaten and saves further trouble you may not find me so mean after all but i must have the stone first i hold the trumps and i'm not going to let the other player make conditions where's the diamond it isn't here it's at home you'll have to get it out of mrs hamer shall i go and wire to her no no said dorrington that's not the way we'll just go together and take mrs hamer by surprise i think i mustn't let you out of sight you know come we'll get a hansom is it far bessborough street pimlico you'll find mrs hamer has a temper of her own well well we all have our failings but before we start now observe for a moment dorrington was stern and menacing you wriggled a little at first but that was quite natural now you've given in and at the first sign of another wriggle i stop it once and for all understand no tricks now they entered a hansom at the door hamer was moody and silent at first but under the influence of dorrington's gay talk he opened out after a while well he said you're far the cleverest of the three no doubt and perhaps in that way you deserve to win it's mighty smart for you to come in like this and push bouvier on one side and me on the other and both of us helpless but it's rough on me after having all the trouble don't be a bad loser man dorrington answered you might have had a deal more trouble and a deal more roughness too i assure you oh yes so i might i'm not grumbling but there's one thing has puzzled me all along where did bouvier get that stone from he inherited it it's the most important of the family jewels i assure you oh skittles i might have known you wouldn't tell me even if you knew yourself but i should like to know what sort of a duffer must it have been that let bouvier do him for that big stone bouvier of all men in the world why he was a record flat himself couldn't tell a diamond from a glass marble i should think why he used to buy peddling little trays of rotters in the garden at twice their value and then he'd sell them for what he could get i knew very well he wasn't going on systematically dropping money like that for no reason at all he had some axe to grind that was plain and after a while he got asking timid questions as to the sale of big diamonds and how it was done and who bought them and all that that put me on it at once all this buying and selling at a loss was a blind he wanted to get into the trade to sell stolen diamonds that was clear and there was some value in them too else he couldn't afford to waste months of time and lose money every day over it so i kept my eye on him i noticed when he put his overcoat on and thought i wasn't looking he would settle a string of some sort round his neck under his shirt collar and feel to pack up something close under his armpit then i just watched him home and saw the sort of shanty he lived in i mentioned these things to mrs h and she was naturally indignant at the idea of a chap like bouvier having something valuable in a dishonest way and agreed with me that if possible it ought to be got from him if only in the interests of virtue hamer laughed jerkily so at any rate we determined to get a look at whatever it was hanging round his neck and we made the arrangements you know about it seemed to me that bouvier was pretty sure to lose it before long one way or another if it had any value at all to judge by the way he was done in other matters but i assure you i nearly fell down like bouvier himself when i saw what it was no wonder we left the bottle behind where i'd dropped it after soaking the shawl i wonder i didn't leave the shawl itself and my hat and everything i assure you we sat up half last night looking at that wonderful stone no doubt i shall have a good look at it myself i assure you here is bessborough street which is the number they alighted and entered a house rather smaller than those about it ask mrs hamer to come here said hamer gloomily to the servant the men sat in the drawing room presently mrs hamer entered a shortish sharp keen eyed woman of forty five this is mr dorrington said hamer of dorrington hicks private detectives he wants us to give him that diamond the little woman gave a sort of involuntary bounce and exclaimed what diamond what d'ye mean oh it's no good maria hamer answered dolefully i've tried it every way myself one comfort is we're safe as long as we give it up here he added turning to dorrington show her some of your evidence that'll convince her very politely dorrington brought forth with full explanations the cork and the broken glass while mrs hamer biting hard at her thin lips grew shinier and redder in the face every moment and her hard gray eyes flashed fury and you let this man she burst out to her husband when dorrington had finished you let this man leave your office with these things in his possession after he had shown them to you and you as big as he is and bigger coward my dear you don't appreciate mr dorrington's forethought hang it i made preparations for the very line of action you recommend but he was ready he brought out a very well kept revolver and he has it in his pocket now mrs hamer only glared speechless with anger you might just get mr dorrington a whisky and soda maria hamer pursued with a slight lift of the eyebrows which he did not intend dorrington to see the woman was on her feet in a moment thank you no interposed dorrington rising also i won't trouble you i'd rather not drink anything just now and although i fear i may appear rude i can't allow either of you to leave the room in short he added i must stay with you both till i get the diamond and this man bouvier asked mrs hamer what is his right to the stone really i don't feel competent to offer an opinion do you know dorrington answered sweetly to tell the truth m bouvier doesn't interest me very much no go maria growled hamer i've tried it all the fact is we've got to give dorrington the diamond if we don't he'll just call in the police then we shall lose diamond and everything else too he doesn't care what becomes of bouvier he's got us that's what it is he won't even bargain to give us a share mrs hamer looked quickly up oh but that's nonsense she said we've got the thing we ought at least to say halves her sharp eyes searched dorrington's face but there was no encouragement in it i am sorry to disappoint a lady he said but this time it is my business to impose terms not to submit to them come the diamond well you'll give us something surely the woman cried nothing is sure madam except that you will give me that diamond or face a policeman in five minutes the woman realised her helplessness well she said much good may it do you you'll have to come and get it i'm keeping it somewhere else i'll go and get my hat again dorrington interposed i think we'll send your servant for the hat he said reaching for the bell rope i'll come wherever you like but i shall not leave you till this affair is settled i promise you and as i reminded your husband a little time ago you'll find tricks come expensive the servant brought mrs hamer's hat and cloak and that lady put them on her eyes ablaze with anger dorrington made the pair walk before him to the front door and followed them into the street now he said where is this place remember no tricks mrs hamer turned towards vauxhall bridge it's just over by upper kennington lane she said not far she paced out before them dorrington and hamer following the former affable and business like the latter apparently a little puzzled when they came about the middle of the bridge the woman turned suddenly come mr dorrington she said in a more subdued voice than she had yet used i give in it's no use trying to shake you off i can see i have the diamond with me here she put a little old black wooden box in his hand he made to open the lid which fitted tightly and at that moment the woman pulling her other hand free from under her cloak flung away over the parapet something that shone like fifty points of electric light illustration there's your diamond you dirty thief there it goes she screamed aloud pointing with her finger there's your diamond you dirty thief you bully go after it now you spy the great diamond made a curve of glitter and disappeared into the river for the moment dorrington lost his cool temper he seized the woman by the arm do you know what you've done you wild cat he exclaimed yes i do the woman screamed almost foaming with passion while boys began to collect though there had been but few people on the bridge yes i do and now you can do what you please you thief you bully dorrington was calm again in a moment he shrugged his shoulders and turned away hamer was frightened he came at dorrington's side and faltered i i told you she had a temper what will you do dorrington forced a laugh oh nothing he said what can i do locking you up now wouldn't fetch the diamond back and besides i'm not sure that mrs hamer won't attend to your punishment faithfully enough and he walked briskly away what did she do bill asked one boy of another why didn't ye see she chucked that man's watch in the river garn that wasn't his watch interrupted a third it was a little glass tumbler i see it have you got my diamond asked the agonised lon bouvier of dorrington a day later no i have not dorrington replied drily nor has your cousin jacques but i know where it is and you can get it as easily as i mon dieu where at the bottom of the river thames exactly in the centre rather to the right of vauxhall bridge looking from this side i expect it will be rediscovered in some future age when the bed of the thames is a diamond field the rest of bouvier's savings went in the purchase of a boat and in this with a pail on a long rope he was very busy for some time afterward but he only got a great deal of mud into his boat the affair of the avalanche bicycle and tyre co limited iv the affair of the avalanche bicycle and tyre co limited i cycle companies were in the market everywhere immense fortunes were being made in a few days and sometimes little fortunes were being lost to build them up mining shares were dull for a season and any company with the word cycle or tyre in its title was certain to attract capital no matter what its prospects were like in the eyes of the expert all the old private cycle companies suddenly were offered to the public and their proprietors already rich men built themselves houses on the riviera bought yachts ran racehorses and left business for ever sometimes the shareholders got their money's worth sometimes more sometimes less sometimes they got nothing but total loss but still the game went on one could never open a newspaper without finding displayed at large the prospectus of yet another cycle company with capital expressed in six figures at least often in seven solemn old dailies into whose editorial heads no new thing ever found its way till years after it had been forgotten elsewhere suddenly exhibited the scandalous phenomenon of broken columns in their advertising sections and the universal prospectuses stretched outrageously across half or even all the page a thing to cause apoplexy in the bodily system of any self respecting manager of the old school in the midst of this excitement it chanced that the firm of dorrington hicks were engaged upon an investigation for the famous and long established indestructible bicycle and tricycle manufacturing company of london and coventry the matter was not one of sufficient intricacy or difficulty to engage dorrington's personal attention and it was given to an assistant there was some doubt as to the validity of a certain patent having reference to a particular method of tightening the spokes and truing the wheels of a bicycle and dorrington's assistant had to make inquiries without attracting attention to the matter as to whether or not there existed any evidence either documentary or in the memory of veterans of the use of this method or anything like it before the year the assistant completed his inquiries and made his report to dorrington now i think i have said that from every evidence i have seen the chief matter of dorrington's solicitude was his own interest and just at this time he had heard as had others much of the money being made in cycle companies also like others he had conceived a great desire to get the confidential advice of somebody in the know advice which might lead him into the good thing desired by all the greedy who flutter about at the outside edge of the stock and share market for this reason dorrington determined to make this small matter of the wheel patent an affair of personal report he was a man of infinite resource plausibility and good companionship and there was money going in the cycle trade why then should he lose an opportunity of making himself pleasant in the inner groves of that trade and catch whatever might come his way information syndicate shares directorships anything so that dorrington made himself master of his assistant's information and proceeded to the head office of the indestructible company on holborn viaduct resolved to become the entertaining acquaintance of the managing director on his way his attention was attracted by a very elaborately fitted cycle shop which his recollection told him was new the avalanche bicycle and tyre company was the legend gilt above the great plate glass window and in the window itself stood many brilliantly enamelled and plated bicycles each labelled on the frame with the flaming red and gold transfer of the firm and in the midst of all was another bicycle covered with dried mud of which however sufficient had been carefully cleared away to expose a similar glaring transfer to those that decorated the rest with a placard announcing that on this particular machine somebody had ridden some incredible distance on bad roads in very little more than no time at all a crowd stood about the window and gaped respectfully at the placard the bicycles the transfers and the mud though they paid little attention to certain piles of folded white papers endorsed in bold letters with the name of the company with the suffix limited and the word prospectus in bloated black letter below these however dorrington observed at once for he had himself that morning in common with several thousand other people received one by post also half a page of his morning paper had been filled with a copy of that same prospectus and the afternoon had brought another copy in the evening paper in the list of directors there was a titled name or two together with a few unknown names doubtless the practical men and below this list there were such positive promises of tremendous dividends backed up and proved beyond dispute by such ingenious piles of business like figures every line of figures referring to some other line for testimonials to its perfect genuineness and accuracy that any reasonable man it would seem must instantly sell the hat off his head and the boots off his feet to buy one share at least and so make his fortune for ever true the business was but lately established but that was just it it had rushed ahead with such amazing rapidity as was natural with an avalanche that it had got altogether out of hand and orders couldn't be executed at all wherefore the proprietors were reluctantly compelled to let the public have some of the luck this was thursday the share list was to be opened on monday morning and closed inexorably at four o'clock on tuesday afternoon with a merciful extension to wednesday morning for the candidates for wealth who were so unfortunate as to live in the country so that it behoved everybody to waste no time lest he be numbered among the unlucky whose subscription money should be returned in full failing allotment the prospectus did not absolutely say it in so many words but no rational person could fail to feel that the directors were fervently hoping that nobody would get injured in the rush dorrington passed on and reached the well known establishment of the indestructible bicycle company this was already a limited company of a private sort and had been so for ten years or more and before that the concern had had eight or nine years of prosperous experience the founder of the firm mr paul mallows was now the managing director and a great pillar of the cycling industry dorrington gave a clerk his card and asked to see mr mallows mr mallows was out it seemed but mr stedman the secretary was in and him dorrington saw mr stedman was a pleasant youngish man who had been a famous amateur bicyclist in his time and was still an enthusiast in ten minutes business was settled and dismissed and dorrington's tact had brought the secretary into a pleasant discursive chat with much exchange of anecdote dorrington expressed much interest in the subject of bicycling and seeing that stedman had been a racing man particularly as to bicycling races there'll be a rare good race on saturday i expect stedman said or rather he went on i expect the fifty miles record will go i fancy our man gillett is pretty safe to win but he'll have to move and i quite expect to see a good set of new records on our advertisements next week the next best man is lant the new fellow you know who rides for the 'avalanche' people let's see they're going to the public as a limited company aren't they dorrington asked casually stedman nodded with a little grimace you don't think it's a good thing perhaps dorrington said noticing the grimace is that so well stedman answered of course i can't say i don't know much about the firm nobody does as far as i can tell but they seem to have got a business together in almost no time that is if the business is as genuine as it looks at first sight but they want a rare lot of capital and then the prospectus well i've seen more satisfactory ones you know i don't say it isn't all right of course but still i shan't go out of my way to recommend any friends of mine to plunge on it you won't no i won't though no doubt they'll get their capital or most of it almost any cycle or tyre company can get subscribed just now and this 'avalanche' affair is both and it is so well advertised you know lant has been winning on their mounts just lately and they've been booming it for all they're worth by jove if they could only screw him up to win the fifty miles on saturday and beat our man gillett that would give them a push just at the correct moment too gillett's never been beaten yet at the distance you know but lant can't do it though as i have said he'll make some fast riding it'll be a race i tell you i should like to see it why not come see about it will you and perhaps you'd like to run down to the track after dinner this evening and see our man training awfully interesting i can tell you with all the pacing machinery and that will you come dorrington expressed himself delighted and suggested that stedman should dine with him before going to the track stedman for his part charmed with his new acquaintance as everybody was at a first meeting with dorrington assented gladly at that moment the door of stedman's room was pushed open and a well dressed middle aged man with a shaven flabby face appeared i beg pardon he said i thought you were alone i've just ripped my finger against the handle of my brougham door as i came in the screw sticks out have you a piece of sticking plaster he extended a bleeding finger as he spoke stedman looked doubtfully at his desk here is some court plaster dorrington exclaimed producing his pocket book i always carry it it's handier than ordinary sticking plaster how much do you want thanks an inch or so this is mr dorrington of messrs dorrington hicks mr mallows stedman said our managing director mr paul mallows mr dorrington dorrington was delighted to make mr mallows's acquaintance and he busied himself with a careful strapping of the damaged finger mr mallows had the large frame of a man of strong build who has had much hard bodily work but there hung about it the heavier softer flesh that told of a later period of ease and sloth ah mr mallows stedman said the bicycle's the safest thing after all dangerous things these broughams ah you younger men mr mallows replied with a slow and rounded enunciation you younger men can afford to be active we elders can afford a brougham dorrington added before the managing director began the next word just so and the bicycle does it all wonderful thing the bicycle dorrington had not misjudged his man and the oblique reference to his wealth flattered mr mallows dorrington went once more through his report as to the spoke patent and then mr mallows bade him good bye good day mr dorrington good day he said i am extremely obliged by your careful personal attention to this matter of the patent we may leave it with mr stedman now i think good day i hope soon to have the pleasure of meeting you again and with clumsy stateliness mr mallows vanished ii so you don't think the 'avalanche' good business as an investment dorrington said once more as he and stedman after an excellent dinner were cabbing it to the track no no stedman answered don't touch it there's better things than that coming along presently perhaps i shall be able to put you in for something you know a bit later but don't be in a hurry as to the 'avalanche' even if everything else were satisfactory there's too much 'booming' being done just now to please me all sorts of rumours you know of their having something 'up their sleeve' and so on mysterious hints in the papers and all that as to something revolutionary being in hand with the 'avalanche' people perhaps there is but why they don't fetch it out in view of the public subscription for shares is more than i can understand unless they don't want too much of a rush and as to that well they don't look like modestly shrinking from anything of that sort up to the present they were at the track soon after seven o'clock but gillett was not yet riding dorrington remarked that gillett appeared to begin late well stedman explained he's one of those fellows that afternoon training doesn't seem to suit unless it is a bit of walking exercise he just does a few miles in the morning and a spurt or two and then he comes on just before sunset for a fast ten or fifteen miles that is when he is getting fit for such a race as saturday's to night will be his last spin of that length before saturday because to morrow will be the day before the race to morrow he'll only go a spurt or two and rest most of the day they strolled about inside the track the two highly banked ends whereof seemed to a nearsighted person in the centre to be solid erect walls along the face of which the training riders skimmed fly fashion only three or four persons beside themselves were in the enclosure when they first came but in ten minutes' time mr paul mallows came across the track why said stedman to dorrington here's the governor it isn't often he comes down here but i expect he's anxious to see how gillett's going in view of saturday good evening mr mallows said dorrington i hope the finger's all right want any more plaster good evening good evening responded mr mallows heavily thank you the finger's not troubling me a bit he held it up still decorated by the black plaster your plaster remains you see i was a little careful not to fray it too much in washing that was all and mr mallows sat down on a light iron garden chair of which several stood here and there in the enclosure and began to watch the riding the track was clear and dusk was approaching when at last the great gillett made his appearance on the track he answered a friendly question or two put to him by mallows and stedman and then giving his coat to his trainer swung off along the track on his bicycle led in front by a tandem and closely attended by a triplet in fifty yards his pace quickened and he settled down into a swift even pace regular as clockwork sometimes the tandem and sometimes the triplet went to the front but gillett neither checked nor heeded as nursed by his pacers who were directed by the trainer from the centre he swept along mile after mile each mile in but a few seconds over the two minutes look at the action exclaimed stedman with enthusiasm just watch him not an ounce of power wasted there did you ever see more regular ankle work and did anybody ever sit a machine quite so well as that show me a movement anywhere above the hips ah said mr mallows gillett has a wonderful style a wonderful style really the men in the enclosure wandered about here and there on the grass watching gillett's riding as one watches the performance of a great piece of art which indeed was what gillett's riding was there were besides mallows stedman dorrington and the trainer two officials of the cyclists' union an amateur racing man named sparks the track superintendent and another man the sky grew darker and gloom fell about the track the machines became invisible and little could be seen of the riders across the ground but the row of rhythmically working legs and the white cap that gillett wore the trainer had just told stedman that there would be three fast laps and then his man would come off the track well mr stedman said mr mallows i think we shall be all right for saturday rather answered stedman confidently gillett's going great guns and steady as a watch the pace now suddenly increased the tandem shot once more to the front the triplet hung on the rider's flank and the group of swishing wheels flew round the track at a one fifty gait the spectators turned about following the riders round the track with their eyes and then swinging into the straight from the top bend the tandem checked suddenly and gave a little jump gillett crashed into it from behind and the triplet failing to clear wavered and swung and crashed over and along the track too all three machines and six men were involved in one complicated smash everybody rushed across the grass the trainer first then the cause of the disaster was seen lying on its side on the track with men and bicycles piled over and against it was one of the green painted light iron garden chairs that had been standing in the enclosure the triplet men were struggling to their feet and though much cut and shaken seemed the least hurt of the lot one of the men of the tandem was insensible and gillett who from his position had got all the worst of it lay senseless too badly cut and bruised and his left arm was broken the trainer was cursing and tearing his hair if i knew who'd done this stedman cried i'd pulp him with that chair oh that betting that betting wailed mr mallows hopping about distractedly see what it leads people into doing it can't have been an accident can it accident skittles a man doesn't put a chair on a track in the dark and leave it there by accident is anybody getting away there from the outside of the track no there's nobody he wouldn't wait till this he's clear off a minute ago and more here fielders shut the outer gate and we'll see who's about but there seemed to be no suspicious character indeed except for the ground man his boy gillett's trainer and a racing man who had just finished dressing in the pavilion there seemed to be nobody about beyond those whom everybody had seen standing in the enclosure but there had been ample time for anybody standing unnoticed at the outer rails to get across the track in the dark just after the riders had passed place the obstruction and escape before the completion of the lap the damaged men were helped or carried into the pavilion and the damaged machines were dragged after them i will give fifty pounds gladly more a hundred said mr mallows excitedly to anybody who will find out who put that chair on the track it might have ended in murder some wretched bookmaker i suppose who has taken too many bets on gillett as i've said a thousand times betting is the curse of all sport nowadays the governor excites himself a great deal about betting and bookmakers stedman said to dorrington as they walked toward the pavilion but between you and me i believe some of the 'avalanche' people are in this the betting bee is always in mallows's bonnet but as a matter of fact there's very little betting at all on cycle races and what there is is little more than a matter of half crowns or at most half sovereigns on the day of the race no bookmaker ever makes a heavy book first still there may be something in it this time of course but look at the 'avalanche' people with gillett away their man can certainly win on saturday and if only the weather keeps fair he can almost as certainly beat the record just at present the fifty miles is fairly easy and it's bound to go soon indeed our intention was that gillett should pull it down on saturday he was a safe winner bar accidents and it was good odds on his altering the record if the weather were any good at all with gillett out of it lant is just about as certain a winner as our man would be if all were well and there would be a boom for the 'avalanche' company on the very eve of the share subscription lant you must know was very second rate till this season but he has improved wonderfully in the last month or two since he has been with the 'avalanche' people let him win and they can point to the machine as responsible for it all 'here' they will say in effect 'is a man who could rarely get in front even in second class company till he rode an 'avalanche' now he beats the world's record for fifty miles on it and makes rings round the topmost professionals' why it will be worth thousands of capital to them of course the subscription of capital won't hurt us but the loss of the record may and to have gillett knocked out like this in the middle of the season is serious yes i suppose with you it is more than a matter of this one race of course and so it will be with the 'avalanche' company don't you see with gillett probably useless for the rest of the season lant will have it all his own way at anything over ten miles that'll help to boom up the shares and there'll be big profit made on trading in them oh i tell you this thing seems pretty suspicious to me look here said dorrington can you borrow a light for me and let me run over with it to the spot where the smash took place the people have cleared into the pavilion and i could go alone certainly will you have a try for the governor's hundred well perhaps but anyway there's no harm in doing you a good turn if i can while i'm here some day perhaps you'll do me one right you are i'll ask fielders the ground man a lantern was brought and dorrington betook himself to the spot where the iron chair still lay while stedman joined the rest of the crowd in the pavilion dorrington minutely examined the grass within two yards of the place where the chair lay and then crossing the track and getting over the rails did the same with the damp gravel that paved the outer ring the track itself was of cement and unimpressionable by footmarks but nevertheless he scrutinised that with equal care as well as the rails then he turned his attention to the chair it was as i have said a light chair made of flat iron strip bent to shape and riveted it had seen good service and its present coat of green paint was evidently far from being its original one also it was rusty in places and parts had been repaired and strengthened with cross pieces secured by bolts and square nuts some rusty and loose it was from one of these square nuts holding a cross piece that stayed the back at the top that dorrington secured some object it might have been a hair which he carefully transferred to his pocket book this done with one more glance round he betook himself to the pavilion a surgeon had arrived and he reported well of the chief patient it was a simple fracture and a healthy subject when dorrington entered preparations were beginning for setting the limb there was a sofa in the pavilion and the surgeon saw no reason for removing the patient till all was made secure found anything asked stedman in a low tone of dorrington dorrington shook his head not much he answered at a whisper i'll think over it later dorrington asked one of the cyclists' union officials for the loan of a pencil and having made a note with it immediately in another part of the room asked sparks the amateur to lend him another stedman had told mr mallows of dorrington's late employment with the lantern and the managing director now said quietly you remember what i said about rewarding anybody who discovered the perpetrator of this outrage mr dorrington well i was excited at the time but i quite hold to it it is a shameful thing you have been looking about the grounds i hear i hope you have come across something that will enable you to find something out nothing will please me more than to have to pay you i'm sure well dorrington confessed i'm afraid i haven't seen anything very big in the way of a clue mr mallows but i'll think a bit the worst of it is you never know who these betting men are do you once they get away there are so many and it may be anybody not only that but they may bribe anybody yes of course there's no end to their wickedness i'm afraid stedman suggests that trade rivalry may have had something to do with it but that seems an uncharitable view don't you think of course we stand very high and there are jealousies and all that but this is a thing i'm sure no firm would think of stooping to for a moment no it's betting that is at the bottom of this i fear and i hope mr dorrington that you will make some attempt to find the guilty parties presently stedman spoke to dorrington again here's something that may help you he said to begin with it must have been done by some one from the outside of the track why well at least every probability's that way everybody inside was directly interested in gillett's success excepting the union officials and sparks who's a gentleman and quite above suspicion as much so indeed as the union officials of course there was the ground man but he's all right i'm sure and the trainer oh that's altogether improbable altogether i was going to say and there's that other man who was standing about i haven't heard who he was right you are i don't know him either where is he now but the man had gone look here i'll make some quiet inquiries about that man stedman pursued i forgot all about him in the excitement of the moment i was going to say that although whoever did it could easily have got away by the gate before the smash came he might not have liked to go that way in case of observation in passing the pavilion in that case he could have got away and indeed he could have got into the grounds to begin with by way of one of those garden walls that bound the ground just by where the smash occurred if that were so he must either live in one of the houses or he must know somebody that does perhaps you might put a man to smell about along that road it's only a short one chisnall road's the name yes yes dorrington responded patiently there might be something in that by this time gillett's arm was in a starched bandage and secured by splints and a cab was ready to take him home mr mallows took stedman away with him expressing a desire to talk business and dorrington went home by himself he did not turn down chisnall road but he walked jauntily along toward the nearest cab stand and once or twice he chuckled for he saw his way to a delightfully lucrative financial operation in cycle companies without risk of capital the cab gained he called at the lodgings of two of his men assistants and gave them instant instructions then he packed a small bag at his rooms in conduit street and at midnight was in the late fast train for birmingham iii the prospectus of the avalanche bicycle and tyre company stated that the works were at exeter and birmingham exeter is a delightful old town but it can scarcely be regarded as the centre of the cycle trade neither is it in especially easy and short communication with birmingham it was the sort of thing that any critic anxious to pick holes in the prospectus might wonder at and so one of dorrington's assistants had gone by the night mail to inspect the works it was from this man that dorrington in birmingham about noon on the day after gillett's disaster received this telegram works here old disused cloth mills just out of town closed and empty but with big new signboard and notice that works now running are at birmingham agent says only deposit paid tenancy agreement not signed farrish the telegram increased dorrington's satisfaction for he had just taken a look at the birmingham works they were not empty though nearly so nor were they large and a man there had told him that the chief premises where most of the work was done were at exeter and the hollower the business the better prize he saw in store for himself he had already early in the morning indulged in a telegram on his own account though he had not signed it this was how it ran mallows upper sandown place london w fear all not safe here run down by train without fail thus it happened that at a little later than half past eight dorrington's other assistant watching the door of no upper sandown place saw a telegram delivered and immediately afterward mr paul mallows in much haste dashed away in a cab which was called from the end of the street the assistant followed in another mr mallows dismissed his cab at a theatrical wig maker's in bow street and entered when he emerged in little more than forty minutes' time none but a practised watcher who had guessed the reason of the visit would have recognised him he had not assumed the clumsy disguise of a false beard he was made up deftly his colour was heightened and his face seemed thinner there was no heavy accession of false hair but a slight crpe hair whisker at each side made a better and less pronounced disguise he seemed a younger healthier man the watcher saw him safely off to birmingham by the ten minutes past ten train and then gave dorrington note by telegraph of the guise in which mr mallows was travelling now this train was timed to arrive at birmingham at one which was the reason that dorrington had named it in the anonymous telegram the entrance to the avalanche works was by a large gate which was closed but which was provided with a small door to pass a man within was a yard and at a little before one o'clock dorrington pushed open the small door peeped and entered nobody was about in the yard and what little noise could be heard came from a particular part of the building on the right a pile of solid export crates stood to the left and these dorrington had noted at his previous call that morning as making a suitable hiding place for temporary use now he slipped behind them and awaited the stroke of one prompt at the hour a door on the opposite side of the yard swung open and two men and a boy emerged and climbed one after another through the little door in the big gate then presently another man not a workman but apparently a sort of overseer came from the opposite door which he carelessly let fall to behind him and he also disappeared through the little door which he then locked dorrington was now alone in the sole active works of the avalanche bicycle and tyre company limited he tried the door opposite and found it was free to open within he saw in a dark corner a candle which had been left burning and opposite him a large iron enamelling oven like an immense safe and round about on benches were strewn heaps of the glaring red and gold transfer which dorrington had observed the day before on the machines exhibited in the holborn viaduct window some of the frames had the label newly applied and others were still plain it would seem that the chief business of the avalanche bicycle and tyre company limited was the attaching of labels to previously nondescript machines but there was little time to examine further and indeed dorrington presently heard the noise of a key in the outer gate so he stood and waited by the enamelling oven to welcome mr mallows as the door was pushed open dorrington advanced and bowed politely mallows started guiltily but remembering his disguise steadied himself and asked gruffly well sir and who are you i answered dorrington with perfect composure i am mr paul mallows you may have heard of me in connection with the 'indestructible bicycle company' mallows was altogether taken aback but then it struck him that perhaps the detective anxious to win the reward he had offered in the matter of the gillett outrage was here making inquiries in the assumed character of the man who stood impenetrably disguised before him so after a pause he asked again a little less gruffly and what may be your business well said dorrington i did think of taking shares in this company i suppose there would be no objection to the managing director of another company taking shares in this no answered mallows wondering what all this was to lead to of course not i'm sure you don't think so eh dorrington as he spoke looked in the other's face with a sly leer and mallows began to feel altogether uncomfortable but there's one other thing dorrington pursued taking out his pocket book though still maintaining his leer in mallows's face one other thing and by the way will you have another piece of court plaster now i've got it out don't say no it's a pleasure to oblige you really and dorrington his leer growing positively fiendish tapped the side of his nose with the case of court plaster illustration tapped the side of his nose with the case mallows paled under the paint gasped and felt for support dorrington laughed pleasantly come come he said don't be frightened i admire your cleverness mr mallows and i shall arrange everything pleasantly as you will see and as to the court plaster if you'd rather not have it you needn't you have another piece on now i see why didn't you get them to paint it over at clarkson's they really did the face very well though and there again you were quite right such a man as yourself was likely to be recognised in such a place as birmingham and that would have been unfortunate for both of us both of us i assure you man alive don't look as though i was going to cut your throat i'm not i assure you you're a smart man of business and i happen to have spotted a little operation of yours that's all i shall arrange easy terms for you pull yourself together and talk business before the men come back here sit on this bench mallows staring amazedly in dorrington's face suffered himself to be led to a bench and sat on it now said dorrington the first thing is a little matter of a hundred pounds that was the reward you promised if i should discover who broke gillett's arm last night well i have do you happen to have any notes with you if not make it a cheque but but how i mean who who tut tut don't waste time mr mallows who why yourself of course i knew all about it before i left you last night though it wasn't quite convenient to claim the reward then for reasons you'll understand presently come that little hundred but what what proof have you i'm not to be bounced like this you know mr mallows was gathering his faculties again proof why man alive be reasonable suppose i have none none at all what difference does that make am i to walk out and tell your fellow directors where i have met you here or am i to have that hundred more am i to publish abroad that mr paul mallows is the moving spirit in the rotten 'avalanche bicycle company' well mallows answered reluctantly if you put it like that but i only put it like that to make you see things reasonably as a matter of fact your connection with this new company is enough to bring your little performance with the iron chair pretty near proof but i got at it from the other side see here you're much too clumsy with your fingers mr mallows first you go and tear the tip of your middle finger opening your brougham door and have to get court plaster from me then you let that court plaster get frayed at the edge and you still keep it on after that you execute your very successful chair operation when the eyes of the others are following the bicycles you take the chair in the hand with the plaster on it catching hold of it at the place where a rough loose square nut protrudes and you pitch it on to the track so clumsily and nervously that the nut carries away the frayed thread of the court plaster with it here it is you see still in my pocket book where i put it last night by the light of the lantern just a sticky black silk thread that's all i've only brought it to show you i'm playing a fair game with you of course i might easily have got a witness before i took the thread off the nut if i had thought you were likely to fight the matter but i knew you were not you can't fight you know with this bogus company business known to me so that i am only showing you this thread as an act of grace to prove that i have stumped you with perfect fairness and now the hundred here's a fountain pen if you want one well said mallows glumly i suppose i must then he took the pen and wrote the cheque dorrington blotted it on the pad of his pocket book and folded it away so much for that he said that's just a little preliminary you understand we've done these little things just as a guarantee of good faith not necessarily for publication though you must remember that as yet there's nothing to prevent it i've done you a turn by finding out who upset those bicycles as you so ardently wished me to do last night and you've loyally fulfilled your part of the contract by paying the promised reward though i must say that you haven't paid with all the delight and pleasure you spoke of at the time but i'll forgive you that and now that the little hors d'oeuvre is disposed of we'll proceed to serious business mallows looked uncomfortably glum but you mustn't look so ashamed of yourself you know dorrington said purposely misinterpreting his glumness it's all business you were disposed for a little side flutter so to speak a little speculation outside your regular business well you mustn't be ashamed of that no mallows observed assuming something of his ordinarily ponderous manner no of course not it's a little speculative deal everybody does it and there's a deal of money going precisely and since everybody does it and there is so much money going you are only making your share of course mr mallows was almost pompous by now of course dorrington coughed slightly well now do you know i am exactly the same sort of man as yourself if you don't mind the comparison i am disposed for a little side flutter so to speak a little speculation outside my regular business i also am not ashamed of it and since everybody does it and there is so much money going why i am thinking of making my share so we are evidently a pair and naturally intended for each other mr paul mallows here looked a little doubtful see here now dorrington proceeded i have lately taken it into my head to operate a little on the cycle share market that was why i came round myself about that little spoke affair instead of sending an assistant i wanted to know somebody who understood the cycle trade from whom i might get tips you see i'm perfectly frank with you well i have succeeded uncommonly well and i want you to understand that i have gone every step of the way by fair work i took nothing for granted and i played the game fairly when you asked me as you had anxious reason to ask if i had found anything i told you there was nothing very big and see what a little thing the thread was before i came away from the pavilion i made sure that you were really the only man there with black court plaster on his fingers i had noticed the hands of every man but two and i made an excuse of borrowing something to see those i saw your thin pretence of suspecting the betting men and i played up to it i have had a telegraphic report on your exeter works this morning a deserted cloth mills with nothing on it of yours but a signboard and only a deposit of rent paid there they referred to the works here here they referred to the works there it was very clever really also i have had a telegraphic report of your make up adventure this morning clarkson does it marvellously doesn't he and by the way that telegram bringing you down to birmingham was not from your confederate here as perhaps you fancied it was from me thanks for coming so promptly i managed to get a quiet look round here just before you arrived and on the whole the conclusion i come to as to the 'avalanche bicycle and tyre company limited' is this a clever man whom it gives me great pleasure to know with a bow to mallows conceives the notion of offering the public the very rottenest cycle company ever planned and all without appearing in it himself he finds what little capital is required his two or three confederates help to make up a board of directors with one or two titled guinea pigs who know nothing of the company and care nothing and the rest's easy a professional racing man is employed to win races and make records on machines which have been specially made by another firm perhaps it was the 'indestructible' who knows to a private order and afterwards decorated with the name and style of the bogus company on a transfer for ordinary sale bicycles of the 'trade' description are bought so much a hundred from the factors and put your own name on 'em they come cheap and they sell at a good price the profit pays all expenses and perhaps a bit over and by the time they all break down the company will be successfully floated the money the capital will be divided the moving spirit and his confederates will have disappeared and the guinea pigs will be left to stand the racket if there is a racket and the moving spirit will remain unsuspected a man of account in the trade all the time admirable all the work to be done at the 'works' is the sticking on of labels and a bit of enamelling excellent all round isn't that about the size of your operations well yes mallows answered a little reluctantly but with something of modest pride in his manner that was the notion since you speak so plainly and it shall be the notion all everything shall be as you have planned it with one exception which is this the moving spirit shall divide his plunder with me you but but why i gave you a hundred just now dear dear why will you harp so much on that vulgar little hundred that's settled and done with that's our little personal bargain in the matter of the lamentable accident with the chair we are now talking of bigger business not hundreds but thousands and not one of them but a lot come now a mind like yours should be wide enough to admit of a broad and large view of things if i refrain from exposing this charming scheme of yours i shall be promoting a piece of scandalous robbery very well then i want my promotion money in the regular way can i shut my eyes and allow a piece of iniquity like this to go on unchecked without getting anything by way of damages for myself perish the thought when all expenses are paid and the confederates are sent off with as little as they will take you and i will divide fairly mr mallows respectable brothers in rascality mind i might say we'd divide to begin with and leave you to pay expenses but i am always fair to a partner in anything of this sort i shall just want a little guarantee you know it's safest in such matters as these say a bill at six months for ten thousand pounds which is very low when a satisfactory division is made you shall have the bill back come i have a bill stamp ready being so much convinced of your reasonableness as to buy it this morning though it cost five pounds but that's nonsense you're trying to impose i'll give you anything reasonable half is out of the question what after all the trouble and worry and risk that i've had which would suffice for no more than to put you in gaol if i held up my finger but hang it be reasonable you're a mighty clever man and you've got me on the hip as i admit say ten per cent you're wasting time and presently the men will be back your choice is between making half or making none and going to gaol into the bargain choose but just consider choose mallows looked despairingly about him but really he said i want the money more than you think i for the last time choose mallows's despairing gaze stopped at the enamelling oven well well he said if i must i must i suppose but i warn you you may regret it oh dear no i'm not so pessimistic come you wrote a cheque now i'll write the bill 'six months after date pay to me or my order the sum of ten thousand pounds for value received' excellent value too i think there you are when the bill was written and signed mallows scribbled his acceptance with more readiness than might have been expected then he rose and said with something of brisk cheerfulness in his tone well that's done and the least said the soonest mended you've won it and i won't grumble any more i think i've done this thing pretty neatly eh come and see the 'works' every other part of the place was empty of machinery there were a good many finished frames and wheels bought separately and now in course of being fitted together for sale and there were many more complete bicycles of cheap but showy make to which nothing needed to be done but to fix the red and gold transfer of the avalanche company then mallows opened the tall iron door of the enamelling oven see this he said this is the enamelling oven get in and look round the frames and other different parts hang on the racks after the enamel is laid on and all those gas jets are lighted to harden it by heat do you see that deeper part there by the back go closer dorrington felt a push at his back and the door was swung to with a bang and the latch dropped he was in the dark trapped in a great iron chamber i warned you shouted mallows from without i warned you you might regret it and instantly dorrington's nostrils were filled with the smell of escaping gas he realised his peril on the instant mallows had given him the bill with the idea of silencing him by murder and recovering it he had pushed him into the oven and had turned on the gas it was dark but to light a match would mean death instantly and without the match it must be death by suffocation and poison of gas in a very few minutes to appeal to mallows was useless dorrington knew too much it would seem that at last a horribly fitting retribution had overtaken dorrington in death by a mode parallel to that which he and his creatures had prepared for others dorrington's victims had drowned in water or at least crofton's had for i never ascertained definitely whether anybody had met his death by the tank after the croftons had taken service with dorrington and now dorrington himself was to drown in gas the oven was of sheet iron fastened by a latch in the centre dorrington flung himself desperately against the door and it gave outwardly at the extreme bottom he snatched a loose angle iron with which his hand came in contact dashed against the door once more and thrust the iron through where it strained open then with another tremendous plunge he drove the door a little more outward and raised the angle iron in the crack then once more and raised it again he was near to losing his senses when with one more plunge the catch of the latch not designed for such treatment suddenly gave way the door flew open and dorrington blue in the face staring stumbling and gasping came staggering out into the fresher air followed by a gush of gas illustration hauled the struggling wretch across the room mallows had retreated to the rooms behind and thither dorrington followed him gaining vigour and fury at every step at sight of him the wretched mallows sank in a corner sighing and shivering with terror dorrington reached him and clutched him by the collar there should be no more honour between these two thieves now he would drag mallows forth and proclaim him aloud and he would keep that bill he hauled the struggling wretch across the room tearing off the crpe whiskers as he came while mallows supplicated and whined fearing that it might be the other's design to imprison him in the enamelling oven but at the door of the room against that containing the oven their progress came to an end for the escaped gas had reached the lighted candle and with one loud report the partition wall fell in half burying mallows where he lay and knocking dorrington over windows fell out of the building and men broke through the front gate climbed into the ruined rooms and stopped the still escaping gas when the two men and the boy returned with the conspirator who had been in charge of the works they found a crowd from the hardware and cycle factories thereabout surveying with great interest the spectacle of the extrication of mr paul mallows managing director of the indestructible bicycle company from the broken bricks mortar bicycles and transfers of the avalanche bicycle and tyre company limited and the preparations for carrying him to a surgeon's where his broken leg might be set as for dorrington a crushed hat and a torn coat were all his hurts beyond a few scratches and in a couple of hours it was all over birmingham and spreading to other places that the business of the avalanche bicycle and tyre company consisted of sticking brilliant labels on factors' bicycles bought in batches for the whole thing was thrown open to the general gaze by the explosion so that when next day lant won the fifty miles race in london he was greeted with ironical shouts of gum on yer transfer hi mind yer label where did you steal that bicycle sold yer shares and so forth somehow the avalanche bicycle and tyre company limited never went to allotment it was said that a few people in remote and benighted spots where news never came till it was in the history books had applied for shares but the bankers returned their money doubtless to their extreme disappointment it was found politic also that mr paul mallows should retire from the directorate of the indestructible bicycle company a concern which is still i believe flourishing exceedingly as for dorrington he had his hundred pounds reward but the bill for he never presented why i do not altogether know unless he found that mr mallows's financial position as he had hinted was not altogether so good as was supposed at any rate it was found among the notes and telegrams in this case in the dorrington deed box the case of mr loftus deacon v the case of mr loftus deacon i this was a case that helped to give dorrington much of that reputation which unfortunately too often enabled him to profit himself far beyond the extent to which his clients intended it occurred some few years back and there was such a stir at the time over the mysterious death of mr loftus deacon that it well paid dorrington to use his utmost diligence in an honest effort to uncover the mystery it gave him one of his best advertisements though indeed it occasioned him less trouble in the unravelling than many a less interesting case there were scarcely any memoranda of the affair among dorrington's papers beyond entries of fees paid and i have almost entirely relied upon the account given me by mr stone manager in the employ of the firm owning the premises in which mr deacon died these premises consisted of a large building let out in expensive flats one of the first places built with that design in the west end of london the building was one of three all belonging to the firm i have mentioned and numbered and bedford mansions they stood in the st james's district and mr loftus deacon's quarters were in no mr deacon's magnificent collection of oriental porcelain will be remembered as long as any in the national depositories much of it was for a long while lent and by mr deacon's will passed permanently into possession of the nation his collection of oriental arms however was broken up and sold as were also his other innumerable objects of eastern art lacquers carvings and so forth he was a wealthy man this mr deacon a bachelor of sixty and his whole life was given to his collections he was currently reported to spend some a year on them and in addition would make inroads into capital for special purchases at the great sales people wondered where all the things were kept and indeed they had reason for mr deacon's personal establishment was but a suite of rooms on the ground floor of bedford mansions but the bulk of the collections were housed at various museums indeed it was a matter of banter among his acquaintances that mr loftus deacon made the taxpayers warehouse most of his things moreover the flat was a large one it occupied almost the whole of the ground floor of the building and it overflowed with the choicest of its tenant's possessions there were eight large and lofty rooms as well as the lobby scullery and so forth and every one was full the walls were hung with the most precious kakemono and nishikiy of japan and glass cabinets stood everywhere packed with porcelain and faience celadon peach bloom and blue and white satsuma raku ninsei and arita many a small piece worth its weight in gold over and over and over again at places on the wall among the kakemono and pictures of the ukioy were trophies of arms two suits of ancient japanese armour each complete and each the production of one of the most eminent of the miochin family were exhibited on stands and swords stood in many corners and lay in many racks innumerable drawers contained specimens of the greatest lacquer ware of korin shunsho kajikawa koyetsu and ritsuo each in its wadded brocade fukusa with the light wooden box encasing all in more glass cabinets stood netsuk and okimono of ivory bronze wood and lacquer there were a few gods and goddesses and conspicuous among them two life sized gilt buddhas beamed mildly over all from the shelves on which they were raised by the operation of natural selection it came about that the choicest of all mr deacon's possessions were collected in these rooms here were none of the great cumbersome pots good in their way but made of old time merely for the european market of all that was japanese every piece was of the best and rarest consequently in almost every case of small dimensions as is the way of the greatest of the wares of old japan and of all the precious contents of these rooms everything was oriental in its origin except the contents of one case which displayed specimens of the most magnificent goldsmiths' and silver smiths' work of medival europe it stood in the room which mr loftus deacon used as his sitting room and more than one of his visitors had wondered that such valuable property was not kept at a banker's this view however always surprised and irritated mr deacon keep it at a banker's he would say why not melt it down at once the things are works of art things of beauty and that's why i have them not merely because they're gold and silver to shut them up in a strong room would be the next thing to destroying them altogether why not lock the whole of my collections in safes and never look at them they are all valuable but if they are not to be seen i would rather have the money they cost so the gold and silver stood in its case to the blinking wonderment of messengers and porters whose errands took them into mr loftus deacon's sitting room the contents of this case were the only occasion however of mr deacon's straying from oriental paths in building up his collection there they stood but he made no attempt to add to them he went about his daily hunting bargaining cataloguing cleaning and exhibiting to friends but all his new treasures were from the east and most were japanese his chief visitors were travelling buyers of curiosities little japanese who had come to england to study medicine and were paying their terms by the sale of heirlooms in pottery and lacquer porters from christie's and foster's and sometimes men from copleston's the odd emporium by the riverside where lions and monkeys porcelain and savage weapons were bought and sold close by the ships that brought them home the travellers were suspicious and cunning the japanese were bright polite and dignified and the men from copleston's were wiry hairy and amphibious one was an enormously muscular little hunchback nicknamed slackjaw a quaint and rather repulsive compound of showman sailor and half caste rough and all were like mermen more or less these curious people came and went and mr deacon went on buying cataloguing and joying in his possessions it was the happiest possible life for a lonely old man with his tastes and his means of gratifying them and it went placidly on till one wednesday mid day then mr deacon was found dead in his rooms in most extraordinary and it seemed altogether unaccountable circumstances there was but one door leading into mr deacon's rooms from the open corridor of the building and this was immediately opposite the large street door when one entered from the street one ascended three or four broad marble steps pushed open one of a pair of glazed swing doors and found oneself facing the door by which mr deacon entered and left his quarters there had originally been other doors into the corridor from some of the rooms but those mr deacon had had blocked up so making the flat entirely self contained just by the glazed swing doors which i have spoken of and in full view of the old gentleman's door the hall porter's box stood it was glazed on all sides and the porter sat so that mr deacon's door was always before his eyes and so long as he was there it was very unlikely that anybody or anything could leave or enter by that door unobserved by him it is important to remember this in view of what happened on the occasion i am writing of there was one other exterior door to mr deacon's flat and one only it gave upon the back spiral staircase and was usually kept locked this staircase had no outlet to the corridors but merely extended from the housekeeper's rooms at the top of the building to the basement it was little used and then only by servants for it gave access only to the rooms on its own side there was no way from this staircase to the outer street except through the private rooms of the tenants or through those of the housekeeper that wednesday morning things had happened precisely in the ordinary way mr deacon had risen and breakfasted as usual he was alone with his newspaper and his morning letters when his breakfast was taken in and when it was removed he had remained in his rooms till between twelve and one o'clock goods had arrived for him this was an almost daily occurrence and one or two ordinary visitors had called and gone away again it was mr deacon's habit to lunch at his club and at about a quarter to one or thereabout he had come out locked his door and leaving his usual message that he should be at the club for an hour or two in case anybody called he had left the building at about one however he had returned hurriedly having forgotten some letters i didn't give you any letters for the post did i beard before i went out he asked the porter and the porter replied that he had not mr deacon thereupon crossed the corridor entered his door and shut it behind him he had been gone but a few seconds when there arose an outcry from within the rooms a shout followed in a breath by a loud cry of pain and then silence beard the porter ran to the door and knocked but there was no reply did you call sir he shouted and knocked again but still without response the door was shut and it had a latch lock with no exterior handle beard who had had an uncle die of apoplexy was now thoroughly alarmed and shouted up the speaking tube for the housekeeper's keys in course of a few minutes they were brought and beard and the housekeeper entered the lobby was as usual and the sitting room was in perfect order but in the room beyond mr loftus deacon lay in a pool of blood with two large and fearful gashes in his head not a soul was in any of the rooms though the two men first shutting the outer door searched diligently all windows and doors were shut and the rooms were tenantless and undisturbed except that on the floor lay mr deacon in his blood at the foot of a pedestal whereupon there squatted with serenely fierce grin the god hachiman gilt and painted carrying in one of his four hands a snake in another a mace in a third a small human figure and in the fourth a heavy straight guardless sword and all around furniture cabinets porcelain lacquer and everything else lay undisturbed at first sight of the tragedy the porter had sent the lift man for the police and soon they arrived and a surgeon with them for the surgeon there was very little to do mr deacon was dead either of the two frightful gashes in the head would have been fatal and they had obviously both been delivered with the same instrument something heavy and exceedingly sharp the police now set themselves to close investigation the porter was certain that nobody had entered the rooms that morning who had not afterwards left he was sure that nobody had entered unobserved and he was sure that mr deacon had re entered his chambers unaccompanied working therefore on the assumption that the murderer could not have entered by the front door the police turned their attention to the back door and the windows the door to the back staircase was locked and the key was in the lock and inside therefore they considered the windows there were but three of these that looked upon the street two in one room and one in another but these were shut and fastened within other rooms were lighted by windows looking upon lighting wells some being supplied with reflectors all these windows were found to be quite undisturbed and fastened within except one this window was in the bedroom and though it was shut the catch was not fastened the porter declared that it was mr deacon's practice invariably to fasten every shut window a thing he was always very careful about moreover the window now found unfastened and shut was always left open a foot or so all day to air the bedroom more a housemaid was brought who had that morning made the bed and dusted the room the window was opened she said when she had entered the room and she had left it so as she always did therefore shut as it was but not fastened it seemed plain that this window must have given exit to the murderer since no other way appeared possible also to shut the window behind him would be the fugitive's natural policy the lower panes were of ground glass and at least pursuit would be delayed the window looked upon a lighting well and the concreted floor of the basement was but fifteen or twenty feet below careful inquiries disclosed the fact that a man had been at work painting the joinery about this well bottom he was a man of very indifferent character had in fact done time and he was employed for odd jobs by way of charity being some sort of connection of a member of the firm owning the buildings he had indeed received a good education fitted to place him in a very different position from that in which he now found himself but he was a black sheep he drank he gambled and finally he stole his relatives helped him again and again but their efforts were useless and now he was indebted to one of them for his present occupation at a pound a week the police of course knew something of him and postponed questioning him directly until they had investigated a little further it might be that mr deacon's death was the work of a conspiracy wherein more than one had participated ii the next morning thursday mr henry colson was an early caller at dorrington's office mr colson was a thin grizzled man of sixty or thereabout who had been a close friend the only intimate friend indeed of mr loftus deacon he was a widower and he lived in rooms scarce two hundred yards distant from bedford mansions where his friend had died my business mr dorrington he said is in connection with the terrible death of my old friend mr loftus deacon of which you no doubt have heard or read in the morning papers yes dorrington assented both in this morning's papers and the evening papers of yesterday very good i may tell you that i am sole executor under mr deacon's will the will indeed is in my possession i am a retired solicitor and there happens to be a sum set apart in that will out of which i am to defray any expenses that may arise in connection with his death it really seems to me that i should be quite justified in using some part of that sum in paying for inquiries to be conducted by such an experienced man as yourself into the cause of my poor friend's death at any rate i wish you to make such inquiries even if i have to pay the fees myself i am convinced that there is something very extraordinary something very deep in the tragedy the police are pottering about of course and keeping very mysterious as to the matter but i expect that's simply because they know nothing they have made no arrest and perhaps every minute of delay is making the thing more difficult as executor of course i have access to the rooms can you come and look at them now oh yes dorrington answered reaching for his hat i suppose there's no doubt of the case being one of murder suicide is not likely i take it oh no certainly not he was scarcely the sort of man to commit suicide i should say and he was as cheerful as he could be the afternoon before when i last saw him besides the surgeon says it's nothing of the kind a man committing suicide doesn't gash himself twice over the head or even once and in this case the first blow would have made him incapable of another i have heard nothing about the weapon dorrington remarked as they entered a cab has it been found that's a difficulty mr colson answered it would seem not of course there are numbers of weapons about the place japanese swords and what not any one of which might have caused such injuries but there are no bloodstains on any of them is any article of value missing i believe not everything seemed to be in its place so far as i noticed yesterday but then i was not there long and was too much agitated to notice very particularly at any rate the old gold and silver plate had not been disturbed he kept that in a large case in his sitting room and it would certainly be the plate that the murderer would have made for first if robbery had been his object mr colson gave dorrington the other details of the case already set forth in this account and presently the cab stopped before no bedford mansions the body of course had been removed but otherwise the rooms had not been disturbed the porter let them into the chambers by aid of the housekeeper's key they don't seem to have found his keys mr colson explained and that will be troublesome for me i expect presently he usually carried them with him but they were not on the body when found that may be important dorrington said but let us look at the rooms they walked through the large apartments one after the other and dorrington glanced casually about him as he went presently mr colson stopped struck with an idea ah he said more to himself than to dorrington i will just see he turned quickly back into the room they had just quitted and made for the broad shelf that ran the length of the wall at about the height of an ordinary table yes he cried it is it's gone what is gone the sword the masamun the whole surface of the shelf covered with a silk cloth was occupied by japanese swords and dirks with rich mountings most lay on their sides in rows but two or three were placed in the lacquered racks mr colson stood and pointed at a rack which was standing alone and swordless that is where it was he said i saw it was talking about it in fact the afternoon before no it's nowhere about it's not like any of the others let me see and mr colson much excited hurried from room to room wherever swords were kept searching for the missing specimen no he said at last looking strangely startled it's gone and i think we are near the soul of the mystery he spoke in hushed uneasy tones and his eyes gave token of strange apprehension what is it dorrington asked what about this sword come into the sitting room mr colson led dorrington away from the scene of mr deacon's end away from the empty sword rack and from under the shadow of the grinning god with its four arms its snake and its threatening sword i don't think i'm very superstitious mr colson proceeded but i really feel that i can talk more freely about the matter in here they sat at the table over against the case of plate and mr colson went on the sword i speak of he said was much prized by my poor friend who brought it with him from japan nearly twenty years back not many years after the civil war there in fact it was a very ancient specimen of the fourteenth century i think and the work of the famous swordsmith masamun masamun's work is very rarely met with it seems and mr deacon felt himself especially fortunate in securing this example it is the only piece of masamun's work in the collection i may tell you that a sword by one of the great old masters is one of the rarest of all the rarities that come from japan the possessors of the best keep them rather than sell them at any price such swords were handed down from father to son for many generations and a japanese of the old school would have been disgraced had he parted with his father's blade even under the most pressing necessity the mounts he might possibly sell if he were in very bad circumstances but the blade never of course such a thing has occurred and it occurred in this very case as you shall hear but as an almost invariable rule the japanese samurai would part with his life by starvation rather than with his father's sword by sale such swords would never be stolen either for there was a firm belief that a faithful spirit resided in each which would bring terrible disaster on any wrongful possessor each sword had its own name just as the legendary sword of king arthur had and a man's social standing was judged not by his house nor by his dress but by the two swords in his girdle the ancient sword smiths wore court dress and made votive offerings when they forged their best blades and the gods were supposed to assist and to watch over the career of the weapon thus you will understand that such an article was apt to become an object almost of worship among the samurai or warrior class in old japan and now to come to the sword in question it was a long sword or katana the swords as you know were worn in pairs and the smaller was called the wakizashi and it was mounted very handsomely with fittings by a great metal worker of the goto family the signature of the great masamun himself was engraved in the usual place on the iron tang within the hilt mr deacon bought the weapon of its possessor a man of some distinction before the overthrow of the shogun in but who was reduced to deep poverty by the change in affairs mr deacon came across him in his direst straits when his children were near to starvation and the man sold the sword for a sum that was a little fortune to him though it only represented some four or five pounds of our money mr deacon was always very proud of his treasure indeed it was said to be the only blade by masamun in europe and the two japanese things that he had always most longed for i have heard him say were a masamun sword and a piece of violet lacquer that precious lacquer the secret of making which died long ago the masamun he acquired as i have been telling you but the violet lacquer he never once encountered six months or so back deacon received a visit from a japanese taller than usual for a japanese i have seen him myself and with the refined type of face characteristic of some of the higher class of his country his name was keigo kanamaro his card said and he introduced himself as the son of keigo kiyotaki the man who had sold deacon his sword he had come to england and had found my friend after much inquiry he said expressly to take back his father's katana his father was dead and he desired to place the sword in his tomb that the soul of the old man might rest in peace undisturbed by the disgrace that had fallen upon him by the sale of the sword that had been his and his ancestors' for hundreds of years back the father had vowed when he had received the sword in his turn from kanamaro's grandfather never to part with it but had broken his vow under pressure of want he the son had earned money as a merchant an immeasurable descent for a samurai with the feelings of the old school and he was prepared to buy back the masamun blade with the goto mountings for a much higher price than his father had received for it and i suppose deacon wouldn't sell it dorrington asked no mr colson replied he wouldn't have sold it at any price i'm sure well kanamaro pressed him very urgently and called again and again he was very gentlemanly and very dignified but he was very earnest he apologised for making a commercial offer assured deacon that he was quite aware that he was no mere buyer and seller but pleaded the urgency of his case 'it is not here as in japan' he said 'among us the samurai of the old days you have your beliefs we have ours it is my religion that i must place the katana in my father's grave my father disgraced himself and sold his sword in order that i might not starve when i was a little child i would rather that he had let me die but since i am alive and i know that you have the sword i must take it and lay it by his bones i will make an offer instead of giving you money i will give you another sword a sword worth as much money as my father's perhaps more i have had it sent from japan since i first saw you it is a blade made by the great yukiyasu and it has a scabbard and mountings by an older and greater master than the goto who made those for my father's sword' but it happened that deacon already had two swords by yukiyasu while of masamun he had only the one so he tried to reason the japanese out of his fancy but that was useless kanamaro called again and again and got to be quite a nuisance he left off for a month or two but about a fortnight ago he appeared again he grew angry and forgot his oriental politeness 'the english have the english ways' he said 'and we have ours yes though many of my foolish countrymen are in haste to be the same as the english are we have our beliefs and we have our knowledge and i tell you that there are things which you would call superstition but which are very real our old gods are not all dead yet i tell you in the old times no man would wear or keep another man's sword why because the great sword has a soul just as a man has and it knows and the gods know no man kept another's sword who did not fall into terrible misfortune and death sooner or later give me my father's katana and save yourself my father weeps in my ears at night and i must bring him his katana' i was talking to poor deacon as i told you only on tuesday afternoon and he told me that kanamaro had been there again the day before in a frantic state so bad indeed that deacon thought of applying to the japanese legation to have him taken care of for he seemed quite mad 'mind you foolish man' he said 'my gods still live and they are strong my father wanders on the dark path and cannot go to his gods without the swords in his girdle his father asks of his vow between here and japan there is a great sea but my father may walk even here looking for his katana and he is angry i go away for a little but my gods know and my father knows' and then he took himself off and now mr colson nodded towards the next room and dropped his voice now poor deacon is dead and the sword is gone illustration give me my father's katana and save yourself kanamaro has not been seen about the place i suppose since the visit you speak of on monday dorrington asked no and i particularly asked as to yesterday morning the hall porter swears that no japanese came to the place as to the letters now you say that when mr deacon came back after having left apparently to get his lunch he said he came for forgotten letters were any such letters afterwards found yes there were three lying on this very table stamped ready for postage where are they now i have them at my chambers i opened them in the presence of the police in charge of the case there was nothing very important about them appointments and so forth merely and so the police left them in my charge as executor nevertheless i should like to see them not just now but presently i think i must see this man presently the man who was painting in the basement below the window that is supposed to have been shut by the murderer in his escape that is if the police haven't frightened him very well we'll see after him as soon as you like there was just one other thing rather a curious coincidence though of course there can't be anything in such a superstitious fancy but i think i told you that deacon's body was found lying at the feet of the four handed god in the other room yes just so mr colson seemed to think a little more of the superstitious fancy than he confessed just so he said again at the feet of the god and immediately under the hand carrying the sword it is not wooden but an actual steel sword in fact i noticed that yes now that is a figure of hachiman the japanese god of war a recent addition to the collection and a very ancient specimen deacon bought it at copleston's only a few days ago indeed it arrived here on wednesday morning deacon was telling me about it on tuesday afternoon he bought it because of its extraordinary design showing such signs of indian influence hachiman is usually represented with no more than the usual number of a man's arms and with no weapon but a sword this is the only image of hachiman that deacon ever saw or heard of with four arms and after he had bought it he ascertained that this was said to be one of the idols that carry with them ill luck from the moment they leave their temples one of copleston's men confided to deacon that the lascar seamen and stokers on board the ship that brought it over swore that everything went wrong from the moment that hachiman came on board and indeed the vessel was nearly lost off finisterre and copleston himself the man said was glad to be quit of it things had disappeared in the most extraordinary and unaccountable manner and other things had been found smashed notably a large porcelain vase without any human agency after standing near the figure well mr colson concluded after all that and remembering what kanamaro said about the gods of his country who watch over ancient swords it does seem odd doesn't it that as soon as poor deacon gets the thing he should be found stricken dead at its feet dorrington was thinking yes he said presently it is certainly a strange affair altogether let us see the odd job man now the man who was in the basement below the window or rather find out where he is and leave me to find him mr colson stepped out and spoke with the hall porter presently he returned with news he's gone he said bolted what the man who was in the basement yes it seems the police questioned him pretty closely yesterday and he seized the first opportunity to cut and run do you know what they asked him examined him generally i suppose as to what he had observed at the time the only thing he seems to have said was that he heard a window shut at about one o'clock questioned further he got into confusion and equivocation more especially when they mentioned a ladder which is kept in a passage close by where he was painting it seems they had examined this before speaking to him and found it had been just recently removed and put back it was thick with dust except just where it had been taken hold of to shift and there the hand marks were quite clean nobody was in the basement but dowden that is the man's name and nobody else could have shifted that ladder without his hearing and knowing of it moreover the ladder was just the length to reach deacon's window they asked if he had seen anybody move the ladder and he most anxiously and vehemently declared that he had not a little while after he was missing and he hasn't reappeared and they let him go dorrington exclaimed what fools he may know something about it of course colson said dubiously but with that sword missing and knowing what we do of kanamaro's anxiety to get it at any cost and and he glanced toward the other room where the idol stood and one thing and another it seems to me we should look in another direction we will look in all directions dorrington replied kanamaro may have enlisted dowden's help do you know where to find kanamaro yes deacon has had letters from him which i have seen he lived in lodgings near the british museum very well now do you happen to know whether a night porter is kept at this place no there is none the outer door is shut at twelve anybody coming home after that must ring up the housekeeper by the electric bell the tenants do not have keys for the outer door no none but keys for their own rooms good now mr colson i want to think things over a little would you care to go at once and ascertain whether or not kanamaro is still at the address you speak of certainly i will perhaps i should have told you that though he knows me slightly he has never spoken of his father's sword to me and does not know that i know anything about it he seems indeed to have spoken about it to nobody but deacon himself he was very proud and reticent in the matter and now that deacon is dead he probably thinks nobody alive knows of the matter of the sword but himself if he is at home what shall i do in that case keep him in sight and communicate with me or with the police i shall stay here for a little while then i shall get the hall porter if you will instruct him before you go to show me the ladder and the vicinity of dowden's operations also i think i shall look at the back staircase but that was found locked with the key inside well well there are ways of managing that as you would know if you knew as much about housebreaking as i do but we'll see iii mr colson took a cab for kanamaro's lodgings kanamaro was not in he found and he had given notice to leave his rooms the servant at the door thought that he was going abroad since his boxes were being packed apparently for that purpose the servant did not know at what time he would be back mr colson thought for a moment of reporting these facts at once to dorrington but on second thoughts he determined to hurry to the city and make inquiry at some of the shipping offices as to the vessels soon to leave for japan on the way however he bethought him to buy a shipping paper and gather his information from that he found what he wanted from the paper but he kept the cab on its way for he happened to know a man in authority at the anglo malay company's office and it might be a good thing to take a look at their passenger list their next ship for yokohama was to sail in a few days but he found it unnecessary to see the passenger list as he entered one of the row of swing doors which gave access to the large general and inquiry office of the steamship company he perceived keigo kanamaro leaving by another kanamaro had not seen him mr colson hesitated for a moment and then turned and followed him and now mr colson became suddenly seized with a burning fancy to play the subtle detective on his own account plainly kanamaro feared nothing walking about thus openly and taking his passage for japan at the chief office of the first line of steamships that anybody would think of who contemplated a voyage to japan instead of leaving the country as he might have done by some indirect route and shipping for japan from a foreign port doubtless he still supposed that nobody knew of his errand in search of his father's sword mr colson quickened his pace and came up beside the japanese kanamaro was a well made man of some five feet eight or nine remarkably tall for a native of dai nippon his cheek bones had not the prominence noticeable in the japanese of the lower classes and his pale oval face and aquiline nose gave token of high sikozu family his hair only was of the coarse black that is seen on the heads of all japanese he perceived mr colson and stopped at once with a grave bow good morning mr colson said i saw you leaving the steamship office and wondered whether or not you were going to leave us yes i go home to japan by the next departing ship kanamaro answered he spoke with an excellent pronunciation but with the intonation and the suppression of short syllables peculiar to his countrymen who speak english my beesness is finished mr colson's suspicions were more than strengthened almost confirmed he commanded his features however and replied as he walked by keigo's side ah your visit has been successful then it has been successful kanamaro answered at a very great cost at a very great cost yes i did not expect to have to do what i have done i should once not have believed it possible that i could do it but kanamaro checked himself hastily and resumed his grave reserve but that is private beesness and not for me to disturb you with mr colson had the tact to leave that line of fishing alone for a little he walked a few yards in silence and then asked with his eyes furtively fixed on the face of the japanese do you know of the god hachiman it is hachiman the warrior him of eight flags kanamaro replied yes i know of course he spoke as though he would banish the subject but mr colson went on did he preside over the forging of ancient sword blades in japan he asked i do not know of preside that is a new word but the great workers of the steel those who made the katana in the times of yoshitsun and taiko sama they hung curtains and made offerings to hachiman when they forged a blade yes the great muramasa and the great masamun and sannori they forged their blades at the foot of hachiman and it is believed that the god inari came unseen with his hammer and forged the steel too though hachiman is buddhist and inari is shinto but these are not things to talk about there is one religion which is yours and there is another religion which is mine and it is not good that we talk together of them there are things that people call superstition when they are of another religion though they may be very true they walked a little farther and then mr colson determined to penetrate kanamaro's mask of indifference observed it's a very sad thing this about mr deacon what is that asked kanamaro stolidly why it is in all the newspapers the newspapers i do not read at all mr deacon has been killed murdered in his rooms he was found lying dead at the feet of hachiman the god indeed kanamaro answered politely but with something rather like stolid indifference that is very sad i am sorry i did not know he had a hachiman and they say mr colson pursued that something has been taken ah yes kanamaro answered just as coolly there were many things of much value in the rooms and after a little while he added i see it is a little late you will excuse me for i must go to lunch at my lodgings good day he bowed shook hands and hailed a cab mr colson heard him direct the cabman to his lodgings and then in another cab mr colson made for dorrington's office kanamaro's stolidity the lack of anything like surprise at the news of mr deacon's death his admission that he had finished his business in england successfully these things placed the matter beyond all doubt in mr colson's mind plainly he felt so confident that none knew of his errand in england that he took things with perfect coolness and even ventured so far as to speak of the murder in very near terms to say that he did not expect to have to do what he had done and would not have believed it possible that he could do it though to be sure he checked himself at once before going farther certainly dorrington must be told at once that would be better than going to the police perhaps for possibly the police might not consider the evidence sufficient to justify an arrest and dorrington may have ascertained something in the meantime dorrington had not been heard of at his office since leaving there early in the morning so mr colson saw hicks and arranged that a man should be put on to watch kanamaro and should be sent instantly before he could leave his lodgings again then mr colson hurried to bedford mansions there he saw the housekeeper from him he learned that dorrington had left some time since promising either to be back or to telegraph during the afternoon also he learned that beard the hall porter was in a great state of indignation and anxiety as a consequence of the discovery that he was being watched by the police he had got a couple of days leave of absence to go and see his mother who was ill and he found his intentions and destination a matter of pressing inquiry mr colson assured the housekeeper that he might promise beard a speedy respite from the attentions of the police and went to his lunch iv after his lunch mr colson called and called again at bedford mansions but neither dorrington nor his telegram had been heard of at something near five o'clock however when he had made up his mind to wait restless as he was dorrington appeared fresh and complacent hope you haven't been waiting long he asked fact is i got no opportunity for lunch till after four so i had it then i think i'd fairly earned it the case is finished finished but there's kanamaro to be arrested i've found no no i don't think anybody will be arrested at all you'll read about it in the evening papers in an hour i expect but come into the rooms i have some things to show you but i assure you mr colson said as he entered the door of deacon's rooms i assure you that i got as good as a confession from kanamaro he let it slip in ignorance of what i knew why do you say that nobody is to be arrested because there's nobody alive who is responsible for mr deacon's death but come let me show you the whole thing it's very simple he led the way to the room where the body had been found and paused before the four armed idol here's our old friend hachiman he said whom you half fancied might have had something to do with the tragedy well you were right hachiman had a good deal to do with it and with the various disasters at copleston's too i will show you how the figure which was larger than life size had been set up temporarily on a large packing case hidden by a red cloth covering hachiman was represented in the familiar japanese kneeling sitting position and the carving of the whole thing was of an intricate and close description the god was represented as clad in ancient armour with a large and loose cloak depending from his shoulders and falling behind in a wilderness of marvellously and deeply carved folds see here dorrington said placing his fingers under a projecting part of the base of the figure and motioning to mr colson to do the same lift pretty heavy eh the idol was indeed enormously heavy and it must have required the exertions of several strong men to place it where it was it seems pretty solid doesn't it dorrington continued but look here he stepped to the back of the image and taking a prominent fold of the cloak in one hand with a quick pull and a simultaneous rap of the other fist two feet above a great piece of the carved drapery lifted on a hinge near the shoulders displaying a hollow interior in a dark corner within a small bottle and a fragment of rag were just visible see there said dorrington there wouldn't be enough room in there for you or me but a small man a japanese priest of the old time say could squat pretty comfortably and see he pointed to a small metal bolt at the bottom of the swing drapery he could bolt himself safely in when he got there whether the priest went there to play the oracle or to blow fire out of hachiman's mouth and nose i don't know though no doubt it might be an interesting subject for inquiry perhaps he did both you observe the chamber is lined with metal which does something towards giving the thing its weight and there are cunning little openings among the armour joints in front which would transmit air and sound even permit of a peep out now mr deacon might or might not have found out this back door after the figure had been a while in his possession but it is certain he knew nothing of it when he bought it copleston knew nothing of it though the thing has stood in his place for months you see it's not a thing one would notice at once i never should have done so if i hadn't been looking for it he shut the part and the joints of irregular outline fell into the depths of the folds and vanished as if by magic now dorrington went on as i told you copleston knew nothing of this but one of his men found it out do you happen to have heard of one samuel castro nicknamed 'slackjaw' a hunchback whom copleston employed on odd jobs i have seen him here he called sometimes with messages sometimes with parcels i should probably have forgotten all about him were it not that he was rather an extraordinary creature even among copleston's men who are all remarkable but did he illustration slackjaw he murdered mr deacon i think dorrington replied as i fancy i can explain to you but he won't hang for it for he was drowned this afternoon before my eyes in an attempt to escape from the police he was an extraordinary creature as you have said he wasn't english a half caste of some sort i think though his command of language of the riverside and dock description was very free it got him his nickname of slackjaw among the longshoremen he was desperately excitable and he had most of the vices though i don't think he premeditated murder in this case nothing but robbery he was immensely strong although such a little fellow and sharp in his wits and he might have had regular work at copleston's if he had liked but that wasn't his game he was too lazy he would work long enough to earn a shilling or so and then he would go off to drink the money so he was a sort of odd on and off man at copleston's just to run a message or carry something or what not when the regular men were busy well he seems to have been smart enough or perhaps it was no more than an accident to find out about hachiman's back and he used his knowledge for his own purposes copleston couldn't account for missing things in the night because he never guessed that castro by shutting himself up in hachiman about closing time had the run of the place when everybody had gone and could pick up any trifle that looked suitable for the pawnshop in the morning he could sleep comfortably on sacks or among straw and thus save the rent of lodgings and he could accept hachiman's shelter again just before copleston turned up to start the next day's business getting out too after the place was opened was quite easy for nobody came to the large store rooms till something was wanted and in a large place with many doors and gates like copleston's unperceived going and coming was easy to one who knew the ropes so that slackjaw would creep quietly out and in again by the front door to ask for a job copleston noticed how regular he had been every morning for the past few months and thought he was getting steadier as to the things that got smashed i expect slackjaw knocked them over getting out in the dark one china vase in particular had been shifted at the last moment probably after he was in his hiding place and stood behind the image that was smashed of course and these things coming after the bad voyage of the ship in which he came over very naturally gave poor hachiman an unlucky reputation probably slackjaw was sorry at first when he heard that hachiman was bought but then an idea struck him he had been to mr deacon's rooms on errands and must have seen that fine old plate in the sitting room he had picked up unconsidered trifles at copleston's by aid of hachiman why not acquire something handsome at deacon's in the same way the figure was to be carried to bedford mansions as soon as work began on wednesday morning very well all he had to do was to manage his customary sojourn at copleston's over tuesday night and keep to his hiding place in the morning he did it perhaps the men swore a bit at the weight of hachiman but as the idol weighed several hundredweights by itself and had not been shifted since it first arrived they most likely perceived no difference hachiman with slackjaw comfortably bolted inside him though even he must have found the quarters narrow jolted away in the waggon and in course of time was deposited where it now stands of course all i have told you and all i am about to tell you is no more than conjecture but i think you will say i have reasons from within the idol slackjaw could hear mr deacon's movements and no doubt when he heard him take his hat and stick and shut the outer door behind him hachiman's tenant was glad to get out he had never had so long and trying a sojourn in the idol before though he had provided himself this time with something to keep his spirits up in that little flat bottle he left behind probably however he waited some little time before emerging for safety's sake i judge this because i found no signs of his having started work except a single small knife mark on the plate case he must have no more than begun when mr deacon came back for his letters first however he went and shut the bedroom window lest his movements might be heard in some adjacent rooms the man who was painting said he heard that you remember well hearing mr deacon's key in the lock of course he made a rush for his hiding place but there was no time to get in and close up before mr deacon could hear the noise mr deacon as he entered heard the footsteps in the next room and went to see the result you know castro perhaps crouched behind the idol and hearing mr deacon approaching and knowing discovery inevitable in his mad fear and excitement snatched the nearest weapon and struck wildly at his pursuer see here are half a dozen heavy short japanese swords at hand any one of which might have been used the thing done castro had to think of escape the door was impossible the hall porter was already knocking there but the man had no key he could be heard moving about and calling for one there was yet a little time he wiped the blade of the weapon put it back in its place took the keys from the dead man's pocket and regained his concealment in the idol whether or not he took the keys with the idea of again attempting theft when the room was left empty i don't know most likely he thought they would aid him in escape anyway he didn't attempt theft but lay in his concealment and a pretty bad time he must have had of it till night probably his nerve was not good enough for anything more than simple flight when all was quiet he left the rooms and shut the door behind him then he lurked about corridors and basements till morning and when the doors were opened slipped out unobserved that's all it's pretty obvious once you know about hachiman's interior and how did you find out when you left me here i considered the thing i put aside all suspicions of motive the japanese and his sword and the rest of it and addressed myself to the bare facts somebody had been in these rooms when mr deacon came back and that somebody had murdered him the first thing was to find how this person came and where he came from at first of course one thought of the bedroom window as the police had done but reflection proved this unlikely mr deacon had entered his front door was inside a few seconds and then was murdered close by the figure of hachiman now if anybody had entered by the window for purposes of robbery his impulse on hearing the key in the outer door and such a thing could be heard all over the rooms as i tested for myself his impulse i say would be to retreat by the way he had come that is by the window if then mr deacon had overtaken him before he could escape the murder might have taken place just as it had done but it would have been in the bedroom not in a room in the opposite direction and any thief's attention would naturally be directed at first to the gold plate indeed i detected a fresh knife mark in the door of the case which i will show you presently now as you see by the arrangement of the rooms the retreat from the plate case to the bedroom window would be a short one whereas the murderer must in fact have taken a longer journey in the opposite direction why because he had arrived from that direction and his natural impulse was to retreat by the way he had come this might have been by the door to the back stairs but a careful examination of this door and its lock and key convinced me that it had not been opened the key was dirty and to have turned it from the opposite side would have necessitated the forcible use of a pair of thin hollow pliers a familiar tool to burglars and these must have left their mark on the dirty key so i turned back to the idol this was the spot the intruder had made for in his retreat and the figure had been brought into the place the very morning of the murder also things had disappeared from its vicinity at copleston's more it was a large thing what if it were hollow one has heard of such things having been invented by priests anxious for certain effects could not a thief smuggle himself in that way the suggestion was a little startling for if it were the right one the man might be hiding there at that moment i gave the thing half an hour's examination and in the end found what i have shown you it was not the sort of thing one would have found out without looking for it look at it even now although you have seen it open you couldn't point to the joints dorrington opened it again once open he went on the thing was pretty plain here is the rag perhaps it was castro's pocket handkerchief used to wipe the weapon it is stained all over and cut as you will observe by the sharp edge also you may see a crumb or two slackjaw had brought food with him in case of a long imprisonment but chiefly observe the bottle it is a flat high shouldered 'quartern' bottle such as publicans sell or lend to their customers in poor districts and as usual it bears the publican's name j mills it's a most extraordinary thing but it seems the fate of almost every murderer no matter how cunning to leave some such damning piece of evidence about foolish as it may seem afterward i've known it in a dozen cases probably castro in the dark and in his excitement forgot it when he quitted his hiding place at any rate it helped me and made my course plain clearly this man whoever he was had come from copleston's moreover he was a small man for the space he had occupied would be too little even for a man of middle height also he bought drink of j mills a publican if j mills carried on business near copleston's so much the easier my task would seem before i left however i went to the basement and inspected the ladder the removal of which had caused the police so much exercise then it was plain why dowden had cleared out all his prevarication and uneasiness were explained at once as the police might have seen if they had looked behind the ladder as well as at it for it had been lying lengthwise against the wooden partition which formed the back of the compartments put up to serve the tenants as wine cellars dowden had taken three planks out of this partition and so arranged that they could be slipped in their places and out again without attracting attention what he had been taking through the holes he thus made i won't undertake to say but i will make a small bet that some of the tenants find their wine short presently and so dowden never an industrious person and never at one job long thought it best to go away when he found the police asking why the ladder had been moved yes yes it's very surprising but no doubt you're right still what about kanamaro and that sword tell me exactly what he said to you to day mr colson detailed the conversation at length dorrington smiled see here he said i have found out something else in these rooms what kanamaro said he meant in another sense to what you supposed i wondered a little about that sword and made a little search among some drawers in consequence look here do you see this box standing out here on a nest of drawers that is quite unlike mr deacon's orderly ways the box contains a piece of lacquer and it had been shifted from its drawer to make room for a more precious piece see here dorrington pulled out a drawer just below where the box stood and took from it another white wood box he opened this box and removed a quantity of wadding a rich brocade fukusa was then revealed and loosening the cord of this dorrington displayed a japanese writing case or suzuribako aged and a little worn at the corners but all of lacquer of a beautiful violet hue what exclaimed mr colson violet lacquer that is what it is dorrington answered and when i saw it i judged at once that deacon had at last consented to part with his masamun blade in exchange for that even greater rarity a fine piece of the real old violet lacquer i should imagine that kanamaro brought it on tuesday evening you will remember that you saw mr deacon for the last time alive in the afternoon of that day beard seems not to have noticed him but in the evening hall porters are apt to be at supper you know perhaps even taking a nap now and then then this is how kanamaro 'finished his business' mr colson observed and the 'very great cost' was probably what he had to pay for this i suppose so and he would not have believed it possible that he could get a piece of violet lacquer in any circumstances but mr colson objected i still don't understand his indifference and lack of surprise when i told him of poor deacon's death i think that is very natural in such a man as keigo kanamaro i don't profess to know a very great deal about japan but i know that a samurai of the old school was trained from infancy to look on death whether his own or another's with absolute indifference they regarded it as a mere circumstance consider how cold bloodedly their hari kiri their legalised suicide was carried out as they left the rooms and made for the street mr colson said but now i know nothing of your pursuit of castro dorrington shrugged his shoulders there is little to say he said i went to copleston and asked him if any one of his men was missing all day on wednesday none of his regular men were it seemed but he had seen nothing that day of an odd man named castro or slackjaw although he had been very regular for some time before and indeed castro had not yet turned up i asked if castro was a tall man no he was a little fellow and a hunchback copleston told me i asked what public house one might find him at and copleston mentioned the 'blue anchor' kept as i had previously ascertained from the directory by j mills that was enough with everything standing as it was a few minutes' talk with the inspector in charge at the nearest police station was all that was necessary two men were sent to make the arrest and the people at the 'blue anchor' directed us to martin's wharf where we found castro he had been drinking but he knew enough to make a bolt the moment he saw the policemen coming on the wharf he dropped on to a dummy barge and made off from one barge to another in what seemed an aimless direction though he may have meant to get away at the stairs a little lower down the river but he never got as far he muddled one jump and fell between the barges you know what a suck under there is when a man falls among barges like that a strong swimmer with all his senses has only an off chance and a man with bad whisky in his head well i left them dragging for slackjaw when i came away as they turned the corner of the street they met a newsboy running paper speshal he cried the west end murder speshal suicide of the murderer dorrington's conjecture that kanamaro had called to make his exchange on tuesday evening proved correct mr colson saw him once more on the day of his departure and told him the whole story and then keigo kanamaro sailed for japan to lay the sword in his father's tomb old cater's money vi old cater's money i the firm of dorrington hicks had not been constructed at the time when this case came to dorrington's hand dorrington had barely emerged from the obscurity that veils his life before some ten years ago and he was at this time a needier adventurer than he had been at the period of any other of the cases i have related indeed his illicit gains on this occasion would seem first to have set him on his feet and enabled him first to cut a fair exterior figure whether or not he had developed to the full the scoundrelism that first brought me acquainted with his trade i do not know but certain it is that he was involved at the time in transactions wretchedly ill paid on behalf of one flint a shipstores dealer at deptford an employer whose record was never a very clean one this flint was one of an unpleasant family he was nephew to old cater the wharfinger and private usurer and cousin to another cater whose name was paul and who was also a usurer though he variously described himself as a commission agent or general dealer indeed he was a general dealer if the term may be held to include a dealer in whatever would bring him gain and who made no great punctilio in regard to the honesty or otherwise of his transactions in fact all three of these pleasant relatives had records of the shadiest and all three did whatever in the way of money lending mortgaging and blood sucking came in their way it is however with old cater jerry cater he was called that this narrative is in the first place concerned i got the story from a certain mr sinclair who for many years acted as his clerk and debt collector old jerry cater lived in the crooked and decaying old house over his wharf by bermondsey wall where his father had lived before him it was a grim and strange old house with long shut loft doors in upper floors and hinged flaps in sundry rooms that when lifted gave startling glimpses of muddy water washing among rotten piles below not once in six months now did a barge land its load at cater's wharf and no coasting brig ever lay alongside for in fact the day of cater's wharf was long past and it seemed indeed that few more days were left for old jerry cater himself for seventy eight years old jerry cater had led a life useless to himself and to everybody else though his own belief was that he had profited considerably truly if one counted nothing but the money the old miser had accumulated then his profit was large indeed but it had brought nothing worth having neither for himself nor for others and he had no wife nor child who might use it more wisely when he should at last leave it behind him no other relative indeed than his two nephews each in spirit a fair copy of himself though in body a quarter of a century younger seventy eight years of every mean and sordid vice and of every virtue that had pecuniary gain for its sole object left jerry cater stranded at last in his cheap iron bedstead with its insufficient coverings with not a sincere friend in the world to sit five minutes by his side down below sinclair his unhappy clerk had the accommodation of a wooden table and a chair and the clerk's wife performed what meagre cooking and cleaning service old cater would have sinclair was a man of forty five rusty starved honest and very cheap he was very cheap because it had been his foolishness twenty years ago when in city employ to borrow forty pounds of old cater to get married with and to buy furniture together with forty pounds he had of his own sinclair was young then and knew nothing of the ways of the two hundred per cent money lender when he had by three or four years' pinching paid about a hundred and fifty pounds on account of interest and fines and only had another hundred or two still due to clear everything off he fell sick and lost his place the payment of interest ceased and old jerry cater took his victim's body soul wife sticks and chairs together jerry cater discharged his own clerk and took sinclair with a saving of five shillings a week on the nominal salary and out of the remainder he deducted on account of the debt and ever accumulating interest enough to keep his man thin and broken spirited without absolutely incapacitating him from work which would have been bad finance but the rest of the debt capital and interest was made into a capital debt with usury on the whole so that for sixteen years or more sinclair had been paying something every week off the eternally increasing sum and might have kept on for sixteen centuries at the same rate without getting much nearer freedom if only there had been one more room in the house old cater might have compulsorily lodged his clerk and have deducted something more for rent as it was he might have used the office for the purpose but he could never have brought himself to charge a small rent for it and a large one would have swallowed most of the rest of sinclair's salary thus bringing him below starvation point and impairing his working capacity but mrs sinclair now gaunt and scraggy did all the housework so that that came very cheap most of the house was filled with old bales and rotting merchandise which old jerry cater had seized in payment for wharfage dues and other debts and had held to because his ideas of selling prices were large though his notion of buying prices were small sinclair was out of doors more than in dunning and threatening debtors as hopeless as himself and the household was completed by one samuel greer a squinting man of grease and rags within ten years of the age of old jerry cater himself greer was wharf hand messenger and personal attendant on his employer and with less opportunity was thought to be near as bad a scoundrel as cater he lived and slept in the house and was popularly supposed to be paid nothing at all though his patronage of the ship and anchor hard by was as frequent as might be old jerry cater was plainly not long for this world ailing for months he at length gave in and took to his bed greer watched him anxiously and greedily for it was his design when his master went at last to get what he could for himself more than once during his illness old cater had sent greer to fetch his nephews greer had departed on these errands but never got farther than the next street he hung about a reasonable time perhaps in the ship and anchor if funds permitted and then returned to say that the nephews could not come just yet old cater had quarrelled with his nephews as he had with everybody else some time before and greer was resolved if he could to prevent any meeting now for that would mean that the nephews would take possession of the place and he would lose his chance of convenient larceny when the end came so it was that neither nephew knew of old jerry cater's shaky condition illustration he saw a few doubled papers before long finding that the old miser could not leave his bed indeed he could scarcely turn in it greer took courage in sinclair's absence to poke about the place in search of concealed sovereigns he had no great time for this because jerry cater seemed to have taken a great desire for his company whether for the sake of his attendance or to keep him out of mischief was not clear at any rate greer found no concealed sovereigns nor anything better than might be sold for a few pence at the ragshop until one day when old cater was taking alternate fits of restlessness and sleep greer ventured to take down a dusty old pickle jar from the top shelf in the cupboard of his master's bedroom cater was dozing at the moment and greer tilting the jar toward the light saw within a few doubled papers very dusty he snatched the papers out stuffed them into his pocket replaced the jar and closed the cupboard door hastily the door made some little noise and old cater turned and woke and presently he made a shift to sit up in bed while greer scratched his head as innocently as he could and directed his divergent eyes to parts of the room as distant from the cupboard as possible sam'l greer said old cater in a feeble voice while his lower jaw waggled and twitched sam'l greer i think i'll 'ave some beef tea he groped tremulously under his pillow turning his back to greer who tip toed and glared variously over his master's shoulders he saw nothing however though he heard the chink of money old cater turned with a shilling in his shaking hand git 'alf a pound o' shin o' beef he said an' go to green's for it at the other end o' grange road d'ye hear it's it's a penny a pound cheaper there than it is anywhere nearer and and i ain't in so much of a 'urry for it so the distance don't matter go 'long and old jerry cater subsided in a fit of coughing greer needed no second bidding he was anxious to take a peep at the papers he had secreted sinclair was out collecting or trying to collect but greer did not stop to examine his prize before he had banged the street door behind him lest cater listening above should wonder what detained him but in a convenient courtyard a hundred yards away he drew out the papers and inspected them eagerly first there was the policy of insurance of the house and premises then there was a bundle of receipts for the yearly insurance premiums and then there was old jerry cater's will there were two foolscap sheets written all in jerry cater's own straggling handwriting greer hastily scanned the sheets and his dirty face grew longer and his squint intensified as he turned over the second sheet found nothing behind it and stuffed the papers back in his pocket for it was plain that not a penny of old jerry cater's money was for his faithful servant samuel greer ungrateful ole waga bone mused the faithful servant as he went his way not a blessed 'a'peny not a 'a'peny an' them as don't want it gets it o' course that's always the way it's like a greasing' of a fat pig i shall 'ave to get what i can while i can that's all and so ruminating he pursued his way to the butcher's in grange road once more on his way there and twice on his way back samuel greer stepped into retired places to look at those papers again and at each inspection he grew more thoughtful there might be money in it yet come he must think it over the front door being shut and sinclair probably not yet returned he entered the house by a way familiar to the inmates a latched door giving on to the wharf the clock told him that he had been gone nearly an hour but sinclair was still absent when he entered old cater's room upstairs he found a great change the old man lay in a state of collapse choking with a cough that exhausted him and for this there seemed little wonder for the window was open and the room was full of the cold air from the river wot jer bin openin' the winder for asked greer in astonishment it's enough to give ye yer death he shut it and returned to the bedside but though he offered his master the change from the shilling the old man seemed not to see it nor to hear his voice well if you won't don't observed greer with some alacrity pocketing the coppers but i'll bet he'll remember right enough presently d'y'ear he added bending over the bed i've got the beef shall i bile it now but old jerry cater's eyes still saw nothing and he heard not though his shrunken chest and shoulders heaved with the last shudders of the cough that had exhausted him so greer stepped lightly to the cupboard and restored the fire policy and the receipts to the pickle jar he kept the will greer made preparations for cooking the beef and as he did so he encountered another phenomenon well he have bin a goin' of it said greer blow me if he ain't bin readin' the bible now a large ancient worn old bible in a rough calf skin cover lay on a chair by old cater's hand it had probably been the family bible of the caters for generations back for certainly old jerry cater would never have bought such a thing for many years it had accumulated dust on a distant shelf among certain out of date account books but greer had never heard of its being noticed before feels he goin' that's about it greer mused as he pitched the bible back on the shelf to make room for his utensils but i shouldn't ha' thought 'e'd take it sentimental like that readin' the bible an' lettin' in the free air of 'eaven to make 'im cough 'isself blind the beef tea was set simmering and still old cater lay impotent the fit of prostration was longer than any that had preceded it and presently greer thought it might be well to call the doctor call him he did accordingly the surgery was hard by and the doctor came jerry cater revived a little sufficiently to recognise the doctor but it was his last effort he lived another hour and a half greer kept the change and had the beef tea as well the doctor gave his opinion that the old man had risen in delirium and had expended his last strength in moving about the room and opening the window ii samuel greer found somewhere near two pounds in silver in the small canvas bag under the dead man's pillow no more money however rewarded his hasty search about the bedroom and when sinclair returned greer set off to carry the news to paul cater the dead man's nephew the respectable greer had considered well the matter of the will and saw his way he fancied at least to a few pounds by way of compensation for his loss of employment and the ungrateful forgetfulness of his late employer the two sheets comprised in fact not a simple will merely but a will and a codicil each on one of the sheets the codicil being a year or two more recent than the will nobody apparently knew anything of these papers and it struck greer that it was now in his power to prevent anybody learning unless an interested party were disposed to pay for the disclosure that was why he now took his way toward the establishment of paul cater for the will made paul cater not only sole executor but practically sole legatee wherefore greer carefully separated the will from the codicil intending the will alone for sale to paul cater because indeed the codicil very considerably modified it and might form the subject of independent commerce paul cater made a less miserly show than had been the wont of his uncle his house was in a street in pimlico the ground floor front room of which was made into an office with a wire blind carrying his name in gilt letters perhaps it was that paul cater carried his covetousness to a greater refinement than his uncle had done seeing that a decent appearance is a commercial advantage by itself bringing a greater profit than miserly habits could save the man of general dealings was balancing his books when greer arrived but at the announcement of his uncle's death he dropped everything he was not noticeably stricken with grief unless a sudden seizure of his hat and a roaring aloud for a cab might be considered as indications of affliction for in truth paul cater knew well that it was a case in which much might depend on being first at bermondsey wall the worthy greer had scarce got the news out before he found himself standing in the street while cater was giving directions to a cabman here you come in too said cater and greer was bustled into the cab it was plainly a situation in which half crowns should not be too reluctantly parted with so paul cater produced one and presented it cater was a strong faced man of fifty odd with a tight drawn mouth that proclaimed everywhere a tight fist so that the unaccustomed passing over of a tip was a noticeably awkward and unspontaneous performance and greer pocketed the money with little more acknowledgment than a growl do you know where he put the will asked paul cater with a keen glance will answered greer looking him blankly in the face the gaze of one eye passing over cater's shoulder and that of the other seeming to seek his boots will p'raps 'e never made one didn't he that 'ud mean lawfully as the property would come to you an' mr flint 'arves bein' all personal property so i'd think and greer's composite gaze blankly persisted but how do you know whether he made a will or not 'ow do i know ah well p'raps i dunno it's only fancy like i jist put it to you that's all it 'ud be divided atween the two of you then after a long pause he added but lor it 'ud be a pretty fine thing for you if he did leave a will and willed it all to you wouldn't it mighty fine thing an' it 'ud be a mighty fine thing for mr flint if there was a will leaving it all to him wouldn't it pretty fine thing cater said nothing but watched greer's face sharply greer's face with its greasy features and its irresponsible squint was as expressive as a brick they travelled some distance in silence then greer said musingly ah a will like that 'ud be a mighty fine thing what 'ud you be disposed to give for it now give for it what do you mean if there's a will there's an end to it why should i give anything for it jist so jist so replied greer with a complacent wave of the hand why should you no reason at all unless you couldn't find it without givin' something see here now said cater sharply let us understand this do you mean that there is a will and you know that it is hidden and where it is greer's squint remained impenetrable hidden lor 'ow should i know if it was hidden i was a puttin' of a case to you because cater went on disregarding the reply if that's the case the sooner you out with the information the better it'll be for you because there are ways of making people give up information of that sort for nothing yes o' course replied the imperturbable greer o' course there is an' quite right too ah it's a fine thing is the lawr a mighty fine thing the cab rattled over the stones of bermondsey wall and the two alighted at the door through which old jerry cater was soon to come feet first sinclair was back much disturbed and anxious at sight of paul cater the poor fellow weak and broken spirited left the house as quietly as he might for years of grinding habit had inured him to the belief that in reality old cater had treated him rather well and now he feared the probable action of the heirs who was that asked paul cater of greer wasn't it the clerk that owed my uncle the money greer nodded then he's not to come here again do you hear i'll take charge of the books and things as to the debt well i'll see about that after and now look here paul cater stood before greer and spoke with decision about that will now bring it greer was not to be bluffed where from he asked innocently will you stand there and tell me you don't know where it is maybe i'd best stand here and tell you what pays me best pay you how much more do you want bring me that will or i'll have you in gaol for stealing it lor answered greer composedly conscious of holding another trump as well as the will why if there was anybody as knowed where the will was and you talked to him as violent as that 'ere why you'd frighten him so much he'd as likely as not go out and get a price from your cousin mr flint whatever was in the will it might pay him to get hold of it at this moment there came a furious knocking at the front door why greer continued i bet that's him it can't be nobody else i bet the doctor's told him or summat they were on the first floor landing and greer peeped from a broken shuttered window that looked on the street yes he said that's mr flint sure enough now mr paul cater business do you want to see that will before i let mr flint in yes exclaimed cater furiously catching at his arm quick where is it i want twenty pound twenty pound you're mad what for all right if i'm mad i'll go an' let mr flint in the knocking was repeated louder and longer no cried cater getting in his way you know you mustn't conceal a will that's law give it up what's the law that says i must give it up to you 'stead of yer cousin if there's a will it may say anythin' in yer favour or out of it if there ain't you'll git 'alf the will might give you more or it might give you less or it might give you nothink twenty pound for first look at it 'fore flint comes in and do what you like with it 'fore he knows anythink about it again the knocking came at the door this time supplemented by kicks but i don't carry twenty pound about with me protested cater waving his fists give me the will and come to my office for the money to morrow no tick for this sort of job answered greer decisively sorry i can't oblige you i'm goin' down to the front door and he made as though to go well look here said cater desperately pulling out his pocket book i've got a note or two i think 'ow much asked greer calmly laying hold of the pocket book two at least two fivers well i'll let it go at that give us hold he took the notes and pulled out the will from his pocket flint outside battered the door once more why exclaimed cater as he glanced over the sheet i'm sole executor and i get the lot who are these witnesses oh they're all right longshore hands just hereabout you'll get 'em any day at the 'ship and anchor' cater put the will in his breast pocket you'd best get out o' this my man he said you've had me for ten pound and the further you get from me the safer you'll be what said greer with a chuckle not even grateful shockin' he took his way downstairs and cater followed at the door flint a counterpart of cater except that his dress was more slovenly stood ragefully ah cousin said cater standing on the threshold and preventing his entrance this is a very sad loss sad loss flint replied with disgust a lot you think of the loss as much as i do i reckon i want to come in then you sha'n't cater replied with a prompt change of manner you shan't i'm sole executor and i've got the will in my pocket he pulled it out sufficiently far to show the end of the paper and then returned it as executor i'm in charge of the property and responsible it's vested in me till the will's put into effect that's law and it's a bad thing for anybody to interfere with an executor that's law too flint was angry but cautious well he said you're uncommon high with your will and your executor's law and your 'sad loss' i must say what's your game for answer cater began to shut the door just you look out cried flint you haven't heard the last of this you may be executor or it may be a lie you may have the will or you may not anyway i know better than to run the risk of putting myself in the wrong now but i'll watch you and i'll watch this house and i'll be about when the will comes to be proved and if that ain't done quick i'll apply for administration myself and see the thing through iii samuel greer sheered off as the cousinly interview ended well satisfied with himself ten pounds was a fortune to him and he meant having a good deal more he did nothing further till the following morning when he presented himself at the shop of jarvis flint good mornin' mr flint said samuel greer grinning and squinting affably i couldn't help noticin' as you had a few words yesterday with mr cater after the sad loss well it 'appens as i've seen the will as mr cater was talkin' of an' i thought p'raps it 'ud save you makin' mistakes if i told you of it what about it jarvis flint was not disposed to accept greer altogether on trust well it do seem a scandalous thing certainly but what mr cater said was right he do take the personal property subjick to debts an' he do take the freehold prim'ses an' he is the 'xecutor was the will witnessed yes two waterside chaps well know'd there abouts was it made by a lawyer no all in the lamented corpse's 'andwritin' umph flint maintained his hard stare in greer's face anything else well no mr flint sir p'raps not but i wonder if there might be sich a thing as a codicil is there oh i was a wonderin' that's all it might make a deal o' difference in the will mightn't it and p'raps mr cater mightn't know anythink about the codicil what do you mean is there a codicil well reely mr flint answered greer with a deprecatory grin reely it ain't business to give information for nothink is it business or not if you know anything you'll find you'll have to tell it i'm not going to let cater have it all his own way if he is executor my lawyer'll be on the job before you're a day older my man and you won't find it pay to keep things too quiet but it can't pay worse than to give information for nothink persisted greer come now mr flint s'pose i don't say there is mind i only say s'pose s'pose there was a codicil and s'pose that codicil meant a matter of a few thousand pound in your pocket and s'pose some person could tell you where to put your hand on that codicil what might you be disposed to pay that person bring me the codicil answered flint and if it's all right i'll give you well say five shillings greer grinned again and shook his head no reely mr flint he said we can't do business on terms like them fifty pound down in my hand now and it's done fifty 'ud be dirt cheap and the longer you are a considerin' well you know mr cater might get hold of it and then why s'pose it got burnt and never 'eard of agen flint glared with round eyes you get out he said go on fifty pound indeed fifty pound without my knowing whether you're telling lies or not out you go i know what to do now my man greer grinned once more and slouched out he had not expected to bring flint to terms at once of course the man would drive him away at first and having got scent of the existence of the codicil and supposing it to be somewhere concealed about the old house at bermondsey wall he would set his lawyer to warn his cousin that the thing was known and that he as executor would be held responsible for it but the trump card the codicil itself was carefully stowed in the lining of greer's hat and cater knew nothing about it presently flint finding cater obdurate would approach the wily greer again and then he could be squeezed meanwhile the hat lining was as safe a place as any in which to keep the paper perhaps flint might take a fancy to have him waylaid at night and searched in which case a pocket would be an unsafe repository flint on his part was in good spirits plainly there was a codicil favourable to himself certainly he meant neither to pay greer for discovering it at any rate no such sum as fifty pounds nor to abate a jot of his rights flint had a running contract with a shady solicitor named lugg in accordance with which lugg received a yearly payment and transacted all his legal business consisting chiefly of writing threatening letters to unfortunate debtors also as i think i have mentioned dorrington was working for him at the time and working at very cheap rates flint resolved to begin with to set dorrington and lugg to work but first dorrington who as a matter of fact was in flint's back office during the interview with greer thus it was that in an hour or two dorrington found himself in active pursuit of samuel greer with instructions to watch him closely to make him drunk if possible and to get at his knowledge of the codicil by any means conceivable iv on the morning of the day after his talk with flint samuel greer ruminated doubtfully on the advisability of calling on the ship store dealer again or waiting in dignified silence till flint should approach him as he ruminated he rubbed his chin and so rubbing it found it very stubbly he resolved on the luxury of a penny shave and as he walked the street kept his eyes open for a shop where the operation was performed at that price mr flint at any rate could wait till his chin was smooth presently in a turning by abbey street bermondsey he came on just such a barber's shop as he wanted within two men were being shaved already and another waiting and greer felt himself especially fortunate in that three more followed at his heels he was ahead of their turns anyhow so he waited patiently illustration his walk was unsteady the man whose turn was immediately before his own did not appear to be altogether sober a hiccough shook him from time to time he grinned with a dull glance at a comic paper held upside down in his hand and when he went to take his turn at a chair his walk was unsteady the barber had to use his skill to avoid cutting him and he opened his mouth to make remarks at awkward times then greer's turn came at the other chair and when his shave was half completed he saw the unsteady customer rise pay his penny and go out beginnin' early in the mornin' observed one customer the barber laughed yes he said he wants to get a proper bust on before he goes to bed i s'pose samuel greer's chin being smooth at last he rose and turned to where he had hung his hat his jaw dropped and his eyes almost sprang out to meet each other as he saw a bare peg the unsteady customer had walked off with the wrong hat his hat and the paper concealed inside lor cried the dismayed greer he's took my hat all the shopful of men set up a guffaw at this take 'is then said one it's a blame sight better one than yourn but greer without a hat rushed into the street and the barber without his penny rushed after him stop 'im shouted greer distractedly stop thief thus it was that dorrington at this time of a far less well groomed appearance than was his later wont watching outside the barber's observed the mad bursting forth of greer followed by the barber after the barber came the customers one grinning furiously beneath a coating of lather stop 'im cried greer 'e's got my 'at stop 'im you pay me my money said the barber catching his arm never mind yer 'at you can 'ave 'is but just you pay me first leave go you're responsible for lettin' 'im take it i tell you it's a special 'at valuable leave go dorrington stayed to hear no more three minutes before he had observed a slightly elevated navvy emerge from the shop and walk solemnly across the street under a hat manifestly a size or two too small for him now dorrington darted down the turning which the man had taken the hat was a wretched thing and there must be some special reason for greer's wild anxiety to recover it especially as the navvy must have left another probably better behind him already dorrington had conjectured that greer was carrying the codicil about with him for he had no place else to hide it and he would scarcely have offered so confidently to negotiate over it if it had been in the bermondsey wall house well in reach of paul cater so he followed the elevated navvy with all haste he might never have seen him again were it not that the unconscious bearer of the fortunes of flint and indeed dorrington hesitated for a little while whether or not to enter the door of a public house near st saviour's dock in the end he decided to go on and it was just as he had started that dorrington sighted him again the navvy walked slowly and gravely on now and again with a swerve to the wall or the curb but generally with a careful and laboured directness presently he arrived at a dock bridge with a low iron rail an incoming barge attracted his eye and he stopped and solemnly inspected it he leaned on the low rail for this purpose and as he did so the hat all too small fell off had he been standing two yards nearer the centre of the bridge it would have dropped into the water as it was it fell on the quay a few feet from the edge and a dockman coming toward the steps by the bridge side picked it up and brought it with him here y'are mate said the dockman offering the hat the navvy took it in lofty silence and inspected it narrowly then he said 'ere wot's this this ain't my 'at and he glared suspiciously at the dockman ain't it answered the dockman carelessly aw right then keep it for the bloke it b'longs to i don't want it no returned the navvy with rising indignation but i want mine though wotcher done with it eh it ain't a rotten old 'un like this 'ere none o' yer 'alf larks jist you 'and it over come on 'and wot over asked the dockman growing indignant in his turn you drops yer 'at over the bridge like some kid as can't take care of it and i brings it up for ye 'stead o' sayin' thank ye 'like a man y' asks me for another 'at go an' bile yer face and he turned on his heel no ye don't bawled the navvy dropping the battered hat and making a complicated rush at the other's retreating form not much you gimme my 'at and he grabbed the dockman anywhere with both hands illustration a mingled bunch of dockman and navvy was floundering about the street the dockman was as big as the navvy and no more patient he immediately punched his assailant's nose and in three seconds a mingled bunch of dockman and navvy was floundering about the street dorrington saw no more he had the despised hat in his hand and general attention being directed to the action in progress he hurried quietly up the nearest court v samuel greer having got clear of the barber by paying his penny was in much perplexity and this notwithstanding his acquisition of the navvy's hat a very decent bowler which covered his head generously and rested on his ears what should be the move now his hat was clean gone and the codicil with it to find it again would be a hopeless task unless by chance the navvy should discover his mistake and return to the barber's to make a rectification of hats so samuel greer returned once more to the barber's and for the rest of the day called again and again fruitlessly at first the barber was vastly amused and told the story to his customers who laughed then the barber got angry at the continual worrying and at the close of the day's barbering he earned his night's repose by pitching samuel greer neck and crop into the gutter samuel greer gathered himself up disconsolately surrounded his head with the navvy's hat and shuffled off to the ship and anchor at the ship and anchor he found one barker a decayed and sodden lawyer's clerk out of work greer's temporary affluence enabling him to stand drinks he was presently able by putting artfully hypothetical cases to extract certain legal information from barker chiefly he learned that if a will or a codicil were missing it might nevertheless be possible to obtain probate of it by satisfying the court with evidence of its contents and its genuineness here at any rate was a certain hope he alone apparently of all persons knew the contents of the codicil and the names of the witnesses and since it was impossible to sell the codicil now that it was gone he might at least sell his evidence he resolved to offer his evidence for sale to flint at once and take what he could get there must be no delay for possibly the navvy might find the paper in the hat and carry it to flint seeing that his name was beneficially mentioned in it and his address given plainly the hat would not go back to the barber's now if the drunken navvy had found out his mistake he probably had not the least notion where he had been nor where the hat had come from else he would have returned it during the day and recovered his own superior property so samuel greer went at once late as it was and knocked up mr flint flint congratulated himself feeling sure that greer had thought better of his business and had come to give his information for anything he could get greer on his part was careful to conceal the fact that the codicil had been in his possession and had been lost all he said was that he had seen the codicil that its date was nine months later than that of the will and that it benefited jarvis flint to the extent of some ten thousand pounds leaving flint to suppose if he pleased that cater the executor had the codicil but would probably suppress it indeed this was the conclusion that flint immediately jumped at and the result of the interview was this flint with much grudging and reluctance handed over as a preliminary fee the sum of one pound the most he could be screwed up to then it was settled that greer should come on the morrow and consult with flint and his solicitor lugg the object of the consultation being the construction of a consistent tale and a satisfactory soi disant copy of the codicil which greer was to swear to if necessary and armed with which paul cater might be confronted and brought to terms it may be wondered why ere this flint had not received the genuine codicil itself recovered by dorrington from greer's hat the fact was that dorrington as was his wont was playing a little game of his own having possessed himself of the codicil he was now in a position to make the most from both sides and in a far more efficient manner than the clumsy greer people of jarvis flint's sordid character are apt with all their sordid keenness to be wonderfully short sighted in regard to what might seem fairly obvious to a man of honest judgment thus it never occurred to flint that a man like dorrington willing for a miserable wage to apply his exceptional subtlety to the furtherance of his employer's rascally designs would be at least as ready to swindle that master on his own account when the opportunity offered would be in fact the more ready in proportion to the stinginess wherewith his master had treated him having found the codicil dorrington's procedure was not to hand it over forthwith to flint it was this first he made a careful and exact copy of the codicil then he procured two men of his acquaintance men of good credit to read over the copy word for word and certify it as being an exact copy of the original by way of a signed declaration written on the back of the copy then he was armed at all points he packed the copy carefully away in his pocket book and with the original in his coat pocket he called at the house in bermondsey wall where paul cater had taken up his quarters to keep guard over everything till the will should be proved so it happened that while samuel greer jarvis flint and lugg the lawyer were building their scheme dorrington was talking to paul cater at cater's wharf on the assurance that he had business of extreme importance cater took dorrington into the room in which the old man had died cater was using this room as an office in which to examine and balance his uncle's books and the corpse had been carried to a room below to await the funeral dorrington's clothes at this time as i have hinted were not distinguished by the excellence of cut and condition that was afterwards noticeable in point of fact he was seedy but his assurance and his presence of mind were fully developed and it was this very transaction that was to put the elegant appearance within his reach mr cater he said i believe you are sole executor of the will of your uncle mr jeremiah cater who lived in this house cater assented that will is one extremely favourable to yourself in fact by it you become not only sole executor but practically sole legatee well i am here as a man of business and as a man of the world to give you certain information there is a codicil to that will cater started then he shrugged his shoulders and shook his head as though he knew better there is a codicil dorrington went on imperturbably executed in strict form all in the handwriting of the testator and dated nine months later than the will that codicil benefits your cousin mr jarvis flint to the extent of ten thousand pounds to put it in another way it deprives you of ten thousand pounds cater felt uneasy but he did his best to maintain a contemptuous appearance you're rushing ahead pretty fast he said talking about the terms of this codicil as you call it what i want to know is where is it that replied dorrington smilingly is a question very easily answered the codicil is in my pocket he tapped his coat as he spoke paul cater started again and now he was plainly discomposed very well he said with some bravado if you've got it you can show it to me i suppose nothing easier dorrington responded affably he stepped to the fireplace and took the poker you won't mind my holding the poker while you inspect the paper will you he asked politely the fact is the codicil is of such a nature that i fear a man of your sharp business instincts might be tempted to destroy it there being no other witness present unless you had the assurance which i now give you that if you as much as touch it i shall stun you with the poker there is the codicil which you may read with your hands behind you he spread the paper out on the table and cater bent eagerly and read it growing paler as his eye travelled down the sheet before raising his eyes however he collected himself and as he stood up he said with affected contempt i don't care a brass farthing for this thing it's a forgery on the face of it dear me answered dorrington placidly recovering the paper and folding it up that's very disappointing to hear i must take it round to mr flint and see if that is his opinion no you mustn't exclaimed cater desperately you say that's a genuine document very well i'm still executor and you are bound to give it to me precisely dorrington replied sweetly but in the strict interests of justice i think mr flint as the person interested ought to have a look at it first in case any accident should happen to it in your hands don't you cater knew he was in a corner and his face betrayed it come said dorrington in a more business like tone here is the case in a nutshell it is my business just as it is yours to get as much as i can for nothing in pursuance of that business i quietly got hold of this codicil nobody but yourself knows i have it and as to how i got it you needn't ask for i sha'n't tell you here is the document and it is worth ten thousand pounds to either of two people yourself and mr flint your worthy cousin i am prepared to sell it at a very great sacrifice to sell it dirt cheap in fact and i give you the privilege of first refusal for which you ought to be grateful one thousand pounds is the price and that gives you a profit of nine thousand pounds when you have destroyed the codicil a noble profit of nine hundred per cent at a stroke come is it a bargain what ejaculated cater astounded a thousand pounds one thousand pounds exactly replied dorrington complacently and a penny for the receipt stamp if you want a receipt oh said cater you're mad a thousand pounds why it's absurd think so remarked dorrington reaching for his hat then i must see if mr flint agrees with you that's all he's a man of business and i never heard of his refusing a certain nine hundred per cent profit yet good day no stop yelled the desperate cater don't go don't be unreasonable now say five hundred and i'll write you a cheque won't do answered dorrington shaking his head a thousand is the price and not a penny less and not by cheque mind i understand all moves of that sort notes or gold i wonder at a smart man like yourself expecting me to be so green but i haven't the money here very likely not where's your bank we'll go there and get it cater between his avarice and his fears was at his wits' end don't be so hard on me mr dorrington he whined i'm not a rich man i assure you you'll ruin me ruin you what do you mean i give you ten thousand pounds for one thousand and you say i ruin you really it seems too ridiculously cheap if you don't settle quickly mr cater i shall raise my terms i warn you so it came about that dorrington and cater took cab together for a branch bank in pimlico whence dorrington emerged with one thousand pounds in notes and gold stowed carefully about his person and cater with the codicil to his uncle's will which half an hour later he had safely burnt vi so much for the first half of dorrington's operation for the second half he made no immediate hurry if he had been aware of samuel greer's movements and lugg's little plot he might have hurried but as it was he busied himself in setting up on a more respectable scale by help of his newly acquired money but he did not long delay he had the attested copy of the codicil which would be as good as the original if properly backed with evidence in a court of law the astute cater wise in his own conceit just as was his equally astute cousin flint had clean overlooked the possibility of such a trick as this and now all dorrington had to do was to sell the copy for one more thousand pounds to jarvis flint it was on the morning of old jerry cater's funeral that he made his way to deptford to do this and he chuckled as he reflected on the probable surprise of flint who doubtless wondered what had become of his sweated inquiry agent when confronted with his offer but when he arrived at the ship store shop he found that flint was out so he resolved to call again in the evening at that moment jarvis flint samuel greer and lugg the lawyer were at the house in bermondsey wall attacking paul cater greer foreseeing probable defiance by cater from a window had led the party in by the wharf door and so had taken cater by surprise cater was in a suit of decent black as befitted the occasion and he received the news of the existence of a copy of the codicil he had destroyed with equal fury and apprehension what do you mean he demanded what do you mean i'm not to be bluffed like this you talk about a codicil where is it where is it eh my dear sir said lugg peaceably he was a small snuffy man we are not here to make disturbances or quarrels or breaches of the peace we are here on a strictly business errand and i assure you it will be for your best interests if you listen quietly to what we have to say ahem it seems that mr samuel greer here has frequently seen the codicil greer's a rascal a thief a scoundrel cried the irate cater shaking his fist in the thick of greer's squint he swindled me out of ten pounds he really mr cater lugg interposed you do no good by such outbursts and you prevent my putting the case before you as i was saying mr greer has frequently seen the codicil and saw it indeed on the very day of the late mr cater's decease you may not have come across it and indeed there may be some temporary difficulty in finding the original but fortunately mr greer took notes of the contents and of the witnesses' names and from those notes i have been able to draw up this statement which mr greer is prepared to subscribe to by affidavit or declaration if by any chance you may be unable to produce the original codicil cater seeing his thousand pounds to dorrington going for nothing and now confronted with the fear of losing ten thousand pounds more could scarce speak for rage greer's a liar i tell you he spluttered out a liar a thief a scoundrel his word his affidavit his oath anything of his isn't worth a straw that my dear sir lugg proceeded equably is a thing that may remain for the probate court and possibly a jury to decide upon in the meantime permit me to suggest that it will be better for all parties cheaper in fact if this matter be settled out of court i think if you will give the matter a little calm and unbiassed thought you will admit that the balance of strength is altogether with our case would you like to look at the statement its effect you will see is roughly speaking to give my client a legacy of say about ten thousand pounds in value the witnesses are easily produced and really i must say for my part if mr greer who has nothing to gain or lose either way is prepared to take the serious responsibility of swearing a declaration i don't believe he will cried cater catching at the straw i don't believe he will mind greer he went on there's penal servitude for perjury yes greer answered speaking for the first time with a squint and a chuckle so there is and for stealin' an' suppressin' dockyments i'm told i'm ready to make that 'ere declaration i don't believe he is cater said with an attempt to affect indifference and anyhow i needn't take any notice of it till he does well said lugg accommodatingly there need be no difficulty or delay about that the declaration's all written out and i'm a commissioner to administer oaths i think that's a bible i see on the shelf there isn't it he stepped across to where the old bible had lain since greer flung it there just before jerry cater's death he took the book down and opened it at the title page yes he said a bible and now why what what mr lugg stood suddenly still and stared at the fly leaf then he said quietly let me see it was on monday last that mr cater died was it not yes late in the afternoon yes then gentlemen you must please prepare yourselves for a surprise mr cater evidently made another will revoking all previous wills and codicils on the very day of his death and here it is he extended the bible before him and it was plain to see that the fly leaf was covered with the weak straggling handwriting of old jerry cater a little weaker and a little more straggling than that in the other will but unmistakably his flint stared perplexed and bewildered greer scratched his head and squinted blankly at the lawyer paul cater passed his hand across his forehead and seized a tuft of hair over one temple as though he would pull it out the only book in the house that he had not opened or looked at during his stay was the bible the thing is very short lugg went on inclining the writing to the light 'this is the last will and testament of me jeremiah cater of cater's wharf i give and bequeath the whole of the estate and property of which i may die possessed whether real or personal entirely and absolutely to to ' what is the name oh yes 'to henry sinclair my clerk ' what yelled cater and flint in chorus each rising and clutching at the bible not sinclair no let me see i think gentlemen said the solicitor putting their hands aside that you will get the information quickest by listening while i read ' to henry sinclair my clerk and i appoint the said henry sinclair my sole executor and i wish it to be known that i do this not only by way of reward to an honest servant and to recompense him for his loss in loan transactions with me but also to mark my sense of the neglect of my two nephews and i revoke all former wills and codicils' then follows date and signature and the signatures of witnesses both apparently men of imperfect education but you're mad it's impossible exclaimed cater the first to find his tongue he couldn't have made a will then he was too weak greer knows he couldn't greer who understood better than anybody else present the allusion in the will to the nephews' neglect coughed dubiously and said well he did get up while i was out an' when i got back he had the bible beside him an' he seemed pretty well knocked up with something an' the winder was wide open i expect he opened it to holler out as well as he could to some chaps on the wharf or somewhere to come up by the wharf door and do the witnessing an' now i think of it i expect he sent me out a purpose in case well in case if i knowed i might get up to summat with the will he told me not to hurry an' i expect he about used himself up with the writin' an' the hollerin' an' the cold air an' what not cater and flint greatly abashed exchanged a rapid glance then cater with a preliminary cough said hesitatingly well now mr lugg let us consider this it seems quite evident to me and no doubt it will to you as my cousin's solicitor it seems quite evident to me that my poor uncle could not have been in a sound state of mind when he made this very ridiculous will quite apart from all questions of genuineness i've no doubt that a court would set it aside and in view of that it would be very cruel to allow this poor man sinclair to suppose himself to be entitled to a great deal of money only to find himself disappointed and ruined after all you'll agree with that i'm sure so i think it will be best for all parties if we keep this thing to ourselves and just tear out that fly leaf and burn it to save trouble and on my part i shall be glad to admit the copy of the codicil you have produced and no doubt my cousin and i will be prepared to pay you a fee which will compensate you for any loss of business in actions eh mr lugg was tempted but he was no fool here was samuel greer at his elbow knowing everything and without a doubt no matter how well bribed always ready to make more money by betraying the arrangement to sinclair and that would mean inevitable ruin to lugg himself and probably a dose of gaol so he shook his head virtuously and said i couldn't think of anything of the sort mr cater not for an instant i am a solicitor and i have my strict duties it is my duty immediately to place this will in the hands of mr henry sinclair as sole executor i wish you a good day gentlemen and so it was that old jerry cater's money came at last to sinclair and the result was a joyful one not only for sinclair and his wife but also for a number of poor debtors whose paper was part of the property for sinclair knew the plight of these wretches by personal experience and was merciful as neither flint nor paul cater would have been the two witnesses to the bible will turned out to be bargemen they had been mightily surprised to be hailed from jerry cater's window by the old man himself already looking like a corpse they had come up however at his request and had witnessed the will though neither knew anything of its contents but they were ready to testify that it was written in a bible that they saw cater sign it and that the attesting signatures were theirs they had helped the old man back into bed and next day they heard that he was dead as for dorrington he had a thousand pounds to set him up in a gentlemanly line of business and villainy ignorant of what had happened he attempted to tap flint for another thousand pounds as he had designed but was met with revilings and an explanation seeing that the game was finished dorrington laughed at both the cousins and turned his attention to his next case and old jerry cater's funeral was attended as nobody would have expected by two very genuine mourners paul cater and jarvis flint but they mourned not the old man but his lost fortune and paul cater also mourned a sum of one thousand and ten pounds of his own they had followed lugg to the door when he walked off with the bible in hope to persuade him but he saw a wealthy client in prospect in mr henry sinclair and would not allow his virtue to be shaken samuel greer walked away from the old house in moody case plainly there were no more pickings available from old jerry cater's wills and codicils as he trudged by st saviour's dock he was suddenly confronted by a large navvy with a black eye the navvy stooped and inspected a peacock's feather eye that adorned the band of the hat greer was wearing then he calmly grabbed and inspected the hat itself inside and outside why blow me if this ain't my 'at said the navvy take that ye dirty squintin' thief and that too and that unwin brothers the gresham press woking and london
