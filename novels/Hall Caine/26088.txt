a son of hagar a romance of our time by hall caine author of the bondsman the deemster etc god hath heard the voice of the lad where he is new york hurst company publishers to rd blackmore it must be an exceeding great reward beyond all the rewards of material success to know that you have written a book that is deep tranquil strong and pure again and again you have nobly earned that knowledge across the more than thirty years that divide us the elder from the younger brother the veteran from the raw comrade let me offer my hand to you as to a master of our craft to the author then of a romance that has no equal save in scott i humbly dedicate this romance of mine hc cumbrian words barnchild dustadost thou hastahast thou laallittle leetalight girtgreat sistaseest thou varravery wadstawouldst thou wiltawilt thou shafan expression of contempt preface in my first novel the shadow of a crime i tried to penetrate into the soul of a brave unselfish long suffering man and to lay bare the processes by which he raised himself to a great height of self sacrifice in this novel the aim has been to penetrate into the soul of a bad man and to lay bare the processes by which he is tempted to his fall to find a character that shall be above all common tendencies to guilt and yet tainted with the plague spot of evil hidden somewhere then to watch the first sharp struggle of what is good in the man with what is bad until he is in the coil of his temptation and finally to show in what tragic ruin a man of strong passions great will and power of mind may resist the force that precipitates him and save his soul alive this is i trust a motive no less worthy no less profitable to study in the utmost result no less heroic and inspiring than that of tracing the upward path of noble types of mind for me there has been a pathetic and i think purifying interest in looking into the soul of this man and seeing it corrode beneath the touch of a powerful temptation until at the last when it seems to lie spent it rises again in strength and shows that the human heart has no depths in which it is lost if this character had been equal to my intention it might have been a real contribution to fiction and far as i know it to fall short of the first deep blow of feeling in which it was conceived it is i think new to the novel though it holds a notable place in the drama it would be presumptuous to say where unnecessary also as i have made no disguise of my purpose one of the usual disadvantages of choosing a leading character that is off the lines of heroic portraiture is that the author may seem to be in sympathy with a base part in life and with base opinions in this novel i run a different risk i shall not be surprised if i provoke some hostility in making the bad man justify his course by the gaunt and grim morality that masquerades as the morality of our own time while the good man is made to justify his one dubious act by the full and sincere and just morality that too often wears now the garb of vice the morality of the books of moses this novel relies i trust on the sheer humanities alone but among its less aggressive purposes is that of a plea for the natural rights of the bastard those rights have been recognized in every country and by every race except one since the day when the outcast woman in the wilderness hearkened to the cry from heaven which said god hath heard the voice of the lad where he is in england alone have the rights of blood been as nothing compared with the rights of property and it is part of the business of this novel to exhibit these interests at a climax of strife i have no fear that any true hearted person will accuse me of a desire to cast reproach upon marriage as an ordinance recognizing the beauty and the sanctity of marriage i have tried to show that true marriage is a higher thing than a ceremony and that people who use the gibbet and stake for offenders against its forms are too often those who see no offense in the violation of its spirit my principal scenes are again among the mountains of cumberland but in this second attempt i have tried to realize more completely their solitude and sweetness their breezy healthfulness and their scent as of new cut turf by putting them side by side with scenes full of the garrulous clangor and the malodor of the dark side of london when i began i thought to enlarge the popular knowledge of our robust north country by the addition of some whimsical character and quaint folk lore if much of this quiet local atmosphere has had to make way before one strong current of tragic feeling i trust some of it remains that is fresh and bracing in the incidents of the booth the smithy the dalesman's wedding the rush bearing the cock fighting and the sheep shearing those readers of the earlier book who found human nature and an element of humor in the patois will regret with me the necessity so to modify the dialect in this book as to remove from it nearly all the race quality that comes of intonation i ought to add that one of my characters parson christian is a portrait of a dear simple honest soul long gone to his account and that the words here put into his mouth are oftener his own than mine i trust this book may help to correct a prevailing misconception as to the morals and mind of the typical english peasantry it is certain that the conventional peasant of literature the broad mouthed rustic in a smock frock dull eyed mulish beetle headed doddering too vacant to be vicious too doltish to do amiss does not exist as a type in england what does exist in every corner of the country is a peasantry speaking a patois that is often of varying inflections but is always full of racy poetry illiterate and yet possessed of a vast oral literature sharing brains with other classes more equally than education humorous nimble witted clear sighted astute cynical not too virtuous and having a lofty contempt for the wiseacres of the town the manners and customs the folk lore and folk talk of cumberland are far from exhausted in my two cumberland novels but it is not probable that i shall work in this vein again in parting from it may i venture to hope that here and there a reader grown tired of the life of the great cities has sometimes found it a relief to escape with me into these mountain solitudes and look upon a life as real and more true a life that is humble and yet not low a life in which men may be men and the rude people of the soil need study the face of no master save nature alone a son of hagar book i retro me sathana prologue in the year it was a chill december morning the atmosphere was dense with fog in the dusky chamber of a london police court the lights were bleared and the voices drowsed a woman carrying a child in her arms had been half dragged half pushed into the dock she was young beneath her disheveled hair her face showed almost girlish her features were pinched with pain her eyes had at one moment a serene look and at the next moment a look of defiance her dress had been rich it was now torn and damp and clung in dank folds to her limbs the child she carried appeared to be four months old she held it convulsively at her breast and when it gave forth a feeble cry she rocked it mechanically your worship i picked this person out of the river at ha'past one o'clock this morning said a constable she had throwed herself off the steps of blackfriars bridge had she the child with her asked the bench yes your worship and when i brought her to land i couldn't get the little one out of her arms nohow she clung that tight to it the mother she was insensible but the child opened its eyes and cried have you not learned her name no sir she won't give us no answer when we ask her that i am informed said the clerk that against all inquiries touching her name and circumstances she keeps a rigid silence the doctor is of opinion your worship that the woman is not entirely responsible her appearance in court might certainly justify that conclusion said the magistrate the young woman had gazed vacantly about her with an air of indifference she seemed scarcely to realize that through the yellow vagueness the eyes of a hundred persons were centered on her haggard face anybody here who knows her asked the bench yes your worship i found out the old woman alonger she lodged let us hear the old person a woman in middle life a little confused aimless uncomfortable body stepped into the box she answered to the name of drayton her husband was a hotel porter she had a house in pimlico a month ago one of her rooms on the first floor back had been to let she put a card in her window and the prisoner applied accepted the young lady as tenant and had been duly paid her rent knew nothing of who she was or where she came from couldn't even get her name had heard her call the baby paul that was all she knew her occupation my good woman what was it nothing she hadn't no occupation your worship never went out not at night no sir leastways not at night sir i hopes your worship takes me for an honest woman sir did nothing for a living and yet she paid you did you board her yes your worship she could cook her wittles but the poor young thing seemed never to have heart for nothing sir never talked to you no sir nothing but cried she cried and cried and cried 'cept when she laughed and then it were awful your worship my man always did say as how there was no knowing what she'd be doing of yet is she married do you know yes your worship she wears her wedding ring quite regular only once she plucked it off and flung it in the fire i saw it with my own eyes sir or i mightn't ha' believed it and i never did see the like but the poor creature's not responsible at whiles that's what my husband says what was her behavior to the child did she seem fond of it oh yes your worship she used to hug and hug and hug it and call it her darling and paul and paul and paul and all she had left in the world when did you see her last before to day yesterday sir she put on her bonnet and cape and drew a shawl around the baby and went out in the afternoon 'it will do you a mort of good' says i to her 'yes mrs drayton' says she 'it will do us both a world of good' that was on the front doorsteps your worship and it was a nice afternoon but i had never no idea what she meant to be doing of but she's not responsible poor young thing that's what my and when night came and she hadn't got home did you go in search of her yes your worship for i says to my husband says i 'poor young thing i can't rest in my bed and knowing nothing of what's come to her' and my man he says to me 'maggie' he says 'you go to the station and give the officers her description' he says 'a tall young woman as might ha' been a lady a carrying a baby that'll be good enough' he says and i went and this morning the officer came and i knew by his face as something had happened and let us hear the doctor is he in court yes your worship said the constable mrs drayton was being bustled out of the box she stopped on the first step down and i do hope as no harm will come to her she's not responsible that's what my hus all right we know all that down with you this way don't bother his worship at the bottom of the steps the woman stopped again with a handkerchief to her eyes and it do make me cry to see her poor thing and the baby too and innocent as a kitten and i hopes if anything is done to her as mrs drayton's further hopes and fears were lost in the bustle of the court the young woman in the dock still gazed about her vacantly there was strength in her firmly molded lip sensibility in her large dark eyes power in her broad smooth brow and a certain stateliness in the outlines of her tall slim figure the doctor who had examined her gave his report in a few words the woman should be under control though she was dangerous to no one but herself her attempt at suicide was one of the common results of disaster in affairs of love perhaps she was a married woman abandoned by her husband more likely she was an unfortunate lady in whom the shame of pregnancy had produced insanity she was obviously a person of education and delicacy of feeling she must have connections of some kind said the magistrate and turning to the dock he said quietly give us your name my good lady the woman seemed not to hear but she pressed her child yet closer to her breast and it cried feebly the magistrate tried again your baby's name is paul isn't it paul what she looked around glanced at the magistrate and back at the people in the court but said nothing just then the door opposite the bench creaked slightly and a gentleman entered the woman's wondering eyes passed over him in an instant her torpor was shaken off she riveted her gaze on the new comer her features contracted with lines of pain she drew the child aside as if to hide it from sight then her face twitched and she staggered back into the arms of the constable behind her she was now insensible through the dense folds of the fog the vague faces of the spectators showed an intent expression it was observed that the gentleman who had entered the court a moment before immediately left it the magistrate saw him pass out of the door merely as a distorted figure in the dusky shadows let her be removed to the dartford asylum said the magistrate i will give an order at once a voice came from the body of the court it was mrs drayton's voice thick with sobs and if you please your worship may me and my husband take care of the child until the poor young thing is well enough to come for it we've no children of our own sir and my husband and me we'd like to have it and no one would do no better by it your worship i think you are a good woman mrs drayton said the magistrate then turning to the clerk he added let inquiries be made about her and if all prove satisfactory let the child be given into her care oh thank your worship it do make me cry yes all right never mind now we know all about it come along the prisoner recovered consciousness in being removed from the dock the constable was taking the child out of her arms she clung to it with feverish hands take me away she said in a deep whisper and her eyes wandered to the door stop that man said the magistrate pointing to the vague recesses into which the spectator had disappeared an officer of the court went out hastily presently returning he is gone said the officer take me away take me away cried the prisoner in a tense voice paul paul my own little paul the woman's breath came and went in gusts and her child cried from the convulsive pressure to her breast remove them said the bench there was a faint commotion among the people in the court huddled like sheep there was a harsh scraping of feet and some suppressed whispering the stolid faces on the bench turned and smiled slightly in the yellow gleam of the gas that burned in front of them then the momentary bustle ended the woman and child were gone and the calm monotony of the court was resumed six months later a handsome woman still little more than a girl yet with eyes of suffering stepped up to the door of a house in pimlico and knocked timidly i wish to see mrs drayton she said when the door was opened by an elderly person bless you they're gone mrs drayton and her husband gone said the young woman gone what do you mean why gone removed shifted removed shifted the idea seemed to struggle its slow way into her brain in course what else when the big hotel fails and he loses his job rents can't be paid on nothing a week and something to put in the mouth besides gone are you mad woman think what you're saying gone where how do i know where mad indeed i'll not say but other folk look a mort madder nor ever i looked the young woman took her by the shoulder don't say that don't say you don't know where they're gone they've got my child i tell you my poor little paul oh so you're the young party as drowned herself are you well they're gone anyways and the little chit with them and there's no saying where you may believe me ask the neighbors else the young woman leaned against the door jamb with a white face and great eyes well well how hard she takes it deary me deary me she's not a bad sort after all well well who'd ha' thought it there there come in and sit awhile it is cruel to lose one's babby and me to tell her too misbegotten or not it's one's own flesh and blood and that's what i always says the young woman had been drawn into the house and seated on a chair she got up again with the face of an old woman oh i'm choking she said rest awhile do now my dear there there no no my good woman let me go heaven help you child how you look heaven has never helped me said the young woman i was a sister of charity only two years ago a man found me and wooed me married me and abandoned me i tried to die and they rescued me they separated me from my child and put me in an asylum i escaped and have now come for my darling and he is gone deary me deary me and the old woman stroked her consolingly let me go she cried starting up afresh if heaven has done nothing for me perhaps the world itself will have mercy the ghastly face answered ill to the grating laugh that followed as she jerked her head aside and hurried away chapter i in the year it was young folks' day in the vale of newlands the summer was at its height the sun shone brightly the lake to the north lay flat as a floor of glass and reflected a continent of blue cloud the fells were clear to their summits and purple with waves of heather it was noontide and the shadows were short in the slumberous atmosphere the bees droned and the hot air quivered some feet above the long lush grass the fragrance of new mown hay floated languidly through a sub current of wild rose and honeysuckle in a meadow at the foot of the causey pike tents were pitched flags were flying and crowds of men women and children watched the mountain sports in the center of a group of spectators two men stripped to the waist were wrestling they were huge fellows with muscles that stood out on their arms like giant bulbs and feet that held the ground like the hoofs of oxen the wrestlers were calm to all outward appearance and embraced each other with the quiet fondling of lambs and the sinuous power of less affectionate creatures but the people about them were wildly excited they stopped to watch every wary movement of the foot and craned their necks to catch the subtlest twist of the wrist sista reuben sista he'll have enough to do to tummel john proudfoot john's up to the scat to day anyways look tha john's on for giving him the cross buttock john was the blacksmith a big buirdly fellow with a larger blunt head and he has given it too has john nay nay john's doon ey ey he's doon is john one of the wrestlers had thrown the other and was standing quietly over him he was a stalwart young man of eight and twenty brown haired clear eyed of a ruddy complexion with a short thick curly beard and the grace and bearing that comes of health and strength and a complete absence of self consciousness he smiled cheerfully and nodded his head in response to loud shouts of applause weel done verra weel done that's the way to ding 'em ower what sayst tha reuben what a bash it was to be sure what dusta think you of yon wrestling ey man nay nay it's verra middling ever seen owt like it since the good auld days you crack on sa often auld man nay he doont him verra neat did paul i will allow it there's never a man in cumberland need take a hand with young paul ritson after this ey ey he's his father's son the wrestler surrounded by a little multitude of boys who clung to his sparse garments on every side made his way to a tent at the same moment a ludicrous figure forced a passage through the crowd and came to a stand in the middle of the green it was a diminutive creature mounted on a pony that carried its owner on a saddle immediately below its neck and a pair of paniers just above its tail the rider was an elderly man with shaggy eyebrows and beard of mingled black and gray his swarthy keen wizened face was twisted into grotesque lines beneath a pair of little blinking eyes which seemed to say that anybody who refused to see that they belonged to a perfectly wideawake son of old adam made a portentous mistake he was the mountain peddler and to day at least his visit was opportune lasses here's for you look you here's gubblum oglethorpe pony and all why didsta ever see the like gubblum's getten hissel into a saddle gubblum from his seat on the pony twisted one half of his wrinkled face awry and said in course i have but it's a vast easier getting into this saddle nor getting out of it i can tell you why how's that gubblum cried a voice from the crowd what man did you never hear of the day i bought it sundry shakes of many heads were the response no said gubblum with an accent of sheer incredulity and added well there is no accounting for the ignorance of some folks what happened to you gubblum gubblum's expression of surprise gave place to a look of condescension he lifted his bronzed and hairy hand to the rim of his straw hat to shade his eyes from the sun well when i got on to auld bessy here i couldn't get off again that's what happened no why you see i'd got my clogs on when i went to buy the saddle in kezzick and they're middling wide in the soles my clogs are so when i put my feet into the stirrups there they stuck stuck ey fast as nails and when i got home to branth'et edge i couldn't get them out so our sally she said to my auld woman 'mother' she said 'we'll have to put father into the stable with the pony and fetch him a cup of tea' and that's what they did and when i had summat into me i had another fratch at getting out of the saddle but i couldn't manish it so i had what you think i had to do nay man what i had to sleep all night in the stable on bessy's back bless thee gubblum and whatever didsta do i'm coming to that on'y some folks are so impatient next morning that lass of mine she said to her mother 'mother' she said 'wouldn't it be best to take the saddle off the pony and then father he'll sure come off with it' and they did do it ey they did they took bessy and me round to the soft bed as they keeps maistly at the back of a stable and they loosened the straps and gave a push and cried 'away' weel man weel weel nowt of the sort it wasn't weel at all when i rolled over i was off the pony for sure but i was stuck fast to the saddle just the same what ever did they do with thee then i'm coming to that too on'y some folks are so mortal fond of hearing theirselves talk they picked me up saddle and all and set me on the edge of the kitchen dresser and there i sat for the best part of a week sleeping and waking and carding and spinning and getting fearful thin but i got off at last i did there was a look of proud content in gubblum's face as he added what a thing it is to be eddicated we don't vally eddication half enough a young fellow it was lang geordie moore pushed a smirking face between the shoulders of two girls and said did you take to reading and writing then gubblum when you were on the kitchen dresser there was a gurgling titter but disdaining to notice the interruption gubblum lifted his tawny face into the glare of the sun and said it was my son as did it him that is learning for a parson he came home from st bees and 'mother' he said before he'd been in the house a minute 'let's take fathers clogs off and then his feet will come out of the stirrups a loud laugh bubbled over the company gubblum sat erect in the saddle and added with a grave face that's what comes of eddication and reading the bible and all o' that if i had fifty sons i'd make 'em all parsons the people laughed again and crowed and exchanged nods and knowing winks they enjoyed the peddler's talk and felt an indulgent tenderness for his slow and feeble intellect he on his part enjoyed no less to assume a simple and shallow nature a twinkle lurked under his bushy brows while he smoked the gonies they laughed and he smiled slyly and both were satisfied gubblum oglethorpe peddler of branth'et edge got off his pony and stroked its tousled mane he was leading it to a temporary stable when he met face to face the young wrestler paul ritson who was coming from the tent in his walking costume drawing up sharply he surveyed paul rapidly from head to foot and then asked him with a look of bewilderment what he could be doing there why when did you come back to these parts paul smiled come back i've not been away the old man looked slyly up into paul's face and winked perceiving no response to that insinuating communication his wrinkled face became more grave and he said you were nigh to london three days ago nigh to london three days ago paul laughed then nodded across at a burly dalesman standing near and said geordie just pinch the old man and see if he's dreaming there was a general titter followed by glances of amused inquiry the peddler took off his hat held his head aside scratched it leisurely glanced up again at the face of young ritson as if to satisfy himself finally as to his identity and eventually muttered half aloud well i'm fair maizelt that's what i am maizelt why i could ha' sworn i saw you at a spot near london three days ago not been there these three years said paul didn't you wave your hand to me as we went by me and bessy did i where why at the hawk and heron in hendon never saw the place in my life sure of that sure the grave old head dropped once more and the pony's head was held down to the withered hand that scratched and caressed it then the first idea of a possible reason on paul's part for keeping his movements secret suggested itself afresh to gubblum he glanced soberly around caught the eye of the young dalesman furtively and winked again paul laughed outright nodded his head good humoredly and rather ostentatiously winked in response the company that had gathered about them caught the humor of the situation and tittered audibly enough to provoke the peddler's wrath but i say you have seen it shouted gubblum in emphatic tones at that moment a slim young man walked slowly past the group he was well dressed and carried himself with ease and some dignity albeit with an air of listlessness a weary and dragging gait due in part to a slight infirmity of one foot when some of the dalesmen bowed to him his smile lacked warmth he was hugh ritson the younger brother of paul gubblum's manner gathered emphasis you were standing on the step of the hawk and heron said he and i waved my hand and shouted 'a canny morning to you master paul' ey that i did you don't say so said paul with mock solemnity his brother had caught the peddler's words and stopped but i do say so said gubblum with many shakes of his big head let any facetious young gentleman who supposed that it was possible to make sport of him understand once for all that it might be as well to throw a stone into his own garden why gubblum said paul smothering a laugh what was i doing at hendon doing well a chap 'at was on the road along of me said that master paul had started innkeeper innkeeper there was a prolonged burst of laughter amid which one amused patriarch on a stick shouted feel if tha's abed gubblum ma man and if i is abed it's better nor being in bed lam isn't it shouted the peddler then gubblum scratched his head again and said more quietly it caps all if it wasn't you it must ha' been the old gentleman hissel' are we so much alike come let's see your pack his name was paul anyways hugh ritson had elbowed his way through the group and was now at gubblum's elbow listening intently when the others had laughed he alone preserved an equal countenance paul what he asked nay don't ax me i know nowt no mair i must be an auld maizelin i must for sure hugh ritson turned on his heel and walked off chapter ii the vale of newlands runs north and south on its east banks rise the cat bell fells and the eel crags on the west rise hindscarth and robinson backed by whiteless pike and grasmoor a river flows down the bed of the valley springing in the south among the heights of dale head and emptying into bassenthwaite on the north a village known as little town stands about midway in the vale and a road runs along each bank the tents were pitched for the sports near the bed of the valley on the east side of the newlands beck on the west side above the road there was a thick copse of hazel oak and birch from a clearing in this wood a thin column of pale blue smoke was rising through the still air a hut in the shape of a cone stood a few yards from the road it was thatched from the ground upward with heather and bracken leaving only a low aperture as door near the hut a small fire of hazel sticks crackled under the pot that swung from a forked triangle of oak limbs fagots were stacked at one end of the clearing a pile of loose bark lay near it was a charcoal pit and behind a line of hurdles that were propped with poles and intertwined with dead grass and gorse an old man was building a charcoal fire he was tall and slight and he stooped his eyes were large and heavy his long beard was whitening he wore a low crowned hat with broad brim and a loose flannel jacket without a waistcoat most of us convey the idea that to our own view we are centers of our circles and that the universe revolves about us this old man suggested a different feeling to himself he might have been a thing gone somehow out of its orbit there was a listless melancholy a lonely weariness in his look and movements an old misery seemed to sit on him his name was matthew fisher but the folk of the country side called him laird fisher the dubious dignity came of the circumstance that he was the holder of an absolute royalty on a few acres of land under hindscarth the royalty had been many generations in his family his grandfather had set store by it when the lord of the manor had worked the copper pits at the foot of the eel crags he had tried to possess himself of the royalties of the fishers but the peasant family resisted the aristocrat luke fisher believed there was a fortune under his feet and he meant to try his own luck on his holding some day that day never came his son mark fisher carried on the tradition but made no effort to unearth the fortune they were a cool silent slow and stubborn race matthew fisher followed his father and his grandfather and inherited the family faith all these years the tenders of the lord of the manor were ignored and the fishers enjoyed their title of courtesy or badinage when matthew was a boy there was a rhyme current in the vale which ran there's t' auld laird and t' young laird and t' laird among t' barns if iver there comes another laird we'll hang him up by t' arms there is a tough bit of toryism in the grain of these northern dalesfolk their threat was idle no other laird ever came matthew married and had one daughter only he farmed his few acres with poor results the ground was good enough but matthew was living under the shadow of the family tradition one day it was sunday morning and the sun shone brightly he was rambling by the po beck that rose on hindscarth and passed through his land when his eye glanced over a glittering stone that lay among the pebbles at the bottom of the stream it was ore good full ore and on the very surface then the laird fisher sunk a shaft and all his earnings with it in an attempt to procure iron or copper the dalespeople derided him but he held silently on his way how dusta find the cobbles to day any softer they would ask as soft as the hearts of most folk he would answer and then add in a murmur and maybe a vast harder nor their heads the undeceiving came at length and then the laird fisher was old and poor his wife died broken hearted after that the laird never rallied the breezy irony of the dalesfolk did not spare the old man's bent head he's brankan holding up his head like a steg swan they would say as he went past the shaft was left unworked and the holding lay fallow laird fisher took wage from the lord of the manor to burn charcoal in the copse the old man had raised his vertical shaft and was laying the oak limbs against it when a girl of about eighteen came along the road from the south and clambered over the stile that led to the charcoal pit she was followed by a sheep dog small and wiry as a hill fox is that thee mercy said the charcoal burner from the fire without turning the girl was a pretty little thing yet there was something wrong with her prettiness one saw at once that her cheeks should have been pink and white like the daisy and that her hair which was yellow as the primrose should have tumbled in wavelets about them there ought to have been sunshine in the blue eyes and laughter on the red lips and merry lilt in the soft voice but the pink had faded from the girl's cheek the shadow had chased the sunshine from her eyes her lips had taken a downward turn and a note of sadness had stolen the merriment from her voice it's only your tea father she said setting down a basket then taking up a spoon that lay on the ground she stirred the mess that was simmering over the fire the dog lay and blinked in the sun a rabbit rustled through the coppice and a jay screeched in the distant glade but above all came the peals of merry laughter from below the girl's eyes wandered yearningly to the tents over which the flags were flying do you hear the sports father she said ey lass there's gay carryin's on they're chirming and chirping like as many sparrows the old man twisted about i should have thowt as thou'd have been in the thick of the thrang thysel' mercy carryin' on the war i didn't care to go said mercy in an undertone the old man looked at her silently for a moment ways me but thoos not the same heartsome lass he said and went on piling the fagots around the shaft but i count nowt of sec wark he added after a pause little mercy's eyes strayed back from the bubbling pot to the tents below there was a shout of applause that's geordie moore's voice thought mercy she could see a circle with linked hands they're playing the cushion game she said under her breath and then drew a long sigh though she did not care to go to the sports to day she felt oh so sick at heart like a wounded hare that creeps into quiet ambush and lies down on the dry clover to die she had stolen away from all this noisy happiness but her heart's joy was draining away in her wistful eyes there was something almost cruel in this bustling merriment in this flaunting gayety in this sweet summer day itself the old charcoal burner had stepped up to where the girl knelt with far away eyes mercy he said i've wanted a word with you this many a day with me father the girl rose to her feet there was a look of uneasiness in her face you've lost your spirits what's come of them me father the assumed surprise was in danger of breaking down not well mercy is that it he took her head between his hard old hands and stroked her hair as tenderly as a mother might have done oh yes father quite well quite then there was a little forced laugh the lucent eyes were full of a dewy wistfulness any trouble mercy what trouble father nay any trouble trouble's common isn't it the old man's voice shook slightly and his hand trembled on the girl's head what have i to trouble me said mercy in a low voice nigh to breaking well you know best said the charcoal burner then he put his hand under the girl's chin and lifted her face until her unwilling eyes looked into his the scrutiny appeared to console him and a smile played over his battered features maybe i was wrong he thought folk are allus clattering mercy made another forced little laugh and instantly the laird fisher's face saddened they do say 'at you're not the same heartsome little lass he said do they oh but i am quite happy you always say people are busybodies don't you father the break down was imminent why mercy you're crying me crying the girl tossed her head with a pathetic gesture of gay protestation oh no i was laughing that was it there are tears in your eyes anyways tears nonsense father tears didn't i tell you that your sight was failing you ey didn't i now it was of no use to struggle longer the fair head fell on the heaving breast and mercy sobbed the old man looked at her through a blinding mist in his hazy eyes tell me my little lassie tell me he said oh it's nothing said mercy she had brushed away the tears and was smiling the laird fisher shook his head it's nothing father only only what only oh it's nothing mercy my lass said the laird fisher and the tears stood now in his own dim eyes mercy remember if owt goes wrong with a girl and her mother is under the grass her father is the first she should come to and tell all the old man had seated himself on a stout block cut from a trunk and was opening the basket when there was a light springy step on the road so you fire to night matthew an elderly man leaned over the stile and smiled nay mr bonnithorne there's ower much nastment in the weather yet the gentleman took off his silk hat and mopped his forehead his hair was thin and of a pale yellow and was smoothed flat on his brow you surprise me i thought the weather perfect see how blue the sky is that doesn't argy it might be better with never a blenk of blue it was rayder airy yesterday and last night the moon got up as blake and yellow as may butter the smile was perpetual on the gentleman's face it showed his teeth constantly you dalesmen are so weather wise the voice was soft and womanish there was a little laugh at the end of each remark we go by the moon in firing sir the charcoal burner answered last night it rose sou' west and that doesn't mean betterment though it's quiet enough now there'll be clashy weather before nightfall the girl strayed away into the thicket and startled a woodcock out of a heap of dead oak leaves the gentleman followed her with his eyes they were very small and piercing eyes and they blinked frequently your daughter does not look very well matthew she's gayly sir she's gayly said the charcoal burner shortly his mouth in his can of tea the gentleman smiled from the teeth out after a pause he said i suppose it isn't pleasant when one of your hurdles is blown down and the charcoal burning indicating the wooden hurdles which had been propped about the half built charcoal stack ey it's gay bad wark to be sure being dragged into the fire the dog had risen with a startled movement following the upward direction of the animal's nose the gentleman said whose sheep are those on the ghyll yonder auld mr ritson's them herdwicks the sheep were on a ridge of shelving rock dangerous spot eh ey it's a bent place they're verra clammersome the black faced sorts i'll bid you good day matthew the yellow haired elderly gentleman was moving off he walked with a jerk and a spring on his toes and mind you take your daughter to the new doctor at keswick he said at parting it's not doctoring that'll mend mercy the charcoal burner muttered when the other had gone chapter iii josiah bonnithorne was quite without kinspeople or connections his mother had been one of two sisters who lived by keeping a small confectioner's shop in whitehaven and were devoted methodists the sisters had formed views as to matrimony and they enjoyed a curious similarity of choice they were to be the wives of preachers but the opportunity was long in coming and they grew elderly at length the younger sister died and so solved the problem of her future the elder sister was left for two years more alone with her confectionery then she married a stranger who had come to one of the pits as gangsman it was a sad falling off but at all events the gangsman was a local preacher and so the poor soul who took him for husband had effected a compromise with her cherished ideal it turned put that he was a scoundrel as well and had a wife living elsewhere this disclosure abridged his usefulness among the brethren and he fled naturally he left his second wife behind having previously secured a bill of sale on her household effects a few months elapsed the woman was turned adrift by her husband's creditors and then a child was born it was a poor little thing a boy the good souls of the connection provided for it until it was two years old and afterward placed it in a charity school while the little fellow was there his mother was struck down by a mortal complaint then for the first time the poor ruined woman asked to see her child they brought the little one to her bedside and it smiled down into her dying face oh that it may please the lord to make him a preacher she said with a great effort at a sign from the doctor the child was taken away the face pinched by cruel suffering quivered slightly the timid eyes worn by wasted hope softened and closed and the mother bid farewell to everything the boy lived they christened him josiah and he took for surname the maiden name of his mother bonnithorne he was a weakling and had no love of boyish sports but he excelled in scholarship in spite of these tendencies he was apprenticed to a butcher when the time came to remove him from school an accident transferred him to the office of a solicitor and he was articled ten years later he succeeded to his master's practice and then he sailed with all sail set he disappointed the connection by developing into a churchman but otherwise aroused no hostile feeling it was obviously his cue to conciliate everybody he was liked without being popular trusted without being a favorite churchwarden trustee for public funds executor for private friends he had a reputation for disinterested industry and people said how well it was that one so unselfish as josiah bonnithorne should nevertheless prosper even as this world goes but there was a man in cumberland who knew mr bonnithorne from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot that man was mr hugh ritson never for an instant did either of these palter with the other when mr bonnithorne left the charcoal pit he followed the road that crossed the newlands beck and returned on the breast of the eel crags this led him close to the booth where the sports were proceeding he heard as he passed the gurgling laugh with which the dalesfolk received the peddler's story of how he saw paul ritson at hendon a minute afterward he encountered hugh ritson on the road there was only the most meagre pretense at greeting when these men came face to face your father sent for me said mr bonnithorne on what business hugh ritson asked i have yet to learn they walked some steps without speaking then the lawyer turned with his constant smile and said in his soft voice i have just seen your little friend she looks pale poor thing something must be done and shortly hugh ritson's face flushed perceptibly his eyes were on the ground let us go no further in this matter he said in a low tone i saw her yesterday then there is her father poor broken creature let it drop i did not believe it of you mr bonnithorne spoke calmly and went on smiling besides i am ashamed the thing is too mean said hugh ritson in what turgid melodrama does not just such an episode occur so so or is it the story of the cat in the adage you would and you wouldn't my blood is not thick enough i can't do it then why did you propose it was it your suggestion or mine i thought to spare the girl her shame here her trouble must fall on her in battalions poor little being send her away and you decimate them it is unnecessary you know i am superior to prejudice hugh ritson dropped his voice and said as if speaking into his breast if the worst comes to the worst i can marry her mr bonnithorne laughed lightly ho ho and in what turgid melodrama does not just such an episode occur hugh ritson drew up sharply why not is she poor then what am i uneducated what is education likely to do for me a simple creature all heart and no head god be praised for that at this moment a girl's laugh came rippling through the air it was one of those joyous peals that make the heart's own music hugh ritson's pale face flushed a little and he drew his breath hard mr bonnithorne nodded his head in the direction of the voice and said softly so our friend greta is here to day yes said hugh ritson very quietly then the friends walked some distance in silence it is scarcely worthy of you to talk in this brain sick fashion said mr bonnithorne there was a dull irritation in the tone you place yourself in the wrong point of view you do not love the little being hugh ritson's forehead contracted and he said if i have wrecked my life by one folly one act of astounding unwisdom what matter there was but little to wreck i am a disappointed man pardon me you are a very young one said mr bonnithorne what am i in my father's house he gives no hint of helping me to an independence in life there are the lands your father must be a rich man and i am a second son indeed hugh ritson glanced up quickly what do you mean you say you are a second son and what then would it be so fearful a thing if you were not a second son in the name of truth be plain my brother paul is living mr bonnithorne nodded his head twice or thrice and said calmly you know that your brother hopes to marry greta i have heard it again the flush came to hugh ritson's cheeks his low voice had a tremor did i ever tell you of her father's strange legacy never my poor friend robert lowther left a legacy to a son of his own who was greta's half brother an illegitimate son not strictly lowther married the son's mother said mr bonnithorne married her then his son was his heir no hugh ritson looked perplexed the girl was a catholic lowther a protestant a catholic priest married them in ireland that was not a valid marriage by english law hugh smiled grimly and lowther had the marriage annulled he had fallen in love began mr bonnithorne this time with an heiress there was a caustic laugh mr bonnithorne nodded greta's mother so he abandoned the first wife hugh ritson interrupted again mr bonnithorne shook his head with an innocent expression wife well he left her you talk of a son had they one they had said mr bonnithorne and when the woman and child disappeared exactly said hugh ritson and he smiled what did lowther then married again and had a daughter greta then why the legacy conscience money said mr bonnithorne pursing up his mouth hugh ritson laughed slightly the sort of fools' pence the chancellor of the exchequer receives labeled 'income tax' precisely only lowther had no address to send it to he had behaved like a scoundrel said hugh ritson true and he felt remorse after the second marriage he set people to find the poor woman and child they were never found his last days were overshadowed by his early fault i believe he died broken hearted in his will i drew it for him he left as i say a sum to be paid to this son of his first wife when found hugh ritson laughed half mockingly i thought he was a fool a scoundrel is generally a fool as well generally i've often observed it said mr bonnithorne what possible interest of anybody's could it be to go hunting for the son of the fool's deserted wife the fool answered mr bonnithorne was shrewd enough to make an interest by ordering that if the son were not found before greta came of age a legacy of double the sum should be paid to an orphanage for boys hugh ritson's respect for the dead man's intelligence experienced a sensible elevation so it is worth a legacy to the family to discover greta's half brother he said summing up the situation in an instant if alive if not then proof that he is dead the two men had walked some distance and reached the turning of a lane which led to a house that could be seen among the trees at the foot of a ghyll the younger man drew up on his infirm foot but i fail to catch the relevance of all this when i mentioned that i was a second son you i have had hardly any data to help me in my search mr bonnithorne continued he was walking on only a medallion portrait of the first wife mr bonnithorne dived into a breast pocket my brother paul is living what possible here it is said mr bonnithorne and he held out a small picture hugh ritson took it with little interest this is the portrait of the nun he said as his eyes first fell on it and recognized the coif and cape a novice that's what she was when lowther met her said mr bonnithorne then hugh ritson stopped he regarded the portrait attentively looked up at the lawyer and back at the medallion for an instant the strong calm which he had hitherto shown seemed to desert him the picture trembled in his hand mr bonnithorne did not appear to see his agitation is it a fancy surely it must be fancy he muttered then he asked aloud what the nun's name had been ormerod there was a start of recovered consciousness ormerod that's strange the exclamation seemed to escape inadvertently why strange hugh ritson did not answer immediately her christian name grace grace ormerod why you must know that grace ormerod happened to be my own mother's maiden name you seem to recognize the portrait hugh ritson had regained his self possession he assumed an air of indifference well yes no of course not no he said emphatically at last in his heart there was another answer he thought for the moment when he set eyes on the picture that it looked like a little like his own mother's face they walked on mr bonnithorne's constant smile parted his lips lifting his voice rather unnecessarily he said by the way another odd coincidence would you like to know the name of grace ormerod's child by robert lowther hugh ritson's heart leaped within him but he preserved an outward show of indifference and drawled well what was it paul the name went through him like an arrow then he said rather languidly so the half brother of greta lowther wherever he is is named paul lowther said mr bonnithorne but he added with a quick glance he may i say he may be passing by another name paul something else for example assuredly certainly yes yes hugh ritson mumbled his all but impenetrable calm was gone they reached the front of the house and stood in a paved court yard it was the home of the ritsons known as the ghyll a long cumbrian homestead of gray stone and green slate a lazy curl of smoke was winding up from one chimney through the clear air a gossamer net of the tangled boughs of a slim brier rose hung over the face of a broad porch and at that moment a butterfly flitted through it the chattering of geese came from behind robert lowther was the father of grace ormerod's child said hugh ritson vacantly the father of her son paul and greta is his daughter is that how it goes that is so and half sister to paul hugh ritson raised his eyes to mr bonnithorne's face and of what age would paul lowther be now well older than you certainly perhaps as old as yes perhaps as old fully as old as your brother hugh ritson's infirm foot trailed heavily on the stones his lips quivered for a moment he seemed to be rapt then he swung about and muttered tut it isn't within belief thrusted home it might betray a man heaven only knows how deeply mr bonnithorne looked up inquiringly pardon me i fail as you say to catch the relevance mr bonnithorne said hugh ritson holding out his hand you and i have been good friends have we not oh the best of friends at your leisure when i have had time to think of this let us discuss it further mr bonnithorne smiled assent and meantime he said softly let the unhappy little being we spoke of be sent away hugh ritson's eyes fell and his voice deepened poor little soul i'm sorry very as for greta and her lover well mr bonnithorne nodded his head significantly and left his words unfinished my father is crossing the stack yard said hugh ritson you shall see him in good time come this way the shadows were lengthening in the valley a purple belt was stretching across the distant hills and a dark blue tint was nestling under the eaves a solitary crow flew across the sky and cawed out its guttural note its shadow fell as it passed on two elderly people who were coming into the court yard chapter iv it's time for that laal mr bonnithorne to be here said allan ritson why did you send for him asked mrs ritson in the low tone that was natural to her to get that matter about the will off my mind it'll be one thing less to think about and it has boddert me sair and lang allan spoke with the shuffling reserve of a man to whose secret communings a painful idea had been too long familiar in the effort to cast off the unwelcome and secret associate there was a show of emancipation which as an acute observer might see was more assumed than real mrs ritson made no terms with the affectation of indifference her grave face became yet more grave and her soft voice grew softer as she said and if when it is settled and done the cloud would break that has hung over our lives then all would be well but that can never be allan tossed his head aside and made pretense to smile but no gleam of sunshine on his cornfields was ever chased so closely by the line of dark shadow as his smile by the frown that followed come worrit thysel' na' mair about it when i've made my will and put paul on the same footing with t'other lad who knows owt mair nor we choose to tell mrs ritson glanced into his face with a look of sad reproach heaven knows allan she said and the dark cloud still gathers for us there the old man took a step or two on the gravel path and dropped his gray head his voice deepened tha says reet mother he said tha says reet ey it saddens my auld days and thine forby he took a step or two more and added and na lawyer can shak' it off now nay nay never now weel mother our sky has been lang owerkessen but mind ye lifting his face and voice together we've had gude crops if we tholed some thistles yes we've had happy days too said mrs ritson at that moment there came from across the vale the shouts of the merrymakers and the music of a fiddle allan ritson lifted his head nodded it aside jauntily and smiled feebly through the mist that was gathering about his eyes there they are wrestling and jumping i mind me when there was scarce a man in cummerlan' could give me the cross buttock that's many a lang year agone though and now our paul can manish most on 'em that he can the fiddle was playing a country dance the old man listened his face broadened he lifted a leg jauntily and gave a sweep of one arm just then there came through the air a peal of happy laughter it was the same heart's music that hugh ritson and mr bonnithorne had heard in the road allan's face brightened and his voice had only the faintest crack in it as he said that's greta's laugh it is for sure what a heartsome lass yon is i like a heartsome lassie a merrie touch and gone yes said mrs ritson soberly greta is a winsome girl it was hardly spoken when a young girl bounded down upon them almost breathless yet laughing in gusts turning her head over her shoulder and shouting hurrah beaten sir hurrah it was greta lowther twenty years of age with fair hair quick brown eyes a sunny face lighted up with youthful animation a swift smile on her parted lips an english wild white rose i've beaten him she said he challenged me to cross windybrowe while he ran round the bowder stone but i got to the lonnin before he had crossed the bridge then running to the corner of the lane she plucked off her straw hat waved it about her head and shouted again in an accent of triumph hurrah hurrah beaten sir beaten paul ritson came running down the fell in strides of two yards apiece oh you young rogue you cheated he cried coming to a stand and catching his breath cheated said greta in a tone of dire amazement you bargained to touch the beacon on the top of windybrowe and you didn't go within a hundred yards of it the beacon on windybrowe said the girl and wondrous perplexity shone in her lovely eyes paul wiped his brow and shook his head and his finger with mock gravity at the beautiful cheat now greta now now gently greta looked around with the bewildered gaze of a lost lambkin mother said paul she stole a march on me he was the thief mrs ritson you believe me don't you me why i never stole anything in my life save one thing and what was that pray said greta with another mighty innocent look paul crept up to her side and whispered something over her shoulder whereupon she eyed him largely and said with a quick smile you don't say so but please don't be too certain of it i'm sure i never heard of that theft then here's a theft you shall hear of said paul throwing one arm about her neck and tipping up her chin there was a sudden gleam of rosy roguish lips old allan with mischief dancing in his eyes pretended to recover them from a more distant sight er why what's that he said the sneck of a gate eh greta drew herself up how can you and all the people looking they might really think that we were we were paul came behind put his head over one shoulder and said and we're not are we they're weel matched mother eh said allan turning to his wife they're marra to bran as folks say greta he's a girt booby isn't he greta stepped up to the old man and with a familiar gesture laid a hand on his arm at the same moment paul came to his side allan tapped his son on the back thou girt lang booby he said and laughed heartily all the shadows that had hung over him were gone and how's parson christian he asked in another tone well quite well and as dear an old soul as ever said greta he's father and mother to thee baith my lass i never knew thy awn father he was dead and gone before we coom't to these parts and thy mother too god bless her she's dead and gone now but if this lad of mine this paul this girt lang ah and here's mr bonnithorne and hughie too the return of the lawyer and hugh ritson abridged the threat of punishment that seemed to hang on the old man's lips hugh ritson's lifted eyes had comprehended everything the girl leaning over his father's arm the pure smooth cheeks close to the swarthy weather beaten comfortable old face the soft gaze upward full of feeling the half open lips and the teeth like pearls then the glance round half of mockery half of protest altogether of unconquerable love to where paul ritson stood his eyes just breaking into a smile the head the neck the arms the bosom still heaving gently after the race the light loose costume hugh ritson saw it all and his heart beat fast his pale face whitened at that moment and his infirm foot trailed heavily on the gravel allan shook hands with mr bonnithorne and then turned to his sons come you two lads have not been gude friends latterly and that's a sair grief baith to your mother and me you're not made in the same mold seemingly but you must mak' up your fratch my lads for your auld folks' sake if nowt else at this he stretched out both arms as if with the intention of joining their hands hugh made a gesture of protestation i have no quarrel to make up he said and turned aside paul held out his hand shake hands hugh he said hugh took the proffered hand with unresponsive coldness paul glanced into his brother's face a moment and said what's the use of breeding malice it's a sort of live stock that's not worth its fodder and it eats up everything there was a scarcely perceptible curl on hugh ritson's lip but he turned silently away with head on his breast he walked toward the porch stop it was old allan's voice the deep tone betrayed the anger that was choking him his face was flushed his eyes were stern his lips trembled come back and shak' hands wi' thy brother reet hugh ritson faced about leaning heavily on his infirm foot why to day more than yesterday or to morrow he said calmly come back i tell thee shouted the old man more hotly hugh maintained his hold of himself and said in a quiet and even voice i am no longer a child then bear thysel' like a man not like a whipped hound the young man shuddered secretly from head to foot his eyes flashed for an instant then recovering his self control he said even a dog would resent such language sir greta had dropped aside from the painful scene and for a moment hugh ritson's eyes followed her i'll have no sec worriment in my house shouted the old man in a broken voice those that live here must live at peace those that want war must go hugh ritson could bear up no longer and what is your house to me sir what has it done for me the world is wide old allan was confounded silent dumb with great staring eyes he looked round into the faces of those about him then in thick choking tones he shouted shak' thy brother's hand or thou'rt no brother of his perhaps not said hugh very quietly shak' hands i tell thee the old man's fists were clinched his body quivered in every limb his son's lips were firmly set he made no answer the old man snatched from mr bonnithorne the stick he carried at this hugh lifted his eyes sharply until they met the eyes of his father allan was transfixed the stick fell from his hand then hugh ritson halted into the house come back come back my boy hughie come back the old man sobbed out but there was no reply allan be patient forgive him he will ask your pardon said mrs ritson paul and greta had stolen away the old man was now speechless and his eyes bent on the ground swam with tears all will be well please god said mrs ritson remember he is sorely tried poor boy he expected you to do something for him' and i meant to i meant to that i did the father answered in a broken cry but you've put it off and off allan like everything else allan lifted his hazy eyes from the ground and looked into his wife's face if it had been t'other lad i could have borne it maybe he said feelingly mr bonnithorne standing aside had been plowing the gravel with one foot he now raised his eyes and said and yet mr ritson folk say that you have always shown most favor to your eldest son the old man's gaze rested on the lawyer for a moment but he did not speak at once and there was an awkward silence i've summat to say to mr bonnithorne mother said the statesman he was quieter now mrs ritson stepped into the house allan ritson and the lawyer followed her going into a little parlor to the right of the porch it was a quaint room full of the odor of a by gone time the floor was of polished black oak covered with skins the ceiling was paneled oak and had a paneled beam bright oak cupboards their fronts carved with rude figures were set into the walls which were whitened and bore one illuminated text and three prints in black and white the furniture was heavy and old there was a spinning wheel under the wide window board a bluebottle buzzed about the ceiling a slant of sunlight crossed the floor the men sat down i sent for thee to mak' my will mr bonnithorne said the old man the lawyer smiled it is an old maxim that delay in affairs of law is a candle that burns in the daytime when the night comes it is burned to the socket old allan took little heed of the sentiment ey he said but there's mair nor common 'casion for it in my case mr bonnithorne was instantly on the alert and what is your especial reason he asked allan's mind seemed to wander he stood silent for a moment and then said slowly as if laboring with thought and phrase weel tha must know i scarce know how to tell thee weel my eldest son paul as they call him the old man stopped and his manner grew sullen mr bonnithorne came to his help yes i am all attention your eldest son he is he is the door opened and mrs ritson entered the room followed close by the laird fisher mr ritson your sheep them black faced herdwicks on hindscarth have broke the fences and the red drift of 'em is down in the barrowmouth of the pass said the charcoal burner the statesman got on his feet i must gang away at once he said mr bonnithorne i must put thee off or maybe i'll lose fifty head of sheep down in the ghyll i made so bold as to tell ye for i reckon we'll have all maks of weather yet that's reet mattha and reet neighborly forby i'll slip away after thee in a thumb's snitting the laird fisher went out can ye bide here for me until eight o'clock to neet mr bonnithorne there was some vexation written on the lawyer's face but he answered with meekness i am always at your service mr ritson i can return at eight verra good then turning to mrs ritson give friend bonnithorne a bite o' summat said allan and he followed the charcoal burner out in the court yard he called the dogs hey howe hey howe bright laddie come boys come boys te lick te smack he put his head in at the door of an out house and shouted reuben wheriver ista come thy ways quick and bring the lad in another moment a young shepherd and a cowherd surrounded by three or four sheep dogs joined allan ritson in the court yard dusta gang back to the fell mattha said the statesman nay i's done for the day i'm away home good neet and thank then the troop disappeared down the lonnin the men calling the dogs barking in walking through the hall mr bonnithorne encountered hugh ritson who was passing out of the house his face very hard his head much bent would you said the lawyer like to know the business on which i have been called here hugh ritson did not immediately raise his eyes to make his will added mr bonnithorne not waiting for an answer then hugh ritson's eyes were lifted there was one flash of intelligence after that the young man went out without a word chapter v hugh ritson was seven and twenty his clean shaven face was long pale and intellectual his nose was wide at the bridge and full at the nostrils he had firm set lips large vehement eyes and a broad forehead with hair of dark auburn parted down the middle and falling in thin waves on the temples the expression of the physiognomy in repose was one of pain and in action of power the effect of the whole was not unlike that which is produced by the face of a high bred horse with its deep eyes and dilated nostrils he was barely above medium height and his figure was almost delicate when he spoke his voice startled you it was so low and deep to come from that slight frame his lameness which was slight was due to a long standing infirmity of the hip as second son of a cumbrian statesman whose estate consisted chiefly of land he expected but little from his father and had been trained in the profession of a mining engineer after spending a few months at the iron mines of cleator he had removed to london at twenty two and enrolled himself as a student of the mining college in jermyn street there he had spent four years sharing the chambers of a young barrister in the temple gardens his london career was uneventful taciturn in manner he made few friends his mind had a tendency toward contemplative inactivity of physical energy he had very little and this may have been partly due to his infirmity late at night he would walk alone in the strand the teeming life of the city and the mystery of its silence after midnight had a strong fascination for him in these rambles he came to know some of the strangest and oddest of the rags and rinsings of humanity among them a persian nobleman of the late shah's household who kept a small tobacco shop at the corner of a by street and an old french exile once of the court of louis phillippe who sold the halfpenny papers at other times he went out hardly at all and was rarely invited only the housemate who saw him at all times and in many moods seemed to suspect that beneath that cold exterior there lay an ardent nature but he himself knew how strong was the tide of his passion he could never look a beautiful woman in the face but his pulse beat high and he felt almost faint yet strong as his passion was his will was no less strong he put a check on himself and during his four years in london contrived successfully to dam up the flood that was secretly threatening him at six and twenty he returned to cumberland having some grounds for believing that his father intended to find him the means of mining for himself a year had now passed and nothing had been done he was growing sick with hope deferred his elder brother paul had spent his life on the land and it was always understood that in due course he would inherit it that at least was the prospect which hugh ritson had in view though no prospective arrangement had been made week followed week and month followed month and his heart grew bitter he had almost decided to end this waiting the day would come when he could bear it not longer and then he would cut adrift an accidental circumstance was the cause of his irresolution he used to walk frequently on the moss where the laird fisher sunk his shaft in the beck that ran close to the disused headgear he would wade for an hour early in the summer morning one day he saw the old laird's daughter washing linen at the beck side he remembered her as a pretty prattling thing of ten or eleven she was now a girl of eighteen with a pure face a timid manner and an air that was neither that of a woman nor of a child her mother was lately dead her father spent most of his days on the fell some of his nights also when the charcoal was burning and she was much alone hugh ritson liked her gentle replies and her few simple questions so it came about that he would look for her in the mornings and be disappointed if he did not catch sight of her good young face himself a silent man he liked to listen to the girl's modest unconnected talk his stern eyes would soften at such times to a sort of caressing expression this went on for months and in that solitude no idle tongue was set to wag at length hugh ritson perceived that the girl's heart was touched if he came late he found her leaning over the gate her eyes bent down among the mountain grasses at her feet and her cheeks colored by a red glow it is unnecessary to go further the girl gave herself up to him with her whole heart and soul and he well he found the bulwarks with which he had surrounded himself were ruined and down then the awakening came and hugh learned too late that he had not loved the simple child by realizing that with all the ardor of his restrained but passionate nature he loved another woman so much for the first complication in the tragedy of this man's life the second complication was new to his consciousness and it was at this moment conspiring with the first to lure him to consequences that are now to be related the story which mr bonnithorne had told of the legacy left by greta's father to a son by one grace ormerod had come to him at a time when owing to disappointment and chagrin he was peculiarly liable to the temptation of any honest trifle that pointed the way he wished to go if the grace ormerod who married lowther had indeed been his own mother then a thousand to one paul was lowther's son if paul was lowther's son he was also half brother of greta if paul was not the son of allan ritson then he himself hugh ritson was his father's heir in the present whirlwind of feeling he did not inquire too closely into the pros and cons of probability enough that evidence seemed to be with him and that it transformed the world in his view perhaps the first result of this transformation was that he unconsciously assumed a different attitude toward the unhappy passage in his life wherein mercy fisher was chiefly concerned what his feeling was before mr bonnithorne's revelation we have already seen now the sentiment that made much of such an accident was fit only for a turgid melodrama and the idea of atonement by marriage was the mock heroic of those great lovers of noble histories the spectators who applaud it from the pit when he passed mr bonnithorne in the hall at the ghyll he was on his way to the cottage of the laird fisher he saw in the road ahead of him the group which included his father and the charcoal burner and to avoid them he cut across the breast of the eel crags after a sharp walk of a mile he came to a little white washed house that stood near the head of newlands almost under the bridge that crosses the fall it was a sweet place in a great solitude where the silence was broken only by the tumbling waters the cooing of pigeons on the roof and the twittering of ringouzels by the side of the torrent the air was fresh with the smell of new peat there was a wedge shaped garden in front and it was encompassed by chestnut trees as hugh ritson drew near he noticed that a squirrel crept from the fork of one of these trees the little creature rocked itself on the thin end of a swaying branch plucking sometimes at the drooping fan of the chestnut and sometimes at the prickly shell of its pendulous nut when he opened the little gate hugh ritson observed that a cat sat sedately behind the trunk of that tree glancing up at intervals at the sporting squirrel in her moving seat as he entered the garden mercy was crossing it with a pail of water just raised from the well she had seen him and now tried to pass into the house he stepped before her and she set down the pail her head was held very low and her cheeks were deeply flushed mercy he said it is all arranged mr bonnithorne will see you into the train this evening and when you get to your journey's end the person i spoke of will meet you the girl lifted her eyes beseechingly to his face not to day hugh she said in a broken whisper let me stay until to morrow he regarded her for a moment with a steadfast look and when he spoke again his voice fell on her ear like the clank of a chain the journey has to be made every week's delay increases the danger the girl's eyes fell again and the tears began to drop from them on to the brown arms that she had clasped in front come he said in a softer tone the train starts in an hour your father is not yet home from the pit and most of the dalespeople are at the sports so much the better put on your cloak and hat and take the fell path to the coledaie road ends there mr bonnithorne will meet you the girl's tears were flowing fast though she bit her lip and struggled to check them come now come you know this was of your own choice there was a pause i never thought it would be so hard to go she said at length he smiled feebly and tried a more rallying tone you are not going for life you will come back safe and happy the words thrilled her through and through her clasped hands trembled visibly and her fingers clutched them with a convulsive movement after awhile she was calmer and said quietly no i'll never come back i know that quite well and her head dropped on her breast and she felt sick at heart i'll have to say good bye to everything there were betsy jackson's children i kissed them all this morning and never said why little willy he seemed to know dear little fellow and cried so bitterly the memories of these incidents touched to overflowing the springs of love in the girl's simple soul and the bubbling child voice was drowned in sobs the man stood with a smile of pain on his face he came close and brushed away her tears and touched her drooping head with a gesture of protestation mercy regained her voice and then there's your mother she said and i can't say good bye to her and my poor father and i daren't tell him hugh stamped on the path impatiently come come mercy don't be foolish the girl lifted to his the good young face that had once been bonny as the day and was now pale with weeping and drawn down with grief she took him by the coat and then by an impulse which she seemed unable to resist threw one arm about his neck and raised her face to his until their lips all but touched and their eyes met in a steadfast gaze hugh she said passionately are you sure that you love me well enough to think of me when i am gone are you quite quite sure yes yes be sure of that he said gently he disengaged her arm and will you come and fetch me after after she could not say the word he smiled and answered why yes yes her fingers trembled and clung together her head fell her cheeks were aglow why of course he smiled again as if in deprecation of so much child like earnestness then put his arm about the girl's shoulder dropped his voice to a tone of mingled compassion and affection and said as he lifted the brightening face to his there there now go off and make ready the girl brushed her tears away vigorously and looked half ashamed and half enchanted i'm going that's a good little girl how the sunshine came back at the sound of his words good bye for the present mercy only for the present you know but how the shadow pursued the sunshine after all hugh saw the tears gathering again in the lucent eyes and came back a step there a smile just one little smile she smiled through her tears there there that's a dear little mercy good day good bye hugh turned on his heel and walked sharply away as he passed out through the gate he could not help observing that the cat from the foot of the chestnut tree was walking stealthily off with something like a dawning smile on its whiskered face and the brush of the squirrel between its teeth hugh ritson had gained his end and yet he felt more crushed than at the darkest moment of defeat he had conquered his own manhood and now he crept away from the scene of his triumph with a sense of utter abasement when he had talked with mr bonnithorne it was with a feeling of the meanness of the folly in which he was involved and if any sentiment touching the girl's situation was strong upon him it was closely bound up with a personal view of the degradation that might come of a man's humiliating unwisdom the very conventionality of his folly had irked him but its cowardice was now uppermost that a man should enter into warfare with a woman on unequal terms and win by cajolery and deceit was more than cruel it was brutal he could have borne even this hard saying so far as it concerned the woman's suffering but for the reflection that it made the man something worse than a coxcomb in his own eyes the day was now far spent the brilliant sun had dipped behind grisedale and left a ridge of dark fells in the west on the east the green sides of cat bells and the eel crags were yellow at the summit where the hills held their last commerce with the hidden sun not a breath of wind not the rustle of a leaf the valley lay still save for the echoing voices of the merrymakers in the booth below the sky overhead was blue but a dark cloud like the hulk of a ship had anchored lately to the north hugh ritson took the valley road back to ghyll he was visibly perturbed he walked with head much bent stopped suddenly at times then snatched impetuously at the trailing bushes and passed on when he was under hindscarth the sharp yap of dogs followed by the bleat of unseen sheep caused him to look up and he saw a group of men like emmets creeping on a dark bowlder moving over a ridge of shelving rock there was a slight spasm of his features at that moment and his foot trailed more heavily as he went on at a twist of the road he passed the laird fisher the old man looked less melancholy than usual it was as if the familiar sorrow sat a little more lightly to night on the half ruined creature good neet to you sir and how fend ye he said almost cheerily hugh ritson responded briefly so you're not sleeping on the fell to night matthew and as he spoke his eyes wandered toward the fell road nay i's not firing to neet for sure my daughter is expecting me hugh's eyes were now fixed intently on the road that crossed the foot of the fell to the west the charcoal burner was moving off and following at the same moment the upward direction of hugh ritson's gaze he said it's a baddish place yon where your father is with reuben and the lad and it's baddish weather that is coming too look at yon black cloud over walna scar then for an instant there was embarrassment in hugh ritson's eyes and he answered in a faltering commonplace ways me but i must slip away home sir my laal lass will be weary waiting good neet to you sir good neet good night matthew and god help you said hugh in a tone of startling earnestness his eyes turned away he had walked half a mile further and reached the lonnin that led to the ghyll when he was almost overrun by greta lowther who came tripping out of the gate of a meadow her bonnet swinging over her arm her soft wavy hair floating over her white forehead her cheeks colored with a warm glow a roguish light in her eyes and laughter on the point of bubbling out of her lips greta had just given paul ritson the slip there was a thicket in the field she had crossed and it was covered with wild roses white and red through the heart of it there rippled a tiny streak of water that was amber tinted from the round shingle in its bed the trunk of an old beech lay across it for ford or bridge underfoot were the sedge and moss overhead the thick boughs and the roses in the air the odor of hay and the songs of birds and paul the cunning rascal would have tempted greta into this solitude but she was too shrewd the wise little woman to be so easily trapped pretending to follow him in ignorance of his manifest design she tripped back on tiptoe and fled away like a lapwing over the noiseless grass when greta met hugh ritson she was saying to herself of paul in particular and of his sex in general what dear simple unsuspecting trustful creatures they are then she drew up sharply ah hugh how happy you look greta he said fixing his eyes upon her a new light brightened her sunny face not happier than i feel she answered she swung the arm over which the bonnet hung the heaving of her breast showed the mold of her early womanhood hugh ritson's mind had for the last half hour brooded over many a good purpose but not one of them was now left you witnessed a painful scene to day he said with some hesitation be sure it was no less painful to me because you were there to see it oh i was so sorry said greta impetuously you mean with your father hugh bent his head slightly it was inevitable i know that full well but for my share in it i ask your pardon that is nothing she said but you took your father too seriously i took him at his word that was all but the dear old man meant nothing and you meant very much he only wanted to abuse you a little and perhaps frighten you and shake his stick at you and then love you all the better for it you may be right greta among the whims of nature there is that of making such human contradictions but as you say i take things seriously everything life itself he paused and there was a slight trembling of the lip besides he went on in another tone it has been always so since our childhood my brother's and mine there has not been much paternal tenderness wasted on me i can hardly expect it now surely that must be a morbid fancy greta said in a distressed tone the light was dying out of her eyes she made one quick glance downward to where hugh ritson's infirm foot trailed on the road and then in an instant of recovered consciousness she glanced up now confused and embarrassed into his face she was too late he had read her thought a faint smile parted her lips and the light of his own eyes was cold no not that he said i ask no pity in that regard and need none nature has given my brother a physique that would shame a greek statue but he and i are quits perhaps more than quits he made a hard smile and she flushed deep with shame of having her thought read i am sorry if i conveyed that she said slowly it must have been quite unwittingly i was thinking of your mother she is so good and tender to everybody why she is the angel of the country side do you know what name they've given her hugh shook his head saint grace parson christian told me it seems it was my own dear mother who christened her nevertheless there has not been much to sweeten my life greta he said his voice arrested her it was charged with unusual feeling she made no answer and they began to walk toward the house after a few steps greta remembered the trick that she had played on paul and craned her beautiful neck to see over the stone cobble hedge into the field where she had left him hugh observed her intently i hear that you have decided is it so greta he said decided what she asked coloring again he also colored slightly and answered with a strained quietness to marry my brother if he wishes it i suppose he does he says so you know hugh looked earnestly into the girl's glowing face and said with deliberation greta perhaps there are reasons why you should not marry paul what reasons he did not reply at once and she repeated her question then he said in a strange tone just and lawful impediments as they say greta's eyes opened wide in undisguised amazement impossible you cannot mean it she said with her customary impetuosity she glanced into hugh's face and misread what she saw there then she began to laugh at first lightly afterward rather boisterously and said with head averted and almost as if talking to herself no no he is nothing to me but the man i love do you then love him greta started do you ask she said the amazement in the wide eyes had deepened to a look of rapture love him she said better than all the world beside the girl was lifted out of herself you are to be my brother hugh and i need not fear to speak so she swung her bonnet on her arm just to preserve composure by some distracting exercise hugh ritson stopped and his face softened it was a perplexing smile that sat on his features while he had talked with greta there had run through his mind as a painful undertone the thought of mercy fisher he had now dismissed the last of his qualms respecting her to be tied down for life to a mindless piece of physical prettiness what man of brains could bear it he had yielded to a natural impulse true that moment of temptation threatened painful consequences still true what then nothing was the dead fruit to hang about his neck forever tut all natural law was against it had he not said that he was above prejudice so was he above the maudlin sentiment of the great lovers of noble histories the sophistry grew apace with greta's beautiful countenance before him catching at her last word he said your brother yes but did you never guess that i could have wished another name the look of amazement returned to her eyes he saw it and went on is it possible that you have not read my secret what secret she said in a half smothered voice greta if your love had been great love you must have read my secret just as i have read yours in a low tone he continued long ago i knew that you loved or thought you loved my brother i saw it before he had seen it before you had realized it the red glow colored her cheeks more deeply than before she had stopped and he was tramping nervously backward and forward greta he said again and he fixed his eyes entreatingly upon her what is the love that scarcely knows itself that is the love with which you love my brother and what is the tame timid passion of a man of no mind that is the love which he offers you what is your love for him or his for you what is it can it be love is not love unless it is the love of true minds that was said long ago greta and how true it is he went on quickly in a tone of dull irritation all other love is no better than lust greta i understand you it is not for a rude man like my brother to do so then in an eager voice he said dearest i bring you a love undreamed of among these country boors country boors she repeated in a half stifled whisper he did not hear her his vehement eyes swam and he was dizzy greta dearest i said there has been little in my life to sweeten it yet i am a man made to love and to be loved my love for you has been mute for months but it can be mute no longer perhaps i have had my own impediment apart from our love for paul but that is all over now his cheeks quivered his lips trembled his voice swelled his nervous fingers were riveted to his palm he approached her and took her hand she seemed to be benumbed by strong feeling she had stood as one transfixed a slow paralysis of surprise laying hold of her faculties but at his touch her senses regained their mastery she flung away his hand her breast heaved in a voice charged with indignation she said so this is what you mean i understand you at last huge ritson fell back a pace greta hear me hear me again but she had found her voice indeed sir you have outraged your brother's heart as surely as if at this moment i had been your brother's wife greta think before you speak think i implore you i have thought i have thought of you as your sister might think and spoken to you as my brother now i know how mean of soul you are hugh broke in passionately for god's sake stop i am an unforgiving man his nostrils quivered every nerve vibrated love you never loved if you knew what the word means you would die of shame where you stand this instant hugh lost all control i bid you beware he said in wrath and dismay and i bid you be silent said greta with an eloquent uplifting of the hand you offer your love to a pledged woman it is only base love that is basely offered it is bad coin sir and goes back dishonored hugh ritson regained some self command the contractions were deep about his forehead but he answered in an imperturbable voice you shall never marry my brother i will god willing then you shall marry him to your lifelong horror and disgrace that shall be as heaven may order a boor a hulking brute a bas enough i would rather marry a plowboy than such a gentleman as you face to face eye to eye with panting breath and scornful looks there they stood for one moment then greta swung about and walked down the lonnin hugh ritson's natural manner returned instantly he looked after her without the change of a feature and then turned quietly into the house chapter vi there was a drowsy calm in the room where mr bonnithorne sat at lunch it was the little oak bound parlor to the right in which he had begun the conversation with old allan ritson that had been interrupted by the announcement of the laird fisher half of the window was thrown up and the landscape framed by the sash lay still as a picture the sun that had passed over grisedale sent a deep glow from behind and the woods beneath took a restful tone only the mountain head was white where it towered into the sky and the silence mrs ritson entered and sat down her manner was meek almost to abjectness she was elderly but her face bore traces of the beauty she had enjoyed in youth the lines had grown deep in it since then and now the sadness of its expression was permanent she wore an old fashioned lavender gown and there was a white silk scarf about her neck her voice was low and tremulous yet eager as if it were always questioning with downcast head and eyes bent on her lap where her fingers twitched nervously as she knitted without cessation she sat silent or put meek questions to her guest mr bonnithorne answered in smiles and speeches of six words apiece between each sparse reply he addressed himself afresh to his lunch with an appetite that was the reverse of sparse all the while a subdued hum of many voices came up from the booth in the fields below at length mrs ritson's anxiety overcame the restraint of her manner mr bonnithorne she said do let the will be made to night urge mr ritson when he returns to admit of no further delay he has many noble qualities but procrastination is his fault it has been ever so mr bonnithorne paused with a glass half raised to his lips and lifted his eyes instead pardon me madame he said with the customary smile which failed to disarm his words this is for certain reasons a subject i can hardly discuss with with with a woman and just then a peacock strutted through the court yard startling the still air with its empty scream mrs ritson colored deeply even modesty like hers had been put to a severe strain but she dropped her eyes again finished a row of stitches rested the steel needle on her lip and answered quietly surely a woman may talk of what concerns her husband and her children the great man had resumed his knife and fork not necessarily he said it is a strange and curious fact that there is one condition in which the law does not recognize the right of a woman to call her son her own during this prolonged speech hugh ritson fresh from his interview with greta lowther entered the room and stretched himself on the couch mrs ritson without shifting the determination of her gaze from the nervous fingers in her lap said what condition mr bonnithorne twisted slightly and glanced significantly at hugh as he answered the condition of illegitimacy something supercilious in the tone jarred on mrs ritson's ear she looked up from her knitting and said what do you mean bonnithorne placed his knife and fork with precision over his empty plate used his napkin with deliberation coughed slightly and said i mean that the law denies the name of son to offspring that has been bastardized mrs ritson's face grew crimson and she rose to her feet if so the law is cruel and wicked she said in a voice more tremulous with emotion mr bonnithorne leaned languidly back in his chair ejected a long hem from his overburdened chest inserted his fingers in the armpits of his waistcoat looked up and said odd isn't it unluckily for the full effect of mr bonnithorne's subtle witticism paul ritson with greta at his side appeared in the door way at the moment of its delivery the manner more than the words had awakened his anger and the significance of both he interpreted by his mother's agitated face in two strides he stepped up to where the great man sat even now all smiles and white teeth and laid a powerful hand on his arm my friend said paul lustily it might not be safe for you to speak to my mother again like that mr bonnithorne rose stiffly and his shifty eyes looked into paul's wrathful face safe he echoed with emphasis paul his lips compressed bent his head and at the same instant brought the other hand down on the table without speaking mr bonnithorne shuffled back into his seat mrs ritson letting fall her knitting into her lap sat and dropped her face into her hands paul took her by the arm raised her up and led her out of the room as he did so he passed the couch on which hugh ritson lay and looked down with mingled anger and contempt into his brother's indifferent eyes when the door closed behind them hugh ritson and mr bonnithorne rose together there was a momentary gleam of mutual consciousness then instantly suddenly by one impulse the two men joined hands across the table chapter vii the cloud that had hung over walna scar broke above the valley and a heavy rain storm with low mutterings of distant thunder drove the pleasure people from the meadow to the booth it was a long canvas tent with a drinking bar at one end and stalls in the corners for the sale of gingerbreads and gimcracks the grass under it was trodden flat and in patches the earth was bare and wet beneath the trapesing feet of the people they were a mixed and curious company in a ring that was cleared by an athletic plowman the fiddler postman of newlands tom o' dint was seated on a tub turned bottom up he was a little man with bowed legs and feet a foot long now lasses step forret dunnot be blate come along with ye any as have springiness in them the rough invitation was accepted without too much timidity by several damsels dressed in gorgeous gowns and bonnets then up and down one two three cut and shuffle cross under and up and down again i'll be mounting my best nag and comin' ower to scara crag and tappin' at your window some neet soon whispered a young fellow to the girl he had just danced with she laughed a little mockingly your best nag willy weel the maister's she laughed again and a sneer curled her lip you colebank chaps are famous sweethearts i hear fare te weel willy and she twisted on her heel he followed her up dunnet gowl aggy mappen i'll be maister man mysel' soon aggy pushed her way through the crowd and disappeared she's packed him off wi' a flea in his ear said an elderly man standing near just like all the lave of them said another snurling up her neb at a man for lack of gear why didna he brag of some rich uncle in austrilly ey and stuff her with all sorts of flaitchment and lies then all the lasses wad be glyming at him the dance spun on why it's a regular upshot as good as carel fair said one of the girls bessie you're reet clipt and heeled for sure responded her companion bessie's eyes sparkled with delight at the lusty compliment paid to her dancing and she opened her cloak to cool herself and also to show the glittering locket that hung about her neck it's famish this fashion muttered the elderly cynic it must tak' a brave canny fortune shaf man the country's puzzen'd round with pride answered his gossip lasses worked in the old days now they never do a hand's turn but washin' and bleachin' and starchin' and curlin' their polls ey ey there's been na luck in the country since the women folk began to think shame of their wark the fiddler made a squeak on two notes that sounded like kiss her and from a corner of the booth there came a clamorous smack of lips i saw you sweetheartin' laal bessie said one of the fellows to another and i saw you last night cutteran sa soft in the meadow nay dunnot look sa strange i never say nowt not i only yon mother of aggy's she's a famous fratcher and dunnot you let her get wind she brays the lasses and mappen she'll bray somebody forby while the dancing proceeded there was a noisy clatter of glasses and a mutter of voices in the neighborhood of the bar the varra crony one's fidgin to see gie us a shak' of thy daddle shouted a fellow with a face like a russet apple come dick let's bottom a quart together deil tak' the expense why man and wherever hasta been since whissen monday weel you see i went to the fair and stood with a straw in my mouth and the wives all came round and one of them said 'what wage do you ask canny lad' 'five pounds ten' i says 'and what can you do' she says 'do' i says 'anything from plowing to threshing and nicking a nag's tail' i says 'come be my man' she says but she was like to clem me so i packed up my bits of duds and got my wage in my reet hand breek pocket and here i am the dancing had finished and a little group was gathered around the fiddler's tub come thy ways here's tom o' dint conjuring and telling folk what they are thinking that's mair nor he could do for the numskulls as never think he bangs all the player folk does tom who's yon tatterdemalion flinging by the newspaper and bawling 'the country's going to the dogs' that's grey graham setting folk by the lug with his blusteration mess lads but he'd be a reet good parli'ment man to threep about the nation weel i's na pollytishun but if it's tearin' and snappin' same as a terrier that mak's a reet good parli'ment man i reckon not all england could bang him and that's not saying nowt sim i've heard grey graham on the ballot till it's wet him through to the waistcoat is that mister paul ritson and mistress lowther just run in for shelter surely and a reet bonny lass she is and he's got larnin' and manners too ey he's of the bettermer sort is paul does she live at the parson's parson christian's why yes man it's only naturable he's her guardian and what a man he is to be sure ey we'll never see his like again when he's gone nay not till the water runs up bank and trees grow down bank and what a scholar and no pride neither and what's mair in a parson no greed why the leal fellow values the world and the world's gear not a flea contentment's a kingdom as folk say and religion is no worse for a bit o' charity there was a momentary pressure of the company toward the mouth of the booth where gubblum oglethorpe reappeared with his pack swung from his neck in front of him the girls gathered eagerly around what have you to day gubblum nay nowt for you my dear you're one of them that allus looks best with nothing on oh gubblum the compliment was certainly a dubious one only your bits of shabby duds that's all that pretty faces like yours wants oh gubblum the peddler was evidently a dear simple soul lord bless you yes what's in here slapping his pack contemptuously it's only for them wizzent old creatures up in london them 'at have faces like the map of england when it shows all the lines of the railways just to make them a bit presentable you know and there is no knowing what some of these things won't do to mak' a body smart what with brooches and handkerchers and collars and i don't know what gubblum's air of indifference had the extraordinary effect of bringing a dozen pairs of gloating eyes on the strapped pack the face of the peddler wore an expression of bland innocence as he continued but bless you i'm such a straightforward chap or i'd make my fortune with the like of what's here open your pack gubblum said one of the fellows geordie moore prompted by sundry prods from the elbow of a little damsel by his side the straightforward chap made a deprecatory gesture and then yielded obligingly while loosening the straps he resumed his discourse on his own general ignorance of business tactics his ruinous honesty and demoralizing sense of honor i'm not cute enough that's my fault i know the way to my mouth with a spoonful of poddish and that's all if i go further in the dark i'm lost gubblum opened his pack and drew forth a red and green shawl of a hideous pattern now just to give you a sample here's a nice neat shawl that i never had no more nor two of well i actually sold the fellow of that shawl for seven and sixpence the look of amazement at his own shortcomings which sat on the child like face of the peddler was answered by the expression of mock surprise in the face of paul ritson who came up at the moment took the shawl from gubblum's outstretched arms and said in a hushed whisper no did you now geordie moore thereupon dived into his pocket and brought out three half crowns here's for you gubblum let's have it 'od bless me cried the elderly cynic but that gubblum will never mak' his plack a bawbee and grey graham having disposed of the affairs of the nation and witnessed geordie snap at the peddler's bait cried out in a bitter laugh 'there's little wit within his powe that lights a candle at the lowe' just then a tumult arose in the vicinity of the bar the two cronies were at open war deuce take it i had fifteen white shillin' in my reet hand breek pocket and where are they now 'od dang thee what should i know about your brass you're kicking up a stour to waken a corp i had fifteen white shillin' in my reet hand breek pocket i tell thee what's that to me thou poor shaffles you're as drunk as muck do you think i've taken your brass you've got a wrong pig by the lug if you reckon to come ower me they were in my reet hand breek pocket i'll swear on it what a fratchin' try your left hand breek pocket the russet faced plowman thrust his hand where directed and instantly a comical smile of mingled joy and shame overspread his countenance there was a gurgling laugh through which the voice of the peddler could be heard saying we'll mak' thee king ower the cockers my canny lad the canny lad was slinking away amid a derisive titter when a great silence fell on the booth those in front fell back and those behind craned their necks to see over the heads of the people before them at the mouth of the booth stood the old laird fisher his face ghastly pale his eyes big and restless the rain dripping from his long hair and beard they've telt me he began in a strange voice they've telt me that my mercy has gone off in the london train i reckon they're mistook as to the lass but i've come to see for mysel' is she here none answered only the heavy rain drops that pattered on the canvas overhead broke the silence paul ritson pushed his way through the crowd mercy london wait matthew i'll see if she's here the laird fisher looked from face to face of the people about him any on you know owt about her he asked in a low voice why don't you speak some on you you shake your heads what does that mean the old man was struggling to control the emotion that was surging in his throat no matthew she's not here said paul ritson then maybe it's true said matthew with a strange quiet there was a pause paul was the first to shake off his surprise she might be at little town in keswick twenty places she might be master paul but she's nowt o' the sort she's on her way to london mercy is it was natt the stableman at the ghyll who spoke at that the old man's trance seemed to break gone mercy gone gone without a word why where she'd her little red bundle aside her and she cried a gay bit to hersel' in the corner i saw her mysel' paul's face became rigid with anger there's villainy in this be sure of that he said hotly the laird rocked his head backward and forward and his eyes swam with tears but he stood in the middle as quiet as a child my laal mercy he said faintly gone from her old father paul stepped to the old man's side and put a great hand on his shoulder as softly as a woman might have soothed her babe then turning about and glancing wrathfully in the faces around them he said some waistrel has been at work here who is he speak out anybody know no one spoke only the laird moaned feebly and reeled like a drunken man then with the first shock over the old man began to laugh what a laugh it was no matter he said no matter now i've nowt left i've nowt to lose there's comfort in that anyways ha ha ha but my heart is like to choke for all you say reet mr ritson there's villainy in it the old man's eyes wandered vacantly her own father he mumbled her lone old father broken hearted him 'at loved her no matter i've nowt left to ha ha ha he tried to walk away jauntily and with a ghastly smile on his battered face but he stumbled and fell insensible into paul's outstretched arms they loosened his neckerchief and bathed his forehead just then hugh ritson strode into the tent stepped up to the group and looked down over the bent heads at the stricken father lying in his brother's arms paul's lips trembled and his powerful frame quivered who knows but the scoundrel is here now he said and his eyes traversed the men about him if he is let him look at his pitiless work and may the sight follow him to his death at that moment hugh ritson's face underwent an awful change then the old man opened his eyes in consciousness and hugh knelt before him and put a glass of water to his lips chapter viii in the homestead of the ritsons the wide old ingle was aglow with a cheerful fire and mrs ritson stood before it baking oaten cake on a griddle the table was laid for supper with beef and beer and milk and barley bread in the seat of a recessed window paul ritson and greta lowther sat together at intervals that grew shorter and with a grave face that became more anxious mrs ritson walked to the door and looked out into the thickening sky the young people had been too much absorbed to notice her increasing perturbation until she opened a clothes chest and took out dry flannels and spread them on the hearth to air don't worrit yourself mother said paul he'll be here soon he had to cross the coledale pass and that's a long stroke of the ground you know it's an hour past supper time said mrs ritson glancing aside at the old clock that ticked audibly from behind the great arm chair the rain is coming again listen there was a light patter of rain drops against the window panes if he's on the fells now he'll be wet to the skin i wish i'd gone in place of him said paul turning to greta a bad wetting troubles him nowadays not same as of old when he'd follow the fells all day long knee deep in water and soaked to the skin with rain or snow the thunder clap shook the house the windows rattled and the lamp that had been newly lighted and put on the table flickered slightly and burned red mercy me what a night was that a flash of lightning said mrs ritson and she walked to the door once more and opened it don't worrit mother repeated paul do come in father will be here soon and if he gets a wetting there's no help for it now paul had turned aside from an animated conversation with greta to interpolate this remonstrance against his mother's anxiety resuming the narrative of his wrestling match he described its incidents as much by gesture as by words john proudfoot took me so and tried to give me the cross buttock but i caught his eye and twisted him on my hip so and down he went in a bash a hurried knock came to the outer door in an instant it was opened and a white face looked in what's now reuben said paul rising to his feet come along with me leave the women folk behind master's down the lightning has struck him i'm afeart he's dead my father said paul and stood for a moment with a bewildered look go on reuben i'll follow paul picked up his hat and was gone in an instant mrs ritson had been stooping over the griddle when reuben entered she heard what he said and rose up with a face of death like pallor but she said nothing and sunk helplessly into a chair then greta stepped up to her and kissed her mother dear mother she said and mrs ritson dropped her head on the girl's breast hugh had been sitting over some papers in his own room off the first landing he overheard the announcement and came into the hall your father has been struck by the lightning said greta they will fetch him home said hugh at the next moment there was the sound from without of burdened footsteps they were bearing the injured man through the back of the house they carried him to his room that is for my sake said mrs ritson raising her tear stained face to listen paul entered his ruddy cheeks had grown ashy white his eyes that had blinked with pleasure a minute ago now stared wide with fear is he alive yes thank god oh thank god forever and ever let me go in to him he is unconscious he breathes but no more mrs ritson with paul and greta went into the room in which they had placed the stricken man he lay across the bed in his clothes just as he had fallen they bathed his forehead and applied leeches to his temples he breathed heavily but gave no sign of consciousness paul sat at his father's side with his face buried in his hands he was recalling his boyish days when his father would lift him in his arms and throw him on the bare back of the pony that he gave him on his thirteenth birthday could it be possible that the end was at hand he got up and led greta out of the room this house of mourning is no place for you he said the storm is over you must leave us natt can put the mare into the trap and drive you home i will not go said greta this shall be my home to night don't send me away from you paul you are in trouble and my place is here you could do no good and might take some harm mrs ritson came out where is mr bonnithorne she asked he was to be here at eight your father might recover consciousness the lawyer could do nothing to help him if he is to leave us may it please god to give him one little hour of consciousness yes knowing us again giving us a farewell word there is another reason a more terrible reason you are thinking of the will let that go by come mother and greta too come let us go back half an hour later the house was as still as the chamber of death with hushed voices and noiseless steps the women servants moved to and from the room where lay the dying man the farming men sat together in an outer kitchen and talked in whispers the storm had passed away the stars struggled one by one through a rack of flying cloud and a silver fringe of moonlight sometimes fretted the black patches of the sky hugh ritson sat alone in the old hall that was now desolate enough his face rested on his hand and his elbow on his knee there was a strange light in his eyes it was not sorrow and it was not pain it was anxiety uncertainty perturbation again and again he started up from a deep reverie and then a half smothered cry escaped him he walked a few paces to and fro and sat down once more a servant crossed the hall on tiptoe hugh raised his head how is your patient now he said quietly just breathing sir still quite unconscious hugh got up uneasily a mirror hung on the wall in front of him and he stood and looked vacantly into it his thoughts wandered and when a gleam of consciousness returned the first object that he saw was the reflection of his own face it was full of light and expression perhaps it wore a ghostly smile he turned away from the sight impatiently sitting down again he tried to compose himself point by point he revolved the situation he thought of what the lawyer had said of his deserted wife and lost son of lowther then taking out of an inner pocket the medallion that mr bonnithorne had lent him he looked at it long and earnestly the inspection seemed to afford a grim satisfaction there could be no doubt now of the ghostly smile that played upon his face there was a tall antique clock in the corner of the hall it struck eight the slow beats of the bell echoed chillily in the hushed apartment the hour awakened the consciousness of the brooding man at eight o'clock mr bonnithorne was appointed to be there to make the will hugh ritson touched gently a hand bell that stood on the table a servant entered send natt to me said hugh a moment later the stableman shambled into the hall he was a thick set young fellow with a short neck and a full face and eyelids that hung deep over a pair of cunning eyes at first sight one would have said that the rascal was only half awake at the second glance that he was never asleep hugh received him with a show of cordiality ah natt come here closer the man walked across hugh dropped his voice go down to little town and find mr bonnithorne you may meet him on the way if not he will be at the flying horse tell him i sent you to say that adam fallow lies dying at bigrigg and must see him at once you understand the man lifted his slumberous eyelids a suspicious twinkle lurked beneath them he glanced around then down at his big grimy boots measured with one uplifted hand the altitude of the bump on the top of his bullet head and muttered i understand hugh's face darkened silence he said sternly and then he met natt's upward glance with a faint smile when you come back get yourself out of the way do you hear the heavy eyelids went up once more i hear then be off the fellow was shuffling away natt said hugh following him a step you fancied that new whip of mine take it you'll find it in the porch a smile crossed natt's face from ear to ear he stumbled out hugh ritson returned to the hearth that haunting mirror caught the light of his eyes again and showed that he too was smiling at the same instant there came from the inner room the dull dead sound of a deep sob it banished the smile and made him pause he looked at the reflection of his face could it be the face of a scoundrel was he playing a base part no he was merely asserting his rights his plain legal rights nothing more he opened a cupboard in the wall and took down a bunch of keys selecting one key he stepped up to a cabinet and opened it in a compartment were many loose papers now to see if by chance there existed a will already he glanced at the papers one by one and threw them aside when he had finished his inspection he took a hasty turn about the room no trace he had been sure of it again the deep sob came from within hugh ritson walked noiselessly to the inner door opened it slightly bent his head and listened he turned away with an expression of pain picked up his hat and went out the night was very dark he strode a few paces down the lonnin and then back to the porch uncovering his head he let the night wind cool his hot temples his breath came audibly and hard he was turning again into the house when his eye was arrested by a light near the turning of the high road the light was approaching he walked toward it and met josiah bonnithorne the lawyer was jouncing along toward the house with a lantern in his hand didn't you meet the stableman said hugh in an eager whisper no the blockhead must have taken the old pack horse road on the fell side one would be safe in that fool's stupidity you have heard what has happened i have there is no will already and your father is insensible yes then none shall be made there was a pause in which the darkness itself seemed full of speech the lantern cast its light only on an open cart shed in the lane if your mother is the grace ormerod who married robert lowther and had a son by him then paul was that son the heir to lowther's conscience money bonnithorne said hugh ritson his voice trembled and broke if it is so then it is so and we need do nothing remember he is my father it is not within belief that he wants to disinherit his own son for the son of another man mr bonnithorne broke into a half smothered laugh and stepped close into the cobble hedge keeping the lantern down your father yes but you have seen to day what that may come to he has always held you under his hand paul has been the old man's favorite no doubt of that hugh crept close to the lawyer he was wrestling in the coil of a tragic temptation if he recovers consciousness he may be tempted to recognize as his own his wife's illegitimate son that the low tone was one of withering irony will keep her from dishonor and you from the estates at least he is my brother my mother's son if my father wishes to provide for him god forbid that we should prevent once more the half smothered laugh came through the darkness you have missed your vocation mr ritson believe me the gospel has lost a fervent advocate perhaps you would like to pray for this good brother perhaps you would consider it safe to drop on your knee and say 'my good brother that should be who has ever loved me whom i have ever loved take here my fortune and leave me until death a penniless dependent on the lands that are mine by right of birth' hugh ritson's breath came in gusts through his quivering unseen lips bonnithorne it cannot be it is mere coincidence seductive damning coincidence my mother knows all if it were true that paul was the son of lowther she would know that paul and greta must be half brother and half sister she would stop their unnatural union and do you think i have waited until now to sound that shoal water with a cautious plummet your mother is as ignorant of the propinquity as greta herself lowther was dead before your family settled in newlands the families never once came together while the widow lived and now not a relative survives who can tell the story parson christian said hugh ritson a great child just out of swaddling clothes then the secret rests with you and me bonnithorne who else the marriage must not come off greta is paul's half sister but she is no relative of yours you are right bonnithorne hugh ritson broke in the marriage is against nature and the first step toward stopping it is to stop the will then why are you here to make sure that there is no will already you have satisfied me and now i go there was a pause who shall say that i am acting a base part said hugh in an eager tone who indeed nature itself is on my side the man was conquered he was in the grip of his temptation i am off mr ritson get back into the house it is not safe for you to be out of sight and sound mr bonnithorne was moving off in the darkness the lamp before his breast its light fell that instant on hugh ritson's haggard face wait put out your lamp it's done all was now dark good night good night with slow whispers the two men parted the springy step of josiah bonnithorne was soon lost in the road below hugh ritson stood for awhile where the lawyer left him and then turned back into the house he found the cabinet open in the turmoil of emotion he had forgotten to close it he returned to it and shuffled with the papers to put them back in their place at that moment the door opened and a heavy footstep fell on the floor hugh glanced up startled it was paul his face was plowed deep with lines of pain but the cloud of sorrow that it wore was not so black as the cloud of anger when he saw what his brother was doing and guessed his purpose what are you about paul asked mastering his wrath there was no response shut up that cabinet hugh turned about with a flushed face i shall do as i please paul took two strides toward him shut it up the cabinet was closed at the same moment mrs ritson came from the inner room paul turned on his heel he is thinking of the will said the elder brother perhaps it is natural that he should distrust me but when the time comes he is welcome to the half of everything and ten thousand wills would hardly give him more mrs ritson was strongly agitated her eyes red with weeping were aflame with expression paul he is conscious she cried in a voice that her anxiety could not subdue he is trying to speak where is the lawyer hugh had been moving toward the outer door conscious he repeated and returned to the hearth send for mr bonnithorne at once said mrs ritson addressing hugh her manner was feverish hugh touched the bell when the servant appeared he said tell natt to run to the village for mr bonnithorne paul had walked to the door of the inner room his hand was on the handle when the door opened and greta came out she stepped up to mrs ritson and tried to quiet her agitation the servant returned i can't find natt she said he is not in the house you'll find him in the stable said hugh composedly the servant went out hurriedly paul returned to the middle of the room i'll go myself he said and plucked his hat from the settle but mrs ritson rose to prevent him no no paul she said in a tremulous voice you must never leave his side paul glanced at his brother with a perplexed look the calmness of hugh's manner disturbed him the servant reappeared natt is not in the stable sir paul's face was growing crimson mrs ritson turned to hugh hugh my dear son do you go for the lawyer a faint smile that lurked at the corners of hugh's mouth gave way to a look of injury mother my place also is here how can you ask me to leave my father's side at a moment like this greta had been looking fixedly at hugh i'll go she said resolutely impossible said paul it is now dark the roads are wet and lonely i'll go nevertheless said greta firmly god bless you my darling and love you and keep you forever said paul wrapping a cloak about her shoulders he whispered my brave girl that's the stuff of which an english woman may be made he opened the door and walked out with her across the court yard the night was now clear and calm the stars burned the trees whispered the distant ghylls swollen by the rain roared loud through the thin air a bird on the bough of a fir tree whistled and chirped the storm was gone only its wreckage lay in the still room within a safe journey to you dear girl and a speedy return whispered paul and in another moment greta had vanished in the dark when he returned to the hall his brother was passing into the room where the sick man lay paul was about to follow when his mother who was walking aimlessly to and fro in yet more violent agitation than before called on him to remain he turned about and stepped up to her observing as he did so that hugh had paused on the threshold and was regarding them with a steadfast look mrs ritson took paul's hand with a nervous grasp her eyes that bore the marks of recent tears had the light of wild excitement god be praised that he is conscious at last she said paul shook his head as if in censure of his mother's feelings let him die in peace he said let his soul pass quietly to its rest don't vex it now with thoughts of the cares it leaves behind mrs ritson let go his hand and dropped into a chair a slight shudder passed over her paul looked down with a puzzled expression then there was a low sobbing he leaned over his mother and smoothed her hair tenderly come let us go in he said in a broken voice mrs ritson rose from her seat and went down on her knees her eyes still wet but no longer weeping were raised to heaven almighty father give me strength she said beneath her breath and then more quietly she rose to her feet paul regarded her with increasing perturbation something even more serious than he yet knew of was amiss hardly knowing why his heart sunk still deeper what are we doing he said scarcely realizing his own words mrs ritson threw herself on his neck did i not say there was a terrible reason why your father should make a will paul's voice seemed to die within him what is it mother he asked feebly not yet gathering the meaning of his fears god knows i never dreamed it would be my lips that must tell you said mrs ritson paul my son my darling son you think me a good mother and a pure woman i am neither i must confess all now and to you oh how your love will turn from me paul's face turned pale his eyes gazed into his mother's eyes with a fixed look the clock ticked audibly not another sound broke the silence at last paul spoke speak mother he said is it something about my father mrs ritson's face fell on to her son's breast a strong shudder ran over her shoulders and she sobbed aloud you are not your father's heir she said you were born before we married but you will try not to hate me your own mother you will try will you not paul's great frame shook visibly he tried to speak his tongue cleaved to his mouth do you mean that i am a bastard he said in a hoarse whisper the word seemed to sting his mother like a poisoned arrow she clung yet closer about his neck pity me and love me still though i have wronged you before god and man i whom the world thought so pure i am but a whited sepulcher a dishonored woman dishonoring her dearest son the door opened gently and hugh ritson stood in the door way neither his brother nor his mother realized his presence he remained a moment and then withdrew leaving the door ajar beneath the two whom he left behind the world at that moment reeled paul stood with great wide eyes that had never tear to soften them gazing vacantly into the weeping eyes before him his lips quivered but he did not speak paul speak to me speak to me only speak only let me hear your voice see i am at your feet your mother kneels to you forgive her as god has forgiven her and loosing her grasp she flung herself on the ground before him and covered her face with her hands paul seemed not at first to know what was happening then he stooped and raised his mother to her feet mother rise up he said in a strange hollow tone who am i that i should presume to pardon you i am your son you are my mother his vacant eyes gathered a startled expression he glanced quickly around the room and said in a deep whisper how many know of this none besides ourselves the frightened look disappeared in its place came a look of overwhelming agony but i know of it oh my god he cried and into the chair from which his mother had risen he fell like a wounded man mrs ritson dried her eyes a strange quiet was coming upon her now her voice gathered strength she laid a hand on the head of her son who sat before her with buried face paul she said it is not until now that the day of reckoning has waited for me when you were a babe and knew nothing of your mother's grief i sorrowed over the shame that might yet be yours and when you grew to be a prattling child i thought if god would look into your innocent eyes they would purchase grace for both of us paul lifted his head at that moment of distress god had sent him the gracious gift of tears his eyes were wet and looked tenderly at his mother paul she continued quite calmly now promise me one thing what is it he asked softly that if your father should not live to make the will that must recognize you as his son you will never reveal this secret paul rose to his feet that is impossible i cannot promise it he said why honor and justice require that my brother hugh and not i should be my father's heir he at least must know what honor and what justice the honor of a true man the justice of the law of england mrs ritson dropped her head so much for your honor she said but what of mine mother what do you mean that if you allow your younger brother to inherit the world by that act will be told all your father's sin your mother's shame mrs ritson raised her hands to her face and turned aside paul stepped up to her and kissed her forehead reverently you are right he said forgive me i thought only of myself the world that loves to tarnish a pure name would like to gloat over your sorrow that it shall never man's law may have been outraged but god's law is still inviolate whatever my birth i am as much your son in the light of heaven as jacob was the son of isaac or david of jesse come let us go to him he may yet live to acknowledge me it had been a terrible moment but it was past to live to manhood in ignorance of the dishonor of his birth and then to learn the truth under the shadow of death this had been a tragic experience the love he had borne his father the reverence he had learned at his mother's knee to what bitter test had they been put had all the past been but as the marble image of a happy life was all the future shattered before him pshaw he was the unconscious slave of a superstition a phantasm a gingerbread superstition and a mightier touch awoke his sensibilities the touch of nature before god at that moment he was his father's son if the world or the world's law said otherwise then they were of the devil and deserving to be damned what rite what jabbering ceremony what priestly ordinance what legal mummery stood between him and his claim to his father's name paul took in love the hand of his mother let us go in to him he repeated and together they walked across the room the outer door was flung open and greta entered flushed and with wide open eyes at the same instant the inner door swung noiselessly back and hugh ritson stood on the threshold greta was about to speak but hugh motioned her to silence his face was pale his hand trembled too late he said huskily he is dead greta sunk on to the settle in the window recess hugh walked to the hearth and paused with rigid features before the haunting mirror paul stood for a moment hand in hand with his mother motionless speechless cold at his heart then he hurried into the inner room mrs ritson followed him closing the door behind him the little oak bound room was dusky the lamp that burned low was shaded across the bed lay allan ritson in his habit as he lived but his lips were white and cold paul stood and looked down there lay his father his father still his father by right of nature of love of honor let the world say what it would and he knew the truth at last too late to look into those glassy eyes and read the secret of their long years of suffering love father paul whispered and fell to his knees by the deaf ear mrs ritson strangely quiet strangely calm stepped to the opposite side of the bed and placed one hand on the dead man's breast paul she said come here he rose to his feet and walked to her side lay your hand with mine and pledge to me your solemn word never to speak of what you have heard to night until that great day when we three shall stand together before the great white throne paul placed his hand side by side with hers and lifted his eyes to heaven on my father's body by my mother's honor never to reveal to any human soul by word or deed his act or her shame always to bear myself as their lawful son before man even as i am their rightful son before god i swear it i swear it his voice was cold and clear but the words were scarcely uttered when he fell to his knees again with a subdued cry of overwrought feeling mrs ritson staggered back caught the curtains of the bed and covered her face all was still then a shuffling footfall was heard on the floor hugh ritson was in the darkened room he lifted the shaded lamp from the table approached the bedside and held the lamp with one hand above his head the light fell on the outstretched body of his father and the bowed head of his brother book ii the coil of the temptation chapter i it was late in november and the day was dark and drear hoar frost lay on the ground the atmosphere was pallid with haze and dense with mystery gaunt specters of white mist swept across the valley and gathered at the sides of every open door the mountains were gone only a fibrous vagueness was visible in an old pasture field by the bridge a man was plowing he was an elderly man sturdy and stolid of figure and clad in blue homespun there was nothing clerical in his garb or manner yet he was the vicar and school master of the parish his low crowned hat was drawn deep over his slumberous gray eyes the mobile mouth beneath completed the expression of gentleness and easy good nature it was a fine old face with the beauty of simplicity and the sweetness of content a boy in front led the horses and whistled the parson hummed a tune as he turned his furrows sometimes he sung in a drawling tone bonny lass canny lass wilta be mine thou's nowder wesh dishes nor sarra the swine at the turn rows he paused and rested on his plow handles he rested longest at the turn rows on the roadside of the field like the shivering mists that grouped about the open doors he was held there by light and warmth the smithy stood at the opposite side of the road cut into the rock of the fell on three sides and having a roof of thatch the glare of the fire now rising now falling streamed through the open door it sent a long vista of light through the blank and pulsating haze the vibrations of the anvil were all but the only sounds on the air the alternate thin clink of the smith's hand hammer and the thick thud of the striker's sledge echoed in unseen recesses of the hills beyond this smithy of newlands filled the function which under a higher propitiousness of circumstance is answered by a club girded with his leather apron his sleeves rolled tightly over his knotty arms the smith john proudfoot stood waiting for his heat his striker geordie moore had fallen to at the bellows on the tool chest sat gubblum oglethorpe leisurely smoking his pony was tied to the hasp of the gate the miller dick of the syke sat on a pile of iron rods tom o' dint the little bow legged fiddler and postman was sharpening at the grindstone a penknife already worn obliquely to a point by many similar applications nay i can make nowt of him he's a changed man for sure said the blacksmith gubblum removed his pipe and muttered sententiously it's die spensy i tell thee dandering and wandering about at all hours of the day and night continued the blacksmith it's all die spensy repeated the peddler and as widderful and wizzent as a polecat nailed up on a barn door said tom o' dint lifting his grating knife from the grindstone and speaking with a voice as hoarse eh and as weak as watter with it added the blacksmith his as was as strong as rum punch rejoined the fiddler it's die spensy john nowt else said gubblum the miller broke in testily what's die spensy what ails paul ritson answered gubblum shaf on your balderdash said dick of the syke die spensying and die spensying you've no' but your die spensy for everything tommy's rusty throat and john's big toe and lang geordie's broken nose as giles raisley gave him a' saturday neet at the pack horse it's all die spensy the miller was a blusterous fellow who could swear in lusty anger and laugh in boisterous sport in a single breath gubblum puffed placidly it is die spensy i know it by exper'ence he observed persistently the blacksmith's little eyes twinkled mischievously to be sure you do gubblum you had it bad the day you crossed in the packet from whitehebben that was die spensy a cute bout too i've heard as it were amazing rough on the watter that day said tom in a pause of the wheel glancing up knowingly at the blacksmith heard had you must have been tolerable deaf else rough why them do say as the packet were wrecked and only two planks saved gubblum was washed ashore cross legged on one of them and his pack on the other the long labored breathings of the bellows ended the iron was thrown white hot out of the glowing coals on to the anvil and the clank of the hand hammer and thud of the sledge were all that could be heard then the iron cooled and was lifted back into the palpitating blaze the blacksmith stepped to the door wiped his streaming forehead with one hand and waved the other to the parson plowing in the opposite field a canny morning mr christian he shouted bad luck for the parson's young lady anyhow her sweetheart is none to keen for the wedding he said turning again to the fire she's a fine like lass yon said tom o' dint an old man iron gray with a pair of mason's mallets swung front and back across his shoulders stepped into the smithy how fend ye john he said middling weel job answered the blacksmith and what's your errand now a chisel or two for tempering cutting in the church yard to day job cold wark eh ey auld ritson's stone as they've putten over him the blacksmith tapped the peddler on the arm gubblum shall i tell you what's a matter with paul never you bother john it's die spensy it's fretting that's it fretting for his father fretting for his fiddlesticks shouted dick the miller allan's dead this half a year john's reet said job the stone cutter it is fretting dick of the syke got up off the iron rods because a young fellow has given you a job of wark to cut his father's headstone and tell a lie or two in letters half an inch deep and two shillings a dozen does that show 'at he's fretting he didn't do nowt of the sort said job hotly dusta mean as it were the other one hugh inquired the miller maybe that's reet said job dick of the syke was not to be beaten for lack of the logic of circumlocution then what for do you say as paul is weeping his insides out about his father when he leaves it to other folks to put a bit of stone over him and a few scrats on it because i do say so said job conclusively and maybe you've got your reasons job said the blacksmith with insinuating suavity maybe i have said the mason then softening he added i don't mind telling you neither yesterday morning when i went to wark i found paul ritson lying full length across his father's grave his clothes were soaking with dew and his face was as white as a feb'uary mist and stiff and set like and his hair was frosted over same as a pane in the church window never he was like to take no note of me but i gave him a shake and called out 'what mr paul why what man what's this' and what ever did he say say nowt he get hissel' up and gay stiff in the limbs he looked to be sure and walked off without a word gubblum on the tool chest had removed his pipe from between his lips during the mason's narrative and listened with a face of blank amazement weel that is a stiffener he said drawing a long breath what's a stiffener said job sharply that 'at you're telling for gospel truth then turning to the blacksmith the peddler pointed the shank of his pipe at the mason and said what morning was it as he found paul ritson taking a bath to hissel' in the kirk yard why yesterday morning said the smith well he bangs them all at lying said gubblum what dusta say shouted job with sudden fury as you've telt us a lie answered gubblum sista gubblum if you don't take that word back i'll i'll throw you into the water butt and what would i do while you were thrang at that laal job asked the peddler the blacksmith interposed sec a rumpus he said you're too sudden in your temper job some folks are ower much like their namesakes in the bible said gubblum resuming his pipe then what for did he say it worn't true as i found young ritson yesterday morning wet to the skin in the church yard said job ignoring the peddler because he warn't there said gubblum job lost all patience look here he said if you're not hankering for a cold bath on a frosty morning laal man i don't know as you've got any call to say that again he warn't there the laal man muttered doggedly the blacksmith had plunged his last heat into the water trough to cool and a cloud of vapor filled the smithy lord a'mighty he said laughing that's the way some folks go off all of a hiss and a smoke he warn't there mumbled the peddler again impervious to the homely similitude how are you so certain sure said dick of the syke you warn't there yourself i reckon no but i was somewhere else and so was paul ritson i slept at the pack house in kezzick night afore last and he did the same did you see him there said the blacksmith no but giles raisley saw him and he warn't astir when giles went on his morning shift at eight o'clock the blacksmith broke into a loud guffaw tell us how he was at the hawk and heron in london at midsummer and so he was said gubblum unabashed willy nilly ey said the blacksmith pausing over the anvil with uplifted hammer the lurid reflection of the hot iron on his face maybe he had his reasons for denying hisself said gubblum the blacksmith laughed again tapped the iron with the hand hammer down came the sledge and the flakes flew two miners entered the smithy good morning john are ye gayly said one of them gayly gayly why it's giles hissel' giles said the peddler where was paul ritson night afore last abed i reckon chuckled one of the new comers where abed nay don't ax me wait night afore last that was the night he slept at janet's wasn't it gubblum's eyes twinkled with triumph what did i tell you what call had he to sleep at keswick said the blacksmith it's no'but four miles from his own bed at the ghyll nay now when ye ax the like o' that tom the postman stopped his grindstone and snuckered huskily maybe he's had a fratch with yon brother yon hugh i'm on the morning shift this week and mother janet she said 'giles' she said 'the brother of your young master came late last night for a bed' job what do you say to that shouted the blacksmith above the pulsating of the bellows and with the sharp white lights of the leaping flames on his laughing face say that they're a pack of liars said the mason catching up his untempered chisels and flinging out of the smithy when he had gone gubblum removed his pipe and said calmly he's ower much like his bible namesake in temper that's the on'y fault of job the parson in the field outside had stood in the turn rows resting on his plow handles he had been drawling bonny lass canny lass but catching the sound of angry words he had paused and listened when job the mason flung away he returned to his plowing and disappeared down the furrow the boy whistling at his horse's head why mattha it is thee said the blacksmith observing for the first time the second of the new comers and how fend ye middling weel john middling weel said matthew in a low voice resting on the edge of the trough it was laird fisher more bent than of old with deeper lines in his grave face and with yet more listless eyes he had brought two picks for sharpening got your smelting house at wark down at the pit mattha asked the blacksmith ey john it's at wark it's at wark the miller had turned to go but he faced about with ready anger lord yes and a pretty pickle you and your gaffer's like to make of me wad ye credit it john they've built their smelting house within half a rod of my mill half a rod not a yard mair when your red hot rubbish is shot down your bank where's it going to go ey that's what i want to know where's it going to go why into your mill of course said gubblum with a wink from the tool chest that'll maybe help you to go by fire when you can't raise the wind verra good for thee gubblum laughed the blacksmith i'll have the law on them safe enough said the miller and where's your damages to come from from the same spot as all the rest of the brass that's good enough for me matthew's voice followed the insinuating guffaw i spoke to master hugh yesterday i telt him all you said about a wall well he won't build it of course not why didsta not speak to paul no use in that said matthew faintly nay young hugh is a gaffer exclaimed the blacksmith and paul has no say in it except finding the brass ey i mak' no doubt as you're reet dick said matthew meekly it's been just so since the day auld allan died said the blacksmith he hadn't been a week in his grave before hugh bought up mattha's royalty in the hammer hole and began to sink for iron he's never found much ore as i've heard tell on but he goes ahead laying down his pumping engines and putting up his cranes and boring his mill races just as if he was proper ietor of a royal mine hugh is the chain horse and paul's no'but the mare in the shafts said gubblum and the money comes somehow said tom o' dint who had finished the knife and was testing its edge in whittling a stick matthew got up from his seat i'll come again for the picks john he said quietly and the old man stepped out of the bright glow into the chill haze mattha has never been the same since laal mercy left him said the blacksmith any news of her asked the peddler ax tom o' dint he's the postman and like to know if anybody in newlands gets the scribe of a line from the wench said the miller tom shakes his head you could tell summat an' you would ey tom said the blacksmith showing his teeth don't you misliken me said the rural messenger in his husky tones i'm none of your peeping toms and the postman drew up his head with as much pride of office as could be assumed by a gentleman of bowed legs and curtailed stature it baffles me as mattha hisself could make nowt of his royalty in the hammer hole if there was owt to make out of it said the miller from the gate buttoning his coat up to his ears i've heard as he had a mind to try his luck again said giles raisley nay nay nowt of the sort said the blacksmith when the laal lass cut away and left the auld chap he lost heart and couldn't bear the sight of the spot where she used to bide so he started back to his bit place on coledale moss but hugh ritson followed him and bought up his royalty for nowt as they say and set him to wark for wage in his own sinking the same that ruined the auld man lang ago and he's like to see a fortun' come out of it yet said giles it won't be mattha's fortun' then nay never fear said the miner gubblum shook the ashes out of his pipe and said meditatively mattha's like me and the cuckoo why man how's that said the blacksmith girding his leather apron in a band about his waist a fresh heat was in the fire the bellows were belching the palpitating flames were licking the smoky hood a twinkle lurked in the blacksmith's eye how's that he repeated he's allus stopping short too soon said gubblum my missis she said to me last back end 'gubblum' she said 'dusta mind as it's allus summer when the cuckoo is in the garden' 'that's what is is' i said 'well' she said 'dusta not think it wad allus be summer if the cuckoo could allus be kept here' 'maybe so' i says 'but easier said nor done' 'shaf on you for a clothead' says she 'nowt so simple when you get the cuckoo into the garden build a wall round and keep it in' and that's what i did and i built it middling high too but it warn't high enough for wad ye think it one day i saw the cuckoo setting off and it just skimmed the top of that wall by a bare inch now if i'd no'but put another stone a loud peal of laughter was gubblum's swift abridgment the peddler tapped the mouth of his pipe on his thumb nail and smiled under his shaggy brows chapter ii when parson christian finished his plowing the day was far spent he gave the boy a shilling as day's wage for leading the horses drove the team back to their owner robert atkinson paid five shillings for the day's hire of them and set out for home on the way thither he called at henry walmsley's the grocery store in the village and bought half a pound of tea a can of coffee and a stone of sugar then at randal alston's the shoemaker's and paid for the repairing of a pair of boots and put them under his arm finally he looked in at the flying horse and called for a pot of ale and drank it and smoked a pipe and had a crack with tommy lowthwaite the publican the mist had risen as the day wore on and now that the twilight was creeping down the valley the lane to the vicarage could be plainly seen in its yellow carpeting of fallen leaves an outer door of the house stood open and a rosy glow streamed from the fire into the porch not less bright was the face within that was waiting to welcome the old vicar home back again greta back again shouted the parson rolling into the cozy room with his ballast under either arm there wait fair play girl ah you rogue now that's what i call a mean advantage there was a smack of lips a little laugh in a silvery voice with a merry lilt in it and then a deep toned mutter of affected protestation breaking down into silence and a broad smile at arms length greta glanced at the parson's burdens and summoned an austere look now didn't i tell you never to do it again she said with an uplifted finger and an air of stern reproof did you now said the parson with an expression of bland innocence adding in an accent of wonderment what a memory i have to be sure leave such domestic duties to your domestic superiors said the girl keeping a countenance of amazing severity do you hear me you dear old darling i hear i hear said the old man throwing his purchases on the floor one by one why bless me and here's mr bonnithorne he added lifting his eyes to the chimney corner where the lawyer sat toasting his toes welcome welcome peter peter cried greta opening an inner door a gaunt old fellow with only one arm shambled into the room peter take away these things to the kitchen said greta the old man glanced down at the parson's purchases with a look of undisguised contempt he's been at it again mistress he said the parson had thrown off his coat and was pushing away his long boots with the boot jack and how's mr bonnithorne this rusty weather wait peter give me the slippers out of the big parcel i got randal alston to cut down my old boots into clock sides and make me slippers out of the feet only sixpence and see what a cozy pair thank you peter so you're well mr bonnithorne odd you say well it is considering the world of folk who are badly these murky days peter lifted the boots and fixed them dexterously under the stump of his abridged member the tea and coffee he deposited in his trousers' pockets and the sugar he carried in his hand there'll be never no living with him he muttered in greta's ear as he passed out don't know as i mind his going to plow that's a job for a man with two hands but the like o' this isn't no master's wark dear me exclaimed the parson who was examining his easy chair preparatory to sitting in it a new cushion and a bag on the wall for my specs and a shelf for my pipes and a a what do you call this an antimacassar mr christian the lawyer said i wondered was he ever going to see any difference said greta with dancing eyes dear me and red curtains on the windows and a clean print counterpane on the settle a chintz a chintz interposed greta with a mock whimper and the old rosewood clock in the corner as bright as a looking glass and the big oak cabinet all shiny with oil varnish sir varnish and all the carvings on it as fresh as a new pin st peter with his great key and the rich man with his money bag trying to defy the fiery furnace didn't i say you would scarcely know your own house when you came home again said greta she was busying herself at spreading the cloth on the round table and laying the parson's supper parson christian was revolving on his slippered toes his eyes full of child like amazement and a maturer twinkle of knowingness lurking in that corner of his aged orbs that was not directly under the fire of the girl's sharp delighted gaze deary me have you a young lady at home mr bonnithorne you know i am a bachelor mr christian said the lawyer demurely so am i so am i i never knew any better not until our old friend mrs lowther died and left me to take charge of her daughter mother should have asked me to take charge of mr christian shouldn't she mr bonnithorne said greta with roguish eyes well there's something in that said the parson with a laugh peter was getting old and a bit rusty in the hinges you know and we were likely to turn out a pair of old crows fit for nothing but to scare good christians from the district but greta came to the musty old house with its dust and its cobwebs and its two old human spiders like a slant of sunlight on a muggy day here's supper draw up your chair mr bonnithorne and welcome it's my favorite dish she knows it barley broth and a sheep's head with boiled potatoes and mashed turnips draw up your chair but where's the pot of ale greta peter peter the other spider presently appeared carrying a quart jug with a little mountain of froth a crater bubbling over and down the sides been delving for potatoes to day peter said the parson peter answered with a grumpy nod of his big head how many bushels maybe a matter of twelve muttered peter shambling out then the parson and his guest fell to you're a happy man mr christian said mr bonnithorne as greta left the room on some domestic errand parson christian shook his head no call for grace he said with all the luxuries of life thrown into one's lap that's the worst of living such a happy life no trials no cross nothing to say but 'soul take thine ease' and that's bad when you think of it have some sheep's head mr bonnithorne you've not got any tongue here's a nice sweet bit thank you mr christian i came round to pay the ten shillings for joseph parkinson's funeral sermon last sunday sennight and the one pound two half yearly allowance from the james bolton charity for poor clergy men well well they may well say it never rains but it pours said the parson i called at henry walmsley's and robert atkinson's on my way home from the crossroads and they both paid me their martinmas quarterage henry five shillings and robert seven shillings and when i dropped in on randal alston to pay for the welting and soling of my shoes he said they would come to one and sixpence but that he owed me one and seven pence for veal that peter sold him so he paid me a penny and we are clear from the beginning of the world to this day i also wanted to speak about our young friend greta said mr bonnithorne softly i suppose you are reconciled to losing her losing her greta said the parson laying down his knife then smiling oh you mean when paul takes her of course of course only the marriage will not be yet awhile he said so himself marriage with paul no said mr bonnithorne clearing his throat and looking grave parson christian glanced into the lawyer's face uneasily and lapsed into silence mr christian you were left guardian of greta lowther by our dear friend her mother it becomes your duty to see that she does the best for her future welfare and happiness surely surely said the parson you are an old man mr christian and she is a young girl when you and i are gone greta lowther will still have the battle of life before her please god please god said the parson faintly isn't it well that you should see that she shall have a husband that can fight it with her side by side so she shall so she shall paul is a manly fellow and as fond of her as of his own soul nay as i tell him it's idolatry and a sin before god his love of the girl you're wrong mr christian paul ritson is no fit husband for greta he is a ruined man since his father's death he has allowed the ghyll to go to wreck it is mortgaged to the last blade of grass i know it parson christian shifted his chair from the table and gazed into the fire with bewildered eyes i knew he was in trouble he said but i didn't guess that things wore so grave a look don't you see that he is shattered in mind as well as purse said the lawyer no no i can't say that i do see that he's a little absent sometimes but that's all when i talk of matthew henry and discuss his commentaries or recite the story of dear adam clarke he is a little just a little forgetful that's all yes that is all compared with his brother what a difference said mr bonnithorne well there is a difference said the parson such spirit such intelligence he'll be the richest man in cumberland one of these days he has bought up a royalty that is sweating ore and now he is laying down pumping engines and putting up smelting houses and he is getting standing orders to fix a line of railway for the ore he is fetching up and where did the money come from asked the parson the money to begin mr bonnithorne glanced up sharply it was his share of his father's personalty a big tree from such a little acorn said the parson meditatively and quick growth too there's no saying what intelligence and enterprise will not do in this world mr christian said the lawyer who seemed less certain of the next hugh ritson is a man of spirit and brains now that's the husband for greta that is if you can get him and i don't know that you can but if it were only possible parson christian faced about mr bonnithorne he said gravely the girl is not up for sale and the richest man in cumberland can't buy her the thirty pieces of silver for which judas sold his master may have been smelted and coined afresh but not a piece of that money shall touch fingers of mine you mistake me mr christian believe me you do protested the lawyer with an aggrieved expression i was speaking in our young friend's interests whatever occurs i beg of you as a friend and well wisher of the daughter of robert lowther now in his grave never to allow her to marry paul ritson that shall be as god wills it said the parson quietly the lawyer had risen and drawn on his great coat she can stay here with me continued the parson no she should marry now said mr bonnithorne stepping to the door she's all but of age it is hardly fair to keep her why what do you mean asked the parson a puzzled look on his face she is rich and she is young her wealth can buy comforts and her youth win pleasures the good old christian opened wide his great gray eyes with a blank expression he glanced vacantly about the simple room rose to his feet and sat down again i never thought of that before he said faintly and staring long into the fire there was a heavy foot on the path outside the latch was lifted and paul ritson stepped into the room at the sound of his step greta tripped through the inner door all joy and eagerness to welcome him the parson got up and held out both hands the clouds gone from his beaming face well good night said the lawyer opening the door i've four long miles before me and how dark how very dark paul ritson was in truth a changed man his face was pale and haggard and his eyes were bleared and heavy he dropped with a listless weariness into the chair that greta drew up to the fire when he smiled the lips lagged back to a gloomy repose and when he laughed the note of merriment rang hollow and fell short just in time for a game with me my lad said the parson greta fetch the chessboard and box the board was brought the pieces fixed the parson settled himself at his ease with slippers on the hearth rug and a handkerchief across his knee do you know paul i heard a great parl about you to day about me where asked paul without much curiosity in his tone at mr proudfoot's smithy while i was turning the fallows in the meadow down at the crossroads little mr oglethorpe was saying that you slept at the pack horse in keswick the night before last but mr job sheepshanks the letter cutter said nay and they had high words indeed wherein job called mr oglethorpe all but his proper name and flung away in high dudgeon paul moved his pawn and said i never slept at the pack horse in my life mr christian greta sat knitting at one side of the ingle the kitten with a bell attached to a ribbon about its neck sported with the bows of her dainty slippers only the click of the needles and the tinkle of the bell and the hollow tick of the great clock in the corner broke the silence at last parson christian drew himself up in his chair well paul man paul deary me what a sad move you're going back back back once you could beat me five games to four now i can run away with you the game soon finished amid a chuckle from the parson a bantering word from greta and a loud forced laugh from paul parson christian lifted from a shelf a ponderous tome bound in leather and incased in green cloth i must make my day's entry he said and get off to bed i was astir before day break this morning greta crept up behind the old man and looked over his shoulder as he wrote nov retired to my lodging room last night and commended my all to god and lay down and fell asleep but peter minded the heifer that was near to calving so he came and wakened me and we went down and sealed her and foddered her and milked her spent all day plowing the low meadow peter delving potatoes called at the flying horse and sat while i drank one pot of ale and no more and paid for it received ten shillings from lawyer bonnithorne for funeral sermon and one pound two from bolton charity also five shillings quarterage from henry walmsley and seven from robert atkinson and a penny to square accounts from randal alston and so retired to my closet at peace with all the world blessed be god the parson returned to its shelf the ponderous diary made to view his life and actions in and called through the inner door for his bedroom candle a morose voice answered coming and presently came thank you peter and how's the meeting house and who preaches there next sunday peter peter grumbled out i don't know as it's not yourself i passed them my word as you'd exhort 'em a' sunday afternoon but nobody has ever asked me you should have mentioned the matter to me first peter before promising but never mind i'm willing though it's a poor discourse they can get from me turning to paul who sat silent before the fire peter has left us and turned methodist said the parson he is now brother peter ward and wants me to preach at the meeting house well i won't say nay many a good ordained clergyman has been dissenting minister as well good night to you peter i wish you to get some whipcord and tie up the reel of my fishing rod there it is on the rafters of the ceiling and a bit more cord to go round the handle of my whip it leans against the leads of the neuk window and peter i'm going to go to the mill with the oats to morrow and robin atkinson has loaned me his shandry and mare robin always puts a bushel of grain into the box but it's light and only small feeding i wish you to get a bushel of better to mix with it and make it more worth the mare's labor to eat it good night all good night peter grumbled something beneath his breath and shambled out god bless him said greta presently and paul without lifting his eyes from the fire said quietly 'christe's lore and his apostles twelve he taught but first he followed it himselve' then there was silence in the little vicarage paul sat without animation until greta set herself to bewitch him out of his moodiness her bright eyes dancing in the rosy fire light that flickered in the room her high spirits bubbling over with delicious teasing and joyous sprightliness her tenderness her rippling laughter her wit her badinage all were brought to the defeat and banishment of paul's heaviness of soul it was to no purpose the gloom of the grave face would not be conquered paul smiled slightly into the gleaming eyes and laughed faintly at the pouting lips and stroked tenderly the soft hair that was glorified into gold in the glint of the fire light but the old sad look came back once and again greta gave it up at last she rose from the hassock at his feet sweetheart she said i will go to bed you are not well to night or you are angry or out of humor she waited a moment but he did not speak then she made a feeble feint of leaving the room at last paul said greta i have something to say she was back at her hassock in an instant the laughter had gone from her eyes and left a dewy wistfulness you are unhappy you have been unhappy a long long time and have never told me the cause tell me now the heavy face relaxed what ever put that in your head little one he asked in a playful tone patting the golden hair tell me now she said more eagerly think of me as a woman fit to share your sorrows not as a child to be pampered and played with and never to be burdened with a man's sterner cares if i am not fit to know your troubles i am not fit to be your wife tell me paul what it is that has taken the sunshine out of your life the sunshine has not been taken out of my life yet little woman here it is said paul lightly and he drew his fingers through the glistening hair the girl's lucent eyes fell you are playing with me she said gravely you are always playing with me am i so much a child are you angry with me angry with you little one hardly that i think said paul and his voice sunk then tell me sweetheart you have something to say what is it i have come to ask yes he hesitated his heart was too full to speak he began again do you think it would be too great a sacrifice to give up what she gasped do you remember all you told me about my brother hugh that he said he loved you well said greta with a puzzled glance i think he spoke truly said paul and his voice trembled she drew back with agony in every line of her face would it be do you think supposing i went away far away and we were not to meet for a time a long time never to meet again could you bring yourself to love him and marry him greta rose to her feet in agitation him love him you ask me that you the girl's voice broke down into sobs that seemed to shake her to the heart's core greta darling forgive me i was blind i am ashamed oh i could cry my eyes out she said wiping away her tears say you were only playing with me then say you were only playing do say so do i will say anything anything but the same words again and they nearly killed me to say them and was this what you came to say greta inquired no no he said lifted out of his gloom by the excitement but another thing and it is easier now ten times easier now to say it greta do you think if i were to leave cumberland and settle in another country australia or canada or somewhere far enough away that you could give up home and kindred and friends and old associations and all the dear past and face a new life in a new world with me could you do it her eyes sparkled he opened his arms and she flew to his embrace is this your answer little one he said with choking delight and a pair of streaming eyes looked up for a brief instant into his face then we'll say no more now i'm to go to london to morrow night and shall be away four days when i return we'll talk again and tell the good soul who lies in yonder peace be with him and sweet sleep the dear old friend paul lifted up his hat and opened the door his gloom was gone his eyes were alive with animation the worn cheeks were aflame he stood erect and walked with the step of a strong man greta followed him into the porch the rosy fire light followed her it flickered over her golden hair and bathed her beauty in a ruddy glow oh how free the air will breathe over there he said when all this slavery is left behind forever you don't understand little woman but some day you shall what matter if it is a land of rain and snow and tempest it will be a land of freedom freedom and life and love and now master hugh we shall soon be quits very soon his excitement carried him away and greta was too greedy of his joy to check it with questions they stood together at the door the night was still and dark the trees were noiseless their prattling leaves were gone silent and empty as a vacant street was the unseen road paul held forth his hand to feel if it rained a withered leaf floated down from the eaves into his palm then a footstep echoed on the path it went on toward the village presently the postman came trudging along from the other direction good night tom o' dint cried paul cheerily tom stopped and hesitated who was it i hailed on the road he asked when just now nay who was it i thought it was yourself the little man trundled on in the dark my brother no doubt said paul and he pulled the door after him chapter iii the next morning a bright sun shone on the frosty landscape the sky was blue and the air was clear hugh ritson sat in his room at the back of the ghyll with its window looking out on the fell side and on the river under the leafless trees beneath the apartment had hardly the appearance of a room in a cumbrian homestead it was all but luxurious in its appointments the character of its contents gave it something of the odor of a by gone age besides books on many shelves prints pictures in water and oil and mirrors of various shapes there was tapestry on the inside of the door a bust of dante above a cabinet of black oak a piece of bas relief in soapstone a gargoyle in wood a brass censer a mediaeval lamp with open mouth and a small ivory crucifix nailed to the wall above the fire hugh himself sat at an organ his fingers wandering aimlessly over the keys his eyes gazing vacantly out at the window there was a knock at the door come in said the player mr bonnithorne entered and walked to a table in the middle of the floor hugh ritson finished the movement he was playing and then arose from the organ and drew an easy chair to the fire brought the deed he asked quietly mr bonnithorne still standing i have my dear friend and something yet more important hugh glanced up through his constant smile mr bonnithorne was obviously agitated dropping his voice the lawyer added copies of the three certificates hugh smiled faintly good we will discuss the certificates first he said and drew his dressing gown leisurely about him mr bonnithorne began to unfold some documents he paused his eye was keen and bright he seemed to survey his dear friend with some perplexity his glance was shadowed by a certain look of distrust but his words were cordial and submissive and his voice was as usual low and meek what a wonderful man you are and how changed it is only a few months since i had to whip up your lagging spirits at a great crisis and now you leave me far behind not the least anxious how different i am to be sure it was this very morning my correspondent sent me the copies and yet i am here five miles from home and when the post arrived i declare to you that such was my eagerness to know if our surmises were right that hugh interrupted in a quick cold voice that you were too nervous to open his letter and fumbled it back and front for an hour precisely saying this hugh lifted his eyes quickly enough to encounter mr bonnithorne's glance and when they fell again a curious expression was playing about his mouth give me the papers said hugh and he stretched forward his hand without shifting in his seat well really you are really hugh raised his eyes again mr bonnithorne paused handed the documents and shuffled uneasily into a seat one by one hugh glanced hastily over three slips of paper this is well he said quietly well i should say so indeed what could be better i confess to you that until to day i had some doubts now i have none doubts so you had doubts said hugh dryly they disturbed your sleep perhaps the lurking distrust in mr bonnithorne's eyes openly displayed itself and he gazed full into the face of hugh ritson with a searching look that made little parley with his smile then one may take a man's inheritance without qualm or conviction hugh pretended not to hear and began to read aloud the certificates in his hand let me see this is first registration of birth mr bonnithorne interrupted luckily very luckily the registration of birth is first hugh read name paul date of birth august place of birth russell square london father's name robert lowther mother's name grace lowther maiden name ormerod then this comes second registration of marriage mr bonnithorne rose in his eagerness and rubbed his hands together at the fire yes second he said with evident relish hugh read calmly allan ritson grace ormerod register's office bow street strand london june what do you say to that asked mr bonnithorne in an eager whisper hugh continued without comment and this comes last registration of birth name hugh march holme ravenglass cumberland allan ritson grace ritson ormerod there you have the case in a nutshell said mr bonnithorne dropping his voice paul is your half brother and the son of lowther you are allan ritson's heir born within a year of your father's marriage can anything be clearer hugh remained silently intent on the documents were these copies made at somerset house he asked mr bonnithorne nodded and your correspondent can be relied upon assuredly a solicitor in excellent practice was he told what items he had to find or did he make a general search he was told to find the marriage or marriages of grace ormerod and to trace her offspring and these were the only entries mr bonnithorne nodded again hugh twirled the papers in his fingers and then placed two of them side by side his face wore a look of perplexity i am puzzled he said what puzzles you said mr bonnithorne can anything be plainer yes by these certificates i am two and a half years younger than paul i was always taught that there was only a year between us mr bonnithorne smiled and said in a superior tone an obvious ruse you think a child is easily deceived true mr bonnithorne preserved a smiling face now i will proceed to the payment of the legacy and you no doubt to the institution of your claim no said hugh ritson with emphasis rising to his feet you know that if a bastard dies seized of an estate the law justifies his title he is then the bastard eigne you must eject this man no said hugh ritson again the lawyer glanced up inquiringly and hugh added that shall come later meantime the marriage must be brought about your own marriage with greta paul's paul's said mr bonnithorne the very suppression of his tone giving it additional emphasis paul's repeated hugh with grim composure he shall marry her the lawyer had risen once more and was now face to face with hugh ritson glancing into his eyes with eager scrutiny you cannot mean it he said at length and why not said hugh placidly because paul is her brother at least her half brother they don't know that mr bonnithorne's breath seemed to be arrested but we know it and we can't stand by and witness their marriage he said at length hugh ritson leaned with his back to the fire we can and shall he said and not a muscle of his face moved mr bonnithorne surveyed his friend from head to foot and then his own countenance relaxed you are trifling but it will be no trifle to them when they learn that their billing and cooing must end and from such a cause too it will be a terrible shock the only question is whether it would not be more humane to say nothing of the impediment until we have brought about another match last night at parson christian's i did what i could for you hugh smiled in return a close observer might have seen that his was a cold mockery of the lawyer's own smile yes you were always humane bonnithorne and now your sensibilities are shocked but when i spoke of marriage i meant the ceremony nothing more mr bonnithorne's eyes twinkled i think i understand you intend to separate them at the church door perhaps at the altar rail it is a shocking revenge my very skin creeps hugh laughed lightly and walked to the window a slant of sunshine fell on his upturned face when he turned his head and broke silence he spoke in a deep harsh voice i was humane too when she spoke of marriage with paul i hinted at an impediment she ridiculed the idea scoffed at it another light laugh and then a stern solemnity she insulted me palpably grossly brutally what did she say didn't i tell you before why she said ha ha would you believe it she said she'd rather marry a plowboy than such a gentleman as me that was her very word hugh ritson's face was now dark with passion while laughter was on his lips she shall marry her plowboy to her lifelong horror and disgrace i promised her as much and i will keep my word a terrible revenge muttered the lawyer twitching uneasily at his finger nails tut you don't know to what lengths love may go even the feeble infant hearts of men whose minds are a blank can carry them any length in the devotion or the revenge of love he paused and then added in a low tone she has outraged my love surely not past forgiveness interrupted mr bonnithorne nervously it would be a lifelong injury and she is a woman too hugh faced about but he is a man and i have my reckoning with him also hugh ritson strode across the room and then stopped suddenly look you bonnithorne you said that with all your confidence on the night of my father's death you had your doubts until to day but i had never a moment's doubt why because i had assurance from my mother's own lips to me no but worse to him he knows well he is not my father's heir he has known it since the hour of my father's death he knows that i know it yet he has kept the lands to this day another uneasy perambulation do you think of that when you talk of revenge manliness he has none he is a pitiful truculent groveling coward ready to buy profit at any price he has robbed me of my inheritance he stands in my place he is a living lie revenge it will be retribution hugh ritson's composure was gone mr bonnithorne not easily cowed dropped his eyes before him terrible terrible he muttered again and added with more assurance but you know i have always urged you to assert your right to the inheritance hugh was striding about the room his infirm foot trailing heavily after him bonnithorne he said pausing when a woman has outraged the poor weak heart of one of the waifs whom fate flings into the gutter he sometimes throws a cup of vitriol into her face saying 'if she is not for me she is not for another' or 'where she has sinned there let her suffer' that is revenge it is the feeble device of a man who thinks in his simple soul that when beauty is gone loathing is at hand another light trill of laughter but the cup of retribution is not to be measured by the cup of vitriol mr bonnithorne fumbled his papers nervously and repeated beneath his breath terrible terrible she has wronged me bonnithorne and he has wronged me they shall marry and they shall separate and henceforward they shall walk together and yet apart a gulf dividing them from each other yet a wider gulf dividing both from the world and so on until the end and he and i and she and i are quits terrible terrible mr bonnithorne mumbled again all nature rises against it is it so then be it so said hugh the flame subsiding from his cheek and a cold smile creeping afresh about his lips your sense of justice would have been answered perhaps if i had turned this bastard adrift penniless and a beggar stopped the marriage and taken by strategy the woman i could not win by love the smile faded away that would have been better than the cup of vitriol but not much better you are a man of the world it is a terrible revenge the lawyer muttered again this time with a different intonation i repeat they shall marry no more than that said hugh i would outrage nature as little as i would shock the world the sun had crept round to where the organ stood in one corner of the room hugh's passion had gradually subsided he sidled on to the stool and began to play softly a knock came to the door and old laird fisher entered the gentleman frae crewe is down at the pit about t' engine in the smelting mill said the old man say i shall be with him in half an hour said hugh and laird fisher left the room then hugh put the papers in his pocket we have wasted too much time over the certificates they can wait where's the deed of mortgage i must have the money to pay for the new engine it is here said the lawyer and he spread a parchment on the table hugh glanced hastily over it and touched a hand bell when the maid appeared he told her to go to mr paul who was thatching in the stack yard and say he wished to see him at once then he returned to the organ and played a tender air his touch was both light and strenuous any news of his daughter said mr bonnithorne sinking his voice to a whisper whose daughter said hugh pausing and looking over his shoulder the old man's laird fisher's strangely enough yes a letter came this morning hugh ritson stopped playing and thrust his hand into an inner pocket but mr bonnithorne hastened to show that he had no desire to pry into another man's secrets pray don't trouble perhaps you'd rather not just tell me in a word how things are shaping hugh laughed a little unfolded a sheet of scented writing paper with ornamented border and began to read 'i am writing to thank you very much ' here tossing the letter to the lawyer read it for yourself then he resumed his playing mr bonnithorne fixed his nose glasses and read i am writing to thank you very much for your kind remembrance of me it was almost like having your company i live in hopes of seeing you soon when are you coming to me sometimes i think you will never never come and then i can't help crying though i try not to and i don't cry much i don't go out very often london is far away six miles there are nice people here and nice children only think when my trouble is over and you come and take me home how is poor father does he look much older does he fret for me now i wonder will he know me i am quite well only there is something the matter in my eyes sometimes when i wake up i can't see plain don't be long writing my eyes are very sore and red to day and it is oh so lonely in this strange place mrs drayton is kind to me good bye she has a son but he is always at meets that is races and i have never seen him write soon to your loving mercy the time is near hugh played on while mr bonnithorne read the lawyer when he came to the end handed the letter back with the simple comment came this morning you say it was written last tuesday nearly a week ago hugh nodded his head over his shoulder and continued to play he swayed to and fro with an easy grace to the long sweeps of the music until the door opened sharply and paul entered with a firm step then he rose picked a pen from the inkstand and dipped it in the ink paul wore a suit of rough light cloth with leggins and a fur cap which he did not remove his face was pale decision sat on every line of it excuse me mr bonnithorne if i don't shake hands he said in his deep voice i'm at work and none too clean this said hugh ritson twiddling the pen in his fingers this is the deed i spoke of yesterday you sign there pointing to a blank space in front of a little wafer then he placed one hand firmly on the upper part of the parchment as if to steady it and held out the pen paul made no approach to accepting it he stretched forward took hold of the document and lifted it casting hugh's hand aside hugh watched him closely the usual formality he said lightly nothing more paul passed his eye rapidly over the deed then he turned to the lawyer is this the fourth or fifth mortgage that has been drawn he inquired still holding the parchment before him really i can't say i presume it is the really i hardly remember mr bonnithorne's suavity of tone and customary smile broke down into silence and a look of lowering anxiety paul glanced steadfastly into his face but i remember he said with composure more embarrassing than violence it is the fifth the holme farm was first and then came goldscope hindscarth was mortgaged to the last ear of corn and then it was the turn for coledale now it's the ghyll itself i see house and buildings hugh ritson's face underwent a change but his tone was unruffled as he said if you please we will come to business then with a sinister smile you resemble the french counsel you begin every speech at the creation 'let us go on to the deluge' said the judge to the deluge said paul and he turned his head slowly to where hugh stood holding the pen in one hand and rapping the table with the knuckles of the other rather unnecessary we're already under water the passion in hugh ritson's face dropped to a look of sullen anger but he mastered his voice and said quietly the engineer from crewe is waiting for me at the pit i have wasted the whole morning over these formalities come come let us have done mr bonnithorne will witness the signature paul had not shifted his steadfast gaze from his brother's face hugh dodged his glance at first and then met it with an expression of audacity still holding the parchment before him paul said quietly to night i leave home for london and shall be absent four days can this business wait until my return no it can't said hugh with emphasis paul dropped his voice don't take that tone with me i warn you can this business wait i mean what i say it can not on my return i may have something to tell you that will affect this and the other deeds once more can it wait will you sign yes or no said hugh paul looked steady and straight into his brother's eyes you are draining away my inheritance you are at this word hugh's smoldering temper was afire your inheritance he broke out in his bitterest tones it is late in the day to talk of that your inheritance but he stopped the expression of audacity gave place to a look of blank bewilderment paul had torn the parchment from top to bottom and flung it on the table and in an instant was walking out of the room chapter iv paul ritson returned to the stack yard and worked vigorously three hours longer a stack had been stripped by a recent storm and he thatched it afresh with the help of a laborer and a boy then he stepped indoors changed his clothes and filled a traveling bag when this was done he went in search of the stableman natt was in his stable whistling as he polished his harness bring the trap round to the front at seven he said and put my bag in at the back you'll find it in the hall by this time the night had closed in and the young moon showed faintly over the head of hindscarth the wind was rising paul returned to the house ate drank and smoked then he rose and walked upstairs and knocked at the door of his mother's room mrs ritson was alone a lamp burned on the table and cast a sharp white light on her face the face was worn and very pale lines were plowed deep on it she was kneeling but she rose as paul entered he bent his head and kissed her forehead there was a book before her a rosary was in her hand the room was without fire it was chill and cheerless and only sparsely furnished sheep skin rugs on the floor texts on the walls a carved oak clothes chest in one corner two square high backed chairs and a small table a bed and no more i'm going off mother said paul the train leaves in an hour when do you return said mrs ritson let me see this is saturday i shall be back on wednesday evening god be with you she said in a fervent voice mother i spoke to greta last night and she promised we shall soon be free of this tyranny already the first link of the chain is broken he called me into his room this morning to sign a mortgage on the ghyll and i refused and yet you are about to go away and leave everything in his hands mrs ritson sat down and paul put his hand tenderly on her head better that than to have it wrested from me inch by inch to hold the shadow of an inheritance while he grasps the substance he knows all his dark hints are not needed to tell me that yet he is silent said mrs ritson and her eyes fell on to her book and surely it is for my sake that he is so if in truth he knows all is he not my son and is not my honor his honor paul shook his head if the honor of twenty mothers as true and dear as you were the stepping stones to his interest over those stones he would go no no it is not honor whether yours or his that keeps him silent mrs ritson glanced up are you not too hard on him he is guiltless in the eye of the world and that at least should plead for him forgive him do not leave your brother in anger i have nothing to forgive said paul even if he knew nothing i should still go away and leave everything i could not live any longer under the shadow of this secret bound by an oath i would go as i go now with sealed lips but a free heart he should have his own before man and i mine before god mrs ritson sat in silence her lips trembled perceptibly and her eyelids quivered i shall soon leave you my dear son she said in a tremulous voice nay nay you shall not he answered in an altered tone half of raillery half of tenderness you are coming with us with greta and me and over there the roses will bloom again in your white cheeks mrs ritson shook her head i shall soon leave you dearest she repeated and told her beads he tried to dispel her sadness he laughed and she smiled feebly he patted her head playfully but she came back to the same words i shall soon leave you the moon was shining at the full when he lifted his hat to go it was sailing through a sky of fibrous cloud the wind was high and rattled the empty boughs of the tree against the window keen frost was in the air i shall see my father's old friend in london on monday and be back on wednesday good bye keep a good heart good bye she wept on his breast and clung to him good bye good bye he repeated and triad to disengage himself from her embrace but she clung closer it was as if she was to see him no more good bye she sobbed and with the tears in his own eyes he laughed at her idle fears ha ha ha one would think i was going for life ha ha there was a scream on the frosty air without his laugh died on his lips what was that he said and drew a sharp breath she lifted her face whiter now than ever and with tearless eyes it was the cry of the bird that foretells death she said in a whisper he laughed a little boisterously nay nay you will be well and happy yet then he broke away natt was sitting in the trap and it was drawn up in the court yard to the door he was looking through the darkness at some object in the distance and when paul came up he was not at first conscious of his master's presence what were you looking at natt said paul pulling on his gloves i war wond'rin' whether lang dick o' the syke had kindled a fire to night or whether yon lowe on the side of the causey were frae the new smelting house paul glanced over the horse's head a deep glow stood out against the fell all around was darkness the smelting house i should say said paul and jumped to his seat beside natt by one of the lamps that the trap carried he looked at his watch a quarter past seven it will be smart driving but you can give the mare her own time coming back then he took the reins and in another moment they were gone chapter v at eight o'clock that night the sky was brilliantly lighted up and the sound of many voices was borne on the night wind the red flare came from the syke the mill was afire showers of sparks and sheets of flame were leaping and streaming into the sky men and women were hurrying to and fro and the women's shrill cries mingled with the men's shouts at intervals the brightness of the glare faded and then a column of choking smoke poured out and was borne away on the wind dick the miller was there with the scorching heat reddening his wrathful face john proudfoot had raised a ladder against the mill and hatchet in hand was going to cut away the cross trees but the heat drove him back the sharp snap of the flames told of timbers being ripped away no use it's gone said the blacksmith dragging the ladder behind him i telt them afore what their damned smelting house would do for me said the miller striding about in his impotent rage parson christian was standing by the gate on the windward side of the mill yard with laird fisher beside him looking on in silence at the leaping flames the wind is from the south he said and a spark of the hot refuse shot down the bank has been blown into the mill the mill was a wooden structure and the fire held it like a serpent in its grip people were coming and going from the darkness into the red glare and out of the glare into the darkness among them was one stalwart figure that none noticed in the general confusion have you a tarpaulin said this man addressing those about him there's a big one on the stack at coledale answered another run for it it's of no use damme run for it the tone of authority was not to be ignored in three minutes a huge tarpaulin was being dragged behind a dozen men lay hold of the ropes and let us dip it into the river shouted the same voice above the prevailing clangor it was done dripping wet the tarpaulin was pulled into the mill yard where's your ladder quick the ladder was raised against the scorching wooden walls be ready to throw me the ropes shouted the deep voice a firm step was set on the lowest rung there was a crackle of glass and then a cloud of smoke streamed out of a broken window for an instant the bright glare was obscured but it burst forth afresh and leaped with great white tongues into the sky the sheets are caught shouted the miller they were flying around with the wind a line of flame seemed to be pursuing them who's the man on the ladder dusta know cried john proudfoot i dunnot answered the miller at that instant hugh ritson came up the smoke was gone and now a dark figure could be dimly seen high up on the mill side he seized the cross trees with both hands and swung himself on to the raking roof now for the ropes he shouted the flames burst out again and illumined the whole sky the dark mass of the fells could be seen far overhead and the waters of the river in the bed of the valley glowed like amber the stalwart figure stood out in the white light against the red glare holding on to the cross trees on the top of the mill and with a wheel of crackling fire careering beside him there could be no doubt of his identity with the light on his strong face and tawny hair it's paul ritson shouted many a voice damme the ropes quick the ropes were thrown and caught and thrown again to the other side then the dripping tarpaulin was drawn over the mill until it covered the top and half the sides the wheel burned out and the iron axle came to the ground with a plunge the fire was conquered the night sky grew black the night wind became voiceless then the busy throng had time for talk where's paul asked parson christian ay where is he said the miller he's a stunner for sure where is he said the blacksmith none knew when the flames began to fade he was missed he had gone none knew where nine o'clock said parson christian turning his face toward home sharp work while it lasted my lads then there was the sound of wheels and natt drove his trap to the gate of the mill yard you've just missed it natt said john proudfoot where have you been driving the master to the train hugh ritson was standing by every one glanced from him to natt the train master what do you mean who who why master paul said natt with a curl of the lip i reckon it could scarce be master hugh when what train said parson christian the eight o'clock to london eight o'clock london don't i speak plain and has he gone i's warrant he's gone consternation sat on every face but natt's chapter vi next day was sunday and after morning service a group of men gathered about the church porch to discuss the events of the night before in the evening the parlor of the flying horse was full of dalespeople and many a sapient theory was then and there put forth to account for the extraordinary coincidence of the presence of paul ritson at the fire and his alleged departure by the london train hugh ritson was not seen abroad that day but early on monday morning he hastened to the stable called on natt to saddle a horse sprung on its back and galloped away toward the town the morning was bitterly cold and the rider was buttoned up to the throat the air was damp a dense veil of vapor lay on the valley and hid half the fells the wintery dawn with its sunless sky had not the strength to rend it asunder the wind had veered to the north and was now dank and icy a snow storm was coming the face of hugh ritson was wan and jaded he leaned heavily forward in the saddle the biting wind was in his eyes he had a fixed look and seemed not to see the people whom he passed on the road dick o' the syke was grubbing among the fallen wreck of the charred and dismantled mill when hugh rode past him he lifted his eyes and muttered an oath beneath his breath old laird fisher was trundling a wheelbarrow on the bank of the smelting house the headgear of the pit shaft was working as hugh passed the smithy john proudfoot was standing hammer in hand by the side of a wheelless wagon upheld by poles john was saying wonder what sec a place mister paul slept a' saturday neet i reckon that wad settle all and a voice from inside the smithy answered nowt of the sort john it's a fate i tell tha the peddler's pony was standing by the hasp of the gate never once lifting his eyes with head bent and compressed lips hugh ritson rode on in the teeth of the coming storm there was another storm within that was uprooting every emotion of his soul when he came to the vicarage he drew up sharply and rapped heavily on the gate brother peter came shambling out at the speed of six steps a minute mr christian at home asked hugh don't know as he is said peter where is he don't know as i've heard tell him i'll call as i come back in two hours don't know as i'll see him then go and look for him shouted hugh impatiently bringing down the whip on the flank of the horse brother peter ward turned about sulkily don't know as i will he grumbled and trudged back into the house then hugh ritson rode on a thin sleet began to fall and it drove hard into his face the roads were crisp and the horse sometimes stumbled but the rider pressed on in less than half an hour he was riding into the town the people who were standing in groups in the market place parted and made space for him they hailed him with respectful salutations he responded curtly or not at all notwithstanding his long ride his face was still pale and his lips were bloodless he stopped at the court yard leading to the front of the pack horse old willie calvert the innkeeper stood there and touched his cap when hugh approached him my brother paul slept here a few nights ago i hear said hugh so he did said the innkeeper what night was it what night let me see it were a week come wednesday did you see him yourself nay i were lang abed who did mistress calvert ey she did for sure janet calling up the court she'll tell ye all the ins and oots a comfortable looking elderly body in a white cap and print apron came to the door you saw my brother paul you know when he slept at your house last wednesday night yes surely said janet what did he say nay nowt it was verra late maybe twelve o'clock and i was bolting up and had the cannel in my hand to get me to bed and a rap came and when i opened the door who should it be but mister paul he said he wanted a bed but he seem't to be in the doldrums and noways keen for a crack so i ax't na questions but just took him to the little green room over the snug and bid him good night and next morning did you see him then said hugh no but a morning when he paid for his bed for he had nowther bite nor sup in the house did he look changed anything different about him nay nowt but in low feckle someways and maybe summat different dressed how different what did he wear that night pale as hugh ritson's face had been before it was now white as a face in moonlight maybe a pepper and salt tweed coat but i can't rightly call to mind at the minute hugh's great eyes stared out of his head his tongue cleaved to his mouth and for the moment denied him speech thank you mistress calvert here willie my man drink my health with the missis so saying he tossed a silver coin to the innkeeper wheeled about and rode off i can not mak' nowther head nor tail o' this said the old man of what the brass said janet nay but that's soond enough for sure auld lass then just thoo leave other folks's business to theirselves and come thy ways in with thee thoo wert allus thrang a meddlin' the innkeeper had gone indoors and drawn himself a draught of ale i allus like to see the ins and oots o' things he observed with a twinkle in his eye and the pot to his mouth mind as you're not ower keen at seein' the ins and oots o' that pewter i'll be keerful auld lass hugh ritson's horse went clattering over the stones of the streets until it came to the house of mr bonnithorne then hugh drew up sharply jumped from the saddle tied the reins to the loop in the gate pier and rang the bell in another minute he was standing in the breakfast room which was made comfortable by a glowing fire mr bonnithorne in dressing gown and slippers rose from his easy chair with a look of surprise did you hear of the fire at the mill on saturday night asked hugh in a faltering voice mr bonnithorne nodded his head very unlucky very said the lawyer the man will want recompense and the law will support him tut a bagatelle said hugh with a gesture of impatience of course if you say so you've heard nothing about paul mr bonnithorne answered with a shake of his yellow head and a look of inquiry then hugh told him of the man at the fire and of natt's story when he drove up in the trap he spoke with visible embarrassment and in a voice that could scarcely support itself but the deep fear that had come over him had not yet taken hold of the lawyer mr bonnithorne listened with a bland smile of amused incredulity hugh stopped with a shudder what are you thinking he asked nervously that natt lied as well say that the people at the fire lied no you yourself saw paul there bonnithorne like all keen eyed men you are short sighted i have something more to tell you the people at the pack horse say that paul slept at their house last wednesday night now i know that he slept at home mr bonnithorne smiled again a mistake as to the night he said what can be plainer don't wriggle look the facts in the face facts a coincidence in evidence a common error would to god it were hugh strode about the room in obvious perturbation his eyes bent on the ground bonnithorne what is the place where the girl mercy lives an inn at hendon do they call it the hawk and heron they do the old woman drayton keeps it hugh ritson's step faltered he listened with a look of stupid consternation did i never tell you that the peddler oglethorpe said he saw paul at the hawk and heron in hendon mr bonnithorne dropped back into his seat without a word conviction was taking hold of him what do the folks say he asked at length say that it was a ghost a wraith twenty things the idiots what do you say mr ritson that it was another man the lawyer remained sitting his eyes fixed and vacant what then what if it is another man resemblances are common we are all brothers for example there are numbers of persons like myself in the world odd isn't it very said hugh with a hard laugh and what if there exists a man resembling your half brother paul so closely that on three several occasions he has been mistaken for him by competent witnesses what does it come to hugh paused come to god knows i want to find out who is this man what is he where does he come from what is his business here why of all places on this wide earth does he of all men alive haunt my house like a shadow hugh ritson was still visibly perturbed there's more in this matter than either of us knows he said mr bonnithorne watched him for a moment in silence i think you draw a painful inference what is it he asked what repeated hugh and added absently who can tell up and down the room he walked restlessly his eyes bent on the floor his face drawn down into lines at length he stood and picked up the hat he had thrown on the couch bonnithorne he said you and i thought we saw into the heart of a mystery heaven pity us for blind moles i fear we saw nothing why what how so when mr bonnithorne stammered and then stopped short hugh had walked out of the room and out of the house he leaped into the saddle and rode away the wind had risen yet higher it blew an icy blast from behind him as he cantered home through the hazy atmosphere a cloud of dun vaporish red could be seen trailing over the dim fells it poised above the ball crown of the eel crags like a huge supernatural bird with outstretched wings hugh held the reins with half frozen hands he barely felt the biting cold his soul was in a tumult and he was driven on by fears that were all but insupportable for months a thick veil had overspread his conscience and now in an instant and by an accident it was being rent asunder he had lulled his soul to sleep but no opiate of sophistry could keep the soul from waking his soul was waking now he began to suspect that he had been acting like a scoundrel at the vicarage he stopped dismounted and entered standing in the hall he overheard voices in the kitchen they were those of brother peter and little jacob berry the tailor who had been hired to sew by the day and was seated on the dresser i've heard of such sights afore the little tailor was saying when auld mother langdale's son was killed at wrustlin' down borrowdale way and mother langdale was abed with rheumatis she saw him come to the bed head a dripping wet with blood as plain as plain could be and in less nor an hour after they brought him home to the auld body on a shutter they did for sure shaf on sec stories i don't know as some folks aren't as daft as mother langdale herself peter muttered in reply hugh ritson beat the door heavily with his riding whip parson christian at home now he asked when peter opened it been and gone said peter did you tell him i meant to come back don't know as i did hugh's whip came down impatiently on his leggins do you know anything he asked do you know that you are now talking to a gentleman don't know as i do mumbled peter backing in again if miss greta is at home tell her i should be glad to speak with her do you hear peter disappeared hugh was left alone in the hall he waited some minutes thinking that peter was carrying his message presently he overheard that worthy reopening the discussion on mother langdale's sanity with little jacob in the kitchen the deep damnation he desired just then for brother peter was about to be indicated by another lusty rap on the kitchen door when the door of the parlor opened and greta herself stood on the threshold with a smile and an outstretched hand i thought it was your voice she said and led the way in your cordial welcome heaps coals of fire on my head greta i cannot forget in what spirit we last talked and parted let us think no more about it said greta and she drew a chair for him to the fire he remained standing and as if benumbed by strong feeling i have come to speak of it to ask pardon for it i was in the wrong he said falteringly she did not respond but sat down with drooping eyes he paused and there was an ominous silence you don't know what i suffered or what i suffer still you are very happy i am a miserable man greta do you know what it is to love without being loved how can you know it is torture beyond the gift of words misery beyond the relief of tears it is not jealousy that is no more than a vulgar kind of envy it is a nameless measureless torment he paused again she did not speak his voice grew tremulous i'm not one of the fools who think that the souls that are created for each other must needs come together that destiny draws them from the uttermost parts of the earth that trifle as they will with their best hopes fate is stronger than they are and true to the pole star of ultimate happiness i know the world too well to believe nonsense like that i know that every day every hour men and women are casting themselves away men on the wrong women women on the wrong men and that all this is a tangle that will never never be undone he stepped up to where she sat and dropped his voice to a whisper greta permit me to say it i loved you dearly would to heaven i had not my love was not of yesterday it was you and i i and you that was the only true marriage possible to either of us from world's end to world's end but paul came between us and when i saw you give yourself to the wrong man greta had risen to her feet you say you come to ask pardon for what you said but you really come to repeat it so saying she made a show of leaving the room hugh stood awhile in silence then he threw off his faltering tone and drew himself up i have come he said to warn you before it is too late i have come to say while it is yet time never marry my brother for as sure as god is above us you will repent it with unquenchable tears if you do greta's eyes flashed with an expression of disdain no she said you have come to threaten me a sure sign that you yourself have some secret cause for fear it was a home thrust and hugh was hit greta i repeat it you are marrying the wrong man what right have you to say so the right of one who could part you forever with a word greta was sore perplexed like a true woman she would have given half her fortune at that moment to probe this mystery but her indignation got the better of her curiosity it is false she said it is true he answered i could speak the word that would part you wider than the poles asunder then i challenge you to speak it she exclaimed they faced each other pale and with quivering lips it is not my purpose i have warned you he said you do not believe your own warning she answered he winced but said not a word you have come to me with an idle threat and fear is written on your own face he drew his breath sharply and did not reply whatever it is you do not believe it he was making for the door he came back a step shall i speak the word he said can you bear it leave me she said and carry your falsehood with you he was gone in an instant then her anger cooled directly and her woman's curiosity came back with a hundred fold rebound gracious heaven what did he mean she thought and the hot flush mounted to her eyes she had half a mind to call him back could it be true the tears were now rolling down her cheeks he has a secret power over paul what is it she ran to the door hugh hugh he was gone the galloping feet of his horse were heard faint in the distance she went back into the house and sat down and wept galling tears of pride and vexation chapter vii at midday parson christian came home from the fields to dinner i've been away leading turf he said from cole moss for robin atkinson to pay him for loaning me his gray mare on saturday when i fetched my grain to the mill happen most of it is burned up though but that's no fault of robin's so now we neither owe t'other anything and we're straight from the beginning of the world greta was bustling about with the very efficient hindrance of brother peter's assistance to get the dinner on the table she smiled and sometimes tossed her fair head mighty jauntily and laughed out loud with a touch of rattling gayety but there were rims of red around her bleared eyes and her voice beneath all its noisy merriment had a tearful lilt the parson observed this but said nothing about it coming round by harras end i met john lowthwaite he said and john would have me go into his house and return thanks for his wife's recovery from childbed so i went in and warmed me and drank a pot of ale with them and assisted the wife and family to return praise to god dinner was laid little jacob berry came in from the kitchen and all sat down together parson christian and greta brother peter and the tailor hired to sew dear me i'm jack of all trades greta my lass said the parson after grace old jonathan truesdale came running after me at the bridge to say that mistress truesdale wanted me to go and taste the medicine that the doctor sent her from keswick and see if it hadn't opium in it because it made her sleep i sent word that i had business to take me the other way but would send miss greta if she would go jonathan said his missus would be very thankful for she was lonesome at whiles i'll go and welcome said greta the rims about her eyes were growing deeper the parson chattered on to banish the tempest of tears that he saw was coming well peter and how did the brethren at the meeting house like the discourse yesterday afternoon don't know as they thought you were varra soond on the point of 'lection muttered peter from the inside of his bowl of soup well you're right homely folk down there and i'd have no fault to find if you were not a little too disputatious what's the use of wrangling over doctrine right or wrong it will matter very little to any of us in a hundred years we're on our way to heaven and please god there'll be no doctrine there greta could not eat she had no appetite for food another appetite the appetite of curiosity was eating at her heart she laid down her knife the parson could hide his concern no longer dear me my lass you and that braw lad of yours are like david and jonathan and with a stern wag of his white head i'm not so sure that i won't turn myself into saul and fling my javelin at him for envy the parson certainly did not look too revengeful at that moment with the mist gathering in his eyes talking of saul said little jacob there's that story of the witch of endor and saul seein' sam'el when he was dead i reckon as that's no'but another version of what happened at the fire a' saturday neet parson christian glanced furtively at greta's drooping head and then meeting the tailor's eye he put his finger to his lips when dinner was over the parson lifted from the shelf the huge tome made to view his life and actions in he drew his chair to the fire and began to turn over the earliest leaves greta had thrown on her cloak and was fixing her hat i'm going to see poor mrs truesdale she said then coming behind the old man and glancing over his shoulder at the book on his knees what are you looking for she asked and smiled a prescription for envy the parson shook his old head gravely you must know i met young mr ritson this morning hugh yes he was riding home from his iron pits but stopped and asked me if i could tell him when his father who is dead and gone poor fellow came first to these parts and how old his brother paul might be at that time why did he ask said greta eagerly nay i scarce can say i told him i could not tell without looking at my book let me see it must be a matter of seven and twenty years ago how old is your sweetheart greta paul is twenty eight and this is the year seventy five twenty eight from seventy five that's forty seven paul was a wee toddle i remember i'll look for forty seven eighteen forty four forty five forty six here it is forty seven and bless me the very page look here we have it then the parson read this entry in his diary 'nov th being promised to preach at john skerton's church at ravenglass i got ready to go thither i took my mare and set forward and went direct to thomas storsacre's where i was to lodge it rained sore all the day and i was wet and took off my coat and let it run an hour then we supped and sat discoursing by the fire till near ten o'clock of one thing and another and among the rest of one allan ritson who had newly settled at ravenglass thomas said allan was fresh from scotland being scottish born and that his wife was irish and that they had a child called paul only a few months old and not yet walking' the very thing wait here's something more 'nov th lord's day went to church and many people came to worship parson skerton read the prayers and thomas storsacre the lessons i prayed and preached from matt vii then ceased and dismissed the people after service thomas brought his new neighbor allan ritson who asked me to visit him that day and dine so i went with him and saw his wife and child an infant in arms mrs ritson is a woman of some education and much piety her husband is a rough blunt dalesman of the good old type' the very thing the parson repeated and he put a pipe spill in the page i wonder why he wants it said greta she left parson christian still looking at his book and went out on her errand she was more than an hour gone and when she returned the winter's day had all but closed in only a little yellow light still lingered in the sky greta they have sent for you from the ghyll said the parson as she entered mrs ritson wants to see you to night natt the stableman came with the trap but he has gone again i will follow him at once said greta nay my lass the day is not young enough said the parson i was never afraid of the dark said greta she took down a lantern and lighted it drew her cloak more closely about her and prepared to go then take this paper to young mr hugh it's a copy of what is written in my book greta hesitated but she could not tell parson christian what had passed between hugh and herself she took the paper and hastened away the parson sat for a while before the fire then he rose walked to the door and opened it heaven bless the girl it's snowing what a night for the child to be abroad he returned in disturbed humor to the fireside chapter viii when greta set out the atmosphere was yellow and vaporish the sky grew rapidly darker as she reached the village thin flakes of snow began to fall she could feel them driven by the wind against her face and when she came by the inn she could see them in the dull yellow light the laborers were leaving the fields and with their breakfast cans swung on their fork handles they were drifting in twos and threes into the flying horse it looked warm and snug within she passed the little cluster of old houses and scarcely saw them in the deepening night as she went by the mill she could just descry its ruined roof standing out like a dark pyramid against the dun sky the snow fell faster it was now lying thick on her cloak in front and on the windward face of the lantern in her hand the road was heavier than before and she had still fully a quarter of a mile to go she hastened on passing the little church parson christian's church she met job sheepshanks the letter cutter coming out of the shed in the church yard bad night for a young lady to be from home begging your pardon miss said job and went on toward the village his bunch of chisels clanking over his shoulder the wind soughed in the leafless trees that grew around the old roofless barn at the corner of the road that led to the fells the gurgle of a half frozen waterfall came from the distant ghyll save for these sounds and the dull thud of greta's step on the snow covered road all around was still how fast the snow fell now yet greta heeded it not at all her mind was busy with many thoughts she was thinking of paul as parson christian's great book had pictured him paul as a child a little darling babe not yet able to walk could it be possible that paul her paul had once been that of course to think like this was foolishness every one must have been young at some time only it seemed so strange it was a sort of mystery then she thought of paul the man paul as he had been gay and heartsome paul as he was harassed by many cares she thought of her love for him of his love for her of how they were soon very soon to join hands and face the unknown future in an unknown land she had promised yes and she would go she thought of paul in london and how soon he would be back in newlands this was monday and paul had promised to come home on wednesday only two days more yet how long it would be after all greta had reached the lonnin that went up to the ghyll she would soon be there how thick the trees were in the lane they shut out the last glimmer of light from the sky the lantern burned yellow amidst the snow that lay on it like a crust then greta thought of mrs ritson it was strange that paul's mother had sent for her they were friends but there had never been much intimacy between them mrs ritson was a grave and earnest woman a saintly soul and greta's lightsome spirit had always felt rebuked in her presence paul loved his mother and she herself must needs love as well as reverence the mother of paul it was paul first and paul last paul was the center of her world she was a woman and love was her whole existence here in the lonnin she was in pitch darkness she stumbled once into the dike then laughed and went on again at one moment she thought she heard a noise not far away she stood and listened no it was nothing only a hundred yards more bravely then by a swift rebound she knew not why her mind went back to the events of the morning she thought of hugh ritson and his mysterious threat what did he mean what harm could he do them oh that she had been calmer and asked her heart fluttered it flashed upon her that perhaps it was he and not his mother who had sent for her to night her pulse quickened at that instant the curlew shot over her head with its deep mournful cry at the same moment she heard a step approaching her it came on quickly she stopped who is it she asked there was no answer the sound of the footstep ceased who are you she called again then with heavy thuds in the darkness and on the snow some one approached she trembled from head to foot but advanced a step and stopped again the footstep was passing her she brought the light of the lantern full on the retreating figure it was the figure of a man going by hastily he turned his head over his shoulder and she saw his face it was the face of paul colorless agitated with flashing eyes every drop of greta's blood stood still paul she cried thrilled and immovable there was an instant of unconsciousness the earth reeled beneath her when she came to herself she was standing alone in the lane the lantern half buried in the snow at her feet had it been all a dream she was but twenty yards from the house the door of the porch stood open chilled with fear to the heart's core she rushed in no one was in the hall not a sound but the faint mutter of voices in the kitchen she ran through the passage and threw open the kitchen door the farm laborers were at supper chatting laughing eating smoking didn't you hear somebody in the house she cried the men got up and turned about there was dead silence in a moment when now no what body she flew off without waiting to explain the kitchen was too far away hugh ritson's room opened from the first landing of the stairs the stairs went up almost from the porch darting up she threw open the door of hugh's room hugh was sitting at the table examining papers by a lamp have you seen paul she cried in an agonized whisper and with a panic stricken look hugh dropped the papers and rose stiffly to his feet great god where here this moment their eyes met he did not answer he was very pale had she dreamed she looked down at the snow crusted lantern in her hand it must have been all a dream she stepped back on to the landing and stood in silence the serving people had come out of the kitchen and huddled together they looked at her in amazement then a low moan reached her ear she ran to mrs ritson's room the door to it stood wide open a fire burned in the grate a candle on the table outstretched on the floor lay the mother of paul cold still and insensible when mrs ritson regained consciousness she looked about with the empty gaze of one who is bending bewildered eyes on vacancy greta was kneeling beside her and she helped to lift her into the bed mrs ritson did not speak but she grasped greta's hand with a nervous twitch when the girl whispered something in her ear from time to time she trembled visibly and glanced with a startled look toward the door but not a word did she utter thus hour after hour wore on and the night was growing apace a painful silence brooded over the house only in the kitchen was any voice raised above a whisper there the servants quaked and clucked every tongue among them let loose in conjecture and the accents of surprise hugh ritson passed again and again from his own room to his mother's he looked down from time to time at the weary pale and quiet face but he said little he put no questions greta sat beside the bed only less weary only less pale and quiet only less disturbed by horrible imaginings than the sufferer who lay upon it toward midnight hugh came to say that peter had been sent for her from the vicarage greta rose put on her cloak and hat kissed the silent lips and followed hugh out of the room as they passed down the stairs greta stopped at the door of hugh ritson's room and beckoned him to enter it with her they went in together and she closed the door now tell me she said what this means hugh's face was very pale his eyes had a wandering look and when he spoke his voice was muffled but by an effort of his unquenchable energy he shook off this show of concern it means he said that you have been the victim of a delusion greta's pale face flushed and your mother has she also been the victim of a delusion hugh shrugged his shoulders showed his teeth slightly but made no reply answer me tell me the truth be frank for once tell me can you explain this mystery if i could explain it how would it be a mystery greta felt the blood tingle to her finger tips do you believe i have told you the truth she asked i am sure you have do you believe i saw paul in the lane i am sure you think you saw him do you know for certain that he went away hugh nodded his head are you sure he has not got back quite sure in short you think what i saw was merely the result of woman's hysteria hugh smiled through his white lips and his staring eyes assumed a momentary look of amused composure he stepped to the table and fumbled some papers this reminded greta of the paper the parson had asked her to deliver i ought to have given you this before she said mr christian sent it he took it without much apparent interest put it on the table unread and went to the door with greta the trap was standing in the court yard with natt in the driver's seat and brother peter in the seat behind the snow had ceased to fall but it lay several inches deep on the ground there was the snow's dumb silence on the earth and in the air hugh helped greta to her place and then lifted the lamp from the trap and looked on the ground a few yards ahead of the horse there are no footprints in the snow he said with a poor pretence at a smile none at least that go from the house greta herself had begun to doubt she lacked presence of mind to ask if there were any footprints at all except peter's the thing was done and gone it all happened three hours ago and it was easy to suspect the evidence of the senses hugh returned the lamp to its loop did you scream he asked when you saw when you saw it greta was beginning to feel ashamed i might have done i can not positively say ah that explains everything no doubt mother heard you and was frightened i see it all now natt drive on cold journey good night greta felt her face burn in the darkness before she had time or impulse to reply they were rolling away toward home at intervals her ear caught the sound of suppressed titters from the driver's seat natt was chuckling to himself with great apparent satisfaction since the fire at the mill he had been putting two and two together and he was now perfectly confident as to the accuracy of his computation when folks said that paul had been at the fire he laughed derisively because he knew that an hour before he had left him at the station but an idea works in a brain like natt's pretty much as the hop ferments when it goes to the bottom it leaves froth and bubbles at the top natt knew that there was some grave quarrel between the brothers he also knew that there were two ways to the station and two ways back to newlands one through the town the other under latrigg mr paul might have his own reasons for pretending to go to london and also his own reasons for not going natt had left him stepping into the station at the town entrance but what was to prevent him from going out again at the entrance from latrigg of course that was what he had done and he had never been out of the county deary me how blind folks were to be sure thus natt's wise head chuckled and clucked at one moment natt twisted his sapient and facetious noddle over his shoulder to where brother peter sat huddled into a hump and in gloomy silence mercy me peter he cried in an affrighted whisper and with a mighty tragical start and is that thee dusta know i thowt it were thy ghost don't know as it's not dragging a body frae bed a cold neet like this mumbled peter numbed up to his tongue but still warm enough there chapter ix hugh ritson was content that greta should think she had been the victim of a delusion he was not unwilling that she should be tortured by suggestions of the supernatural if she concluded that paul had deceived her as to his departure from newlands he would not be unlikely to foster the delusion the one thing of all others which hugh ritson was anxious to prevent was that greta should be led to draw the purely matter of fact inference that when she thought she saw paul she had really seen another man but that was his own conviction he was now sure beyond the hope of doubt that there was a man alive who resembled paul ritson so closely that he had thrice before and now once again been mistaken for him by unsuspecting persons that other man was to be the living power in his own life in his brother's life in his mother's life in greta's life who was he left alone in the court yard when the trap drove away hugh ritson shuddered and looked round he had laughed with the easy grace of a man no longer puzzled as he bid greta good night but suspense was gnawing at his heart he returned hastily to his room sat down at the table picked up the paper which parson christian had sent him and read it with eager eyes he read it and reread it he seemed to devour it line by line word by word when he would have set it down his fingers so trembled that he let it fall and he rose from his chair with rigid limbs what he had dreaded he now knew for certainty he had stumbled into an empty grave he opened a drawer and took out three copies of certificates that mr bonnithorne had brought him selecting the earliest of these in order of date he set it side by side with the copy of the extract from parson christian's diary by the one paul the son of grace ormerod by her husband robert lowther was born august by the other paul the reputed son of grace ormerod by her husband allan ritson was an infant still in arms on november paul ritson could not be paul lowther paul ritson could not be the half brother of greta lowther hugh ritson fell back as one who had been dealt a blow for months he had been idly hatching an addled villainy the revenge that he had promised himself for spurned and outraged love the revenge that he had named retribution was but an impotent mockery for an hour he strode up and down the room with flushed face and limbs that shook beneath him natt came home from the vicarage put in his horse and turned into the kitchen now long deserted for the night he heard the restless footstep backward and forward and began to wonder if anything further had gone wrong at last he ventured upstairs opened noiselessly the door and found his master with a face aflame and a look of frenzy but the curious young rascal with the sleepy eyes had not time to proffer his disinterested services before he was hunted out with an oath he returned to the kitchen with a settled conviction that somewhere in that mysterious chamber his master kept a capacious cupboard for strong drink like master like man natt brewed himself an ample pint of hot ale pulled off his great boots and drew up to warm himself before the remains of a huge fire hugh ritson's bedroom opened off his sitting room he went to bed he tried to sleep but no sleep came near him he tossed about for an hour rose walked the room again then went to bed once more he was feeling the first pangs of honest remorse a worse man would have accommodated himself more speedily to the altered conditions when he found that he had pursued a phantasm to do this erring man justice he writhed under it a better man would have fled from it if at the outset if when the first step in the descent had been taken he had seen clearly that villainy lay that way he would not have gone further but now he had gone too far to go on were as easy as to go back and go on he must while he honestly believed that greta was half sister to the man known to the world as paul ritson and his brother he could have stood aside and witnessed without flinching the ceremony that was to hold them forever together and apart then without remorse he could have come down and separated them and seen that woman die of heart's hunger who had starved to death the great love he bore her there would have been a stern retribution in that and the voice of nature would have whispered him that he did well but when it was no longer possible to believe that greta and paul were anything to each other the power of sophistry collapsed and retribution sunk to revenge he might go on but there could be no self deception the blind earthworms of malice might delude themselves if they liked but he could see and he must face the truth if ever he did what he had proposed to do then he was a scoundrel and a conscious scoundrel hugh ritson leaped out of his bed the perspiration rolled in big beads from his forehead his tongue grew thick and stiff in his mouth the great veins in his neck swelled without knowing whither he went he walked out of his own into his mother's room a candle still burned on the table the fire had smoldered out a servant maid sat by the bedside with head aslant sleeping the innocent sleep he approached the bed his mother was breathing softly she had fallen into a doze the pale face was very quiet the weary look of the worn cheeks was smoothed out the absent eyes were lightly closed closed too on the rough world was the poor soul that was vexed by it hugh ritson was touched somewhere deep down in that frozen nature the angel of love troubled the still waters bending his head he would have touched the cold forehead with his feverish lips but he drew back no no no tenderness was not for him the good god gave it to some as manna from heaven but here and there a man stretched on the rack of life had not the drop of water that would cool his tongue with stealthy steps as of one who had violated the chamber of chastity hugh ritson crept back to his own room he took brandy from a cupboard and drank a glass of it then he lay down and composed himself afresh to sleep thoughts of greta came back to him even his love for her was without tenderness it was a fiery passion it made him weep nevertheless galling tears hot bitter smarting tears rolled from his eyes and down in that deep and hidden well of feeling where he too was a man like other men hugh ritson's strong heart bled he would have thought that love like his must have subdued the whole world to its will that when a woman could reject it the very stones must cry out pshaw would sleep never come he leaped up and laughed mockingly drank another glass of brandy and laughed again his door was open and the hollow voice echoed through the house he put on a dressing gown took his lamp in his hand and walked down stairs and into the hall the wind had risen it moaned around the house then licked it with hissing tongues hugh ritson walked to the ingle where no fire burned there he stood scarcely knowing why the lamp in his hand cast its reflection into the mirror on the wall behind it was a flushed face haggard with hollow eyes and parted lips the sight recalled another scene he stepped into the little room at the back it was in that room his father died now it was empty a bare mattress a chair a table no more hugh ritson lifted the lamp above his head and looked down he was enacting the whole terrible tragedy afresh he crept noiselessly to the door opened it slightly and looked cautiously out then leaving it ajar he stood behind it with bent head and inclining ear his face wore a ghastly smile the wind soughed and wept without hugh ritson threw the door open and stepped back into the hall there he stood some minutes with eyes riveted on one spot then he hurried away to his room as he went up the stairs he laughed again back at his bedside he poured himself another glass of brandy and once more lay down to sleep he certainly slept this time and his sleep was deep natt's dreamy ear heard a voice in the hall he had drunk his hot ale and from the same potent cause as his master he also had slept but with somewhat less struggle awakened in his chair by the unaccustomed sound he stole on tiptoe to the kitchen door he was in time to see from behind the figure of a man ascending the stairs carrying a lamp before him natt's eyes were a shade hazy at the moment but he was cock sure of what he saw of course it was mister paul sneaking off to bed after more straitforrad folk had got into their nightcaps and their second sleep that was where natt soon put himself when all was still in that troubled house the moon's white face peered through a rack of flying cloud and looked in at the dark windows chapter x next morning tuesday morning hugh ritson found this letter on his table dearest i do not know what is happening to me but my eyes get worse and worse to day and yesterday i have not opened them oh dear i think i am losing my sight and i have had such a fearful fright the day after i wrote to you mrs drayton's son came home and i saw him oh i thought it was your brother paul and his name is paul too but i think now it must be my eyes they were very bad and perhaps i did not see plain he asked me questions and went away next morning do not be long writing i am oh so very lonely when are you coming to me write soon your loving mercy hugh ritson had risen in a calmer mood he was prepared for a disclosure like this last night he had been overwhelmed by the discovery that paul ritson was not the son of robert lowther with the coming of daylight a sterner spirit of inquiry came upon him the question that now agitated him was the identity of the man who had been mistaken for paul after mercy's letter the mystery was in a measure dispelled there could hardly be the shadow of a doubt that the man who had slept at the pack horse the man who had been seen by many persons at the fire the man who greta had encountered in the lane was one and the same with the man whom mercy knew for paul drayton the innkeeper at hendon but so much light on one small spot only made the surrounding gloom more dark far more important than any question of who this man was by repute was the other question of why he was there wherefore had he come why did he not come openly what hidden reason had he for moving like a shadow where he knew no one and was known of none hugh thought again of the circumstance of his mother's strange seizure last night he had formulated his theory respecting it and it was simple enough the second man whoever he was had for whatever reason come to the house and failing to attract attention in the hall had wandered aimlessly upstairs to the first room in which he heard a noise that room happened to be his mother's and when the stranger with the fatal resemblance to her absent son presented himself before her in that strange way at that strange hour in that strange place the fear had leaped to her heart that it was his wraith warning her of his death and she had fainted and fallen the theory had its serious loop holes for incredulity but hugh ritson minded them not at all another and a graver issue tortured him but this morning by the light of mercy's letter his view was clearer if the man who resembled paul had come secretly to newlands he must have had his reasons for not declaring himself if he had wandered when none was near into mrs ritson's room it must have been because he had a purpose there and his mother's seizure might not have been due to purely superstitious fears or her silence to shattered nerves there was one thing to do and that was to get at the heart of this mystery whoever he was this second man was to be the living influence in all their lives thus far one thing only was plain that paul ritson was not the half brother of greta hugh determined to travel south forthwith if the other man was still beating about newlands so much the better hugh would be able to see the old woman his mother and talk with her undisturbed by the suspicions of a cunning man hugh spent most of that day in his office at the pit head settling up such business as could not await his return on wednesday morning early he dispatched natt on foot with a letter to mr bonnithorne explaining succinctly but with shrewd reservations the recent turn of events then he stepped for a moment into his mother's room mrs ritson had risen and was sitting by the fire writing hugh observed as she rose that there were tears in her eyes and that the paper beneath her pen was stained with great drops that had fallen as she wrote a woman was busy on her knees on the floor sorting linen into a trunk this garrulous body old dinah wilson was talking as hugh entered it caps all you niver heard sec feckless wark she was saying and reuben threept me down too there he was in the peat loft when i went for the peats and he had it all as fine as clerk after passon 'it was master paul at the fire certain sure' he says ower and ower again 'what man get away wi' thy botheration mister paul was off to london' i says 'go and see if tha can leet on a straight waistcoat any spot' i says but he threept and he threept 'it was master paul or his own birth brother' he says hush dinah said mrs ritson hugh told his mother in a quiet voice that business was taking him away then he turned about and said good day without emotion she held out her hand to him and looked him tenderly in the eyes is this our parting she said and then leaned forward and touched his cheek with her lips he seemed surprised and turned pale but he went out calmly and without speaking in half an hour he was walking rapidly over the snow crusted road to the station chapter xi when paul parted from natt at the station on saturday night he had told the stableman to meet him with the trap at the same spot and at the same hour on wednesday since receiving these instructions however natt had as we have seen arrived at conclusions of his own respecting certain events the futility of doing as he had been bidden began to present itself to his mind with peculiar force what was the good of going to the station for a man who was not coming by the train what was the use of pretending to bring home a person who had never been away these and other equivocal problems defied solution when natt essayed them he revolved the situation fully on his way home from mr bonnithorne's and decided that to go to the station that night at eight o'clock would be only a fine way of making a fool of a body but when he reached the stable and sat down to smoke and saw the hour approaching his instinct began to act automatically and in sheer defiance of the thing he called his reason in short natt pulled off his coat and proceeded to harness the mare then it was that relieved of the weight of abstract questions he made two grave discoveries the first was that the horse bore marks of having been driven in his absence the next that the harness was not hanging precisely on those hooks where he had last placed it and when he drew out the trap he saw that the tires of the wheels were still crusted with unmelted snow these concrete issues finally banished the discussion of general principles natt had not entirely accounted for the strange circumstances when he jumped into his seat and drove away but the old idea of paul's dubious conduct was still fermenting the froth and bubbles were still rising natt had not gone half way to the station when he almost leaped out of the trap at the sudden advent of an original thought the trap had been driven out before he had not covered a mile more before that thought had annexed another and along this road too after this the sequence of ideas was swift in less than half a league natt had realized that paul ritson himself had driven the mare to the station in order that he might be there to come home at eight o'clock and thus complete the deception which he had practiced on gullible and slow witted persons but in his satisfaction at this explanation natt overlooked the trifling difficulty of how the trap had been got home again driving up into the station he was greeted by a flyman waiting for hire bad on the laal mare ma man two sec journeys in ya half day i reckon tha knows it's been here afore natt's face broadened into a superior smile which seemed to desire his gratuitous informant to tell him something he didn't know this unspoken request was about to be gratified dusta ken who came down last natt waved his hand in silent censure of so much unnecessary zeal and passed on promptly as the clock struck eight the london train drew up at the station and a minute afterward paul ritson came out here he be of course thought natt paul was in great spirits his face wore the brightest smile and his voice had the cheeriest ring his clothes seen by the lamp looked a little draggled and dirty he swung himself into the trap took the driver's seat and the reins and rattled along with cheerful talk it was months since natt had witnessed such an access of geniality on paul's part too good to be true thought natt who in his own wise way was silently making a study in histrionics anything fresh while i've been away asked paul humph said natt nothing new nobody's cow calved the mare not lost her hindmost shoe nothing asked paul and laughed i know no more nor you said natt in a grumpy tone paul looked at him and laughed again not to night were good spirits like his to be quenched by a servant's ill humor they drove some distance without speaking the silence being broken only by paul's coaxing appeals to the old mare to quicken the pace that was carrying him to somebody who was waiting at the vicarage natt recovered from his natural dudgeon at an attempt to play upon him and began to feel the humor of the situation it was good sport after all this little trick of master paul and the best of it was that nobody saw through it but natt himself natt began to titter and look up significantly out of his sleepy eyes into paul's face paul glanced back with a look of bewilderment but of course that was only a part of the game keep it up thought natt how we are doing 'em the landscape lying south was a valley with a double gable of mountains at the top the mill stood on a knoll two miles further up and on any night but the darkest its black outlines could be dimly seen against the sky that crept down between these fells there was no moon visible but the moon's light was behind the clouds what has happened to the mill said paul catching sight of the dismantled mass in the distance nowt since saturday neet as i've heard on said natt and what happened then oh nowt nowt i's warrant not said natt with a gurgling titter paul looked perplexed natt had been drinking nothing surer why lad the wheel is gone look i'll not say but it is we know all about that we do paul glanced down again liquor got into the brains of some folk but it had gone into natt's face with what an idiotic grin he was looking into one's eyes but paul's heart was full of happiness his bosom's lord sat lightly on its throne natt's face was excruciatingly ridiculous and paul laughed at the sight of it then natt laughed and they both laughed together each at neither with the other i don't know nothing i don't oh no chuckled natt inwardly once he made the remark aloud when they came to the vicarage paul drew up threw the reins to natt and got down don't wait for me he said drive home natt drove as far homeward as the flying horse and then turned in there for a crack leaving the trap in the road before he left the inn a discovery yet more astounding if somewhat less amusing was made by his swift and subtle intellect chapter xii an itinerant mendicant preacher had walked through the valley that day and when night fell in he had gravitated to the parson's door seeing the sun low he said and knowing it a long way to keswick and i not being able to abide the night air but sure to catch a cold i came straight to your house like other guests of high degree the shoeless being made a virtue of accepting hospitality come in brother and welcome said parson christian and that night the wayfarer lodged at the vicarage he was a poor straggle headed creature with a broken brain as well as a broken purse but he had the warm seat at the ingle greta heard paul's step on the path and ran to meet him paul paul thank god you are here at last her manner was warm and impulsive to seriousness but paul was in no humor to make nice distinctions parson christian rose from his seat before the fire and shook hands with feeling and gravity right glad to see you good lad he said this is brother jolly he added a fellow soldier of the cross who has suffered sore for neglecting solomon's injunction against suretyship paul took the flaccid hand of the fellow soldier and then drew greta aside into the recess of the square window it's all settled he said eagerly i saw my father's old friend and agreed to go out to his sheep runs as steward with the prospect of farming for myself in two years' time i have been busy i can tell you only listen on monday i saw the good old gentleman he's living in london now and he won't go back to victoria he tells me wants to lay his bones where they were got he says funny old dog rather says he remembers my father when he wasn't as solemn as a parish clerk on ash wednesday well on monday i saw the old fellow and settled terms and things liberal old chap too if he has got a hawk beak regular shylock you know well where was i oh of course then on tuesday i took out our berths yours mother's and mine the ship is called the 'ballarat' queer name a fine sea boat though she leaves the london docks next wednesday next wednesday said greta absently and with little interest in her tone yes a week to day sails at three prompt pilot comes on at a quarter to everybody aboard at twelve but it didn't take quite four and twenty hours to book the berths and the rest of the day i spent at a lawyer's office can't stomach that breed somehow they seem to get all the clover maybe it's because they're a drift of sheep with tin cans about their necks and can never take a nibble without all the world knowing ha ha i wish i'd thought of that when i saw old shylock paul was rattling on with a glib tongue and eyes that danced to the blithe step of an emancipated heart in the slumberous fire light the parson and the itinerant preacher talked together of the dust and noise in the great world outside these sleepy mountains greta drew back into the half light of the window recess too greedy of paul's good spirits to check them yes i went to the lawyer's office he continued and drew out a power of attorney in hugh's name and now he can do what he likes with the ghyll just as if it were his own much luck to him say i and some bowels too please god but that's not all not half this morning ah now you wise little woman who always pretend to know so much more than other folks tell me what i did in london before leaving it this morning greta had hardly listened her eyes had dropped to his breast her arms had crept about his neck and her tears were falling fast but he was not yet conscious of the deluge what do you think why i went to doctors' commons and bought the license dirt cheap too at the price and now it can be done any day any day think of that so ho so ho covering your face eh up now up with it gently do you know they asked me your complexion the color of your eyes or something that old shylock or somebody and i couldn't tell for the life of me there a peep just one wee peep why what's this what the d what villain what in the name of mischief is the ma why greta you're cry yes you are you are crying paul had forced up greta's face with gentle violence and now he held her at arm's length surveying her with bewildered looks parson christian twisted about in his chair he had not been so much immersed in wars and rumors of wars as to be quite ignorant of what was going on around him greta is but in badly case he said pretending to laugh she has fettled things in the house over and over again and she has if't and haffled over everything she's been longing surely the deep voice had a touch of tremor in it this time and the twinkling old eyes looked hazy ah of course shouted paul in stentorian tones and he laughed about as heartily as the parson greta's tears were gone in an instant you must go home at once paul she said your mother must not wait a moment longer he laughed and bantered and talked of his dismissal she stopped him with a grave face and a solemn word at last his jubilant spirit was conquered he realized that something was amiss then she told him what happened at the ghyll on monday night he turned white and at first stood tongue tied next he tried to laugh it off but the laughter fell short must have been my brother he said it's true we're not much alike but then it was night dark night and you had no light but the dim lamp and at least there's a family resemblance your brother hugh was sitting in his room paul's heart sickened with an indescribable sensation you found the door of my mother's room standing open wide open and hugh was in his own room said paul his eyes flashing and his teeth set i saw him there a moment later my features my complexion my height and my build you say the same in everything paul lifted his face and in that luminous twilight it were an expression of peculiar horror in fact myself in a glass greta shuddered and answered just that paul neither more nor less very strange he muttered he was shaken to the depths greta crept closer to his breast and when my mother recovered she said nothing nothing you did not question her how could i but i was hungering for a word paul patted her head with his tenderest touch have you seen her since not since i have been ill i mean rather unwell parson christian twisted again in his chair what do you think my lad greta in a dream last night rose out of bed went to the stair head and there fell to the ground my poor darling said paul the absent look flying from his eyes but blessed be god she has no harm said the parson and turned once more to his guest paul you must hurry away now good bye for the present dearest kiss me good bye but paul stood there still greta do you ever feel that what is happening now has happened before somehow somewhere and where when the questions keep ringing in your brain and racking your heart but there is no answer you are shouting into a voiceless cavern his face was as pale as ashes his eyes were fixed and his gaze was far away greta grew afraid of the horror she had awakened don't think too seriously about it she said besides i may have been mistaken in fact hugh said well what did he say he made me ashamed he said i had imagined i saw you and screamed and so frightened your mother there are men in the world who would see the lord of hosts come from the heavens in glory and say it was only a water spout but as you said yourself it was in the night and very dark i had nothing but the feeble oil lamp to see by don't look like that paul the girl lifted a nervous hand and covered his eyes and laughed a little hollow laugh paul shook himself free of his stupor good night greta he said tenderly and walked to the door then the vacant look returned the answer is somewhere somewhere he said faintly he shook himself again and shouted in his lusty tones good night all good night good night the next instant he was gone out in the road he began to run but it was not from exertion alone that his breath came and went in gusts before he reached the village his nameless sentiment of dread of the unknown had given way to anxiety for his mother what was this strange illness that had come upon her in his absence her angel face had been his beacon in darkness she had lifted his soul from the dust tortured by the world and the world's law yet heaven's peace had settled on her let the world say what it would into her heart the world had not entered he hurried on what a crazy fool he had been to let natt go off with the trap why had not that coxcomb told him what had occurred he would break every bone in the blockhead's skin how long the road was to be sure a hundred fears suggested themselves on the way would his mother be worse would she be still conscious why in god's name had he ever gone away he came by the flying horse and there tied to the blue post stood the horse and trap natt was inside there he was the villain in front of the fire laughing boisterously a glass of hot liquor in his hand paul jumped into the trap and drove away it was hardly in human nature that natt should resist the temptation to show his cronies by ocular demonstration what a knowing young dog he could be if he liked natt never tried to resist it is it all die spensy he asked with a wink when with masterly circumlocution he had broached his topic it's a fate i tell tha' said tom o' dint taking a churchwarden from between his lips and another thin voice from a back bench it was little jacob berry's corroborated that view of the mystery a fine scorn sat on the features of natt as he exploded beneath their feet this mine of supernaturalism shaf on your bogies and bodderment say i he cried there are folks as won't believe their own senses if you'll no' but show me how yon horse of mine can be in two places at once i'll maybe believe as master paul ritson can be here and in london at the same time nowt short o' that'll do for me i can tell you and at this conclusive reasoning natt laughed and crowed and stirred his steaming liquor it was at that moment that paul whipped up into the trap and drove away show me as my horse as i've tied to the post out there is in his stable all the time and i's not be for saying as maybe i won't give in gubblum oglethorpe came straggling into the room at that instant and caught the words of natt's clinching argument what see a post he asked why the post afore the house for sure well i wudna be for saying but i's getten a bit short sighted but if theer's a horse tied to a post afore this house i's not be for saying as i won't be domd natt ran to the door followed by a dozen pairs of quizzing eyes the horse was gone natt sat down on the post and looked around in blank astonishment well i will be domd he said at last the bogies had him in their grip chapter xiii by the time that paul had got to the ghyll his anxiety had reached the point of anguish perhaps it had been no more than a fancy but he thought as he approached the house that a mist hung about it when he walked into the hall his footsteps sounded hollow to his ear and the whole place seemed empty as a vault the spirit deadening influence of the surroundings was upon him when old dinah wilson came from the kitchen and looked at him with surprise clearly he had not been expected he wanted to ask twenty questions but his tongue cleaved to his mouth the strong man trembled and his courage oozed away why did not the woman speak how scared she looked too he was brushing past her and up the stairs when she told him in faltering tones that her mistress was gone the word coursed through his veins like poison gone how gone he said could it be possible that his mother was dead gone away said dinah away where gone by train sir this afternoon gone by train paul repeated mechanically with absent manner there's a letter left sir it's on the table in her room recovering his self possession paul darted upstairs at three steps a stride his mother's room was empty no fire in the grate the pictures down from the walls the table coverless the few books gone from the shelf all chill voiceless and blind what did it mean paul stood an instant on the threshold seeing all in one swift glance yet seeing nothing then with the first return of present consciousness his eye fell on the letter that lay on the table he took it up with trembling fingers it was addressed in his mother's hand to him he broke the seal this is what he read i go to day to the shelter of the catholic church i had long thought to return to this refuge though i had hoped to wait until the day your happiness with greta was complete that in heaven's purposes was not to be and i must leave you without a last farewell good bye dear son and god bless and guide you if you love me do not grieve for me it is from love of you i leave you think of me as one who is at peace and i will bless you even in heaven if ever the world should mock you with your mother's name remember that she is your mother still and that she loved you to the last good bye dear paul you may never know the day when this erring and sorrowing heart will be allowed in his infinite pity to join the choirs above then dearest from the hour when you read this letter think of me as dead for i shall be dead to the world paul held the letter before him and looked at it long with vacant eyes feeling itself seemed gone not a tear came from him not a sigh not one moan of an overwrought heart escaped him all was blind pulseless torpor he stood there crushed and overwhelmed a shaken shattered man a thousand horrors congealed within him to one deep dead stupor he turned away in silence and walked out of the house the empty chambers seemed as he went to echo his heavy footsteps he took the road back toward the vicarage turning neither to the right nor the left looking straight before him and never once shifting his gaze the road might be long but now it fretted him no more the night might be cold but colder far was the heart within him the moon might fly behind the cloud floes and her light burst forth afresh but for him all was blank night in the vicarage the slumberous fire was smoldering down the straggle brained guest had been lighted to his bed and the good parson himself was carrying to his own tranquil closet a head full of the great world's dust and noise greta was still sitting before the dying fire her heart heavy with an indefinable sensation of dread when paul opened the door his face was very pale and his eyes had a strange look but he was calm and spoke quietly he told what had occurred and read aloud his mother's letter the voice was strong in which he read it and never a tremor told of the agony his soul was suffering then he sat some time without speaking and time itself had no reckoning greta scarcely spoke and the old parson said little what power had words to express a sorrow like this death had its solace but there was no comfort for death in life at last paul told parson christian that he wished the marriage to take place at once to morrow or at latest the day after that he told of their intention to leave england of his father's friend and in answer to questions of the power of attorney drawn up in the name of his brother the old man was deeply moved but his was the most unselfish of souls he understood very little of all that was meant by what had been done and was still to do but he said god bless you and go with you though his own wounded heart was bleeding greta knelt at his chair and kissed the tawny old face lined and wrinkled and damp now with a furtive tear it was agreed that the marriage should take place on friday this was wednesday night paul rose and stepped to the door and greta followed him to the porch it is good of you to leave all to your brother she said we'll not speak of it he answered is there not something between you she asked another time darling greta recalled hugh ritson's strange threat should she mention it to paul she had almost done so when she lifted her eyes to his face the weary worn expression checked her not now it would be a cruelty i knew the answer to that omen was somewhere he said and it has come he stepped over the threshold and stood one pace outside the snow still lay under foot crusted with frost the wind blew strongly and soughed in the stiff and leafless boughs overhead the flying moon at that moment broke through a rack of cloud at the same instant the red glow of the fire light found its way through the open door and was reflected on paul's pallid face greta gasped a thrill passed through her there before her eye to eye with her once again was the face she saw at the ghyll chapter xiv paul went back home carrying with him a crushed and broken spirit he threw himself into a chair in a torpor of dejection when the servants spoke to him he lifted to their faces two clouded eyes heavy with suffering and answered their questions in few words the maid laid the supper and told him it was ready when she returned to clear the cloth the supper was untouched paul stepped up to his mother's room and sat down before the cold grate the candle he carried with him burned out in the kitchen the servants of the farm and house gossipped long and bickered vigorously whatever ails master paul crossed in love maybe shaf on sec woman's wit wherever has mistress gone to buy a new gown mayhap sista now how a lass's first thowt runs on finery didsta hear nowt when you drove mistress to the rail reuben nay nowt dusta say it war thee as drove to the station this afternoon i wouldn't be for saying as it warn't wilta be meeting master hugh in the forenoon natt nay ax natt na questions he's fair tongue tied to neet natt is he's clattering all of it to hisself swearing a bit and sec as that when the servants had gone to bed and the house was quiet paul still sat in his mother's abandoned room no one but he knew what he suffered that night he tried to comprehend the disaster that had befallen him why had his mother shut herself in a convent how should her love for him require that she should leave him to demand answers to these questions was like knocking at the door of a tomb the voice was silent that could reply there came no answer save the dull heavy hollow echo of his own uncertain knock all was blind dumb insensate torpor no outlook no word no stimulating pang his stupor was broken by a vision that for long hours of that dead night burned in his brain like molten lead the face which greta had seen and which his mother must also have seen seemed to rise up before him as he sat in that deserted chamber he saw his own face as he might have seen it in a glass not even the blackness of night could conceal it clear as a face seen in the day it shone and burned in that dark room he closed his eyes to shut it out but it was still before him it was within him it was imprinted in features of fire on his brain he trembled with fear never until that hour knowing what fear was it acted upon him like his own ghost he knew it was but a phantasy but no phantasy was ever more horrible he got up to banish it and it stood before him face to face he sunk down again and it sat beside him eye to eye then it changed for a moment it faded away into a palpitating mist and the tension of his gaze relaxed how blessed was that moment's respite his thought returned to his mother if ever the world should mock you with your mother's name remember that she is your mother still and that she loved you to the last dear sacred soul little fear that he should forget it little fear that the wise world should tarnish the fair shrine of that holy love tears of tenderness rose to his eyes and in the midst of them he thought his mother sat before him her head was bent an all eating shame was crimsoning her pale cheek then he knew that other eyes were upon her looking into her heart prying deep down into her dead past keeping open the heavy eyelids that could never sleep he looked up his own shadow was silently gazing down upon both of them paul leaped to his feet and ran out of the room surely the spirit of his mother still inhabited the deserted chamber surely this was the shadow that had driven her away big drops of sweat rolled in beads from his forehead he went out of the house heavy black clouds were adrift in a stormy sky behind them the bright moon was scudding he walked among the naked trees of the gaunt wood at the foot of coledale and listened to the short breathings of the wind among the frost covered boughs at every second step he gave a quick glance backward but at last he saw the thing he looked for it was walking with him side by side pace for pace he passed slowly out of the wood not daring now to run the white fell rose sheer up to the grim gray crags that hung in shaggy snowy masses over the black seams of the ravines and the moon's light rested on them for an instant without thought or aim he began to climb the ascent was perilous at any hour to any foot save that of a mountaineer the exertion and the watchfulness banished the vision and his liberated mind turned to greta what was life itself now without greta's love nothing but a succession of days she was the savior of his outcast state she was his life's spring whence the waters of content might flow and a flood of emotion came over him and in his heart he blessed her it was then that on that gaunt headland he seemed to see her at his side but between them and dividing them stalked the spectre of himself all to the east was dense gloom save where the pulsating red of the smelting house burned in the distance with no rest for his foot paul walked in the direction of the light and the shadow of his face walked with him as the wind went by him it whistled in his ear and it sounded in that solitude like the low cry of the thing at his side old laird fisher was at his work of wheeling the refuse of the ore from the mouth of the furnace and shooting it down the bank the glow of the hot stone in the iron barrow that he trundled was reflected in sharp white lights on his wrinkled face ista theer mister paul he said catching his breath and coughing amid the smoke and shouting between the gusts of wind the slow beat of the engine and the clank of the chain of the cage in the shaft deadened the wind's shrill whistle the smoke from the bank shot up and swirled away like a long flight of swallows standing there the vision troubled him no longer it had been merely a waking phantasy bred of what greta said she saw in the snow and heightened by the shock to his nerves caused by his mother's departure the sight of matthew helped to beat it off his submissive face was the sign of his broken spirit a tempest had torn up his only hold on the earth he was but a poor naked trunk flung on the ground without power of growth or grip of the soil he was old and he had no hope yet he lived on and worked submissively paul's own case was different destiny had dashed him in unknown seas against unseen rocks but he was young he had the power of life and the stimulus of love yet here he was the prey to an idle fancy tortured by an agony of fear good night to you matthew he shouted cheerily above the wind and went away into the night he would go home and sleep the fever out of his blood he took the road and as he went the monotonous engine throb died off behind him he passed through the village the street was empty and it echoed loud to the sound of his footfall large shadows fell about him when for an instant the moon shot clear of a cloud a light burned in a cottage window poor mrs truesdale's sick life was within that sleepless chamber lingering out its last days the wind fell to silence at one moment and then a child's little cry came out to him in the night he walked on and plunged again into the darkness of the road beyond the dogs were howling at the distant ghyll a sable cloud floated in the sky and at its back the moon sailed it was like black hair silvered with gray but on one spot on the road before him the moon shone clear and white the place fascinated him like a star he quickened his pace until he came into the moon's open light then it turned to an ashy tint it lay over the church yard his father's grave was only a few paces from the road what unseen power had drawn him there was it meant that he should understand that all the stings that fate had in store for him were to be in some unsearchable way the refuse of his father's deed his mind went back to the night of his father's death he thought of his mother's confession a confession more terrible to make more fearful to listen to than a mother ever made before or a son ever heard and now again was the disaster of this very night a link in the chain of destiny let no man compare the withering effects of a father's curse with the blasting influence of a father's sin if the wrath of providence should fail in its stern and awful retribution the world in its mercy would not forget that the sins of the fathers must be visited upon the children paul entered the lych gate and entered the church yard the night dew on his cheeks was not colder than his tears as he knelt by his father's grave at one instant he cursed the world and the world's cruel law then there stole into his heart a poison that corroded its dearest memory he thought of his father with bitterness at that moment a strange awe crept over him he knew though still only by the eyes of his mind that the vision had returned he knew it was standing against the night sky as a ghastly headstone to the grave but when he raised his eyes what he saw was more terrible the face was before him but it was a dead face now he saw his own corpse stretched out on his father's grave his head fell on the cold sod he lay like the dead on the grave of the dead then he knew that it was ordered above that the cloud of his father's sin should darken his days that through all the range and change of life he was to be the lonely slave of a sin not his own his fate was sin inherited and the wages of sin is death was it strange that at that moment when all the earth seemed gloomed by the shadow of a curse that lay blackest over him when reverence for a father's memory and love learned at a mother's knee were deadened by a sense of irremediable wrong was it strange that there and then peace fell on him like a dove from heaven orphaned in one hour now and not till now foredoomed to writhe like a worm amid the dust of the world the man in him arose and shook off its fear it was because he came to know rude man as he was unlettered but strong of soul that there is a power superior to fate that the stormiest sea has its master that the waif that is cast by the roughest wave on the loneliest shore is yet seen and known and the voice of an angel seemed to whisper in his heart the story of hagar and her son how the boy was the first born of his father how the second born became the heir how the woman and son were turned away how they were nigh to death in the desert and how at last the cry came from heaven god hath heard the voice of the lad where he is the horror of the vision had gone it would come back no more paul walked home went up to his own room and slept peacefully when he awoke the pink and yellow rose of a wintery sunrise bloomed over the head of the eel crags the tinkle of the anvil came from across the vale sheep were bleating high up on the frost nipped side of the fell the echo of the ax could be heard from the wood and the muffled lowing of the kine from the shippon in the yard behind the harsh scrape of natt's clogs was on the gravel a robin with full throat perched on the window ledge and warbled cheerily last night was gone from him for all eternity before him was the day the world and life chapter xv that day the day before the wedding all the gossiping tongues in newlands were cackling from morning till night natt had been sent round the dale with invitations addressed to statesmen their wives sons and daughters parson christian himself made the round of the homes of the poor 'the poor ye have always with you' but not everywhere and not often in cana of galilee he said to greta on setting out and the people of the highways and hedges were nothing loath to come in to the feast god luck to the weddiners they said and may they never lick a lean poddish stick there was not much work done in the valley that day the richest heiress on the country side was about to be married to the richest statesman in the dale on the eve of such an event it was labor enough to drop in at the flying horse and discuss mathematics the general problem was one in simple addition namely how much paul ritson would be worth when he married greta lowther and more than once that day twice two made a prodigious five the frost continued and the roads were crisp heavy rains had preceded the frost and the river that ran down the middle of the valley had overflowed the meadows to the width of a wide carriage way this was now a road of ice five miles long smooth as glass and all but as straight as an arrow abraham strong the carpenter had been ordered to take the wheels off a disused landau and fix instead two keels of wood beneath the axles this improvised sledge after it had been shod in steel by the blacksmith was to play a part in to morrow's ceremony early in the day brother peter was dispatched to the town to fetch mr bonnithorne the four miles' journey afoot seemed to him a bigger candle than the entire game was worth don't know as i see what the lass wants mair nor she's got he told himself grumpily as he plodded along the road what call has she for a man hasn't she two of 'em as she is i made her comfortable enough myself but lasses are varra ficklesome mr bonnithorne gathered enough from brother peter's don't know as there's not a wedding in t' wind to infer what was afoot hugh ritson was away from home and his brother paul was availing himself of his absence to have the marriage ceremony performed this was the inference with which mr bonnithorne had walked from the town but before reaching the vicarage he encountered paul himself who was even then on the way to his office few words passed between them indeed the young dalesman was civil and no more he gave scant courtesy but then he also gave something that was more substantial and the severity of the lawyer's cynicism relaxed paul handed mr bonnithorne without comment the deed drawn up in london mr bonnithorne glanced at it pocketed it and smiled his sense of paul's importance as a dangerous man sunk to nothing at that moment they parted without more words parson christian got home toward evening dead beaten with fatigue he found the lawyer waiting for him the marriage had been big in his eyes all day and other affairs very little so you shall give her away mr bonnithorne he said without superfluous preface of any kind i i said mr bonnithorne with elevated brows who has more right said the parson well you know you you me nay i must marry them it is you for the other duty you see mr christian if you think of it i am i am you are her father's old friend there let us look on it as settled mr bonnithorne looked on it as awkward well to say the truth mr christian i'd i'd rather not the old parson lifted two astonished eyes and gazed at mr bonnithorne over the rims of his spectacles the lawyer's uneasiness increased then parson christian remembered that only a little while ago mr bonnithorne had offered reasons why paul should not marry greta they were rather too secular those same reasons but no doubt they had appealed honestly to his mind as a friend of greta's family paul and greta are going away said the parson so i judged they go to victoria to farm there continued the parson on greta's money added the lawyer parson christian looked again over the rims of his spectacles then for once his frank and mellow face annexed a reflection of the curl on the lawyer's lip do you know he said it never once came into my simple old pate to ask which would find the dross and which the honest labor mr bonnithorne winced the simple old pate could on occasion be more than a match for his own wise head seeing that i shall marry her i think it will be expected that you should give her to her husband but if you have an objection an objection mr bonnithorne interrupted i don't know that my feeling is so serious as that then let us leave it there and you'll decide in the morning said parson christian so they left it there and mr bonnithorne the dear friend of the family made haste to the telegraph office and sent this telegram to hugh ritson in london they are to be married to morrow if you have anything imperative to say write to night or come paul and greta saw each other only for five minutes that day amid the general hubbub but their few words were pregnant with serious issues beneath the chorus of their hearts' joy there was an undersong of discord and neither knew of the other's perplexity greta was thinking of hugh ritson's mysterious threat whether or not hugh had the power of preventing their marriage was a question of less consequence to greta at this moment than the other question of whether or not she could tell paul what hugh had said as the day wore on her uncertainty became feverish if she spoke she must reveal what hitherto she had partly hidden the importunity and unbrotherly disloyalty of hugh's love she must also awaken fresh distress in paul's mind already overburdened with grief for the loss of his mother probably paul would be powerless to interpret his brother's strange language and if he should be puzzled the more he must be pained perhaps hugh ritson's threat was nothing but the outburst of a distempered spirit the noise of a bladder that is emptying itself still greta's nervousness increased no reason no sophistry could allay it she felt like a blind man who knows by the current of air on his face that he has reached two street crossings and can not decide which turn to take paul on his part had a grave question to revolve he was thinking whether it was the act of an honorable man to let greta marry him in ignorance of the fact that he was not his father's legitimate son yet he could never tell her the oath he had taken over his father's body must seal his lips forever his mother's honor was wrapped up in that oath break the one and the other was no longer inviolate true it would be to greta and greta alone and she and he were one true too his mother was now dead to the world but the oath was rigid never to reveal to any human soul by word or deed his act or her shame he had sworn it and he must keep it the conflict of emotion was terrible love was dragging him one way and love the other honor said yes and honor said no his heart's first thought was to tell greta everything to keep nothing back from her whose heart's last thought was his but the secret of his birth must lie as a dead and speechless thing within him if it was not the act of an honorable man to let greta marry him in ignorance of his birth there was only one escape from the dishonor not to let her marry him at all if they married the oath must be kept if the oath were kept the marriage might be dishonored it could not be the unreserved and complete union of soul with soul heart with heart mind with mind which true marriage meant it would be laying the treasure at the altar and keeping back part of the price paul was not a man of subtle intellect or perhaps such reflections would have troubled him too deeply love was above everything and to give up greta was impossible if circumstance was the evil genius of a man's life should it be made the god of it also at all hazards paul meant to marry greta and after all what did this question of honor amount to it was a mere phantasm what did it matter to greta whether he were high or basely born should he love her less or more would he be less or more worthy of her love and how was his birth base not in god's eyes for god had heard the voice of hagar's son only in the eyes of the world and what did that mean it meant that whether birth was high or base depended one part on virtue and nine hundred and ninety nine parts on money where had half the world's titled great ones sprung from not like him from their father and their father's fathers but from a monarch's favorite thus paul reasoned with himself at this juncture whether he was wholly right or wholly wrong or partly right and partly wrong concerns us not at all it was natural that such a man in such a place at such an hour should decide once for all to say not a word to greta it was just as natural that his reticence should produce the long series of incidents still to be recorded thus it was not a word was said between them of what lay nearest to the hearts of both chapter xvi the morning was brilliant a vigorous lusty young day such as can awake from the sleep of the night only in winter and in the north the sun shone on the white frost the air was hazy enough to make the perspective of the fells more sharp and leave a halo of mystery to hang over every distant peak and play about every tree the ghyll was early astir and in every nook and corner full of the buzz of gossip well things is at a pass for sure and never no axings nowther and all cock a hoop and no waiting for the mistress to come back shaf what matter about the mistress she's no' but a kill joy there'd be no merry neet an' she were at home well i is fair maizelt 'at he won't wait for master hugh his awn brother thoo knows what lass dusta think as he wad do owt at the durdum to neet maybe

did say as somebody were partial to her hod thy tongue about the bit thing don't thoo misliken me to sec a stromp resplendent in a blue cloth coat light check trousers a flowered yellow silk waistcoat and a white felt hat natt was flying up and down the stairs to and from paul's room paul himself had not yet been seen rumor in the kitchen whispered that he had hardly taken the trouble to dress and had not even been at the pains to wash natt had more than once protested his belief that his master meant to be married in his shirt sleeves nothing but papers and pens and sealing wax and things had he asked for outside the vicarage a motley group had gathered there was john proudfoot the blacksmith uncommonly awkward in a frock coat and a pair of kid gloves that sat on his great hands like a clout on a pitchfork dick the miller was there too with giles raisley the miner and job sheepshanks by the way of treaty of peace stood stroking the tangled mane of gubblum oglethorpe's pony children hung on the fence women gathered about the gate dogs capered on the path gubblum himself had been in the house and now came out accompanied by brother peter ward and a huge black jug the jug was passed round with distinct satisfaction is the laal man ever coming said gubblum smacking his lips and taking a swift survey of the road why here he is at sec a skufter as'll brak' his shins at the top of his speed and breathless clad in a long coat whose tails almost swept the ground grasping a fiddle in one hand and a paper in the other tom o' dint came hurrying up tha's here at last tom ma man teem a glass into him peter and let's mak' a start ye see i's two men i is said the small man apologetically i had my rounds with my letters to do first and business afore pleasure you knows pleasure afore business say i cried gubblum never let yer wark get the upper hand o' yer wages them's my maxims two coaches came up at the moment having driven four miles for the purpose of driving four furlongs john proudfoot without needless courtesy took the fiddler postman by the neck of his coat and the garment beneath its tails and slung him fiddle and all on to the saddle of the pony and held him there a moment steadying him like a sack with an open mouth sit thee there as steady as a broody hen and now let's mak' shift said the blacksmith but i must go inside first said the fiddler i've a letter for lawyer bonnithorne shaf on thee and thy letter away with thee deliver it at the church door the men dropped into a single file with tom o' dint riding at their head and gubblum walking by the pony's side and holding the reins strike up shouted job sheepshanks ista ever gaen to begin then the fiddler shouldered his fiddle and fell to and the first long sweeps of his wedding march awoke the echoes of the vale the women and children followed the procession a few hundred yards and then returned to see the wedding party enter the coaches inside the vicarage all was noise and bustle greta was quiet enough and ready to set out at any time but a bevy of gay young daleswomen were grouped about her trying to persuade her to change her brown broche dress for a pale blue silk to have some hothouse plants in her hair and at least to wear a veil and mind you keep up heart darling and speak out your responses and dearest don't cry until the parson gets to 'god bless you' greta received all this counsel with equal thanks she listened to it affected to approve of it and ignored it her face betrayed anxiety she hardly understood her own fears but whenever the door opened and a fresh guest entered she knew that her heart leaped to her mouth parson christian stood near her in silk gaiters and a coat that had been old fashioned even in his youth but his jovian gray head and fine old face beautiful in its mellowness and child like simplicity made small demand of dress he patted greta's hair sometimes with the affectionate gesture that might be grateful to a fondled child mr bonnithorne arrived early in a white waistcoat and coat adorned by a flower his brave apparel was scarcely in keeping with the anxiety written on his face he could not sit down for more than a moment in the same seat he was up and down walking to and fro looking out of the window and diving for papers into his pocket the procession headed by tom o' dint had not long been gone when word was given and the party took to the coaches and set off at a trot then the group of women at the gate separated with many a sapient comment weel he's getten a bonny lass for sure and many a sadder thing med happen to her too the village lay midway between the vicarage and the church and the fiddler and his company marched through it to a brisk tune bringing fifty pairs of curious eyes to the windows and the doors tom o' dint sat erect in the saddle playing vigorously and when a burst of cheering hailed the procession as it passed a group of topers gathered outside the flying horse tom accepted it as a tribute to his playing and bowed his head with becoming dignity and without undue familiarity always remembering that courtesy comes after art as a true artist is in loyalty bound to do once or twice the pony slipped its foot on the frosty road and then tom was fain to abridge a movement in music and make a movement in gymnastics toward grasping the front of the saddle but all went well until the company came within fifty paces of the church door and there a river crossed the road being shallow and very swift the river head escaped the grip of the frost and slipped through its fingers there was a foot bridge on one side and the men behind the fiddler fell out of line to cross by it gubblum dropped the reins and followed them but as bridges are not made for the traffic of ponies tom o' dint was bound to go through the water never interrupting the sweep and swirl of the march he was playing he gave the pony a prod with his foot and it plunged in but scarcely had it taken two steps and reached the depth of its knees when from the intenser cold or from coming sharply against a submerged stone or from indignation at the fiddler's prod or from the occult cause known as pure devilment it shied up its back legs and tossed down its tousled head and pitched the musician head foremost into the stream amid a burst of derisive cheers tom o' dint was drawn wet as a sack to the opposite bank and his fiddle was rescued from a rapid voyage down the river now the untoward adventure had the good effect of reducing the fiddler's sense of the importance of his artistic function and bringing him back to consciousness of his prosaic duties as postman he put his hand into his pocket feeling as if he had dipped it into a bag of eels and drew out the lawyer's letter it was wet and the ink of the superscription was beginning to run tom o' dint also began to run fearing trouble he left his unsympathetic cronies hurried on to the church went into the vestry where he knew there would be a fire and proceeded to dry the letter the water had softened the gum and the envelope had opened so much the mair easier dried thought tom and nothing loath he drew out the letter unfolded it and held it to the fire the paper was smoking with the heat and so was tom when he heard carriage wheels without and then a mighty hubbub and loud voices mentioning his own name without reverence where's that clothead of a fiddler and sundry other dubious allusions tom knew that he ought to be at the gate striking up a merry tune to welcome the bride but then the letter was not dry there was not a moment to lose tom spread the paper and envelope on the fender intending to return for them and dashed off with his fiddle to the discharge of his artistic duty as tom o' dint left the vestry parson christian entered it the parson saw the papers on his fender picked them up and in all innocence read them the letter ran as follows morley's hotel trafalgar square nov dear bonnithorne the man who was in newlands is paul lowther greta's half brother paul ritson is my own brother my father's son keep this to yourself as you value your salvation your pride or your purse or whatever else you hold most dear send me by wire to day the name of their hotel in london the time of their train south and who if any are with them yours hugh ritson ps the girl mercy will be troublesome the parson had scarcely time to understand the words he read when he too was compelled to leave the vestry the bride and bridegroom had met at the church door it was usual to receive them at the altar with music the fiddler's function was at an end for the present parson christian could not allow the fiddle to be heard in church there a less secular instrument was required the church was too poor for an organ it had not yet reached the dignity of a harmonium but it had an accordion and among the parson's offices was the office of accordionist so throwing his gown over his head he walked into the church stepped into the pulpit whipped up his instrument from the shelf where he kept it and began to play now it chanced that mr bonnithorne in his legal capacity held certain documents for signature and having accompanied the bride to the altar rail he hurried to deposit them in the vestry the gloom had still hung heavy on his brow as he entered the church he was brooding over a letter that he had expected and had not received perhaps it was his present hunger for a letter that made his eye light first on the one which the fiddler postman had left to dry the parson had dropped it on the mantel shelf at a glance mr bonnithorne saw it was his own tom o' dint had been compelled to come up the aisle at the tail of the wedding party he saw mr bonnithorne who was at the head of it go into the vestry dripping wet as he was and with chattering teeth the sweat stood on his forehead deary me what sec a character will i have he muttered he elbowed and edged his way through the crowd and got into the vestry at last but he was too late with an eye that struck lightning into the meek face of the fiddler mr bonnithorne demanded an explanation the request was complied with and who has been in the room since you left it nay nobody sir sure of that for sure said tom mr bonnithorne's countenance brightened he had read the letter and believing that no one else had read it he was satisfied he put it in his pocket maybe i may finish drying it sir said tom o' dint the lawyer gave a contemptuous snort and turned on his heel when paul walked with a firm step up the aisle he looked fresh and composed his dress was simple his eyes were clear and bright and his wavy brown hair fell back from a smooth and peaceful brow greta at paul's side looked less at ease the clouds still hung over her face her eyes turned at intervals to the door as if expecting some new arrival the service was soon done and then the parson delivered a homily it was short and simple telling how the good bishop had said marriage was the mother of the world filling cities and churches and heaven itself whose nursery it was then it touched on the marriage rite i do not love ceremonies said the parson for they are too often 'devised to set a gloss on faint deeds' and there are such of them as throw the thing they celebrate further away than the wrong end of a telescope then he explained that though the marriage ceremony was unknown to the early christians and never referred to in the old bible where abraham took sarah to wife and jacob took rachel yet that the marriage of the church was a most holy and beautiful thing symbolizing the union of christ with his people last of all he spoke of the stainless and pious parentage of both bride and bridegroom and warned them to keep their name and fame unsullied for what is birth to man or woman said the teacher if it shall be a stain to his dead ancestors to have left such offspring greta bowed her head meekly and paul stood while the parson spoke with absent eyes fixed on the tablets on the wall before him spelling out mechanically the words of the commandments in a few moments the signatures were taken the bell in the little turret was ringing and the company were trooping out of the church it was a rude old structure with great bulges in the walls little square lead lights and open timbers untrimmed and straight from the tree the crowd outside had gathered about the wheelless landau which the carpenter and blacksmith had converted into a sledge on the box seat sat tom o' dint his fiddle in his hand and icicles hanging in the folds of his capacious coat the bride and bridegroom were to return in this conveyance which was to be drawn down the frozen river by a score of young dalesmen shod in steel they took their seats and had almost set off when greta called for the parson parson christian parson christian echoed twenty voices the good parson was ringing the bell being bell ringer also presently the brazen tongue ceased wagging and parson christian reappeared here's your seat parson said paul making space in half a crack replied parson christian pulling a great key out of his pocket and locking the church door he was sexton as well then he got up into the sledge word was called the fiddle broke out and away they went for the river bank a minute more and they were flying over the smooth ice with the morning sunlight chasing them and the music of fifty lusty voices in their ears they had the longer journey but they reached the vicarage as early as the coaches that had returned by the road then came the breakfast a solid repast fit for appetites sharpened by the mountain air parson christian presided in the parlor and brother peter in the kitchen the door between being thrown open the former radiated smiles like april sunshine the latter looked as sour as a plum beslimed by the earthworms and didn't know as he'd ever seen sec a pack of hungry hounds after the breakfast the toasts and up leaped mr bonnithorne that gentleman had quite cast off the weight of his anxiety he laughed and chaffed made quips and cranks our lawyer is foreclosing whispered a pert young damsel in greta's ear he's getting drunk mr bonnithorne would propose mr and mrs ritson he began with a few hoary and reverend quotations men are april when they woo december when they wed this was capped by maids are may when they are maids but the sky changes when they are wives mr bonnithorne protested that both had been true only with exceptions paul thanked the company in a dozen manly and well chosen phrases and then stepped to the kitchen door and invited the guests over whom brother peter presided to spend the evening at the ghyll the ladies had risen and carried off greta to prepare for her journey when gubblum oglethorpe got on his feet and insisted on proposing the lasses what gubblum had to say on the subject it is not given to us to record by some strange twist of logic he launched out on a very different topic perhaps he sat in the vicinity of nancy tantarum for he began with the story of a funeral it minds me he said of the carriers at adam strang's funeral at gosforth last back end gone twelvemonth there were two sets on 'em and they'd a big bottle atween 'em same as that one as auld peter the honey keeps to hissel at yon end of the table well they carried adam shoulder high from the house to the grave yard first one set and then t'other mile on mile apiece and when one set got to the end of their mile they set down the coffin and went on for t'other set to pick it up it were nine mile from branthet edge to gosforth so they had nine shifts atween 'em and at every shift they swigged away at the big bottle this way with it peter well the mourners they crossed the fields for shortness but the bearers they had to keep the corpse road all went reet for eight mile and then one set with adam were far ahead of the other with the bottle they set the coffin on a wall at the roadside and went on well when the second set came up they didn't see it they couldn't see owt that's the fact same as i expect i'll be afore the day's gone but not with peter's good will seemingly well they went on too and when all of 'em coom't up to the church togither there was the parson in his white smock and his bare poll and big book open to start but you see there warn't no corpse where was it why it was no' but resting quiet all by itsel' on the wall a mile away gubblum was proceeding to associate the grewsome story with the incidents of paul's appearance at the fire while he was supposed to be in london but greta had returned to the parlor muffled in furs paul had thrown on a long frieze ulster and every one had risen for the last leave taking in the midst of the company stood the good old christian his wrinkled face wet with silent tears greta threw herself into his arms and wept aloud then the parson began to cast seeming merry glances around him and to be mighty jubilant all at once the improvised sledge was at the door laden with many boxes good bye good bye good bye a little cheer a little attempt at laughter a suppressed sigh then a downright honest cry and away they were gone the last thing seen by greta's hazy eyes was a drooping white head amid many bright girl faces how they flew along the glow of sunset was now in their faces it crimsoned the west and sparkled like gold on the eastern crags between them and the light were the skaters drawing the sledge sailing along like a flight of great rooks their voices echoing in unseen caverns of the fells mr bonnithorne sat with paul and greta where did you say you would stay in london he asked at morley's hotel said paul with this answer the lawyer looked unreasonably happy the station was reached in twenty minutes the train steamed in paul and greta got into the last carriage all before it being full a moment more and they were gone then mr bonnithorne walked direct to the telegraph office but the liquor he had taken played him false he had got it into his stupefied head that he must have blundered about morley's hotel that was not paul's but hugh's address so he sent this telegram left by train at one address hawk and heron then he went home happy that night there was high revel at the ghyll first a feast in the hall beef veal mutton ham haggis and hot bacon pie then an adjournment to a barn where tallow candles were stuck into cloven sticks and hollowed potatoes served for lamps strong ale and trays of tobacco went round and while the glasses jingled and the smoke wreathed upward a song was sung a man may spend and god will send if his wife be good to owt but a man may spare and still be bare if his wife be good to nowt then blindman's buff antony blindman kens ta me sen i bought butter and cheese o' thee i ga' tha my pot i ga' tha my pan i ga' all i had but a rap ho' penny i gave a poor auld man last of all the creels were ranged round the hay mows and the floor was cleared of everything except a beer barrel this was run into the corner and tom o' dint and fiddle were seated on top of it dancing was interrupted only by drinking until tom's music began to be irregular whereupon gubblum remonstrated and then tom with the indignation of an artist broke the bridge of his fiddle on gubblum's head and gubblum broke the bridge of tom's nose with his fist and both rolled on to the floor and lay there until gubblum extricated himself with difficulty shook his lachrymose noddle and said the laal man is as drunk as a fiddler the vicarage was quiet that night all the guests save one were gone parson christian sat before the smoldering fire old laird fisher sat with him neither spoke they passed a long hour in silence book iii the declivity of crime chapter i a way side hostelry six miles from london bearing its swinging sign of the silver hawk and golden heron it was a little low roofed place with a drinking bar in front as you entered and rooms opening from it on either hand the door of the room to the left was shut one could hear the voices of children within and sometimes a peal of their merry laughter the room to the right stood open to the bar it was a smoky place with a few chairs a long deal table a bench with a back a form against the wall pipes that hung on nails and a rough beam across the low ceiling a big fire burned in an open grate on a hearth without a fender in front of it coiled up in a huge chair like a canoe that had a look of having been hewn straight from the tree sat the only occupant of the room the man wore a tweed suit of the indefinite pattern known as pepper and salt his hat was drawn heavily over his face to protect his eyes from the glare of the fire light he gave satisfactory evidence that he slept under any light but that of the fire the place must have looked cheerless to desolation but the comfortless room was alive with the fire's palpitating heart the rosy flames danced over the sleeper's tawny hair over the sanded floor over the walls adorned with gaudy prints they threw shadows and then caught them back again flashed a ruddy face out of the little cracked window and then lay still while the blue night looked in an old woman with a yellow face deeply wrinkled served behind the bar two or three carriers and hawkers sat on a bench before it one of these worthies screwed up the right side of his face with an expression of cutting irony burn my body though but what an inwalable thing to have a son wot never need do no work the old woman lifted her eyes there enough of that she said and then jerked her head toward the room from whence came measured snores he'll be working at throwing you out some of you same as he did young bobby on sunday sennight like enough he don't know which side his bread is buttered he don't his bread said another an old road mender with a scornful dig of emphasis his old mother's you mean don't you notice as folks as eat other folks' bread and earn none for theirselves never knows no more nor babbies which side the butter is on hold your tongue luke sturgis said the old woman mayhap you think it's you're pint of half and half as keeps us all out of the union now you're a goin' to get wexed mrs drayton so wot's to prevent me having another pint just to get that fine son of yourn an extra cigar or so hold hard with the pewter though i'll drain off what's left if convenient a drowsy eyed countryman with a dog snoring at his feet said been to lunnon again and pointed the shank of his pipe in the direction of the sleeping man got the lunnon smell on his clothes i allus knows it forty perches off you're wrong then mr wiseman said the old woman and he ain't got no smell of no lunnon on his clothes this day anyways for he's been where there ain't no smell no more nor in hendon leastways unless the mount'ins smells and the cataracks and the sheeps the mount'ins and has master paul been along of the mount'ins yes cummerland that's the mountains and fur off too i've heerd cummerland ain't that the part as the young missy comes from mayhap it is i wouldn't be for saying no to that so that's the time o' day is it the speaker gave a prolonged whistle and turned a suggestive glance into the faces of his companions well i allus says to my old woman 'bide quiet' i says 'and it'll leak out' and sure enough so it has the landlady fired up and i allus says to your missus 'mistress sturgis' i says 'it do make me that wexed to see a man a prying into other people's business and a talking and a scandalizing which it is bad in a woman where you expects no better as the saying is but it ain't no ways bearsome in a man and i wish you'd keep him' i says 'from poking his nose as you might say into other people's pewters' there that's what i allus says to your missis and very perwerse of you too said the worthy addressed speaking with the easy good nature of one who could afford to be rated and wot's to prevent me having a screw of twist on the strength of it putting a penny on the counter the landlady threw down the paper of tobacco picked up the penny and cast it into the till on'y as i say there's no use denying now as mister paul drayton has a finger in the young missy's pie there that's enough o' that i told you afore she never set eyes on him till a fortnight come sunday two women came into the bar with jugs and how is the young missy asked the elder of the two catching up the conversation as the landlady served her she's there said the landlady rather indefinitely indicating with a sidelong nod the room to the left with the closed door at that moment the laughter of the children could be heard from within she's merry over it at any rate though i did hear a whisper said the woman as she feeds two when she eats her wittals as the saying is the men laughed that's being overcur'ous mistress said one as the woman passed out sniggering such baggage oughtn't to be taken in to live with respectable people said the other woman the younger one who wore a showy bonnet and a little gay ribbon at her neck and that's being overcharitable said another voice it's the women for charity especially to one of themselves it's cur'osity as is the mischief i' this world said the drowsy eyed countryman people talk o' the root o' all evil and some says drink and some says money and some says rheumatis but i says cur'osity show me the man as ain't cur'ous and he don't go a poking his nose into every stink pot as you might say of course not said the gentleman addressed as luke sturgis and show me the man as ain't cur'ous he said with a wink and i'll show you the man as is good at a plough and inwalable at a ditch and wery near worth his weight in gold at gapping a hedge and mucking up a horse midden and catching them nasty moles wot ruin the county worse nor wars and publicans and parsons chapter ii it was mercy fisher who sat in the room to the left of the bar and played with the children and laughed when they laughed and tried to forget that she was not as young as they were and as happy and as free from thought living as they lived from hour to hour with no past and without a future and all in the living present but she was changed and was now no longer quite a child though she had a child's heart that would never grow old but be a child's heart still all the same that the weight of a woman's years lay upon it and the burden of a woman's sorrow saddened it a little older a little wiser perhaps a little graver of face and with eyes a little more wistful a neighbor who had gone to visit a relative five miles away had brought round her children begging the young missy to take care of them in her absence a curly headed boy of four sat wriggling in mercy's lap while a girl of six stood by her side watching the needles as she knitted and many a keen thrust the innocent prattling tongues sent straight as an arrow to mercy's heart the little fellow was revolving a huge lozenge behind his teeth and if oo had a little boy would oo give him sweets ery often all days sweets and cakes would oo yes every day darling i'd give him sweets and cakes every day i 'ikes oo and would oo let him go out to play with the big boys and get birds' nests and things would oo yes bird's nests and berries and everything i 'ikes oo i do and let him go to meet daddy coming home at night and ride on daddy's back a shadow shot across the girl's simple face and there was a pause would oo and lift him on daddy's shoulder would oo perhaps dear oh the little chap's delight required no fuller expression ot's oo doing knitting darling there rest quiet on my knee ot is it knitting stockings for oo little boy i have no little boy sweetheart they are mittens for a gentleman how pooty ot's a gentleman a man dear mr drayton is a gentleman you know oh then after a moment's sage reflection me knows a raskill willy 'at's what daddy says he is all this time the little maiden at mercy's side had been pondering her own peculiar problem what would you do if you had a little girl well let me see i'd teach her to knit and to sew and i'd comb her hair so nice and make her a silk frock with flounces and oh such a sweet little hat how nice and would you take her to market and to church and to see the dolls in mrs bicker's window yes dearest yes and never whip her my little girl would be very very good and oh so pretty and let her go to grandma's whenever she liked and not tell grandpa he's not to give her ha'pennies would you yes dear yes perhaps are your eyes very sore to day mercy they are so red but the little one of all was not interested in this turn of the conversation well why don't oo have a little boy a dead silence wont oo eh willy was put to the ground let us sing something do you like singing sweetheart the little fellow climbed back to her lap in excitement me sing me sing mammy told i a song me sing it oo and without further ceremony the little chap struck up the notes of a lullaby mercy had learned that same song as her mother crooned it long ago by the side of her cot a great wave of memory and love and sorrow and remorse in one swept over her it cost her a struggle not to break into a flood of tears and the little innocent face looked up at the ceiling as the sweet child voice sung the familiar words there was a new comer in the bar outside it was hugh ritson clad in a long ulster with the hood drawn over his hat he stepped up to the landlady who courtesied low from behind the counter so he has returned he said without greeting of any kind yes sir he is back sir he got home in the afternoon sir you told him nothing of any one calling no sir that is to say sir not to say told him sir but i did mention just mention sir that hugh ritson smiled coldly of course precisely were you more prudent with the girl oh yes sir being as you told me not to name it to the missy he is asleep i see yes sir he'd no sooner taken bite and sup than he dropped off in his chair same as you see sir and never a word since he must have traveled all night he did not explain oh no sir he on'y called for his cold meat and his ale sir and you see his old mother ain't noways in his confidence master said one of the countrymen on the bench nor you in mine my friend said hugh ritson facing about then turning again to the landlady he said tell him some one wants to speak with him or wait i'll tell him myself he stepped into the room with the sleeping man and closed the door after him luke sturgis said the landlady with sudden austerity i'll have you know as it's none of your business saying words what's onpleasant and me his mother too what's it you say cloven hoof he's a personable gentleman if he has got summat a matter with a foot and a clever face how an' ever chapter iii alone with the sleeping man hugh ritson stood and looked down at him intently the fire had burned to a steady glow of red coal without flame there was no other light in the room the sleeper began to stir with the uneasy movement of one who is struggling against the effect of a fixed gaze bent upon him then with a shake of the head and a shrug of the shoulders he sat up in his chair he tossed his hat back from his forehead and a tuft of wavy brown hair tumbled over it his head was held down and his eyes were on the fire hugh ritson took a step toward him and put one hand on his arm paul drayton he said and the man shrunk under his touch and slowly turned his face full upon him when their eyes met hugh ritson saw what he had expected to see the face of paul ritson in that low red light every feature was the same by the swift impulse of sense it seemed as if it could be the same man and no other as if paul drayton and paul ritson were one man drayton got on to his feet with an uncertain shuffle and then in a moment the hallucination was dispelled he kicked with a heavy boot at the slumbering coals and the fire broke into a sharp crackle and bright blaze the white light fell on his face it was a fine face brutalized by excess the features were strong manly and impressive what god had done was very good but the eyes were bleared and the lips discolored and the expression which might have been frank was sullen i don't wonder that you were tired after your journey it was a long one said hugh ritson he affected an easy manner but there was a tremor in his voice you caught the early scotch mail from penrith he added and drew a bench nearer to the fire and sat down drayton made a half dazed scrutiny of his visitor and said damme if you're not the fence as was here afore criss crossing at our old woman tell us your name the voice was husky but it had nevertheless a note or two of the voice of paul ritson that will be unnecessary said hugh ritson with complete self possession we've met before he added smiling the deuce we have where you slept at the pack horse at keswick rather more than a week ago said hugh drayton betrayed no surprise last saturday night you were active at the fire that almost destroyed the old mill at newlands drayton's sullen face was immovable by the way said hugh elevating his voice and affecting a sudden flow of spirits i owe you my personal thanks for your exertions what do you drink brandy going to the door he called for a bottle of brandy and glasses then again on monday night he added turning into the room you did me the honor to visit my own house drayton was still standing i know you he said shall i tell you your name hugh smiled with undisturbed humor that also will be unnecessary he said and leisurely drew off his gloves what d'ye want i ain't got no time to waste that's flat well let me see it's just ten o'clock said hugh ritson taking out his watch i want you to earn twenty pounds before twelve mr drayton gave vent to a grim laugh i'll pound it as i'm fly to what that means you're looking to earn two hundred before midnight mr drayton gave hugh a sidelong glance of great astuteness hugh lifted his eyebrows and shook his head money is not my object oh it ain't eh well i'm not afraid for you to know as it's mine very much so and mr drayton gave vent to another grim laugh mrs drayton entered the room at this moment and set down the brandy two glasses and a water bottle on the deal table let me offer you a little refreshment and hugh took up the brandy and poured out half a tumbler thankee thankee water say when but mr drayton stopped the dilution by snatching up his tumbler his manner had undergone a change the watchfulness of a ferocious creature dogged and all but trapped gave way to reckless abandonment bravado and audacity what's the lay he said with a chuckle to accompany a lady to kentish town junction and see her safe into the midnight train that's all drayton laughed outright of course it is he said the lady will be here shortly before midnight of course she will hugh ritson's face lost its smiles don't laugh like that i won't have it mr drayton made another application to the spirit bottle and then leaned toward hugh ritson over the arm of his chair look here he said it's just a matter o' thirty years gone august since my mother put me into swaddling clothes and deng my buttons if i'm wearing 'em yet what do you mean my friend said hugh drayton chuckled contemptuously speak out plain he said give the work its right name i ain't afraid for you to say it a man don't give twenty pounds for the like o' that not if he works for it honest same as me i'm a licensed victualer and a gentleman that's what i am if you want to know hugh ritson repudiated all unnecessary curiosity whereupon mr drayton again had recourse to the spirit bottle mentioned afresh his profession and pretensions and wound up by a relative inquiry and what do you call yourself hugh did not immediately gratify mr drayton's curiosity quite right mr drayton he said i know all about you shall i tell you why you went to cumberland remarking that it was easy to repeat an old woman's gossip mr drayton took out of his pocket a goat skin tobacco pouch and proceeded to charge a discolored meerschaum pipe thirty years ago said hugh ritson a young lady tried to drown herself and her child she was rescued and committed to an asylum her child a son was given into the care of the good woman with whom she had lodged mr drayton interrupted thankee but as the wice chairman says 'we'll take it as read' so we will hugh ritson nodded his head and continued while mr drayton smoked vigorously you have never heard of your mother from that hour to this but one day you were told by the young girl whom circumstances had cast on your foster mother's care that among the mountains of cumberland there lived another man who bore you the most extraordinary resemblance that excited your curiosity you had reasons for thinking that if your mother were alive she might be rich now you yourself had the misfortune to be poor and i'm not afraid for anybody to know it interrupted mr drayton come to the point honest look here we are like two hyenas i saw one day at the zoo one got a bone in his tooth at feeding time and blest if the other didn't fight for that bone i don't know how long and all well continued hugh ritson with a dubious smile that the cloud of smoke might have hidden from a closer observer being a man of spirit and not without knowledge of the world having inherited brains in short from the parents who bequeathed you nothing else mr drayton puffed volumes then poured himself half a tumbler of the raw spirit and tossed it off you determined on seeing if after all this were only a fortuitous resemblance mr drayton raised his hand i am a licensed victualer that's what i am and i ain't flowery he said in an apologetic tone i hain't had the chance of it being as i'd no schooling but deng me you've just hit it and the gentleman who could not be flowery shook hands effusively with the gentleman who could precisely mr drayton precisely said hugh ritson he paused and watched drayton closely that worthy had removed his pipe and was staring with stupid eyes and open mouth into the fire but you found nothing how d'ye know your face at this moment says so pooh don't you go along trusting this here time piece for the time o' day it ain't been brought up in habits o' truthfulness same as yours hugh ritson laughed you and i are meant to be friends mr drayton he said but let us first understand each other your idea that you could find your parents in cumberland was a pure fallacy eh why because your mother is dead drayton shook off the stupor of liquor and betrayed a keen if momentary interest the book of the asylum in which she was confined after the attempted suicide contains the record but she escaped interrupted drayton contains the record of her escape and subsequent recovery dead the body was picked out of the river recognized by the authorities as that of the unknown woman and buried in the name she gave what name said drayton hugh ritson's face underwent a momentary change that is indifferent he said i forget sure you forget said drayton couldn't be ritson eh hugh struck the table assuredly not the name was not ritson the tone irritated mr drayton he glanced down with a look that seemed to say that hugh ritson had his maker to thank for giving him the benefit of an infirm foot hugh ritson mollified him by explaining that if he had any curiosity as to the name he could discover it for himself besides said hugh what matter about the name if your mother is dead that's true said drayton who being now appeased began to see that his anger had been puerile depend upon it your father wherever he is is a cipher said hugh ritson drayton got on to his feet and trudged the floor uneasily an idea had occurred to him the person picked out of the river may have been another woman i've heard of such possibly but the chance of error is worth little to you hugh looked uncomfortable as he said this but drayton saw nothing bah what matter said drayton and determined to cudgel his brains no longer he reached for the brandy and drank another half glass there was then an interchange of deep amity tell me said hugh what passed at the ghyll on monday night the ghyll monday that was the night of the snow what passed nothing why did you go wanted to see your mother saw your brother one night late at the door of the parson's house saw you at the fire at the fire certainly stood a matter of a dozen yards away when that young buck of a stableman drove up with the trap what excuse for going blest if i remember summat or other knocked and no one came i don't know how long and all i stood cooling my heels at the door then i saw a light coming from a room on the first floor and up i went and knocked 'come in' says somebody i went in withered old party got up black crape and beads you know but afore i could speak she reeled like a top and fell all of a heap blest if the old girl didn't take me for a ghost mr drayton elevated his eyebrows and added with emphasis i got out and on the way back you frightened a young lady in the lane who like my mother mistook you for the ghost of my brother paul well that young lady was married to my brother this morning they are now on their way to london they intend to leave england on wednesday next and they mean to pass to night in your house mr drayton's eyebrows went up again it is certainly hard to understand but look and hugh ritson handed to drayton the telegram he had received from bonnithorne that worthy examined it minutely back and front with bleared and bewildered eyes and then looked to his visitor for explanation the lady must not leave england said hugh drayton steadied himself and tried hard to look appalled upon my soul you make my flesh creep he said what do you want for your twenty pounds speak out plain i'm not flowery i'm not i'm a licensed victualer and a gentleman what do i want only that you should send the lady home again by the first train drayton began to laugh you see there was no cause for alarm said hugh with an innocent smile drayton's laughter became boisterous i am to decoy the young thing away by making her believe as i'm her husband eh mr drayton you are a shrewd fellow and what about the husband ain't he another shrewd fellow leave him to me when the time comes make no delay don't expose yourself unnecessarily wear that ulster you have on at present say as little as possible nothing if practicable get the lady into the fly that shall be waiting at the door drive to the station book her to keswick put her into the carriage at the last moment then clear away with all expedition the midnight train never stops this side of bedford drayton was shuffling across the room chuckling audibly he he he haw haw so i'm to leave her at the station eh poor young thing i hain't got the heart i hain't got it in me to be so cruel no no i couldn't be such a vagabond of a husband he he haw haw and on the poor thing's wedding day too hugh ritson rose to his feet if you go an inch further than the station you'll repent it to your dying day he said once more bringing down his fist heavily on the table at this drayton chuckled and crowed yet louder and declared that it would be necessary to have another half glass in order to take the taste of the observation out of his mouth then his laughter ceased look here you want me to do a job as can only be done by one man alive and what do you offer me twenty pounds keep it he said it won't pass sir the fire had burned very low the cheerless room was dense with smoke and noisome with the smell of dead tobacco drayton buttoned up to the throat the long coat he wore i've summat on he said good night the sound of children's voices came from the bar the little ones were going home good night missy and thank you it was a woman's voice good night mercy cried the children drayton was opening the door think again said hugh ritson you run no risk eleven forty five prompt will do chapter iv when drayton went out hugh ritson walked into the bar the gossips had gone only the landlady was there the door to the room opposite now stood open mrs drayton said hugh have you ever seen this face before he took a medallion from his pocket and held it out to her lor's a mercy me cried the landlady why it's her herself as plain as plain except for the nun's bonnet is that the lady who lodged with you at pimlico the mother of paul as sure as sure lor's yes and to think the poor young dear is dead and gone it's thirty years since but it do make me cry and my husband he's gone too my husband he said to me 'martha' he said 'martha ' the landlady's garrulity was interrupted by a light scream hugh hugh mercy fisher stood in the door way with wonder stricken eyes and heaving breast in an instant the poor little soul had rushed into hugh ritson's arms with the flutter of a frightened bird oh i knew you would come i was sure you would come she said and dried her eyes and then cried again and then dried them afresh and lifted her pouting lips to be kissed hugh ritson made no display a shade of impatience crossed his face at first but it was soon gone he tried to look pleased and bent his head and touched the pale lips slightly you look wan you poor little thing he said quietly what ails you nothing nothing now that you have come only you were so long in coming so very long he called up a brave word to answer her but you see i keep my word little woman he said and smiled down at her and nodded his head cheerfully and you have come to see me at last all this way to see poor little me the mute weariness that had marked her face fled at that moment before a radiant smile one must do something for those who risk so much for one he said and laughed a little ah the first surprise over the joy of that moment was beyond the gift of speech her arms encircled his neck and she looked up at his face in silence and with brightening eyes and so you found the time long and tedious he said i had no one to talk to she said with a blank expression why you ungrateful little thing you had good mrs drayton here and her son and all the smart young fellows of hendon who came to drink at the bar and say pretty things to the little bar maid and it's not that i had no one who knew you she said and dropped her voice to a whisper but you go out sometimes into the village to london he said no i never go out never now then your eyes are really worse it's not my eyes but never mind oh i knew you would not forget me only sometimes of an evening when the dusk fell in and i sat by the fire all alone something would say 'he doesn't want me' 'he won't come for me' but that was not true was it why no of course not and then when the children came the neighbor's children and i put the little darlings to bed and they said their prayers to me and i tried to pray too sometimes i was afraid to pray and then and then she glanced round watchfully and dropped her voice something would say 'why didn't he leave me alone i was so happy' you morbid little woman you shall be happy again you are happy now are you not he said her eyes bleared and red but bright with the shafts of love looked up at him in the dumb joy that is perfect happiness ah she said and dropped her comely head on his breast but you should have taken walks long healthy happy walks he said i did while the roses bloomed and the dahlias and things and i saved so many of them against you would come moss roses and wild white roses but you were so long coming and they withered and then i couldn't throw them away because you know they were yours so i pressed them in the book you gave me see let me show you she stepped aside eagerly to pick up a little gilt edged book from the table in the inner room he followed her mechanically hardly heeding her happy prattle and was there no young fellow in all hendon to make those lonely walks of yours more cheerful she was opening her book with nervous fingers and stopped to look up with blank eyes eh no handsome young fellow who whispered that you were a pretty little thing and had no right to go moping about by yourself none eh her old look of weariness was creeping back come mercy tell the truth you sly little thing eh she was fumbling his withered roses with nervous fingers her throat felt parched he looked down at her saddening face and then muttered as if speaking to himself i told that bonnithorne this hole and corner was no place for the girl he should have taken her to london the girl's heart grew sick the book was closed and dropped back on to the table and now mercy said hugh ritson i want you to be a good little woman and do as i bid you and not speak a word will you the child face brightened and mercy nodded her head a little tear rolling out of one gleaming eye at the same moment she put her hand in the pocket of her muslin apron and took out a pair of knitted mittens and tried to draw them on to hugh's wrists he looked at the gift and smiled and said i won't need these not to day i mean see i wear long gloves with fur wristbands there i'll store your mittens away in my pocket what a sad little soul crying again mercy's pretty dreams were dying one by one she lifted now a timid hand until it rested lightly on his breast listen i'm going out but i'll soon be back i must talk with mrs drayton and i've something to pay her you know the timid hand fell to the girl's side when i return there may be some friends with me a lady and a gentleman but i want to see them alone quite alone and i don't want them to see you do you understand a great dumb sadness was closing in on mercy's heart but they will soon be gone and then to morrow you and i must talk again and try to arrange matters so that you won't be quite so lonely but will stir about and see the doctor for your eyes and get well again and try to forget forget said the girl faintly her parched throat took away her voice i mean that is to say i was hoping of course i mean forget all the trouble in cumberland and now get away to bed like a good little girl i must be off ah how late see a quarter to eleven and my watch is slow he walked into the bar buttoning up his coat to his ears the girl followed him listlessly mrs drayton was washing glasses behind the counter mind you send this little friend of mine to bed very soon said hugh to the landlady look how red her eyes are and keep a good fire in this cozy parlor on the left you are to have visitors you need not trouble about a bedroom they won't stay long let me see what do they say is the time of your last up train to london the last one starts away at half past twelve said the landlady very good i'll see you again mrs drayton good night mercy and do keep a brighter face there kiss me now good night what a silly affectionate little goose and mind you are in bed and asleep before i return or i shall be that angry yes i shall you never saw me angry well never mind good night the door opened and closed mercy went back into the room it was cheerless and empty and the children's happy voices lived in it no more the girl's heart ached with a dull pain that had never a pang at all but was dumb and dead and cold and mercy was all alone perhaps he was only in fun when he said that about walking out with somebody and trying to forget and not being seen she thought yes he must have been only in fun she thought because he knew how i waited and waited then she took up again the book that he had hardly glanced at it fell open at a yellow dried up rose that had left the stain of its heart's juice on the white leaf yes he was only in fun she said and then laughed a little and then a big drop fell on to the open page and on to the dead flower then she tried to be very brave i must not cry it makes my eyes oh so sore i must get them well and strong oh yes i must be well and strong against against then she lifted her head slowly where she stood alone and a smile like a summer breeze on still water rippled over her mouth he kissed me she thought and he came to see me all this long long way a lovely dream shone in her face now and if he does not come again until until then he will be glad oh he will be very glad the thought of a future hour when the poor little soul should be rich with something of her own that would be dearest of all because not all her own shone like a sleeping child's vision in her face she went out into the bar and lighted a candle so that's your sweetheart not the lawyer man eh said mrs drayton bustling about i've no call to hide my face now not now that he has come have i said mercy well he is free of his money and i'se just been hoping you get some of it for as i says you want things bad and them as has the looking to it should find 'em as is only reasonable mercy did as she had been bidden she went off to her bedroom but her head was too full of thoughts for sleep she examined her face in the glass and smiled and blushed at it because he called it pretty it was prettier than ever to her own eyes now after half an hour she remembered that she had left the book on the table in the parlor and crept down stairs to recover it when she was on the landing at the bottom she heard a hurried knock at the outer door thereafter all her dreams died in an instant chapter v when hugh ritson stepped out into the road the night was dark fresh from the yellow light of the inn his eyes could barely descry the footpath or see the dim black line of the hedge the atmosphere was damp the moisture in the air gathered in great beads on his eyebrows and beard stiffening them with frost it was bitterly cold the mist that rose from the river spread itself over the cold open wastes of marshy ground that lay to the right and to the left the gloomy road was thick with half frozen mud hugh ritson buttoned his coat yet closer and started at a brisk pace no time to lose he thought if i've to be at the station when the north train goes through would have dearly liked to keep an eye on my gentleman should have done it but for the girl 'summat on' eh what is it i wonder it might be useful to know with a cutting wind at his back he walked faster as his eyes grew familiar with the darkness he was thinking that bonnithorne's telegram might be an error perhaps it had even been tampered with it was barely conceivable that paul and greta had ever so much as heard of the hawk and heron and what possible inducement could they have to sleep in hendon when they would be so near to london his mind went back to mercy fisher at that moment she was dreaming beautiful dreams of how happy she was very soon to make him he was thinking with vexation that the girl was a connecting link with the people in cumberland yes and the only link too could it be that mercy no the idea of mercy's disloyalty to him was really too ridiculous if he could get to the station before the train from the north was due to stop there he would see for himself whether paul and greta alighted if they did not as they must be in that train he would get into it also and go on with them to london bonnithorne might have blundered the journey was long and the roads were heavy for walking it seemed a far greater distance than he had thought at the angle of a gate and a thick brier hedge he struck a match and read the time by his watch eleven o'clock too late if the watch were not more than a minute slow at that moment he heard the whistle of a train and between the whirs of the wind he heard the tinkle of the signal bell too late indeed he was still a quarter of a mile from the station still he held on his way without hope for his purpose yet quickening his pace to a sharp run he had come within three hundred yards of the station when he heard an unearthly scream followed in an instant by a great clamor and tumult of human voices shrieks shouts groans sobs wails all were mingled together in one agonized cry that rent the thick night air asunder hugh ritson ran faster then he saw haggard men and women appearing and disappearing before him in the light of a fire that panted on the ground like an overthrown horse the north train had been wrecked within a dozen yards from the station the engine and three of the front carriages had broken from their couplings and plunged on to the bank the last four carriages free of the fatal chain had kept the rails and were standing unharmed above women who had been dragged through the tops of the overturned carriages fled away with white faces into the darkness of the fields men too with panic stricken eyes sat down on the grass helpless and useless some resolute souls roused to activity were pulling at the carriages to set them right men from the station came with lanterns and rescued the injured and put them to lie out of harm's way the scene was harrowing and only two of its incidents are material to this history over all the rest the clamor the tumult the agony the abject fear and the noble courage let a veil be drawn fate had brought together in that hour of disaster three men whose lives hitherto apart were henceforth to be bound up as one life for good or ill hugh ritson rushed here and there like a man distraught he peered into every face he caught up a lantern that some one had set down and ran to and fro in the darkness stooping to let the light fall on those on the ground holding up the red glare to the windows of the uninjured carriages at that moment all his frozen soul seemed to melt face to face with the pitiless work of destiny his own heartless schemes disappeared at last he saw the face he looked for then he dropped the lantern to his side and turned the glass of it from him stay here greta said a voice he knew i shall be back with you presently let me lend them a hand over yonder the man went by him in the darkness hark hugh ritson heard a cry from the field beyond the bank it was there that they had placed the injured help help i am robbed help came out of the darkness where are you asked another voice here help help hugh ritson ran toward the place whence the first voice came and saw the figure of a man stooping over something that lay on the ground at the same moment another man rushed up and laid strong hold of the stooping figure there was a short sharp struggle the two men were of one stature one strength there was a sound as of cloth ripped asunder at the next moment one of the men went by like the wind and was lost in the blackness of the fields but hugh ritson had held up the lantern as the man passed and caught one swift glimpse of his face he knew him a group had gathered about the injured person on the ground and about the other man who had struggled to defend him could you not hold the scoundrel said one i held him till his coat came to pieces in my hand see here said the other hugh ritson knew the voice a piece of irish frieze i should say feeling it you must have gripped him by the lappel of his ulster let me keep this i am a police sergeant what is your name sir paul ritson and your address i was on my way to morley's hotel trafalgar square what place is this hendon could one get accommodation here for the night a lady is with me best go up by the twelve thirty sir the lady is too much worn and excited any hotel inn lodging house a porter came up the hawk and heron's handiest a mile sir drayton it's him as keeps it he's here somewhere drayton calling can you get me a fly my good fellow yes sir the police sergeant moved off then i may look for you at the hawk and heron he said hugh ritson heard all he kept the lantern down in the darkness not a face of that group was seen of any man a quarter of an hour later hugh ritson panting for breath was knocking at the door of the inn the landlady within fumbled with the iron bar behind it come quick said hugh the door opened and he stepped in sharply bathed in perspiration is your son back he said catching his breath back sir no sir it's a mercy if he gets home afore morning sir he's noways stop your clatter the girl is in her room go and turn the key on her it was at that moment that mercy having stood an instant at the bottom of the stairs had ventured nervously into the bar turning about hugh ritson came face to face with her at the sight of her his crimsoning cheeks became white with wrath didn't i tell you to be in bed he muttered in a low hoarse whisper i've only come for i came down for hugh don't be angry with me come get back then don't stand there quick and mind you lock your door yes i'm going you wouldn't be angry with me would you well no perhaps not only get off and quick do you hear why don't you go i only came down for i only came god what foolery is this the girl's fainting never mind here landlady bring a light lead the way she's not too heavy to carry upstairs with you what a snail you are old woman which room another knock at the outer door another and another in rapid succession i'm a coming i'm a coming cried the landlady from the floor above she bustled down the stairs as fast as her stiff joints would let her but the knock came again mercy me mercy me and whoever is it damme move your bones and let me in the door flew open with pressure from without ghastly white yet dripping with perspiration his breath coming in short thick gusts his neck bare his shirt collar torn aside the lappel of the frieze ulster gone and the rent of the red flannel lining exposed paul drayton entered he was sober now where is he with an oath i'm here said hugh ritson walking through the bar and into the bar room to the right and candle in hand drayton followed him trying to laugh am i in time of course you are with a hard smile fearing i might be late of course you were ran all the way of course you did what are you sniggering and mocking at with another oath hugh ritson dropped his banter and pointed without a word to the torn ulster and the disordered shirt collar drayton glanced down at his dress in the light of the candle crossed the fields for shortness and caught in a bramble bush he said muttering drop it said hugh there's no time for it look here drayton i'm a downright man don't try it on with me as you say it won't pass shall i tell you where the collar of that coat is now it's at the police station drayton made an uneasy movement and glanced up furtively there was no mistaking what he saw in hugh ritson's face i've my own suspicions as to what caused that accident said hugh drayton shuddered and shrunk back no damme that shows what you are though show me the man as allus suspects others of lying and i'll show you a liar show me the man as allus suspects others of stealing and i'll show you a thief you suspect me of that d'ye i know you now no matter said hugh impatiently your sense of the distinction between crimes is a shade too nice one crime i do not suspect you of i saw you commit it is that enough drayton was silent you'll go to the station with the lady the gentleman will go to london with me they are to come here after all though my first advice was a blunder i'll take the twenty drayton mumbled will you now we'll discuss that matter afterward drayton seemed stupefied for a moment then he lifted his haggard face and grinned hugh ritson understood him in an instant no tricks i tell you if you don't put the lady in the train the right train and be back here at half past one to morrow you shall improve your acquaintance with the old bailey drayton carried his eyes slowly up to hugh ritson's face then dropped them suddenly if i'm lagged it will be a lifer he muttered he fumbled his torn ulster i must change my coat he said no she'll see the rent so much the better but the people at the junction will see it what matter you will be there as paul ritson not paul drayton drayton began to laugh to chuckle to crow hush the sound of carriage wheels came from the road they're here said hugh ritson keep you out of sight as you value your liberty do you hear take care that he doesn't see you and that she doesn't see you until he is gone drayton was tramping about the floor in the intensity of his energy here's the bar slide i'll just lift it an inch not half an inch said hugh and he blew out the candle then he took the key out of the inside of the lock and put it on the outside what am i to be a prisoner in my own house said drayton i'll put the key on the bar slide whispered hugh when you hear the door close after us let yourself out not a moment sooner the carriage wheels stopped outside there was a sound as of the driver jumping from the box then there came a knock hugh ritson stepped back to drayton and whispered this is the very man who tried to hold you keep you close chapter vi this way sir this way my lady we knew you was a coming so we kep' a nice warm fire in the parlor this way my lady and mind the step up yes it air dark but it's clean sir yes it is sir but there's a light in here sir paul and greta followed the landlady through the dark bar we'll find our way my good woman ah and how cozy you are here as warm as toast on a cold night thank you thank you and why surely we've we've surprised you did you say you were expecting somebody ah i see mrs drayton was backing out of the room with a pallid face and twitching at the string of her apron when she got to the bar she was trembling from head to foot i don't believe in ghosts she muttered to herself but if so be as i did believe in ghosts and afeart of 'em i don't know as lor's a mercy me who was a saying as our paul was like some one and now here's some one as is like our paul and as much a match as two pewters on'y one more smarter mayhap and studdier whatever ails the old lady said greta faintly paul stood a moment and laughed strange but we can't trouble now what a mercy we're safe and unharmed a fearful sight i'll never never forget it said greta and she covered her face paul stepped to the door the flyman was bringing in the luggage leave the boxes in the bar driver there that will do many of them eh rather here's for yourself why bless my soul who's this what hugh hugh ritson walked into the room calm and smiling and held out his hand to greta and then to his brother i came up to meet your train he said in answer to the look of inquiry well that was good of you of course you know of the accident how did you find us here i heard at the station that a lady and gentleman had gone to the hawk and heron and you followed well hugh i must say that was brotherly of you after all wasn't it greta yes dear said greta faintly her voice trembling paul observed her agitation my poor girl you are upset i don't wonder at it you must get off for the night hugh you must excuse her it was a terrible scene you know our new life begins with a great shock to you greta never mind that only means that the bright days are before us paul stepped to the door again and called to mrs drayton here my good landlady take my wife to her room the landlady hobbled up room sir room the gentleman didn't say nothing take the lady to your best room upstairs said hugh with a significant look greta was going her step was slow and uncertain won't you say good night greta said hugh good night she said so faintly as hardly to be heard the brothers looked after her god bless her said paul fervently the days before her shall be brighter if i can make them so hugh ritson closed the door paul he said you and your wife must never meet again paul ritson turned red and then ashy pale a scarcely perceptible tremble of the eyelids then a jaunty laugh and then an appalling solemnity what d'ye mean man he said with a vacant stare sit down and listen said hugh seating himself and lifting the poker to draw the fire together quick tell me what it is said paul again paul don't chafe we are hot tempered men both at bottom said hugh and his eye perused his brother with searching power don't look at me like that said paul don't try to frighten me speak out and quickly be calm said hugh bah you take me blindfold to the edge of a precipice and tell be to 'be calm' you are wrong i find you there and remove the bandage said hugh quick what is it in another moment i shall cry out hugh ritson rose stiffly to his feet paul did you tell greta she was marrying a bastard with one look of anguish paul fell back mute and trembling did you tell her said hugh with awful emphasis paul's eyes were on the ground his head bent forward he was silent i thought you did not mean to tell her said hugh coldly his eyes looked steadfastly at paul's drooping head i think so still paul said nothing but drew his breath hard hugh watched him closely to marry a woman under a false pretense is it the act of an honorable man is it a cheat give it what name you will paul drew himself up his lips were compressed and he smiled is this all he asked why did you not tell her said hugh because i had sworn to tell no one you will read that secret as you have read the other hugh smiled say rather because you dare not do so because had you told her she had never become your wife paul laughed vacantly we shall see my own lips are sealed but yours are free you shall tarnish the memory of our father and blacken the honor of our mother you shall humble me and rob me of my wife's love if you will and can saying this paul stepped hastily to the door flung it open and cried greta greta hugh followed him and caught him arm what are you doing he said in a hoarse whisper be quiet i tell you be quiet paul turned about you say i am afraid to tell her you charge me with trapping her into marrying me you shall tell her yourself now here and before my very face come in and shut the door said hugh it would do no good and perhaps some harm no matter you shall tell her i challenge you to tell her come in and listen to me said hugh sullenly and putting himself between paul and the door he closed it there is more to think of than what greta may feel he added have you nothing to say to me paul's impetuous passion cooled suddenly i have made you atonement he said faintly and dropped into a seat atonement hugh ritson smiled bitterly when you return you will see said paid his eyes once more on the ground you are thinking of the deed of attorney i have heard of it already said hugh a cold smile played on his compressed lips it was all that was left to do said paul his voice hardly stronger than a whisper his proud spirit was humbled and his challenge dead paul you have robbed me of my inheritance consciously deliberately you have stood in my place you stand there still and you leave me your pitiful deed by way of amends a black frown crossed hugh ritson's face atonement are you not ashamed of such mockery what atonement is there for a wrong like that i did it for the best god knows i did said paul his head fell on the table hugh ritson stood over him pale with suppressed wrath was it best to hold my place until my place was no longer worth holding and then to leave it with an empty show of generosity power of attorney what right have you to expect that i will take that from you take my own from the man who robbed me of it and to receive it back on my knees to accept it as a gift whereof the generosity of giving is yours and the humility of receiving is mine a strong shudder passed over paul's shoulders i was helpless i was helpless he said understand your true position your legal position you were your mother's illegitimate son i did it to protect her honor you mean to hide her shame as you will i was helpless and i did it for the best hugh ritson's face grew dark was it best to be a perjured liar he said paul gasped but did not reply was it best to be a thief paul leaped to his feet god give me patience he muttered was it best to be an impostor stop for god's sake stop was it best to be a living lie and all for the sake of honor honor forsooth is it in perjury and robbery that honor lies paul strode about the room in silence ashy pale his face convulsed and ugly then his countenance softened and his voice was broken as he said hugh i have done you too much wrong already don't drive me into more don't don't i beseech you hugh laughed lightly a little trill that echoed in the silent room at that heartless sound all the soul in paul ritson seemed to freeze no longer abashed he lifted his head and put his foot down firmly so be it he said and the cloud of anguish fell from his face i say it was to save our mother's good name that i consented to do what i did consented said hugh elevating his eyelids you don't believe me very well let it pass you say my atonement is a mockery very well let us say it is so you say i have kept your place until it is no longer worth keeping you mean that i have impoverished your estate that is not true and you know it is not true if the land is mortgaged you yourself have had the money and who had a better right to it said hugh and he laughed again paul waved his hand and gulped down the wrath that was rising you have led me the life of the damned you know well what bitter cup you have made me drink if i have stood to the world as my father's heir you have eaten up the inheritance if my father's house was mine i was no more than a cipher in it i have had the shadow and you the substance you have undermined me inch by inch and meantime i have been as secret as the grave said hugh and once more he laughed lightly god knows your purpose you do nothing without one said paul but it is not i alone that have suffered do you think that all this has been going on under our mother's eyes without her seeing it hugh ritson dropped the bantering tone paul's face grew to an awful solemnity when our father died it was to be her honor or mine to die with him that was the legacy of his sin heaven forgive him i did not hesitate but since that hour she has wasted away is this my fault hugh asked heaven knows and heaven will judge between you said paul she could bear it no longer paul's voice trembled as he added she's gone there was a moment's silence it was as if an angel went by weeping i know it said hugh coldly she has taken the veil i have since seen her paul glanced up she is in the catholic convent at westminster said hugh paul's face quivered miserable man but for you how happy she might have been you are wrong said hugh it came of her own misdeed and yours paul strode toward his brother with uplifted hand not another word of that he said and his voice was low and deep how could she examine her conscience and be happy she had put an impostor in the place of my father's heir said hugh she had put there your father's first born son said paul it is false she had put there her bastard by another man silent and awful paul stood a moment with an expression of agony so horrible that for an instant even hugh ritson quailed before it go on he said huskily and crouched down into his seat your mother was married before said hugh and her marriage was annulled it was invalid a child was born of that union paul lifted his head i won't believe it it is true and you shall believe it paul's heart sickened with dread your father married again and had a daughter your mother married again and had a son your father's daughter is now living shall i tell you who she is she is your wife the woman you have married to day paul sprung to his feet it is a lie he cried see for yourself said hugh ritson and taking three papers from his pocket he threw them on to the table they were the copies of certificates which bonnithorne had given him paul glanced at them with vacant and wandering eyes fell back in his chair dropped his head on to the table and groaned oh god can this thing be when your mother told you that you were an illegitimate son she omitted to say by what father that was natural in her but cruel to you i knew the truth from the first then you are a scoundrel confessed cried paul hugh rolled his head slightly and made a poor pretense to smile i knew how she had passed from one man to another i knew what her honor counted for and yet i was silent silent though by silence i lost my birthright say now if you will which of us you or i has been the true guardian of our mother's name paul got up again abject crushed trembling in every limb man man don't gnaw my heart away unsay your words have pity on me and confess that it is a lie a black foul lie think of the horror of it only think of it and have pity it is true then paul fell on his knees and caught his brother by the arm hugh hugh my brother confess it is false don't let my flesh consume away with horror don't let me envy the very dead who lie at peace in their graves pity her if you have no pity left for me i would save you from a terrible sin paul rose to his feet now i know it is a lie he said and all the abject submission of his bearing fell away in one instant hugh ritson's face flushed there is that here said paul throwing up his head and striking his breast that tells me it is false hugh smiled coldly and regained his self possession my mother knew all if greta had been my half sister would she have stood by and witnessed our love hugh waved his hand deprecatingly your mother was as ignorant of the propinquity as you were robert lowther was dead before she settled at newlands the survivors knew nothing of each other the secret of that early and ill fated marriage was buried with him destiny itself would have prevented it for destiny shapes its own ends and shapes them for the best said paul yes destiny is shaping them now said hugh here and in me this is the point to which the pathways of your lives have tended they meet here and part paul's ashy face smiled then nature would have prevented it he said if this thing had been true do you think we should not have known it she and i in the natural recoil of our own hearts when true hearts meet there is that within which sanctions their love and says it is good that is heaven's own license no sanction of the world or the world's law no earthly marriage is like to that for it is the marriage first made by nature itself our hearts have met hers and mine and the same nature has sanctioned our love and sanctified it and against that last that first that highest arbiter do you ask me to take the evidence of these poor pitiful papers away with them paul's eyes were bright his face had lost its shadows that is very beautiful no doubt said hugh and he smiled deeply but i warn you to beware i have no fear said paul see to it i tell you these lofty emotions leave a void that only a few homely facts can fill verify them i will please god accept my statements and these papers or disprove both i will disprove them meantime take care leave your wife in this house until morning but do you go elsewhere what paul's anger was boiling up if you have wronged greta i have done her no wrong said paul growing fiercer i say if you have wronged her and would have it in your power to repair the injury you must pass this night apart hugh cried paul in white rage rising afresh to his feet you have tortured me and broken the heart of my mother you have driven me from my home and from the world you have thrust yourself between me and the woman who loves me and now when i am stripped of all else but that woman's love and am going out to a strange land a stranger and with empty hands you would take her from me also and leave me naked i would save you from a terrible sin said hugh ritson once again out of my way cried paul in a thick voice and he lifted his clinched fist take care i tell you said hugh paul looked dangerous his forehead contracted into painful lines his quick breathing beat on hugh's face for the love of heaven get out of my way but with awful strength and fury his fist fell at that moment and hugh ritson was dashed to the ground in an instant paul had lifted his foot to trample him but he staggered back in horror at the impulse his face ghastly white his eyes red like the sun above snow then there was silence and then paul gasped in a flood of emotion get up get up hugh hugh get up he darted to the door and threw it open come in come in will nobody come he cried the landlady was in the room at a stride she had been standing listening and quivering behind the door in another moment greta hurried down stairs and hastened to paul's side paul was leaning against the wall his face buried in his hands take him away he groaned before i rue the day that i saw him hugh ritson rose to his feet paul what has happened cried greta take him away and still paul covered his eyes from the sight of what he had done and had been tempted to do hugh what is it hugh ritson stepped to the door ask your husband he said with emphasis and an appalling calmness and remember this night you shall never forget it then he halted out of the room chapter vii hugh ritson walked to the bare room opposite the handle of the door did not turn in his hand drayton held it at the other side and with head bent low he crouched there and listened who is it he whispered when hugh ritson unlocked the door and pushed at it let me in said hugh sullenly does he suspect whispered drayton when the door closed again did he follow me what are you going to do for a fellow damme but i'll be enough for him and drayton groped in the dark room among the dead cinders on the hearth and picked up the poker you fool said hugh in a low voice put that thing down isn't he after me d'ye think i'm going to be taken let him come here and see drayton tramped the room and the floor creaked beneath his heavy tread speak lower you poltroon hugh whispered huskily he knows nothing about you he has never heard of you be quiet do you hear there was a light nervous knock at the door who's there said hugh it's only me sir said mrs drayton from without breathing audibly and speaking faintly amid gusts of breath hugh ritson opened the door and the landlady entered lor's a mercy me whatever ails the gentleman oh is it yourself in the dark paul i'm that fearsome i declare i shiver and quake at nothing and the gentleman so like you too i never did see nothing like it i'm sure hush stop your clatter what does he say said hugh the gentleman he says and says and says as nothing and nothing and nothing will make him leave the lady this night he'll think better of that and wherever can i put them and me on'y one room forby paul's and no cleaning and airing and nothing that's what worrits me hold your tongue put the lady in your son's room your son won't need it to night that's where i did put her very well leave her there and the gentleman too belike the gentleman will go back with me come get away quite right on'y there's no airing and cleaning and i declare i'm that fearsome hugh ritson had taken the landlady by the shoulders and was pushing her out of the room one moment he whispered and drew her back anything doing upstairs upstairs the bed airing the girl has she made any noise yet is she conscious not as i know of i went up and listened and never a sound deary me deary me i'm that fearsome go up again and put your ear to the door i'm afeart she'll never come round and her in that way and weak too and at that instant there came from the dark road the sound of carriage wheels approaching hugh ritson thrust the landlady out of the room slammed the door to and locked it what's that said drayton in a husky whisper who do they want you've not rounded on a fellow eh it's the carriage that is to take you and the lady to kentish town said hugh hush listen the driver rapped at the door with the end of his whip and shouted from his seat heigho heigho ready for kentish town eleven o'clock struck this half hour then he could be heard beating his crossed arms under his armpits to warm his hands the fool muttered hugh can't he keep his tongue in his mouth quite right shouted mrs drayton in a shrill voice putting her face to the window pane belike it's for the gentleman she explained to herself and then with candle in hand she began to mount the stairs the door of the room to the left opened and paul ritson came out his great strength seemed to be gone he reeled like a drunken man landlady he said when does your last train go up to london at half past twelve said mrs drayton from two steps up the stairs can i get a fly my good woman at this hour of the night the fly's at the door sir just come sir paul went back into the room where he had left his wife the two men in the dark room opposite listened intently be quiet whispered hugh ritson i knew he must think better of it he is going keep still five minutes more and you start away with the lady for kentish town he shall walk to the station with me the instant we leave the house you go to the lady and say 'i have changed my mind greta we must go together come' not a word more hurry her into the fly and away easier said nor done say i chapter viii alone with greta paul kissed her fervently and his head fell on her shoulder the strong man was as feeble as a child now he was prostrate the black lie is like poison in my veins he said what is it said greta and she tried to soothe him a lie more foul than man ever uttered before more cruel more monstrous what is it dearest said greta again with her piteous imploring face close to his i know it's a lie my heart tells me it is a lie the very stones cry out that it is a lie tell me what it is said greta and she embraced him tenderly but even while he was struggling with the poison of one horrible word it was mastering him he put his wife from him with a strong shudder as if her proximity stung him her bosom heaved she looked appealingly into his face if it is false she said whatever it is why need it trouble you that is true my darling he said gulping down his fear and taking greta in his arms and trying to laugh lightly why indeed why need it trouble me can you not tell me she said with an upward look of entreaty she was thinking of what hugh ritson had said of an impediment to their marriage why should i tell you what is false then let us dismiss the thought of it she said soothingly why yes of course let us dismiss the thought of it darling and he laughed a loud hollow laugh his forehead was damp she wiped away the cold sweat his temples burned she put her cool hand on them he was the very wreck of his former self the ruin of a man would that i could he muttered to himself then tell me she said it is my right to know it i am your wife now he drew himself away she clung yet closer paul there can be no secrets between you and me nothing can be kept back heavenly father he cried uplifting a face distorted with agony if you can not dismiss it let it not stand between us said greta could it be true that there had been an impediment my darling it would do no good to tell you when i took you to be my wife i vowed to protect and cherish you shall i keep my vow if i burden you with a black lie that will drive the sunshine out of your life look at me look at me greta's breast heaved heavily but she smiled with a piteous sweetness as she laid her head on his breast and said no while i have you no lie can do that paul made no answer an awful burden of speech was on his tongue in the silence they heard the sound of weeping it was as if some poor woman were sobbing her heart out in the room above dearest when two hearts are made one in marriage they are made one indeed said greta in a soft voice henceforth the thought of the one is the thought of both the happiness of one is the happiness of both the sorrow of one is the sorrow of both nothing comes between joy is twofold when both share it and only grief is less for being borne by two death itself cruel relentless death itself even death knits that union closer and in sunshine and storm in this world and in the next the bond is ever the same the tie of the purest friendship is weak compared with this tie and even the bond of blood is less strong oh god of heaven this is too much said paul paul if this union of thought and deed of joy and grief begins with marriage and does not end even with death shall we now here at the threshold of our marriage do it wrong a great sob choked paul's utterance i can not tell you he cried i have sworn an oath an oath then surely this present trouble was not that which hugh ritson has threatened greta if our union means anything it means trust trust me my darling i am helpless my tongue is sealed i dare not speak no not even to you scarcely to god himself there was silence for a moment that is enough she said very tenderly and now the tears coursed down her own cheeks i will not ask again i do not wish to know you shall forget that i asked you come dearest kiss me think no more of this come now and she drew his head down to hers paul threw himself into a chair his prostration was abject come dearest said greta soothingly be a man there is worse to come he said what matter said greta and smiled i shall not fear if i have you beside me i can bear it no more said paul the thing is past cure no dearest it is not only death is that greta you said death would bind us closer together but this thing draws us apart no dearest it does not that it can not do could nothing part us said paul lifting his face nothing though the world divided us yet we should be together again the loud sobs came from overhead paul rose to his feet a shattered man no more his abject mien fell from him like a garment did i not say it was a lie he muttered fiercely greta i am ashamed he said your courage disgraces me see what a pitiful coward you have taken for your husband you have witnessed a strange weakness but it has been for the last time thank god i am now the man of yesterday her tears were rolling down her cheeks but her eyes were very bright what do you wish me to do she whispered is it not something for me to do it is darling you said rightly that the thought of one is the thought of both what is it a terrible thing no matter i am here to do it what it is to part from me to night only for to night only until to morrow greta's face broke into a perfect sunshine of beauty is that all she asked my darling said paul and embraced her fervently and kissed the quivering lips i am leading you through dark vaults where you can see no single step before you but i am holding your hand my husband greta whispered speech was too weak for that great moment again the heart breaking sobs fell on the silence then paul drew a cloak over greta's shoulders and buttoned up his ulster it is a little after midnight he said with composure there is a fly at the door we may catch the last train up to london i have a nest for you there my darling then he went out into the bar landlady he said i will come back to morrow for our luggage meantime let it lie here if it won't be in your way we've kept you up late old lady here take this and thank you thankee and the boxes are quite safe sir thankee he threw open the door to the road and hailed the driver of the fly cheerily cold sleety night my good fellow you'll have a sharp drive yes sir it air cold waiting very specially inside sir just for want of summat short well come in quick and get it my lad right sir when paul returned to the room to call greta he found her examining papers she had picked them up off the table they were the copies of certificates which hugh ritson had left there paul had forgotten them during the painful interview he tried to recover them unread but he was too late this she said holding out one of them is not the certificate of your birth this person paul lowther is no doubt my father's lost son no doubt said paul dropping his head but he is thirty years of age see you are no more than twenty eight if i could but prove that it would be enough he said i can prove it and i will she said you how wait until to morrow and see she said he had put one arm about her waist and was taking her to the door she stopped i can guess what the black lie has been she whispered now driver up and away right sir kentish town junction the station to catch the the carriage door was opened and closed then the bitter weeping from the upper room came out to them in the night poor girl whatever ails her i seem to remember her voice said greta we can't wait paul answered chapter ix the clocks of london were striking one when paul and greta descended the steps in front of st pancras station the night was dark and bitterly cold dense fog hung in the air and an unaccustomed silence brooded over the city a solitary four wheeled cab stood in the open square the driver was inside huddled up in his great coat and asleep a porter awakened him and he made way for greta and paul he took his apron from the back of his horse wrapped it about his waist and snuffed the wicks of his lamps they burned low and red and crackled in the damp atmosphere what hotel sir the convent westminster convent sir did you say the convent sir st margaret's westminster sir the catholic convent greta's hand pressed paul's arm the cabman got on to his box muttering something that was inaudible as he passed the gate lodge he drew up while the porter on duty came out with a lamp and took the number of the cab the fog grew more dense at every step and the pace at which they traveled was slow to avoid the maze of streets that would have helped them to a shorter cut on a clearer night the driver struck along euston road to tottenham court road and thence south toward oxford street this straighter and plainer course had the disadvantage of being more frequented many a collision became imminent in the uncertain light the cabman bought a torch from a passer by and stuck it in his whip barrel as they reached the busier thoroughfares he got down from his box took the torch in one hand and the reins in the other and walked at his horse's head the pace was now slower than before it was like a toilsome passage through the workings of an iron mine volumes of noisome vapor rolled slowly past them the air hung close over their heads like an unseen vaulted roof red lights gleamed like vanishing stars down the elastic vista one light would turn out to be a coffee stall round which a group of people gathered cabmen muffled to the throat women draggled and dirty boys with faces that were old another would be a potato engine with its own volumes of white vapor and the clank of its oven door like the metallic echo of the miner's pick the line of regular lamps was like the line of candles stuck to the rock the cross streets were like the cross workings the damp air settling down into streaks of moisture on the glass of the cab window was like the ceasless drip drip of the oozing water from overhead and to the two laden souls sitting within in silence and with clasped hands the great city nay the world itself was like a colossal mine which human earthworms had burrowed underground while the light and the free air were both above at one point where a patch of dry pavement indicated a bake house under the street three or four squalid creatures crouched together and slept the streets were all but noiseless it would be two hours yet before the giant of traffic would awake the few cabmen hailed each other as they passed unrecognized and their voices sounded hoarse when the many clocks struck two the many tones came muffled through the dense air the journey was long and wearisome but paul and greta scarcely felt it they were soon to part they knew not when they were to meet again perhaps soon perhaps late perhaps not until a darkness deeper than this should cover the land turning into oxford street the cabman struck away to the west in order to come upon westminster by the main artery of regent street the great thoroughfare was quiet enough now fashion was at rest but even here and in its own mocking guise misery had its haunt a light laugh broke the silence of the street and a girl so young as to be little more than a child dressed in soiled finery and reeling with unsteady step on the pavement came up to the cab window and peered in at the open door of a hotel from whence a shaft of light came out into the fog the cabman drew up comfortable hotel sir think you'd like to put up sir paul dropped the window we want the catholic convent at westminster my man the cabman had put up his torch and was flapping his arms under his armpits cold job sir think i've had enough of it ha'past two and a mile from st margaret's yet sir got a long step home sir and the missis looking out for me this hour and more the night porter of the hotel had opened the cab door but not for an instant did paul's purpose waver i'm sorry my good fellow but we must reach the convent as i tell you won't to morrow do sir comfortable quarters sir can recommend 'em with a tip of his hand over his shoulder we must get to the convent to night my man the cabman returned to his horse's head with a grunt of dissatisfaction porter can you keep a bed for me here i shall be back in an hour said paul the porter signified assent and once again the cab moved off on its slow journey as it passed out of trafalgar square by way of charing cross the air suddenly lightened it was as if waves of white mist rolled over the yellow vapor the cabman threw away his torch mounted his box and set off at a trot when he reached parliament square the fog was gone the great clock of westminster was striking three the sky was a dun gray behind the clocktower and the dark mass of the abbey could be dimly seen the cab drew up on the south west of abbey gardens and before a portico railed in by an iron gate the lamp burning on the sidewalk in front cast a hazy light on what seemed to be a large brick house plain in every feature this is saint margaret's sir eight shillings sir if you please paul dismissed the cabman and rang the bell the hollow tongue sent out a startling reverberation into the night the sky to the east was breaking thin streaks of a lighter gray foretold the dawn the door opened and the iron gate swung back a sister carrying an open oil lamp motioned them to enter can i see the superior said paul she is newly risen said the sister and she fixed the lamp to a bracket in the wall and went away they were left in a bare chill echoing hall the next moment a line of nuns in their coifs passed close by them with quick and silent steps at that gray hour they had risen for matins some of them were pale and emaciated and one that was palest and most worn went by with drooping head and hands that inlaced her rosary paul stepped back a pace the nun moved steadily onward with the rest never a sign of recognition never an upward glance only the quivering of a lip but it was his mother he too dropped his head and his own lips trembled the mother superior was standing with them before he was aware for an instant his voice was suspended but he told her at length that a great calamity had befallen them and begged her to take his wife for a time into her care charity is our office said the mother when she had heard his story come my sister the church is peace your poor laden soul may put off its load while you are here paul begged to be allowed a moment to say farewell and the good mother left them together then from an inner chamber came the solemn tones of an organ and the full voices of a choir the softened harmonies seemed to float into their torn hearts and they wept the gray dawn was creeping in it blurred the red light of the lamp good bye darling good bye paul whispered but even while he spoke he clung the closer good bye for the present dear husband said greta and smiled who would have thought that this calamity could wait for you at the very steps of god's altar a day will turn all this evil into good at the threshold of our life together to be torn apart think of it no more dearest our lives will yet be the brighter for this calamity do you remember what parson christian used to say the happiest life is not that which is always in the sunlight but rather that over which a dark cloud has once lowered and passed away paul shook his head my lips are sealed you do not know all it is a cruel lie that separates us but what if it can not be disproved greta's eyes were full of a radiant hopefulness it can and shall paul bent his head and touched her forehead with his lips the past is a silence that gives back no answer he said my mother alone could disprove it and she is dead to the world not alone dearest i can disprove it wait and see paul smiled coldly and once more shook his head you don't know all he said again and kissed her reverently what if to morrow and to morrow and to morrow brings no light to unravel this mystery never fear it the finger of heaven is in this said greta say rather the hand of destiny and how little we are in the presence of that pitiless power god sees all said greta he has led me in here and he will guide me out again what if i brought you for a day and you remain for a year for life then think that god himself has taken your wife at your hands paul's face that had worn a look of deep dejection became distorted with pain oh it is horrible and this cloister is to be your marriage bed hush all is peace here good bye dearest paul be brave my husband brave before death a man may be brave but in the face of a calamity like this what man could be brave god will turn it away god grant it but i tremble to ask for the truth the future is not more awful to me now than the past keep up heart dear paul you know how pleasant it is to fall asleep amid storms that shake the trees and to awake in the stillness and the sunshine and amid the songs of the birds to morrow the falsehood will be outfaced and you will return to fetch me yes said paul or else drag out my days as an outcast in the world no no no good bye dearest then the voice of the comforter failed her and she dropped her head on his breast the choir within chanted the matin service paul removed the iron bar that crossed the door and opened it the opposite side of the street was a blank wall with gaunt boughs of leafless trees behind it and above it and beyond all was the dim sanctuary traffic's deep buzz flowed in the distance the dawn had reddened the eastern sky and the towers of the abbey were black against the glory of the coming day it may be that there is never a sunrise on this old city but it awakens some one to some new calamity said paul yet surely this is the heaviest stroke of all good bye my darling good bye my husband yonder gray old fabric has looked on the scarred ruins of many a life but never a funeral that has passed down its aisles was so sad as this parting good bye dearest wife good bye good bye paul he struck his breast and drew his breath audibly i must go the thing is not to be thought of and endured good bye paul her face was buried in his breast to hide it from his eyes they say that the day a dear friend is lost to us is purer and calmer in remembrance than the day before may it be so with us hush you will soon be back to take me away and greta nestled closer to his breast if not if not his hot breathing beat fast on her drooping head if not then as the world is dead to both without the other's love remain here in this house forever good bye good bye he disengaged her clinging arms he pressed her cold brow with his quivering lips her fears conquered her brave heart at last a mist was fast hiding her from him good bye good bye a moment's silence a breaking sigh a rising sob a last lingering touch of the inlaced fingers and then the door closed behind him she was alone in the empty hall her lips were cold her eyes were shut the rosy hues of morning were floating in the air now rich and sweet and balmy and restful with the full pure holy harmonies of the choir chapter x it was merely a momentary vexation which hugh ritson felt when the course that paul had taken falsified his prescience no matter he said it is only a question of a day more or less the thing must be done drayton made no attempt to conceal his relief when the door closed and the fly drove off i ain't sorry the fence is gone and that's flat only being gone you will have a bigger risk to run now my friend said hugh ritson with undisguised contempt drayton looked up with a glance half of fear half of suspicion you ain't gone and rounded on a fellow after all you ain't told him as i'm here don't be a fool get off to bed wait you must put me up for the night you'll take care of yourself if you're wise the police will be here in the morning take my word for that here in the morning no when they asked for his address he gave them the name of this house they'll not forget it men of that sort don't forget i'll pound if they don't they have memories for other things besides addresses consider if they have any other reason to remember the landlord of your house no criss crossing you don't do me the same as the old woman no matter you know best take care of yourself mr drayton drayton buttoned his coat as near to the throat as the torn lapel would allow that's what i mean to do i ain't going to be lagged it's a lifer this time and that would take the stiff'ning out of a man where are you going no criss crossing i say leave this house and they'll have you in twenty four hours stay here and they'll lag me in twelve being as that's twelve to the good i'm off drayton's hand was on the door handle hugh ritson snatched it away an idiot like you deserves to be taken such men ought to be put away drayton lifted his fist damme but i'll put you away if if hugh ritson did not flinch what if i show you how to escape the consequences of to night's work altogether drayton's uplifted hand fell i ain't objecting to that he growled how by putting another man in your place drayton's eyes opened in a stare of blank amazement and what about me he asked you said hugh ritson and a scarcely perceptible sneer curled his lip you shall stand in his shoes a repulsive smile crossed drayton's face he fumbled the torn lapel with restless fingers his eyes wandered to the door there was a moment's silence him he said with an elevation of the eyebrows hugh ritson bent his head slightly drayton stood with mouth agape old mrs drayton was pottering around the bar preparatory to going to bed i'll be a bidding you good night sir paul you'll lock up after the gentleman good night mrs drayton the landlady hobbled away but from midway up the stairs her querulous voice came again the poor young thing i declare she's a crying her eyes out why d'ye mean to do asked drayton to get him here how'll ye track him he's gone to london ain't he that's a big haystack to find a needle in ain't it london is not a haystack mr drayton it's a honey comb and every cell is labeled on getting out of the train at st pancras station they will either hire a cab or they will not if they hire one then the number will be taken at the lodge by that number the cabman can be found he will know where he drove his fare if my brother left his wife at one place and settled himself at another the cabman will know that also if they do not hire a cab then as the hour is late and one of them is a lady they must be somewhere in the vicinity of the station thus in that vast honey comb their particular cells are already marked out for us that's enough for the present who sleep in this house beside yourselves and the girl nobody but a lad a pot boy where is he now in bed four hours agone where does he sleep up in the attic don't let that lad see you on which side of the house does the attic lie in the gable this end is there an attic in the other gable yes a bad one no matter get a mattress and sleep there yourself and lie close all day to morrow take food but no liquor mind that i'll come for you when all is clear and now show me to your room after some preparation the two men went upstairs carrying the only remaining light give me the candle you had best go up to your attic in the dark here put this key in the girl's door and unlock it she's quiet enough now hush no it was only the wind good night and mind what i say don't let that boy see you and listen no liquor chapter xi the day had not yet dawned and all lay still in that house when mercy fisher opened noiselessly the door of her room and crept stealthily down the stairs it was very dark in the bar below and she had no light the sickening odor of dead tobacco was in the air she carried a little bundle in one hand and with the other she felt her way around the walls until she came to the outer door a heavy chain fastened it and with nervous fingers she drew it out of the slide when free of its groove it slipped from her hand and fell against the door jamb with a clang the girl's heart leaped to her throat at first she crouched in fear then lifted the latch opened the door and fled away into the gloom without leaving the door wide open never to the last day of her life did she know what purpose guided her in that hour she had no object no aim only to fly away from a broken heart only to lie down on the earth and know no more with all the heartache over but she was drifting in her blind misery to that reservoir of life london she hurried down the road never once looking back the leafless trees were surging in the night wind their gaunt branches were waving grimly over her head the hedges took fantastic shapes before her and beside her her limbs trembled and her teeth chattered yet she hastened on her head ached she felt suffocated the world was so cruel to her if only she could fly from it and forget only forget the day was dawning the deep blue of the sky to the left of her was streaked with thin bars all before her was a blank void of dun gray a veil of vapor beat against her cheeks the wide marshy lands lay in mist around her not a sound but her own footstep on the road not a bird in the empty air not a cloud in the blank sky it was a dreary scene neither day nor night and through this grim realm that is aloof from all that is human one poor broken hearted girl hurried on her little bundle in her hand a shawl wrapped about her shoulders her red tearless eyes fixed in front of her like the spirit of unrest the wind moaned and soughed now and then a withered leaf of last year went by her with a light rustle and stealthy motion desolate as the heart within her was the waste ground bit by bit the gray sky lightened the east was fretted over with pink and a freshness was breathed into the air then she began to run behind her were all her pretty dreams and they were dead behind her was the love she had cherished and that was dead too from a joyful vision she had awakened to find the idol cold at her breast running hard along the gloomy road under the empty sky through the surging wind the outcast girl cried in her tearless grief as a little child cries for the mother who is in her grave never knowing its loss until it has grown tired and weary and sick and the night is very near she came to a brick kiln that stood back from the road its wreathing smoke coiled slowly upward in the smoke like atmosphere the red haze drew her to it as it drew the shivering waifs of the air cold and tired she crept up and stood some minutes in the glow but a step fell on her ear from behind the kiln and she stole away like a guilty thing away away she knew not where on on she knew not why the day had dawned now in the brightness of morning her heart sunk lower draggled and soiled her hair still damp with the dew and the odor of night in her dress she walked on in the golden radiance of the risen sun oh to bury herself forever and yet not to die no no not to die at a cross road there was a finger post and it read to kilburn beyond it there was a wood and the sunlight played on the pine trees and reddened the dead leaves that still clung to an oak she was warm now but oh so tired behind the ambush of a holly bush close to the road mercy crouched down on a drift of withered leaves at the foot of a stout beech she dozed a little and started all was quiet then weary nature conquered fear and overcame sorrow and she slept and sleep that makes kings and queens of us all gracious sleep made a queen of the outcast girl a queen of love and she dreamed of her home among the mountains mercy was still sleeping when a covered wagon such as carriers use came trundling along the road the driver a bright eyed man with the freshness of the fields in his face sat on the front rail and whistled his horse shied at something and this made him get up he was at that moment in front of the holly bush and he saw mercy lying behind it her face was worn and pale her bonnet fallen back from her forehead her head leaning against the trunk of the tree one hand on her breast the other straying aside on the drift of yellow leaves where a little bundle covered by a red handkerchief had fallen from her graspless fingers and the radiant morning sunlight over all the driver of the wagon jumped to the ground at the same moment mercy awoke with a frightened look she rose to her feet and would have hurried away young to be wagranting about ain't ye miss said the driver his tone was kindlier than his words let me go please said mercy and she tried to pass coorse coorse if yer wants to mercy thanked him her eyes on the ground she was already on the road being as you're going my way i ain't objecting to giving you a lift no thank you i have no i've no money i must run you'll wait till i ax for it won't ye missy come get up and will you let me go down whenever i like coorse i will why not up with ye there easy kneel on the shaft that's the size of it now go set yourself down on them sacks them's apples them is right very well we're off then the wagon was about half full of sacks and mercy crept down in the furthest corner i ain't in the apple line reg'lar i'm a fern gatherer that's wot i am on'y nature don't keep ferning all the year round so i'se forced to go fruiting winter times buying apples same as them from off'n the farmers down the country and bringing 'em up to covent garden that's where i'm going now that is and got to be there afore the sales starts mercy listened but said nothing you know covent garden not fur from leicester square and the haymarket mercy shook her head what never been there and that near mercy shook her head again and dropped her eyes the driver twisted about to look at her let a be she's feeling it bad he thought and was silent for a moment then he twisted about for another look i say missy got bad eyes they're sore and a little dim said mercy blest if you don't look the spitting image of a friend of mine 'boutn the eyes i mean red and swelled up and such it was tom crow a partner of mine in fact tom caught cold sleeping out one night as we was ferning down roger tichborne's estates him as was the claimant for 'em you know on'y he didn't get 'em the cold flew to tom's eyes straight and blest if he ain't gone blind as a mole mercy's lips quivered the driver stopped his chatter conscious that he had gone too far and then with somewhat illogical perversity he proceeded to express his vexation at himself by punishing his horse get along you stupid old perwerse old knacker's crutch the horse set off at a trot they passed through a village and mercy read the name child's hill printed on the corner of a house is it london you are going to said mercy timidly covent garden is that london eh the driver opened his eyes very wide in a blank stare mercy trembled and held down her head they jogged on awhile in silence and then the driver who had cast furtive glances at the girl drew rein and said i'm wexed as i said tom crow was as blind as a mole how and ever a mole ain't blind and it's on'y them coster chaps as think so but i've caught a many of 'em out ferning besides tom was a worrited with his missus tom was and happen that was worse nor his cold git along you old perwerse old file you see tom's missus cut away and left him as

and she ain't out o' bed this twelvemonth come christmas and she gets lonesome lying all by herself and frets a bit maybe and git along will you you wexing old fence there was a long silence this time they were leaving the green fields behind them and driving through longer streets than mercy had ever seen before though the sun was shining feebly the lamps on the pavement were still burning they passed a church and mercy saw by the clock that it was hard on eight they drove briskly through camden town into st giles's and so on to long acre the streets were thronged by this time troops of people were passing to and fro cabs and omnibuses were rattling hither and thither at every turn the crowd became denser and the noise louder mercy sat in her corner bewildered the strange city frightened her for the time it drove away the memory of her sorrow when they reached covent garden jim the driver drew up with a jerk and nodded to some of the drivers of similar wagons and hailed others with a lusty shout all was a babel to the girl's dazed sense laughter curses yelling whooping quarreling mercy's head ached she got down hardly knowing what to do next where was she to go in that wilderness of london more desolate than the trackless desert what was she she stood a moment on the pavement her little bundle in her hand and all the bewildering scene went round and round the tears rose to her eyes and the glare and noise and the tumult were blotted out the next instant she felt herself being lifted back into the wagon and then she remembered nothing more chapter xii two days later hugh ritson entered the convent church of st margaret it was evening service and the nave was thronged from chancel to porch the aisles which were bare of seats were filled only half way down the rest of the pavement being empty save for a man here and there who leaned lightly against the great columns of the heavy colonnade the sermon had already begun hugh ritson walked up the aisle noiselessly until he came close behind the throng of people standing together then he stood at the side of a column and looked around on those in the nave he was within range of the preacher's voice but he hardly listened his eyes traversed the church until at last they rested on one spot in the south transept where a company of nuns sat with downcast eyes half closed the face of one of them was hidden beneath her drooping coif the rosary held to her breast was gripped with nervous fingers near at hand there was another face that riveted hugh ritson's gaze it was the face of greta radiant in its own beauty and tender with the devotional earnestness of parted lips and of lashes wet with the dew of a bruised spirit from these two his eyes never wandered for longer than a minute languidly he listened to the words that floated over the people and held them mute the preacher was a slight young man emaciated pale with lustrous eyes and a voice that had a thin meek pipe but the discourse was in a strain of feverish excitement a spirit of hard intolerance a tone of unrelenting judgment that would have befitted the gigantic figure and thunderous accents of the monk jerome there is a way that seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof is death this was the text twenty times repeated men talked of the rights of conscience as if conscience were god's law they babbled of toleration as if any heresy were to be endured if only it were believed conscience it was the slave of circumstance toleration it was the watchword at the gate of hell hugh ritson listened with a vague consciousness his eyes fixed alternately on the nun with the drooping coif and on the fair upturned face beside her at last a word struck him and made his whole soul to vibrate men women the great mute throng pillars arches windows of figured saints altar aflame with candles the surpliced choir and the pale thin face with the burning eyes in the pulpit above all vanished in an instant what was true said the preacher in the realm of thought could not be false in the world of life men did evil deeds and justified them to their own enslaved minds no way so dark but it had appeared to be the path of light none so far wrong but it had seemed to be right let man beware of the lie that he told to his own heart the end thereof is death staring from a bloodless face hugh ritson reeled a step backward and then clung with a trembling hand to the pillar against which he had leaned the harsh scrape of his foot was heard over the hushed church and here and there a neck was craned in his direction his emotion was gone in an instant a light curl of the hard lip told that the angel within him had once again been conquered the sermon ended with a rapturous declaration of the immutability of god's law and the eternal destinies of man the world was full of change but man who seemed to change most changed least the stars that hung above had seen the beginning and the end of ages before man was they were the old river that flowed past the old city that night had flowed there centuries ago and generations of men had lived and died in joy and sorrow and still the same waters washed the same shore but the stars that measure time itself and the sea that recorded it would vanish away and man should be when time would be no more they shall perish but thou shalt endure they shall wax old as doth a garment but thou art the same and thy years shall have no end the preacher finished and the buzz and rustle of the people shifting in their seats told of the tension that had been broken faces that had been distorted with the tremors of fear or contracted with the quiverings of remorse or glorified with the lights of ecstasy resumed their normal expression the vesper hymn was sung by the whole congregation standing it floated up to the blue roof where the lights that burned low over the people's heads left in the gloom the texts written on the open timbers and the imaged christ hung in the clerestory there was one voice that did not sing the vesper hymn and the close locked lips of hugh ritson were but the symbol of the close locked heart he was asking himself was it true that when the fire of the stars should be burned to ashes still man would endure pshaw what was man these throngs of men whose great voice swelled like the sea what were they in this old church where they sung other men had sung before them and where were they now who should say they had not perished living believing dying they were gone gone with their sins and sorrows gone with their virtues and rewards gone from all sight and all memory and no voice came from them pealing out of the abyss of death to join this song of hope hope it was a dream a dream that great yearning crowds like these filling churches and chapels dreamed age after age but it was a dream from which there would be no awakening to know that it was not true the priest and choir left the church then the congregation broke up and separated hugh ritson stood awhile still leaning against the column of the colonnade the nuns in the south transept rose last and went out by a little aperture opening from the south aisle hugh watched them pass at the distance of the width of the nave greta walked a few paces behind them when the people had gone and she rose from her seat her eyes fell on hugh then she dropped her head and walked down the aisle with a hurried step hugh saw her out the church was now empty and the voluntary was done he followed her through the door and entered into the sacristy before him was another door it led into the convent the last of the line of nuns was passing through it greta stood in the sacristy faint with a scared face one hand at her breast the other on the base of a crucifix that stood by the wall when she saw that he had followed her her first impulse was to shrink away her second was to sink to her knees at his feet she did neither conquering her faintness but still quivering from head to foot she turned upon him with a defiant look why do you come here i do not wish to speak with you let me pass she said hugh ritson made no effort to detain her he stood before her with downcast eyes his infirm foot bent under him i come to bid you farewell he said calmly i come to say that we meet no more would that we had parted forever before we met the last time said greta fervently would that we had never met said hugh in a low voice that was a lie with which you parted me from my husband she said it was god forgive me and you knew it was a lie said greta i knew it was a lie then where is your shame that you can look me in the face have you no shame she said have you no pity said hugh what pity had you for me have you not done me wrong enough already god knows it is true and he knows i am a miserable man have pity and forgive me and say farewell something of contrition in the tone touched her she was silent the preacher was wrong he said there is no spirit of evil we are betrayed by our own passions and the chief of those passions is love it is the nemesis that stalks through the world haunting all men and goading some to great wrong it was of your doing that i came here said greta would to god it may be of my doing that you remain here said hugh that is a prayer he will not hear i am leaving this house to night there is some one coming who can unmask your wicked falsehood parson christian said hugh greta made no answer and hugh continued his journey is needless a word from my mother would have done all she is in this house yes heaven forgive you she is here said greta you are wrong you do not know all where is your husband greta shook her head i have neither seen him nor heard from him since we parted at these doors she said and when you leave them to night do you leave him behind you said hugh heaven forbid said greta passionately hugh ritson's bloodless face was awful to look upon greta he said in a tone of anguish give up the thought look on that false union as broken forever and all this misery will end it was i and you you and i but that is over now i do not come between you it is useless to think of that i do not offer you my love you refused it long ago but i can not see you my brother's wife that would be too much for me to endure i will not endure it have pity upon me if i have no claim to your love have i no right to your pity what have i suffered for your love a life's misery what have i sacrificed to it my name my place my inheritance greta lifted her eyes with a look of inquiry what has he not even yet told you all said hugh no matter what has he done to earn your love that i have not done what has he suffered what has he sacrificed if this is love it is selfish love said greta in a broken voice selfish be it so all love is selfish leave me leave me hugh ritson paused the warmth of his manner increased i will leave you he said and never seek you again i will go from you forever and crush down the sorrow that must be with me to the end if you will promise me one thing what is it said greta her eyes on the ground it is much said hugh but it is not all if the price is great think of the misery that it buys and buries you would sacrifice something for me would you not his voice swelled as he spoke and his pale face softened and the light of hopeless love was in his great eyes say that you would for me me he held out his arms toward her as if soul and body together yearned for one word one look of love greta stood there silent and immovable what is it she repeated let me think that you would do something for my sake mine he pleaded let me carry away that solace think what i have suffered for you and all in vain think that perhaps it was no fault of mine that you could not love me that another woman might have found me worthy to be loved who had not been unworthy of love from me what is it repeated greta coldly but her drooping lashes were wet with tears think that i am of a vain proud stubborn spirit that in all this world there is neither man nor woman friend nor enemy to whom i have sued for grace or favor that since i was a child i have never even knelt in prayer in god's house that man might see or god might hear then think that i am at your feet a miserable man what is it said greta again hugh ritson paused and then added more calmly that you should take the vows and the veil and stay here until death greta lifted her eyes hugh's eyes were bent upon her no i can not i should be false to my marriage vows she said quietly to be true to them is to be false to yourself to your husband and to me said hugh i love my husband said greta with an eloquent glance to be true to them is to be true to him there was a pause hugh ritson's manner underwent a change it was the white heat of high passion that broke the silence when he spoke again greta he said and his deep voice had a strong tremor if there is any truth in what that priest told us to night if it is not a dream and a solemn mockery made to enchant or appal the simple if there is a god and judgment my soul is already too heavily burdened with sins against you and yours i would have eased it of one other sin more black than these but it was not to be what do you mean said greta her face was panic stricken hugh ritson came a step nearer that your husband is in my hands that one word from me would commit him to a doom more dreadful than death that if he is to be saved as a free man alive you must renounce him forever speak plain what do you mean said greta choose quick which shall it be you for this convent or your husband for lifelong imprisonment greta's mind was in a whirl she was making for the door in front of them he stepped before her i parted you with a lie he said but to me it was not always a lie i believed it once do you think i should have denied my self my inheritance and let a bastard stand in my place if i had not believed it what further lie is this said greta no matter heaven knows and all i did was for love of you is it so guilty a thing that i have loved you to all lengths and ends of love i meant to put a hemisphere between you to send him to australia and you back home to cumberland what if the lie had then been outfaced i should have parted you and that would have been enough and now when your revenge falls idle at your feet you come to me on your knees said greta revenge that was but a feeble revenge said hugh he would have learned the truth and come back to claim you there would have been no peace for me while he was alive and free do i come to you on my knees yes but it is to pray of you to save your husband is it so much that i ask of you think what is earned by it if you have no pity for me have you none for him she was struggling to pass him greta he said choose and at once it is now or never to night to morrow will be too late you for a holy life of self renouncement or your husband to drag out his miserable days in penal servitude this is only another lie let me pass she said it is the truth as sure as god hears us said hugh i shall never believe it i will swear it he laid a strong hand on her wrist i will swear it at the very foot of god's altar he tried to draw her back into the church she resisted let me go i will cry for help he dropped her wrist and fell back from her she drew herself up in silence and walked slowly away he stood a moment alone in the sacristy then he went out through the church it was empty and all but dark the sacristan with a long rod was putting out the lights one by one he turned with arm uplifted to look after the halting figure that passed down the aisle and out at the west porch chapter xiii abbey gardens the street in front was dark and all but deserted only a drunken woman went reeling along but the dull buzz in the distance and the white sheet in the sky told that somewhere near the wild heart of the night beat high hugh ritson looked up at the heavy mass of the convent building as he crossed the street the lights were already out and all was dark within he went on but presently stopped by a sudden impulse and looked again it was then he was aware that something moved in the deep portico the lamp on the pavement sent a shaft of light on to the door and there under the gas light with the face turned from him was the figure of a woman she seemed to cast cautious and stealthy glances around and to lift a trembling hand to the bell that hung above her the hand fell to her side but no ring followed once again the hand was lifted and once again it fell back then the woman crept totteringly down the steps and turned to go hugh ritson recrossed the street amid all the turmoil of his soul the incident had arrested him the woman was coming toward him he put himself in her path the light fell full upon her and he saw her face it was mercy fisher with a low cry the girl sunk back against the railings of the convent and covered her face with her hands is it you mercy said hugh she made no answer then she tried to steal away but he held her with gentle force why did you leave hendon he asked you did not want me said the girl in a tone of unutterable pain and still her face was buried in her hands he did not reply he let her grief spend itself just then a drunken woman reeled back along the pavement and passed them close peering into their midst and going by with a jarring laugh what's he a doing to ye my dear eh she said jeeringly sarve ye right she added and laughed again she was a draggled battered outcast a human ruin such as night the pander flings away mercy lifted her head a dull weary look was in her eyes you know how i waited and waited she said and you were so long in coming so very long she turned her eyes aside you did not want me in your heart you did not want me she said the wave of bitter memory drowned her voice not unmoved he stood and looked at her and saw the child face wet with tears and the night breeze of the city drift in her yellow hair where have you been since he said a man going to market brought me up in his wagon i fainted and then he took me to his home he lives close by in the horse and groom yard his wife is bedridden and such a good creature and so kind to me but they are poor and i had no money and i was afraid to be a burden to them and besides besides well she saw that i was she saw what was going to being a woman she knew i was soon yes yes said hugh stopping another flood of tears with a light touch of the hand how red your eyes look are they worse the man was very good he took me to the doctors at a hospital and they said oh they said i might lose my sight poor little mercy said hugh he was now ashamed of his own sufferings how loud they had clamored awhile ago yet what were they side by side with this poor girl's tangible sorrows mere things of the air with no reality but no matter she burst out that's no matter you must keep up heart mercy i spoke angrily to you the other night but it's over now is it not oh why didn't you leave me alone said the girl hush mercy it will be well with you yet his own eyes were growing dim but even then his heart was bitter had he not said in his wrath that passion was the demon of the world he might say it in his sorrow too the simple heart of this girl loved him even as his own lustier soul loved greta he had wronged her but that was only a tithe of the trouble if she could but return him hate for wrong how soon everything would be right with her what brought you here mercy one of the sisters they visit the sick one of them visited the house where they gave me lodgings and i heard that they sometimes took homeless girls into the convent and i thought i was homeless now and and poor little woman i came the night before last but saw your brother paul walking here in front so i went away paul then i came last night and he was here again so i went away once more and to night i came earlier and he wasn't here but just as i was going to ring the bell and say that i had no home and that my eyes were growing worse something seemed to say they would ask if i had a father and why i had left him and then i couldn't ring and then i thought if only i could die yes if only i could die and forget and never wake up again in the morning hush mercy you shall go back home to your father no no no yes and i shall go with you there was silence the bleared eyes looked stealthily up into his face a light smile played there ah a bright vision came to her of a fair day when hand in hand with him she loved she should return to her forsaken home in the mountains and hold up her head and wipe away her father's tears she was in the dark street of the city then she and her home were very far apart he laughed inwardly at a different vision in a grim spirit of humor he saw all his unquenchable passion conquered and he saw himself the plain homely respectable husband of this simple wife was paul alone when you saw him said hugh yes and would you tell them all the girl's sidelong glance was far away mercy i want you to do something for me yes yes again the sidelong glance hugh lifted the girl's head with his hand to recall her wandering thoughts paul will come again to night i want you to wait for him and speak to him yes yes but won't he ask me questions what if he does answer them all only don't say that i have told you to speak to him tell him will you remember it are you listening look me in the face little woman yes yes tell him that mr christian parson christian you know has come to london and wishes to see him at once say he has looked for him at the hotel in regent street and not found him there and is now at the inn in hendon will you remember yes where were you going mercy back to your poor friends no but will he be sure to come to night no doubt at what time was he here last night ten o'clock it is now hard on nine tell him to go to hendon at once and when he goes you go with him do you understand yes don't forget to night to morrow night will not do if he does not come you must follow me to hendon and tell me so i shall be there don't tell him that do you hear the girl gave a meek assent and now good bye for an hour or two little one he turned away and she was left alone before the dark convent but she was not all alone a new born dream was with her and her soul was radiant with light chapter xiv hugh ritson walked rapidly through dean's yard in the direction of the sanctuary as he turned into parliament street the half moon rose above the roof of westminster hall but the night was still dark he passed through trafalgar square and into the haymarket the streets were thronged crowds on crowds went languidly by dim ghosts of men and women most of them who loitered at this hour in these streets old men with the souls long years dead within them and the corruption reeking up with every breath to poison every word or lurking like charnel lights in the eyes to blink contagion in every glance young girls hopping like birds beside them the spectres of roses in their cheeks but the real thorns at their hearts there had been no way for them but this this and one other way either to drift into the thames and be swallowed up in the waters of death or to be carried along for a brief minute on the froth of the waves of life laughing because they might not weep laughing because their souls were dead laughing in their conscious travesty of the tragedy of pleasure they tripped and lounged and sauntered along and the lamps shone round them and above them was the glimmering moon as hugh ritson went up the steep haymarket his infirmity became more marked and he walked with a sliding gait seeing this a woman who stood there halted and limped a few paces by his side and pretending not to see him shouted with a mocking laugh what is it a man or a bat how the wild mad heart of the night leaped up a man passed through the throng with eyes that seemed to see nothing of its frantic frenzy and joyless joy a stalwart man who strode along like a giant among midgets his vacant eyes fixed before him his strong white face expressionless hugh ritson saw him they passed within two paces but without recognition the one was wandering aimlessly in his blind misery toward the convent of st margaret the other was making for the old inn at hendon an hour later hugh ritson was standing in the bar of the hawk and heron his mind was made up his resolve was fixed his plan was complete anybody with him he said to the landlady motioning toward the stairs not as i knows on sir but he do seem that restless and off his wittals and i don't know as i quite understands why hugh ritson stopped her garrulous tongue i have found the girl she will come back to you to night mrs drayton if she brings with her the gentleman who left these boxes in your care take him to your son's bedroom and tell him the person he wishes to see has arrived and will be with him directly with this he went up the stairs then calling down he added the moment he is in the room come up and tell me a minute later he called again where's the key to this door let me have it the landlady hobbled up with the key to drayton's bedroom the room was empty and the door stood open hugh ritson tried the key in the lock and saw that the wards moved freely that will do he said in a satisfied tone the old woman was hobbling back hugh was standing in thought with head bent and the nail of his forefinger on his cheek by the way mrs drayton he said you should get the girl to help you a little sometimes lor's sir i never troubles her being as she's like a visitor nonsense mrs drayton she's young and hearty and your own years are just a little past their best you know how's your breathing to day any easier well i can't say as it's a mort better neither thanking you the same sir and a protracted fit of coughing bore timely witness to the landlady's words ah that's' a bad bout my good woman well it is sir and i get no sympathy neither leastways not from him as a mother might look to in a manner of speaking bethink you is there nothing the girl can do for you when she comes nothing wanted no errand well sir taking it kindly sir there's them finings in the cellar a wants doing bad and the boy as ought to do 'em he's that grumpysome as i declare quite right mrs drayton send the girl down to them the moment she comes in and keep her down until bed time thank you sir i'm sure i takes it very kind and thoughtful of a gentleman to say as much and no call neither the landlady shuffled down stairs wagging gratefully her dense old noddle the thoughtful gentleman left the key of drayton's room in the lock on the outside of the door and ascended a ladder that went up from the end of the passage he knocked at a door at the top at first there was no answer a dull shuffling of feet could be heard from within come open the door said hugh impatiently the door was opened cautiously drayton stood behind it hugh ritson entered there was no light in the room the red smoking wick of a tallow candle newly extinguished was filling the air with its stench you take care of yourself said hugh let us have a light drayton went down on his knees in the dark fumbled on the floor for a box of lucifers and relighted the candle he was in his shirt sleeves cold without your coat eh said hugh a sneer played about his lips without answering drayton turned to a mattress that lay in the gloom of one corner lifted it took up a coat that lay under it and put it on it was the ulster with the torn lapel hugh ritson followed drayton's movements and laughed slightly men like you are always cautious in the wrong place he said let them lay hands on you and they won't be long finding your coat the last word had a contemptuous dig of emphasis damme if i won't burn it for good and all muttered drayton his manner was dogged and subdued no you won't do that said hugh and he eyed him largely the garret was empty save for the mattress and the blanket that lay on it and two or three plates with the refuse of food on the floor it was a low room with a skylight in the rake of the roof which sloped down to a sharp angle there was no window the walls were half timbered and had once been plastered but the laths were now bare in many places heard anything said drayton doggedly yes i called and told the police sergeant that i thought i was on the scent what no the two men looked at each other drayton suspicious hugh ritson with amused contempt tell you what you don't catch me hobnobbing with them gentry said drayton recovering his composure hugh ritson made no other answer than a faint smile as he looked into the face of drayton he was telling himself that no man had ever before been at the top of such a situation as that of which he himself was then the master here was a man who was the half brother of greta and the living image of her husband here was a man who despite vague suspicions did not know his own identity here was a man over whom hung an inevitable punishment hugh ritson smiled at the daring idea he had conceived of making this man personate himself drayton he said i mean to stand your friend in this trouble tell you again the best friend to me is the man as helps me to make my lucky you shall do it drayton this very night listen to me that man my brother as they call him paul ritson as his name goes is not my father's son he is the son of my mother by another man and his true name is paul lowther i don't care what his true name is nor his untrue neither it ain't nothing to me say i and no more is it would it be anything to you to inherit five thousand pounds what paul lowther is the heir to as much what would you say if i could put you in paul lowther's place and get you paul lowther's inheritance eh a fortune out of hand how the way i described before there was a slight scraping sound such as a rat might have made in burrowing behind the partition what's that said drayton his face whitening and his watchful eyes glancing toward the door a key in the lock he whispered tut isn't your own key on the inside said hugh ritson drayton hung his head in shame at his idle fears i know i haven't forgot he muttered covering his discomfiture it's a pity to stay here and be taken when you might as easily be safe said hugh so it is drayton mumbled and go through penal servitude for life when another man might do it for you added hugh with a ghostly smile i ain't axing you to say it over what's that drayton cowered down the bankrupt garret had dropped a cake of its rotten plaster hugh ritson moved not a muscle only the sidelong glance told of his contempt for the hulking creature's cowardice the lawyer who has charge of this legacy is my friend and comrade he said after a moment's silence we should have no difficulty in that quarter my mother is well she's gone there would be no one left to question you if you were only half shrewd the path would be clear what about her greta she would be your wife my wife in name you would go back as i told you and say 'i whom you have known as paul ritson am really paul lowther and therefore the half brother of the woman with whom i went through the ceremony of marriage this fact i learned immediately on reaching london i bring the lady back as i found her and shall ask that the marriage which is no marriage be annulled i deliver up to the rightful heir hugh ritson the estates of allan ritson and make claim to the legacy left me by my father robert lowther' this is what you have to say and do and every one will praise you for an honest and upright man very conscientious no doubt but what about him he will then be paul drayton and a felon drayton chuckled and what about her if he is in safe keeping she will count for nothing so i'm to be paul lowther you are to pretend to be paul lowther i told you afore as it won't go into my nob and no more it will said drayton scratching his head you shall have time to learn your lesson you shall have it pat said hugh ritson meantime at that instant drayton's eyes were riveted on the skylight with an affrighted stare look yonder he whispered what the face on the roof hugh ritson plucked up the candle and thrust it over his head and against the glass what face he said contemptuously again drayton's head fell in shame at his abject fear there was a shuffling footstep on the ladder outside drayton held his head aside and listened the old woman he mumbled what now supper i suppose chapter xv at that moment there was a visitor in the bar down stairs he was an elderly man with shaggy eyebrows and a wizened face a diminutive creature with a tousled head of black and gray it was gubblum oglethorpe the mountain peddler had traveled south to buy chamois leather and had packed a great quantity of it into a bundle like a panier which he carried over one arm since the wedding at newlands three days ago gubblum's lively intelligence had run a good deal on his recollection of the man resembling paul ritson whom he had once seen in hendon he had always meant to settle for himself that knotty question so here on his first visit to london he intended to put up at the very inn about which the mystery gathered how's ta rubbun on he said by way of salute on entering when mrs drayton had gone upstairs she had left the pot boy in charge of the bar he was a loutish lad of sixteen and his name was jabez jabez slowly lifted his eyes from the pewters he was washing and a broad smile crossed his face evidently the new comer was a countryman cold neet eh sharp as a step mother's breath said gubblum throwing down the panier and drawing up to the fire the smile on the face of jabez broadened perceptibly and he began to chuckle what's ta snertan at eh said gubblum i say it's hot weather varra hasta owt agenn it jabez laughed outright clearly the countryman must be crazy what's yon daft thingamy aboot thought gubblum then aloud ay my lad gie us a laal sup o' summat jabez found his risible faculties sorely disturbed by this manner of speech but he proceeded to fill a pewter the pot boy's movements resembled those of a tortoise in celerity he's a stirran lad yon thought gubblum he's swaddering like a duck in a puddle can i sleep here to neet he asked when jabez had brought him his beer then the sapient smile on the pot boy's face ripened into speech i ain't answering for the sleeping said jabez but happen you may have a bed he he he i'll ask the missis he he haw the missis hasta never a master then said gubblum now jabez had been warned with many portentous threats that in the event of any one asking for the master he was to be as mute as the grave so in answer to the peddler's question he merely shook his wise head and looked grave and astonishingly innocent no and how lang hasta been here three years come easter said jabez and how lang dusta say 'at missis has been here missis i heard father say as mistress drayton has kep' the hawk and heron this five and twenty year five and twenty then i reckon that master would be no'but a laal wee barn when she coomt first said gubblum happen he were said jabez then recovering the caution so unexpectedly disturbed jabez protested afresh that he had no master it's slow wark suppen buttermilk wi' a pitchfork thought gubblum and he proceeded to employ a spoon sista my lad wadsta like me to lend thee a shilling jabez grinned and closed his fat fist on the coin thrust into his palm i once knew a man as were the varra spitten picter of your master said gubblum in fact his varra sel' upsett'n and doon thross'n i thowt it were hissel' that's the fact but when i tackled him he threept me down and i was that vexed i could have bitten the side out of a butter bowl but i ain't got no master protested jabez i were riding by on my laal pony that day but now i'm going shankum naggum continued gubblum unmindful of the pot boy's mighty innocent look 'a canny morning to you master paul' i shouted and on i went then you know his name said jabez opening wide his drowsy eyes 'master paul's half his time frae home' says the chap on t'road 'coorse he is' i says 'it's me for knowing that' ah i mind it same as it were yesterday i looked back and there he was standing at the door and he just snitit his nose wi' his finger and thoom ey he did for sure jabez found his conscience abnormally active at that moment but i ain't got none he protested afresh none what no master that's a lie my lad for i see he's been putten a swine ring on yer snout to keep ye frae rooting up the ground after this gubblum sat a good half hour in silence mrs drayton came down stairs and arranged that gubblum should sleep that night in the house his bedroom was to be a little room at the back entered from the vicinity of the ladder that led to the attics gubblum got up said he was tired and asked to be shown to his room jabez lighted a candle and they went off together whereiver does that lead to said gubblum pointing to the ladder near his bedroom door i dunno said jabez moodily he had been ruminating on gubblum's observation about the swine ring he's as sour as vargis thought gubblum there was the creak of a footstep overhead who sleeps in the pigeon loft gubblum asked tipping his finger upward i dunno repeated jabez his dander's up thought gubblum just then the landlady in the bar heard the sound of wheels on the road and the next moment a carriage drew up at the open door i say there lend a hand here quick shouted the driver mrs drayton hobbled up the flyman was leaning through the door of the fly helping some one to alight take a' arm missy there that's the size of it now sir down gently the person assisted was a man the light from the bar fell on his face and the landlady saw him clearly it was paul ritson he was flushed and his eyes were bloodshot behind him was mercy fisher with recent tears on her cheeks oh he's ill mrs drayton said mercy paul freed one of his arms from the grasp of the girl waved with a gesture of deprecation smiled a jaunty smile and said no no no let me walk i'm well i'm well with this he made for the house but before he had taken a second step he staggered and fell against the door jamb deary me deary me the poor gentleman's taken badly said mrs drayton fussing about paul ritson laughed a little lifted his red eyes and said well well but it's nothing just dizzy that's all and thirsty very give me a drink good woman bring that there bench up missy and we'll put him astride it said the driver right that's the time o' day now sir down deary me deary me drink this my good gentleman it'll do you a mort o' good it's brandy water bring me water said paul ritson feebly i'm parched how hot his forehead is said mercy and no light 'un to lift neither said the driver does he live here missis mrs drayton brought a glass of water paul drained it to the last drop no sir i mean yes driver said the landlady confusedly he warn't so bad getting in the driver observed oh dear oh dear where is mr christian parson christian said mercy whose distracted eyes wandered around the gentleman's come sir he's upstairs sir said the landlady and muttering to herself mrs drayton hobbled away paul ritson's head had fallen on his breast his hat was off and his hair tumbled over his face the strong man sat coiled up on the bench then he shook himself and threw up his head as if trying to cast off the weight of stupor that sat on him well well who'd have thought of this water more water he mumbled in a thick voice mercy stood before him with a glass in her hand is it good for him i wonder she said oh where is mr christian paul ritson saw the glass clutched at it with both hands then smiled a poor weak smile as if to atone for his violence and drank every drop well well so hot and dizzy and cold he muttered incoherently then he relapsed into silence after a moment the driver who was supporting him at the back looked over at his face the eyes were closed and the lips were hanging he's gone off unconscious said the flyman ain't ye got a bed handy at that moment mrs drayton came hastily down stairs in a fever of agitation you've got to get him up to his room she said between gusts of breath that's a job for two men ain't it missis said the driver mercy had loosened paul's collar and with a nervous hand she was bathing his burning forehead oh tell mr christian she said say he has fainted mrs drayton hobbled back in another instant there was a man's step descending the stairs hugh ritson entered the bar he looked down at the unconscious man and felt his pulse when did this happen he asked turning to mercy he said he was feeling ill when i met him then he was worse in the train and when we reached hendon he was too dizzy to stand said mercy his young woman ain't it said the flyman aside to hugh hugh nodded his head slightly then turning toward mrs drayton with a significant glance your poor son is going to be ill he said the landlady glanced back with a puzzled expression and began in a blundering whimper the poor gentleman the old lady's son said the flyman tipping his finger in the direction of the landlady paul drayton said hugh mercy saw and heard all the tears suddenly dried in her eyes which opened wide in amazement she said nothing hugh caught the altered look in her face mrs drayton he said didn't you say you had something urgent for mercy to do let her set about it at once now driver lend a hand upstairs it's only a step they lifted paul ritson between them and were carrying him out of the bar where's the boy asked hugh don't let him get in the way boys are more hindrance than help he added in an explanatory tone they had reached the foot of the stair now my man easy heavy eh rather they went up mercy stood in the middle of the floor with a tearless and whitening face half a minute later hugh ritson and the flyman had returned to the bar the phantom of a smile lurked about the flyman's mouth hugh ritson's face was ashen and his lips quivered the boxes and portmanteaus which paul and greta had left in the bar three nights ago still lay in one corner hugh pointed them out to the driver put them on top of the cab he said the flyman proceeded to do so when the man was outside the door hugh ritson turned to mrs drayton the landlady was fussing about twitching her apron between nervous fingers mrs drayton said hugh you will go in this fly to the convent of st margaret westminster there you will ask for mrs ritson the lady who was here on friday night you will tell her that you have her luggage with you and that she is to go with you to st pancras station to meet her husband and return to cumberland by the midnight train you understand i can't say as i do sir asking pardon sir if so be as the lady axes why her husband didn't come for her hisself what then then say what is true nothing more mrs drayton and happen what may that be sir that her husband is ill but mind not seriously oh well i can speak to that sir being as i saw the poor gentleman mrs drayton was putting on her bonnet and shawl the flyman had fixed the luggage on top of the cab and was standing in the bar whip in hand a glass for the driver said hugh mrs drayton moved toward the counter no you get into the cab mrs drayton mercy will serve mercy went behind the counter and served the liquor in an absent manner it's now ten thirty said hugh looking at his watch you will drive first to the convent westminster and from there to st pancras to catch the train at twelve saying this he walked to the door and put his head through the window of the cab the landlady was settling herself in her seat mrs drayton he whispered you must not utter a syllable about your son when you see the lady mind that you understand well sir i can't say being as i saw the gentleman wherever's paul hush the driver came out he leaped to his seat in another moment the cab rattled away hugh ritson walked back into the house the boy jabez had come down stairs when do you close the house hugh asked eleven o'clock sir said jabez no one here you might almost as well close now no matter go behind the bar my lad mercy your eyes are more inflamed than ever get away to bed immediately mercy's eyes were not more red than their expression was one of bewilderment she moved off mechanically when she reached the foot of the stairs she turned and tried to speak the words would not come at length she said in a strange voice you did not tell me the truth mercy where's parson christian said mercy and her voice grew stern you must not use that tone to me come get away to bed little one her eyes dropped before his she turned away he watched her up the stairs so sure of hand was he that not even at that moment did he doubt his hold of her but mercy did not go to bed she turned in at the open door of drayton's room the room was dark only a fitful ray of bleared moonlight fell crosswise on the floor but she could see that the unconscious figure of paul ritson lay stretched upon the bed and i have led you here with a lie she thought then her head swam and fell on to the counterpane some minutes passed in silence she was aroused by footsteps in the passage outside they were coming toward this room the door which stood ajar was pushed open there was no time for mercy to escape so she crept back into the darkness of a narrow space between the foot of the bed and the wall two men entered mercy realized their presence in the dark room rather by the sense of touch than by the sense of hearing or sight they walked lightly the darkness hid them but the air seemed heavy with their hot breath one of them approached the bedside mercy felt the bed quiver the man leaned over it and there was a pause only the scarcely perceptible breathing of the insensible man fell on the silence he's safe enough still said a voice that thrilled her through and through now for it there's no time to lose the girl crouched down and held her breath damme if i ain't wishing myself well out of it muttered another voice mercy knew both men they were hugh ritson and paul drayton hugh closed the door what simpleton says fortune favors the brave he said in a low derisive tone here is fortune at the feet of a man like you drayton growled and mercy heard the oath that came from beneath his breath i'm wanting to be out of this and i ain't ashamed for you to know it hugh ritson's light laugh came from the bedside he was still standing by paul ritson's head if the lord mayor came for you in his carriage with a guard of flunkies you would leave this house in less safety he said then he added impatiently come waste no words strip off that tell tale coat with this he leaned over the bed and there was a creak of the spring mattress what's that said drayton in an affrighted tone for god's sake be a man said hugh bitterly d'ye call this a man's work muttered drayton the light laugh once more perhaps not so manly as robbing the dead and dying said hugh ritson and his voice was deep and cold mercy heard another muttered oath dear god what was about to be done could she escape the door was closed still if she could but reach it she might open it and fly away at that instant hugh ritson as if apprehending her thought said wait and then stepped back to the door and drew the snap bolt mercy leaned against the wall and heard the beating of her heart in the darkness she knew that paul drayton had thrown off his coat a good riddance he muttered and the heavy garment fell with a thud hugh ritson had returned to the bed head give me a hand he said raise him gently there i'll hold him up now draw off his coat quietly one arm at a time is it free then lift away another heavy garment fell with a thud what's the fence got in his other pockets eh come lend your hand again draw off the boots they're cumberland make and yours are cockney style quick drayton stepped to the bottom of the bed and fumbled at the feet of the insensible man he was then within a yard of the spot where the girl stood she could feel his proximity and the alcoholic fumes of his breath rose to her nostrils she was dizzy and thought she must have fallen she stretched out one hand to save herself and it fell on to the bed rail it was within a foot of drayton's arm take off his stockings they're homespun while i remove the cravat the pin was a present it has his name engraved on the plate behind the slant of the moonlight had died off the floor and all was dark drayton's craven fears seemed to leave him he laughed and crowed how quiet the fence is very obliging i'm sure just fainted in the nick of time will it last quick strip off your own clothes and put them where these have come from the coat with the torn lapel where is it make no mistake about that i'll pound it no drayton laughed a short hoarse laugh there was some shuffling in the darkness then a pause hush mercy knew that hugh ritson had grasped the arm of drayton and that both held their breath at that moment the moonlight returned and the bleared shaft that had once crossed the floor now crossed the bed the light fell on the face of the prostrate man his eyes were open water water said paul ritson very feebly hugh ritson stepped out of the moonlight and went behind his brother then mercy saw a hand before paul's face putting a spirit flask to his mouth when the hand was raised the face twitched slightly the eyes closed with a convulsive tremor and the half lifted head fell back on to the pillow he'll be quieter than ever now said hugh ritson softly mercy thought she must have screamed but the instinct of self preservation kept her still she stirred not a limb her head rested against the wall her eyes peered into the darkness her parched tongue and parted lips burned like fire quick put his clothes on to your own back and let us be gone drayton drew on the garments and laughed hoarsely and a good fit too same make of a man to a t ex act ly the window and the door stood face to face the bed was on the left of the door with the head at the door end the narrow alcove in which the girl stood was to the left of the window and in front of the window there was a dressing table drayton stepped up to this table to fix the cravat by the glass the faint moonlight that fell on his grinning face was reflected dimly into the mirror at that moment mercy's sickening eyes turned toward the bed there in repose that was like death itself lay the upturned face of paul ritson two faces cast by nature in the same mold one white and serene and peaceful the other bloated red smirking distorted by passion with cruel eyes and smoking lips the very thing the very thing damme if his own mother wouldn't take me for her son hugh ritson stepped to drayton's side when he spoke his voice was like a cold blast of wind now listen from this moment at which you change your coat for his you cease to be paul drayton and become paul ritson didn't you say i was to be paul lowther that will come later as i say it won't go into my nob no matter say nothing to yourself but this 'i am to pretend to be paul ritson' well now for it ready asked hugh he returned to the bed head ready then give a hand here we must put him up into your garret when the police come for him he must seem to be in hiding and in drink you understand a low hoarse laugh was the only answer then they lifted the unconscious man from the bed opened the door and carried him into the passage mercy recovered her stunned senses when the men were gone she crept out on tiptoe and tripped down the passage to her own room at the door she reeled and fell heavily then in a vague state of consciousness she heard these words passed over her carry her back into her room and lock her in at the same instant she felt herself being lifted in a strong man's arms chapter xvi before gubblum oglethorpe parted with jabez he tried to undo the mischief he had done give us a shak' o' thy daddle he said holding out his hand but jabez had not forgotten the similitude of the swine ring he made no response dang him for a fool thought gubblum he's as daft as a besom then gubblum remembered with what lavish generosity he had bribed the pot boy to no purpose he cover't a shilling dammish he thought i'll dang his silly head off jabez put down the candle and backed out of the room his eyes fixed on the peddler with a ghostly stare you needn't boggle at me i'll none hurt ye said gubblum jabez pulled the door after him his head's no'but a lump of puddin' and a daub o' pancake thought gubblum then the peddler sat on the bed and began to wonder what possible reason there might be for the lad's sudden change of temper he sat long and many crude notions trotted through his brain at last he recalled the fact that he had said something about jabez's snout carrying a swine ring that was the rub sure enough i mak' no doobt he thowt it was a by wipe thought gubblum just as the peddler had arrived at this sapient conclusion he heard heavy footsteps ascending and descending the ladder that stood in the passage outside gubblum understood the sounds to mean that the inn was so full of visitors that some of them had to be lodged even in the loft ey i shouldn't wonder but this is a bonny paying consarn he thought he undressed got into bed and blew out his light he lay awhile waiting for sleep and thinking of the failure of his plummets to sound the depths of jabez then he remembered with vexation that the lad had even laughed at him in spite of the shilling dammish shaf it was no'but his guts crowkin' thought gubblum and he rolled over face to the wall and began to pay nasal tribute to sleep from the slowly tightening grip of unconsciousness gubblum was roused to sudden wakefulness there was a noise as of heavy shuffling feet outside his door the peddler raised himself and listened too dark in this corner said a voice get a light gubblum crept out of bed held his head to the door and listened there were retreating steps then the man who had spoken before spoke again quick there we must catch the train at eleven fifteen the voice pealed in gubblum's memory he knew it it was the voice of the last man he should have looked for in this house hugh ritson presently the footsteps approached and thin fingers of light shot over gubblum's head into his dark room he looked up at the door three small round holes had been pierced into the styles for ventilation put the candle on the floor and take the feet i'll go up first said the same voice gubblum raised himself on tiptoe and tried to peer through the perforations he was too small a man to see through there was a chair by the side of his bed and his extinguished candle stood on it he removed the candlestick lifted the chair cautiously placed its back to the door and mounted it then he saw all there were two men and he knew both the brothers ritson ah had he not said that paul ritson kept this inn i'll shut up the whole boilin' of 'em next time thought the peddler wait what are they lugging into the pigeon loft easy damme but the fence is a weight it was the hoarse voice of the other man the candle was behind him and on the floor it cast its light on his back if i could no'but get a blink frae the cannel i'd see what's atween them thought gubblum the men with their burden were now at the top of the ladder twist about and go in sideways muttered the voice first heard the man below twisted this movement brought the full light of the candle on to the faces of all three lord a'mighty whativer's this gubblum thought the burden was a man's body but it was the face that startled the peddler the face of paul ritson gubblum's eyes passed over the group in one quick glance he saw two paul ritsons there and one of them lay as still as the dead a minute more of awful tension and the door of the loft above was slammed and shut the heavy feet of the two men descended the ladder quickly and went down the stairs into the bar gubblum listened as if with every sense he knew that the outer door to the road had opened and closed he heard footsteps dying away in the distance without all was silent within the house two men hastening in the night to the hendon railway station paused at that turn of the road which leads to the police offices and jail you go on and take care of yourself i'll follow in five minutes said one you ain't going to give a man away said the other there was only a contemptuous snort for answer the first speaker had turned on his heel when he reached the police offices he rang the bell the door was answered by a sergeant in plain clothes i've found your man for you said hugh ritson where sir at the hawk and heron who is he paul drayton you'll find him lying in the garret at the west end of the gable drunk lose not an hour go at once is the gentleman who struggled with him still staying there mr paul ritson no he goes back home to night what's his address in the country the ghyll newlands cumberland and yours sir i am his brother hugh ritson and my address is the same we'll go this instant well take your piece of frieze with you and see if it fits it was by the torn ulster that i recognized your man good night chapter xvii as soon as the noise of the retiring steps had died away on gubblum's ear he dressed himself partially opened the door of his bedroom cautiously and stepped into the passage he was still in the dark and groping with one hand he felt for the ladder by which the two men had carried their burden to the loft above he had grasped the lowest rungs of it and was already some steps up when he heard a singular noise it was something between the cry of a child and the deep moan of a sick man did it come from the loft gubblum held his head in that direction and listened no the sound was from the other end of the passage now it was gone and all was quiet what a strange house was this can't see a styme thought gubblum i'll away for the cannel back in his bedroom he struck a match and then stepped afresh into the passage guarding the newly lighted candle with the palm of his hand then there came a shrill cry it seemed to be before him above him behind him everywhere about him gubblum's knees gave way but the stubborn bit of heart in him was not to be shaken a rayder queerly sort of a house he thought and at that instant there were heavy lunges at a door at the further end of the passage and a cry of help help gubblum darted in the direction of the voice let me out cried the voice from within gubblum tried the door it was locked help help came again in a sniffer rest ye a bit shouted gubblum and putting the light on the floor he planted his shoulder against the door and one foot against the opposite wall help help let me out quick quick came once more from within sec a skrummidge shouted gubblum panting for breath then the lock gave way and the door flew open in the midst of the bad light gubblum saw nothing at first then a woman with wild eyes and a face of anguish came out on him from the dark room it was mercy fisher when they recognized each other there was a moment of silence but it was only a moment and that moment was too precious to be lost in a flood of tears the girl told him what had happened gubblum understood no more than that villainy had been at work mercy saw nothing but that she had been deceived and had been herself the instrument of deception this was enough the raggabrash i'd like to rozzle their backs with an ash stick said gubblum oh where have they taken him where where cried mercy wringing her hands don't put on wi' thee i know said gubblum i questit them up the stairs come along wi' me lass and don't slobber and yowl like a barn gubblum whipped up his candle and hurried along the passage and up the ladder like a monkey mercy following at his heels belike they've locked this door forby he said but no the key was in the lock gubblum turned it and pushed it open then he peered into the garret holding the candle above his head when the light penetrated the darkness they saw a man's figure outstretched on a mattress that lay on the bare floor of the empty room they ran up to it and raised the head it's his fadder's son i'll uphod thee said gubblum and yon riff raff his spitten picter is no'but some wastrel merry begot mercy was down on her knees beside the insensible man chafing his hands there was a tremulous movement of the eyelids sista he's coming tul't slip away for watter lass said gubblum mercy was gone and back in an instant let a be let a be he'll come round in a crack rub his forehead stir thy hand lass pour the watter there that's enough plenty o' butter wad sto a dog sista he's coming tul't fast paul ritson had opened his eyes slip away for mair watter lass there that's summat like rest ye my lad a drink ey a sup o' watter paul looked around him his filmy eyes were full of questions but at first his tongue would not speak he looked up at the bare skylight and around at the bleached walls and then back into the face of the peddler he noticed mercy and smiled where are we my girl he said faintly this is the hawk and heron she answered how do i come to be here he asked mercy covered her face and sobbed i brought you she said at length paul looked at her a moment with bewildered eyes then the tide of memory flowed back upon his mind i remember he said quietly i was feeling dizzy hadn't slept two nights not even been in bed walked the streets the long hours through everything had rushed over him in a moment and he closed his eyes with a deep groan at his feet mercy buried her face and sobbed aloud paul drew himself feebly up on his elbow where is parson christian he asked and gazed around with a faint smile the girl's anguish overflowed that was a lie i told you she sobbed the smile fled away a lie why a lie he was struggling with a dazed sense i told you that parson christian was here and wanted you he is not here and mercy's weeping seemed to choke her my good girl and why they brought you to this room and left you and now they are gone they who your brother hugh and mr drayton paul looked deadly sick at heart who is this drayton the spitten picter of yourself my lad said gubblum the man i telt ye of lang ago him as keeps this house paul's eyes wandered vacantly his nervous fingers twitched at the ulster that he wore what's this he said and glanced down at his altered dress when you were insensible they stripped you of your clothes and put others on you said mercy whose clothes are these mr drayton's paul ritson rose to his feet where are the men he said in a husky voice gone where to the station that was all i heard paul gazed about with hazy eyes mercy flung herself at his feet and wept bitterly forgive me oh forgive me he looked down at her with a confused expression his brain was benumbed he drew one arm across his face as though struggling to recover some lost link of memory why my good lass what's this he said and then smiled faintly and made an attempt to raise her up who is at the convent at westminster she asked then all his manner changed why what of that he said mrs drayton was sent there in a cab to tell mrs ritson to be at st pancras station at midnight to meet her husband and return to cumberland the face that had been pale became suddenly old and ghastly there was an awful silence is this the truth he asked yes yes cried the girl i think i see it all now i think i understand he faltered forgive me cried the girl he seemed hardly to see her i have been left in this room insensible and the impostor who resembles me where is he now he struggled with the sickness that was mastering him his brain reeled the palms of his hands became damp he staggered and leaned against the wall rest ye a bit my lad said gubblum you'll be gitten stanch agen soon he recovered his feet his face was charged with new anger and the wicked woman who trapped me to this house is still here he said in a voice thick with wrath forgive me forgive me wept the girl at his feet he took her firmly by the shoulders raised her to her knees and turned her face upward till her eyes met his let me look at her he said hoarsely who would have believed it forgive me forgive me cried the girl woman woman what had i done to you what what the girl's sobs alone made answer in his rage he took her by the throat a fearful purpose was written in his face and this is the woman who bowed down the head of her old father nigh to the grave he said bitterly and flung her from him then he staggered back his little strength had left him there was silence only the girl's weeping could be heard the next instant strangely calm without a tear in his sad eyes he stepped to her side and raised her to her feet i was wrong he said surely i was wrong you could not lie to me like that and know it no no no they told me what i told you said the girl and i blamed you for it all poor girl then you forgive me she said lifting her eyes timidly forgive you ask god to forgive you girl i am only a man and you have wrecked my life there was a foot on the ladder and jabez the boy stepped up a candle in his hand he had been waiting for the landlady when he heard voices overhead the varra man shouted gubblum didsta see owt of thy master down stairs jabez grinned and glanced up at paul ritson hark ye laal man didsta see two men leaving the house a matter of fifteen minutes ago belike i did said jabez and to be sure it were the gentleman that come here afore and another one another one your master you mean jabez grinned from ear to ear didsta hear owt i heard the gentleman say they had to be at st pancras at midnight paul fumbled at his breast for his watch it was gone what's o'clock he asked fifteen after eleven master said jabez i've just bolted up paul's face was full of resolution i'll follow he said i've lost time enough already what man you'll never manish it and you as weak as watter forby you'll be falling swat in the road like a wet sack paul had pulled the door open excitement lent him strength the next moment he was gone where's the master off to st pancras asked jabez fadge te fadge gang out of my gate away and lig down your daft head in bed said gubblum jabez did not act on the peddler's advice he returned to the bar to await the return of mrs drayton whose unaccustomed absence gave rise to many sapient conjectures in the boy's lachrymose noddle he found the door to the road open and from this circumstance his swift intelligence drew the conclusion that his master had already gone his hand was on the door to close and bolt it when he heard rapid footsteps approaching in an instant two men pushed past him and into the house where's mr drayton said one panting from his run he's this minute gone said jabez is that true my lad the man asked laying a hand on the boy's shoulder he's gone to st pancras sir he's got to be there at midnight said jabez the boy had recognized the visitors and was trembling the men glanced into each other's faces that was drayton the man that ran past us down the road said one make sure of it said the other search the place i'll wait for you here in two minutes more the men had left the house together a quarter of an hour later the night porter at the hendon railway station saw a man run across the platform and leap into the up train just as the carriages were moving away he remarked that the man was bareheaded and wore his clothes awry and that a rent near the collar of his long frieze ulster exposed a strip of red flannel lining he thought he knew him the train had barely cleared the platform when two men ran up and came suddenly to a stand in front of the porter gone said one of them with vexation that would be the said the other to king's cross did any one get into it here porter yes sergeant drayton of the hawk and heron said the porter your next up is to st pancras yes sir due at twelve is it prompt to the second the two men faced about time enough yet said one chapter xviii the cab that drove mrs drayton into london carried with it a world of memories thought in her old head was like the dip of a sea bird in the sea now here now there now a straight flight and now a backward swirl as she rattled over the dark roads of child hill and the new end she puzzled her confused brain to understand the business on which she had been sent why had the gentleman been brought out to hendon why being ill was he so soon to be removed why being removed was he not put back into this cab and driven to the station for cumberland what purpose could be served by sending her to the convent for the gentleman's wife when the gentleman himself might have been driven there why was the lady in a convent the landlady pursed up her lips and contracted her wrinkled brows in a vain endeavor to get light out of the gloom of these mysteries the thought of the gentleman lying ill at her house suggested many thoughts concerning her son paul was not her son and his name was not drayton whose son he was she never knew and what his name was she had never heard but she had fixed and done for him since he was a baby and no mother could have loved a son more than she had loved her paul what a poor puling little one he was and how the neighbors used to shake their heads and say you'll never rear it there's a fate on it poor misbegotten mite that was thirty long years ago and now paul was the lustiest young man in hendon ah it was not hendon then but london and her husband the good man was alive and hearty it'll thrive yet martha he would say and the little one would seem to know him and would smile and crow when he cracked his fingers over its cot then the landlady thought of the dark days that followed when bread was scarce and the gossips would say serve you right what for do you have an extra mouth to feed take the brat to the foundling but her husband god bless him had always said what's bite and sup for a child keep him martha he'll be a comfort to ye yet old woman mrs drayton wiped her eyes as she drove in the dark then the bad times changed and they left the town and took the inn at hendon and then the worst times of all came on them for as soon as they were snug and comfortable the good man himself died he lay dying a week and when the end came he cried for the child give me the boy he said and she lifted the child into his arms in bed then he raised his thin white hand to stroke the wavy hair but the poor hand fell into the little one's face mrs drayton shifted in her seat and tried to drive away the memories that trod on the heels of these recollections but the roads were still dark and nothing but an empty sky was to be seen and the memories would not be driven away she recalled the days when young paul grew to be a lusty lad daring reckless the first in mischief the deepest in trouble and there was no man's hand to check him and people shook their heads and whispered he'll come to a bad end he has the wickedness in his blood poor lad it was not his fault if he had turned out a little wild and wayward and rough and cruel to his own mother as you might say jostling her when he had a drop to drink and maybe striking her when he didn't know what he was doing and never turning his hand to honest work but always dreaming of fortunes coming some day and betting and racing and going here and there and never resting happy and content at home it was not his fault he had been led astray by bad companions and then she didn't mind a blow not she every woman had to bear the like of that you want a world of patience if you have men creatures about you that's all thinking of bad companions suggested to the landlady's mind by some strange twist of which she was never fully conscious the idea of hugh ritson the gentleman who had come so strangely among them appeared to have a curious influence over paul he seemed to know something of paul's mother paul himself rummaged matters up long ago and found that the lady had escaped from the asylum and been lost and now the strange gentleman came with her portrait and said she was dead poor soul how well mrs drayton remembered her and that was thirty years ago she had never afterward set eyes on the lady and never heard of her but once and even that once must be five and twenty years since one day she went for coal to the wharf at pimlico and there she met an old neighbor who said mrs drayton your lodger she that drowned herself came back for the babby but your man and you were shifted away and to think that the poor young thing was dead and gone now and she herself who had thought she was old even in those days was alive and hearty still by this time the cab was rattling through the busy streets of london and the train of the landlady's thoughts was broken only in a vague way did she know where she was going the cab was taking her there and it would take her back again when they reached the convent she had to ask for mrs ritson and say she was sent to take her to st pancras station to meet her husband there and return to cumberland by the train at midnight that was all the clock of the abbey was marking the half hour after eleven as the cab passed into parliament square in another minute they drew up before the convent in abbey gardens the cabman jumped from the box rang the bell and helped mrs drayton to alight the iron gate and the door in the portico swung open together and a nun stood on the threshold holding a lamp in her hand mrs drayton hobbled up the steps and entered the hall a deep gloom pervaded the wide apartment in which there were but two wicker chairs and a table the nun wore a gray serge gown with a wimple cut square on her chest a girdle about her waist and a rosary hanging by her side can i see a lady boarder mrs ritson said the landlady the nun started a little and then answered in a low melancholy voice in which the words she spoke were lost mrs drayton's eyes were now accustomed to the gloom and she looked into the nun's face it was a troubled and clouded face and when it was lifted for an instant to her own mrs drayton felt chilled as if a death's hand had touched her it was the face of the mother of paul older sadder calmer but the same face still the nun dropped her eyes and made the sign of the cross then she walked with a quick and noiseless step to the other end of the hall and sounded a deep gong in a moment this summoned a sister a novice dressed like the first except all in white mrs drayton was now trembling from head to foot but she repeated her question and was led into a bare chill room and left alone chapter xix when greta parted from hugh ritson three hours before she was in an agony of suspense another strange threat had terrified her she had been asked to make choice of one of two evils refusing to believe in hugh ritson's power she had rejected both but the uncertainty was terrible to what lengths might not passion unrequited passion defeated passion outraged passion lead a man like hugh ritson without pity without remorse with a will that was relentless and a heart that never knew truth he was a man to flinch at no extremity what had he meant greta's first impulse had been to go in search of her husband but this was an idle and a foolish thought where should she look besides this she had promised to remain in the convent until her husband should come for her and she must keep her word she did not go to supper when the gong sounded but crept up to her room the bell rang for vespers and greta did not go to the chapel she lay down in anguish and wept scalding tears the vesper hymn floated up to her where she lay and she was still weeping there was no light in this dark place there was no way out of this maze but to wait and suffer and slowly the certainty stole upon her that hugh ritson had made no idle threat he was a resolute man he had given her a choice of two courses and had she not taken a selfish part if paul her husband were indeed in danger no matter from what machination of villainy was it much to ask that she his wife should rescue him by a sacrifice that fell heaviest upon herself hugh ritson had been right her part had been a selfish one oh where was mr christian she had telegraphed for him and he had answered that he would come yet hour had followed hour and still he had not arrived three hours she tossed in agony she heard the sisters pass up the echoing stone staircase to their dormitories and then the silent house became as dumb as a vault not a ripple flowed into this still tarn from the great stream of the world that rushed and surged and swelled with the clangor of a million voices around its incrusted sides her window overlooked the abbey gardens all was quiet beneath not a step sounded on the pavement before her the blank wall was black and the dark leafless trees stood out from the vague green of the grass beyond against the sky were the dim outlines of the two towers of the old abbey by day a great rock for the pigeons that wheeled above the tumbling sea of the city by night a skull of stone from which the voice of the bell told of the flight of time out of the calm of a moment's stupefaction greta was awakened by a knock at her door the novice entered and told her that a woman waited below to speak with her greta betrayed no surprise and she was beyond the reach of fresh agitation without word or question she followed the novice to the room where mrs drayton sat she recognized the landlady and heard her story greta's heart leaped up at the thought of rejoining her husband here was the answer to the prayer that had gone up she knew not how often from her troubled heart soon she would be sure that hugh ritson's threat was vain soon she would be at paul's side and hold his hand and no earthly power should separate them again ah thank god the merciful father who healed the wounded hearts of his children she should very soon be happy once more and all the sorrows of these past few days would fade away into a dim memory twelve o'clock at st pancras and you have the luggage in a cab at the door you say yes and there's no time to lose for to be sure the night is going fast said mrs drayton and he will be there to meet me asked greta her eyes still wet with recent tears danced with a new found joy yes at st pancras said the landlady greta's happiness overflowed she took the old woman in her arms and kissed her wizened cheeks wait a minute only a minute she said and tripped off with the swift glide of a lapwing but when she was half way up the stairs her ardor was arrested and she returned with drooping face and steps of lead but why did he not come for me himself she asked the gentleman is not well he is ill said mrs drayton ill you say he is ill then he could not come and i blamed him for not coming the gentleman is weak but noways worse belike he will go straight off and meet you at the station greta turned away once again and went upstairs slowly at a door on the first landing she tapped lightly and when a voice answered from within she entered the room the superior was on her knees at a table she lifted a calm and spiritual face as greta approached reverend mother said greta i am leaving you this moment so soon my daughter my husband has sent for me he will meet me at the railway station at twelve why did he not come himself he is ill he has gone direct the hour is late and the message is sudden are you satisfied i am anxious reverend mother what is it my daughter an old gentleman a clergyman mr christian is coming from cumberland i have expected him hourly but he is not yet arrived i cannot wait i must rejoin my husband will you order that a message be left for the clergyman what is the message my child simply that i have returned with my husband by the train leaving st pancras at midnight the lay sister in the hall shall deliver it who is the sister sister grace there was a silence reverend mother has sister grace ever spoken of the past the superior told a few beads the past is as nothing to us here my daughter within these walls the world does not enter in the presence of the cross the past and the future are one greta drew a long breath then she stooped and kissed the hand of the superior and turned softly away greta and the landlady passed out through the deep portico and the same nun who had opened the door closed it behind them mrs drayton clung to greta's arm as they went through and her hand trembled perceptibly who is she whispered the landlady when they were seated in a cab sister grace said greta and turned her head aside i could ha' sworn as she were the mother of my paul murmured mrs drayton greta faced about but the landlady saw nothing of the look of inquiry her eyes like her thoughts were far away chapter xx though the hour was late the streets were thronged the people were trooping home from the theaters and the strand as greta and the landlady crossed it was choked with cabs and omnibuses the cab drove through the seven dials and there the public houses were disgorging at every corner their poor ruins of men and women shouts curses quarreling and laughter struck upon the ear above the whir of the wheels unshaven men and unwashed women squalid children running here and there among the oyster and orange stalls thieves idlers vagabonds of all conditions not a few honest people withal and among them the dark figures of policemen greta's heart beat high that night her spirit was full of a new alacrity every inch of the way as they flew over the busy streets seemed to awake in her soul some fresh sensibility she wondered where the multitudes of people came from and whither they were going vast oceans on oceans of humanity flowing and ebbing without tide she wanted to alight a hundred times and empty her pockets of all her money a blind man playing a tin whistle and leading a small dog held by a long string awoke her special pity the plaintive look in the eye of the cur was an object of peculiar sympathy a filthy woman reeling drunk and bareheaded across the street almost under the feet of the horses her discolored breast hanging bare and a puny infant crying feebly in her arms was another occasion for solicitude a tiny mite that might have been a dirty boy coiled up in a ball on a doorstep like a starved cat was an object of all but irresistible attraction but she dare not stop for an instant and at last with this certainty she lay back and shut her eyes very resolutely and wondered whether after all it were not very selfish to be very happy the cab stopped with a jolt they were at st pancras station has he come asked greta eagerly and looked about her with eyes that comprehended everything at a glance she could not see paul and when a porter opened the cab and helped her to alight it was on her tongue to ask the man if he had seen her husband but no she would not do that she must look for him herself so that she might be the first to see him oh yes she must be the very first to see him and she was now obstinately determined to ask no one the porter brought round the truck and wheeled the luggage onto the platform and greta and mrs drayton followed it then the wide eyes that half smiled and looked half afraid beneath their trembling lids glanced anxiously around no paul was not there what is the time she asked her eyes still wandering over the bustling throng about her ten to twelve miss announced the porter oh she said with a sigh of relief then he will soon be here will you sit in the waiting room miss asked the porter and almost unconsciously she followed him when he led the way mrs drayton hobbled behind her what did he say about being ill she asked when they were left together that he was only a bit dizzy mayhap he's noways 'customed to illness said the landlady that is true and what did you say then i coaxed him to rest him a bit and take a drop o' summat and he smiled and said 'thank you my good woman' you were in the right you dear old soul said greta and she put her arms about the landlady and hugged her i'm sure you've been very good to my husband and watched him tenderly while i who should have nursed him have been away thank you thank you mrs drayton was feeling uneasy well d'ye know i can't bear to see a fellow creatur' suffer it goes agen me someways greta had risen to her feet stay here mrs drayton drayton isn't it stay here while i go on to the platform he might come and not see me ah yes he may be looking everywhere for me now she went out and elbowed her way among the people who were hurrying to and fro she dodged between the trucks that were sliding luggage on to the weighing machine and off to the van the engines were puffing volumes of smoke and steam up to the great glass roof where the whistle of the engine man echoed sharp and shrill presently she returned to the waiting room oh mrs drayton she said i dreamed a fearful dream last night what do you think will he be well enough to come coorse coorse my dear 'tell her to meet her husband at twelve' them's the gentleman's own words how happy i shall be when we are safe at home and if he is ill it will be for me to nurse him then the light in the dove like eyes at that moment told plainly that to the poor soul even illness might bring its compensating happiness and as to dreams to be sure they are on'y dreams and what's dreams say i you are right mrs drayton said greta and once more she shot away toward the platform her mind had turned to parson christian could it be possible that he had arrived the porter who had brought in her luggage was still standing beside it and with him there was another porter their backs were toward greta as she came out of the waiting room and tripping lightly behind them she overheard a part of their conversation before they were aware that she was near see the old file in the gaiters by the eleven up said one rather a reg'lar grandmother's great grandfather just out of the year one talk about swallows eh and the buckles and the stockings good sort how an' ever good for a tip eh wouldn't ha' thought it no but a real good hearted 'un an' if he is a pape never to be sure got me to put him in a fly for the catholic convent up westminster way greta could restrain herself no longer but burst in upon them with twenty questions when had the parson arrived when had he left was it in a fly would it go quickly could there be time for it to get back what's your train miss twelve to the north yes will he catch it scarce get back at twelve said the porter but in spite of this discouraging prophecy greta was so elated at the fresh intelligence that she drew out her purse and gave the man five shillings she had no other change than two half crowns and two pennies and in her present elevation of soul there could be no choice between the silver and the copper as to which the bearer of such news deserved the man stared and then smiled but he quickly reconciled himself to the unexpected with extraordinary alacrity he labeled the luggage and bowled off to the north train which was already at the platform it was now within three minutes of midnight and mrs drayton had joined greta in the bustling throng on the platform oh i feel as if a thousand hearts were all swelling and beating in my breast at once said greta mrs drayton is it certain that he will come porter have you put the luggage in the van which is the train the left no miss the left's going out to make room for the local train up from kentish town and hendon the right's your train miss got your ticket miss not yet must i get it think you is the time short yes i will get two tickets myself she added turning to the landlady then when he comes he will have nothing to do but step into the carriage you'll have to be quick miss train's nigh due out only a minute said the porter greta's luminous eyes were peering over the heads of the people that were about her then they brightened with a flash more swift than lightning and all her face wore in an instant a heavenly smile ah he is there there at the back at the booking office run to him run my good dear creature run and tell him i am here i'll find a compartment and have the door open greta tripped along the platform with the foot of a deer in another moment she had a carriage door open and she stood there with the handle in her hand she saw him coming who was more than all the world to her but she did not look twice no she would not look twice she would wait until they were within alone together side by side with him walked hugh ritson could it be possible and was it he who had brought her husband ah he had repented and it was only she who had been bitter to the end how generous of him how cruel of her her eyes fell and a warm flush overspread her cheeks as he who came first stepped into the carriage she did not look again at him nor did he look again at her she knew he did not though her eyes were down oh when we are alone she thought and then she turned to hugh ritson the heavenly smile was still on her beautiful face and the deep light in her eyes spoke of mingled joy and grief hugh i fear i fear she faltered i have been hard and cruel let us be friends let me be your dearest sister he looked at her in silence his infirm foot trailed a pace he saw what was in her heart and he knew well what was in his own heart too he thought of the blow that he was about to strike her she held out her hand and took in hers his own unresisting fingers ay he knew that there and then he was about to break that forgiving heart forever he knew who had stepped into that carriage she leaned forward and kissed his cheek the man in him could bear up no longer he broke down he could not speak he was choked with emotion she turned to the landlady who stood near twitching at the ribbons of her bonnet and peering into the carriage good bye mrs drayton and god bless you for what you have done for my husband the landlady muttered something that was inaudible she was confused she stammered and then was silent greta stepped into the carriage the guard was standing at the door the bell had been rung the train had been signaled the whistle had sounded the clocks were striking midnight wait wait it was a voice from the end of the platform the guard turned with a smile to see who called on a train to wait an old gentleman in silk stockings and gaiters with long white hair flowing under the broad brim of a low crowned hat came panting to the only door that was still open quick sir it's moving in with you mr christian cried greta and throwing her arms about him she drew him into the carriage then the train began to move away at that instant another train the local train from kentish town and hendon steamed up to the opposite side of the platform before it had stopped two men leaped out they were the two police sergeants instantly simultaneously a man burst through the barrier and ran on to the platform from the street he was bareheaded and his face was ghastly white in one moment the police sergeants had laid hands upon him the train to the north had not yet cleared the platform he saw it passing out he took hold of the hands by which he was held and threw them off as if their grasp had been the grasp of a child then he bounded away toward the retreating train it was now moving rapidly it was gone it was swallowed up in the dark mouth beyond and the man stood behind bareheaded dripping with perspiration yet white as ashes his clothes awry the collar of his frieze ulster torn away and a strip of red flannel lining exposed it was paul ritson the police sergeants hurried up with the re enforcement of two porters to recover their man but he was quiet enough now he did not stir a muscle when they handcuffed him he looked around with vague vacant eyes hardly seeming to realize where he was or what was being done with him his frenzy was gone they led him down the platform hugh ritson was standing on the spot where greta had left him one minute before when the company neared that spot the prisoner stopped he looked across at hugh ritson in silence and for an instant the dazed look died off his face then he turned his head aside and allowed himself to be led quietly away chapter xxi a morning paper of november contained the following paragraph it will be remembered that in the reports of the disastrous railway collision which occurred at hendon on friday last it was mentioned as a ghastly accessory to the story of horror that an injured passenger who had been lifted from the debris of broken carriages and put to lie out of harm's way in a field close at hand was brutally assaulted and apparently robbed by some unknown scoundrel who though detected in the act itself tore himself from the grasp of police sergeant cox of the hendon division of the metropolitan police force and escaped in the darkness the authorities were determined that their vigilance should not be eluded and a person named paul drayton is now in custody and will be brought up at bow street this morning it turns out that drayton is an innkeeper at hendon where he has long borne a dubious character he was arrested at midnight in st pancras station in a daring and mad attempt to escape by the north bound train and it is understood that the incident of his capture is such as reflects the highest credit on the resolution energy and intrepidity of the force the same paper of the day after contained this further paragraph the man drayton who was yesterday formally committed to take his trial at the central criminal court will be brought up at the old bailey to morrow and as the evidence is said to be of a simple and unconflicting character it is not expected that the hearing will extend over a single day it is stated that the accused who observed a rigid silence during yesterday's proceedings will on his trial set up the extraordinary defense of mistaken identity an evening paper of friday november contained the following remarks in the course of a leading note it is a familiar legal maxim that a plea of alibi that breaks down is the worst of all accusations the scoundrel that attempted to rob a dying man who lay helpless and at his mercy amid the confusion of friday night's accident at hendon was audacious enough to put forth the defense that he was not the man he was taken for cases of mistaken identity are of course common enough in the annals of jurisprudence but we imagine the instances are rare indeed of evidence of identity so exceptional and conclusive as that which convicted the hendon innkeeper being susceptible of error the very clothes he wore in the dock bore their own witness to his guilt and the court saw the police sergeant produce a scrap of cloth torn from the guilty man's back which exactly fitted a rent in the prisoner's ulster the whole case would be a case of criminality too gross and palpable to merit a syllable of comment but for the astounding assurance with which the accused adhered to his plea in the face of evidence that was so complete as to make denial little more than a farce he denied that he was paul drayton and said his name was paul ritson he was identified as drayton by several witnesses who have known him from infancy among others by his old mother martha drayton whose evidence given with reluctance and with more tears than a son so unnatural deserved was at once as damning and as painful as anything of the kind ever heard in a court of justice the claim to be paul ritson was answered by the evidence of mr hugh ritson mine owner in cumberland and brother of the gentleman whom the prisoner wished to personate mr h ritson admitted a resemblance but had no hesitation in saying that the accused was not his brother the prisoner thereupon applied to the court that the wife of paul ritson should be examined but as it was explained that both husband and wife were at present ill in cumberland the court wisely ruled against the application as a final freak of defense the prisoner asked for the examination of one mercy fisher who he said would be able to say by what circumstances he came to wear the clothes of the guilty man the court adjourned for an hour in order that this person might be produced but on reassembling it was explained that the girl who turned out to be a mistress whom drayton had kept at his mother's house had disappeared thus with a well merited sentence of three years' penal servitude ended a trial of which the vulgarity of detail was only equalled by the audacity of defense a week passed and the public had almost forgotten the incidents of the trial when the following paragraph appeared in a weekly journal i have heard that the man who was sentenced to three years' penal servitude for robbery at the scene of the hendon accident was seized with an attack of brain fever immediately upon his arrival at millbank the facts that transpire within that place of retirement are whispered with as much reserve as guards the secrets of another kind of confessional but i do hear that since the admission of the man who was known on his trial as paul drayton and who is now indicated by a numerical cognomen certain facts have come to light which favor the defense he set up of mistaken identity chapter xxii the chapter room of st margaret's convent was a chill bare chamber containing an oak table and four or five plain oak chairs on the painted walls which were of dun gray there was an etching by a florentine master of the flight into egypt and a symbolic print of the sacred heart besides these pictures there was but a single text to relieve the blindness of the empty walls and it ran where the tree falls there it must lie four days after greta's departure from the house wherein she had been received as a temporary boarder the superior sat in the chapter room and a sister knelt at her feet the sister's habit was gray and her linen cape was plain she wore no scapular and no hood above the close cap that hid her hair and crossed her forehead she was therefore a lay sister she was sister grace mother hear my sin she said in a trembling whisper speak on daughter we were both at athlone in the year of the great famine he was an officer in a regiment quartered there i was a novice of the choir in the order of charity we met in scenes sanctified by religion oh mother the famine was sore and he was kind to the famished people 'the hunger is on us' they would cry as if it had been a plague of locusts it was thus with their shrill voices and wan faces that the ragged multitudes followed us yes mother he was very very kind to the people well the penitent bowed her head yet lower my mother i renounced the vows and we were married the lips of the superior moved in silent prayer what was his name my daughter robert lowther we came from ireland to london a child was born and we called him paul then my husband's love grew chill and died i grieved over him perhaps i was but a moody companion at last he told me the voice faltered the whole body quivered well my child oh mother he told me i was not his wife that i was a catholic but that he was a protestant that a catholic priest had married us in ireland without question or inquiry that was not a valid marriage by english law shame on the english law but what do we know of the law at the foot of the cross well he left me mother i flung god's good gift away i tried to drown myself and my little child with me but they prevented me i was placed in an asylum for the insane and my baby my paul was given into the care of a woman with whom i had lodged have i not sinned deeply your sins are great my daughter but your sufferings have also been great what happened then i escaped from the asylum and returned for my child it was gone the woman had removed to some other part of london none knew where and my paul my darling was lost to me forever my mother it was then that i sinned deepest of all her head was bowed to her trembling knees and her voice was all but suspended in an agony of shame mother i flung away god's better gift than life oh how shall i tell you your foot trembles reverend mother you are a holy woman and know nothing of the world's temptations hush my daughter i am as great a sinner as yourself i cannot tell you mother mother you see i cannot it is for your soul's weal my daughter i had tried to serve god and he had seen my shame what was left to me but the world the world the world perhaps the world itself would have more mercy my kind mother have i not told you yet the superior made the sign of the cross ah my daughter the enemy of your soul was with you then you should not have ceased to lift your hands to heaven in supplication and prayer you should have prostrated yourself three days and nights in the tribune before the holy sacrament the penitent raised her pale face in less time i was a lost and abandoned woman the superior told a few beads with trembling fingers then she lifted the cross that hung from her girdle and held it out to the sister i thought of my child and prayed that he might be dead i thought of him who was not my husband and my heart grew cold and hard mother my redemption came yes but with it came the meaning of the fearful words too late amid the reeling madness of the life that is mocked with the name of gay i met a good man yes holy mother a good man mother he now sleeps there her pale face serene and solemn was lifted again and the hand that held the crucifix was raised above her head i loathed my life he took me away from it to the mountains to scotland and a child was born mother it was only then that i awoke as from a trance it seemed as if a ring of sin begirt me tears ah me what tears were shed but rest and content came at last and then we were married my daughter my daughter little did i think when i received your vows that the enemy of your soul had so mastered you listen a little longer holy mother the child grew to be the image of my darling my paul every feature every glance the same and partly to remind me of my lost one and partly to make me forget him forever i called the second child paul mother the years went by in peace the past was gone from me only its memory lay like a waste in my silent heart i had another son and called him hugh after many years my husband died the penitent paused mother another thing comes back to me but i have confessed it already shall i repeat it no my daughter not if it touches the oath that lay heavy on your heart i thought my first child was dead for thirty years i had not seen him but the pathways of our lives crossed at last and the woman who nursed him came to this house four days ago here mother my son the child of that first false union my darling for whom i wept scalding tears long long years ago my paul whose loss was all but the loss of his mother's soul my son is a thief and an outcast the lips of the superior moved again in prayer he is the man known to the world as paul drayton to me as paul lowther my dear daughter humble yourself in the midst of so awful a judgment do you say drayton drayton who as i hear was to day tried and sentenced no yes how shall i tell you the same and not the same mother the crime was committed by my son paul lowther the sentence was pronounced on my son paul ritson my dear daughter i was in the court and heard all and i alone knew all i alone alone bear with me that i transgressed the law of this holy order think oh my kind mother think that the nun was yet the woman and above all the mother yes i heard all i heard the charge that convicted my son paul lowther he was guilty before god and man but the prisoner in the dock was my son paul ritson i knew him and believed him when he denied the name they gave him ah me my heart bled what did you do my daughter mother i was weak very weak i could not see my duty clearly an awful conflict was rife within me i could not justify the one man without condemning the other and both were the children of my bosom fearful fearful but my daughter the one was guilty and the other innocent yes yes a thousand times yes but then there was myself how could i punish the guilty without revealing the secret sin that had been thirty years hidden in my heart and my poor weak spirit shrunk within me and i sat silent amid all my daughter we must crucify our spiritual pride yes yes but there was the love of my son paul ritson he thought me a good woman even yet how could i confess to that sinful past and not loose the love of the only human soul that held me pure and true mother it is very sweet to be loved oh my daughter my daughter a terrible situation terrible terrible mother i have told you everything tell me now what hope is left give me your direction my daughter let us humble ourselves before god and pray that he may reveal the path of duty come the superior rose took her crozier in her hand and walked out of the room the sister followed her they passed through the sacristy into the empty church it was evening the glow of a wintery sunset came through the windows to the west and fell in warm gules on the altar there was the hush of the world's awe here as day swooned into night without these walls were turmoil and strife within was the balm of rest the rest that lies in the heart of the cyclone and the good mother and the sister went down on their knees together and prayed for light and guidance the mother rose but the sister knelt on darkness fell and she was still kneeling and when the east was dabbled with the dawn the gray light fell on her bowed head and uplifted hands book iv the waters of marah are bitter chapter i in the year the dale lay green in the morning sunlight the river that ran through its lowest bed sparkled with purple and amber the leaves prattled low in the light breeze that souched through the rushes and the long grass the hills rose sheer and white to the smooth blue lake of the sky where only one fleecy cloud floated languidly across from peak to peak out of unseen places came the bleating of sheep and the rumble of distant cataracts and above the dull thud of tumbling waters far away was the thin caroling of birds overhead but the air was alive with yet sweeter sounds on the breast of the fell that lies over against cat bells a procession of children walked and sung and chattered and laughed it was st peter's day and they were rush bearing little ones of all ages from the comely girl of fourteen just ripening into maidenhood who walked last to the sweet boy of four in the pinafore braided with epaulets who strode along gallantly in front most of the little hands carried rushes but some were filled with ferns and mosses and flowers they had assembled at the school house and now on their way to the church they were making the circuit of the dale they passed over the road that crosses the river at the head of newlands and turned down into the path that follows the bed of the valley at that angle there stands a little group of cottages deliciously cool in their white wash nestling together under the heavy purple crag from which the waters of a ghyll fall into a deep basin that reaches to their walls the last of the group is a cottage with its end to the road and its open porch facing a garden shaped like a wedge as the children passed this house an old man gray and thin and much bent stood by the gate leaning on a staff a colly with the sheep dog's wooden bar suspended from its shaggy neck lay at his feet the hum of voices brought a young woman into the porch she was bareheaded and wore a light print gown her face was pale and marked with lines she walked cautiously stretching one hand before her with an uncertain motion and grasping a trailing tendril of honeysuckle that swept downward from the roof her eyes which were partly inclined upward and partly turned toward the procession had a vague light in their bleached pupils she was blind at her side and tugging at her other hand was a child of a year and a half a chubby sunny little fellow with ruddy cheeks blue eyes and fair curly hair prattling laughing singing snatches and waving their rushes and ferns above their happy thoughtless heads the children rattled past when they were gone the air was empty as it is when the lark stops in its song the church of newlands stands in the heart of the valley half hidden by a clump of trees by the lych gate parson christian stood that morning aged a little the snow a thought thicker on his bushy hair the face mellower the liquid eyes full of the sunlight behind which lies the shower greta stood beside him quieter of manner than in the old days a deeper thoughtfulness in her face her blue eyes more grave and less restless her fair hair no longer falling in waves behind her but gathered up into a demure knot under her hat here they come bless their innocent hearts said parson christian and at that moment the children turned an angle of the road the pink and white of their frocks and pinafores were all but hidden by the little forest of green that they carried before and above them 'till birnam wood do come to dunsinane muttered greta smiling when the rush bearers came up to the front of the church the lych gate was thrown open and they filed through how tired he looks the brave little boy said greta picking up the foremost of the company the tiny man in the epaulets now covered with the dust of the roads the little ones first and you great girls afterward said the parson those with flowers go up to the communion and lay them on the form and those with mosses put them on the font and those with rushes and ferns begin under the pulpit and come down the aisle to the porch the stalwart little tramp in greta's arms wriggled his way to the ground he had mosses in his hands and must go first then the children trooped into the church and in an instant the rude old place was alive with the buzz of prattling tongues the floor covered many a tomb graven on the plain slabs that formed the pathway down the middle of the church were the names of the men and women who had lived and died in the dale generations gone by in their own day they were children themselves and now other children their own children's children's children with never a thought about what lay beneath with only love in their eyes and laughter on their lips and life in their limbs were strewing rushes down the path above them in ten minutes there was not an inch of the flagged aisle visible all was green from the communion to the porch here and there an adventurous lad turning to account the skill at climbing acquired at birds' nesting had clambered over the pews to the rude cross trees and hung great bunches of rushes from the roof now children let us sing said the parson and taking up the accordion he started a hymn the leaded windows of the old church stood open and the sweet young voices floated away and far away over the uplands and the dale and the birds still sung in the blue sky and the ghylls still rumbled in the distance and the light wind still souched through the long grass and the morning sunlight shone over all there was a cloud of dust on the road and presently there came trooping down from the village a company of men surrounded by a whole circuit of dogs snarls and yaps and yelps and squawks and guffaws and sometimes the cachinnation and crow of cocks broke upon the clear air the roystering set would be as many as a dozen and all were more or less drunk first came john proudfoot the blacksmith in his shirt sleeves with his leathern apron wrapped in a knot about his waist and a silver and black game cock imprisoned under his arm lang geordie moore his young helper carried another fowl dick o' the syke the miller in a brown coat whitened with flour walked abreast of geordie and tickled the gills of the fowl with a straw job sheepshanks the letter cutter carried a pot of pitch and a brush and little tom o' dint hobbled along with a handful of iron files behind these came the landlord of the flying horse with a basket over one arm from which peeped the corks of many bottles and natt the stableman at the ghyll carried a wicker cage in which sat a red bantam cock with spurs that glittered in the light there was one other man who walked with the company and he was the soul of the noisy crew his voice was the loudest his laugh the longest and half of all that was said was addressed to him he was a lusty man with a florid face he wore a suit of tweeds plaided in wide stripes of buff and black it was paul drayton burn my body and what's on now he said as the gang reached the church rush bearing i reckon answered tom o' dint and what's rush bearing you know mister paul said the postman rush bearing the barns rush bearing st peter's day you know oh ay i know rush bearing let me see ain't it once a year what man but you mind the days when you were a bit boy and went a rushing yersel' said the blacksmith coorse coorse oh ay i ain't forgotten them days let me see it's a kind of a harvest home ain't it nowt o' the sort said dick the miller testily your memory's failing fast mister ritson and that's true old fence i'll never be the same man again after that brain fever i had up in london not in the head piece you know the group of men and dogs had drawn up in front of the church just as brother peter crossed the church yard to the porch carrying a red paper in his hand who's that the methodee man it's the methodee for sure said the blacksmith ey it's the parson's peter added the postman and yon paper is a telegraph it's like he's takin' it to somebody hold hard my boys said drayton and leaving his cronies he strode through the lych gate and down the path the dogs yapping around him brother peter had drawn up at the door of the porch the children were still singing if that telegram is for my wife you may hand it over to me said drayton and reached out his hand to take it brother peter drew back it'll be all right old fellow i'll see she gets it ey thoo'll manish that i's warn said peter in a caustic voice come don't you know that what belongs to the wife belongs to the husband don't know as i do i'se never been larn't sec daftness said peter hand it over come be quick get ower me 'at can said peter with a decisive twinkle gi'e him a slab ower the lug shouted the miller from the road you hear what they say come out with it eh you've rowth o' friends you're a teeran crew but i cares laal for any on you drayton turned away with a contemptuous snort damme what a clatter he shouted and leaped on to the raised mound of a grave to look in at an open window as he did so he kicked a glass for flowers that lay upon it and the broken frame tumbled in many pieces i've done for somebody's money he said with a loud guffaw what man but it were thy awn brass as bought it said the blacksmith ey it's thy fadder's grave said job sheepshanks drayton glanced down at the headstone why so it is he said d'ye see i hain't been here since the day i buried him nay that's all stuff and nonsense said job i mind the morning i found ye lying wet and frostit on the top of that grave d'ye say so well i ain't for denying it and now i think of it i was yes i was here that morning nay you warn't nowt o' the sort said the blacksmith that were the varra morning as giles raisley saw you at the pack horse sleeping i mind the fratch job had with laal gubblum about it long ago it's all stuff and nonsense replied job he were here the pack horse well now i remember i was there too the singing had ceased and greta came out into the porch on tiptoe carrying in her arms a tiny mite who was crying peter handed her the telegram and turned up the path drayton had rejoined his companions and was in the act of knocking the neck off a bottle by striking it against the wall when peter walked through the lych gate tee a pint o' yal down the methodee's back shouted dick the miller and in another moment brother peter was covered with the contents of the broken bottle a loud roystering laugh filled the air and echoed from the hills what a breck tittered the postman what a breck shouted the blacksmith what a breck roared the miller get ower me 'at can mimicked natt he's got a lad's heart has mister paul said the landlord of the flying horse ey he's a fair fatch echoed little tom o' dint leaving peter to shake himself dry of the liquor that dripped from him in froth the noisy gang reeled down the road the yelping dogs careering about them and the cocks squawking with the hugs they received from the twitching arms of the men convulsed with laughter at the head of the vale of newlands there is a clearing that was made by the lead miners of two centuries ago it lies at the feet of an ampitheater of hills that rise peak above peak and die off depth beyond depth of the old mines nothing remains but the level cuttings in the sides of the fells and here and there the washing pits cut out of the rock at your feet fragments of stone lie about glistening with veins of lead but no sound of pick or hammer breaks the stillness and no cart or truck trundles over the rough path it is a solitude in which one might forget that the world is full of noise to this spot drayton and his cronies made their way at one of the old washing troughs they drew up and sat in a circle on its rocky sides they had come for a cock fight it was to be the bantam carried by natt and owned by his master against all comers drayton and the blacksmith were the setters on the first bout was between the bantam and lang geordie's ponderous black spanish geordie's bird soon squawked dolorously and made off over the heads of the derisive spectators whereupon geordie captured it by one of its outstretched wings and forthwith screwed its neck then came john proudfoot's silver and black and straightway steel gaffs were affixed to the spurs when the cocks felt their feet they crowed and then pecked the ground from side to side an exciting struggle ensued up and down over and under now beating the breast now trailing the comb now pecking at the gills and the two men at opposite sides of the pit the one in his shirt sleeves rolled up to the elbows the other in his sporting plaid stooped with every lunge and craned their necks at every fall and bobbed their heads with every peck their eyes flashing their teeth set at one moment they drew off their birds called for the files and sharpened up the spurs later on they seized the cocks by the necks shouted for the pitch pot and patched up the bleeding combs the birds were equally matched and fought long at last their strength ebbed away they followed each other feebly stretching their long lagging throats languidly opening their beaks and hanging out their dry white tongues turning tail then twisting about and fighting again until both lay stretched out on the pit bottom as the energy of the cocks subsided the ardor of the men waxed sensibly they yelled excitedly protested reviled swore laughed jeered and crowed at length when the bantam fell and gave no signs of speedy resurrection the anger of drayton could not be supported he leaped across the pit his face red as his cock's comb and shouting damme what for did ye pick up my bird he planted a blow full on the blacksmith's chest a fight of yet fiercer kind followed amid shouts and in the thick of a general scuffle the blacksmith closed with his powerful adversary gripped him about the waist twisted him on his loins and brought him to the ground with a crash then he stood over him with fierce eyes i mak' no doubt you're not hankerin' for another of that sort he puffed john's given him the cross buttock said the miller the master's lost all his wrustling said natt blinking out of his sleepy eyes i mind the day when he could have put john down same as a bit boy said the little postman natt helped drayton to his feet he was quiet enough now but as black in the face as a thunder cloud this comes of a gentleman mixing with them as is beneath him he muttered and he mopped his perspiring forehead with a bandanna handkerchief the miller snorted the mason grunted the little postman laughed in his thin pipe drayton's eyes flashed i'm a gentleman i am if you want to know he said defiantly the blacksmith stood by leisurely rolling down his shirt sleeves ey for fault of wise folk we call you so he said and laughed but when i leet of a man i's rather have him nor a hundred sec gentlemen as you thoo's reet for once john shouted dick o' the syke and there was some general laughter gentleman ax the women folk what they mak' of sec a gentleman continued the blacksmith with contemptuous emphasis him as larn't folks to fill the public and empty the cupboard there was a murmur among the men as they twisted about ax them what they mak' of him 'at spent four days in lunnon and came back another man ax the women folk they're maistly reet i reckon another uneasy movement among the men burn my body and what's the women to me said drayton nay nowt answered the blacksmith your awn wife seems nowdays powerful keen for your company drayton's eyes were red but the fire died out of them in an instant he stepped up to the blacksmith and held out his hand you've licked me he said in another tone but i ain't the man to keep spite i ain't so come along old fence and let's wet it that's weel said put in tommy lowthwaite the landlord it's no'but fair said dick the miller he's a reet sort after all said job the mason he's his awn fadder's son is paul ritson said tom o' dint in two minutes more the soiled company were trampling knee deep through rank beds of rushes on their way to the other side of the dale they stopped a few yards from a pit shaft with its headgear and wheel let's take my brother's ken for it said drayton and they turned into a one story house that stood near it was a single capacious chamber furnished more like a library than an office carpets rugs a cabinet easychairs and a solid table in the middle of the floor the cock fighters filed in and sat down on every available chair on the table and at last on the floor squat and whiff said drayton and tommy you out with the corks quick it must be a bonny money making consarn to keep up the likes of this said the miller settling himself uneasily in an easy chair dick was telling himself what a fool he had been not to ask more than the fifty pounds he received for the damage once done by fire to his mill have you never heard as it ain't all gold as glitters said drayton and he struck a lucifer match on the top of the mahogany table what man dusta mean as the pit's not paying said the blacksmith drayton gave his head a sidelong shake of combined astuteness and reserve i mak' no doubt now as you have to lend master hugh many a gay penny said tom o' dint in an insinuating tone least said soonest mended said drayton sententiously and smiled a mighty knowing smile then the men laughed and the landlord handed the bottles round and all drank out of the necks and puffed dense volumes of smoke from their pipes and spat on the carpet and still the birds sung in the clear air without and still the ghylls rumbled and still the light wind souched through the grass and still the morning sunlight shone over all the door opened and hugh ritson entered followed by the lawyer mr bonnithorne there was a steely glimmer in his eyes as he stood just inside the threshold and looked round come get out of this he said the men shuffled to their feet and were elbowing their way out drayton who sat on the table removed his pipe from between his teeth and called on them to remain hugh ritson stepped up to drayton and touched him on the shoulder i want to speak with you he said what is it demanded drayton i want to speak with you repeated hugh what is it out with it you've got the gift of the gab hain't ye don't mind my friends hugh ritson's face whitened and a cold smile passed over it your time is near he muttered and he turned on his heel as he stepped out of the noisesome chamber a loud hoarse laugh followed him he drew a long breath thank god it will soon be over he said bonnithorne was at his side is it to be to morrow asked the lawyer to morrow said hugh ritson have you told him tell him yourself bonnithorne i can bear with the man no longer i shall be doing something that i may repent have you apprised parson christian hugh ritson bent his head and greta she won't come said hugh the girl could never breathe the same air as that scoundrel for five minutes together and yet he's her half brother said the lawyer softly and then he added with the conventional smile odd isn't it chapter ii when the procession of children had passed the little cottage at the angle of the roads the old man who leaned on his staff at the gate turned about and stepped to the porch did the boy see them did he see the children said the young woman who held the child by the hand i mak' na doot said the old man he stooped to the little one and held out one long withered finger the soft baby hand closed on it instantly did he laugh i thought he laughed said the young woman a bright smile played on her lips maybe so lass ralphie has never seen the children before father didn't he look frightened just a little frightened at first you know i thought he crept behind my gown maybe maybe the little one had dropped the hand of his young mother and still holding the bony finger of his grandfather he toddled beside him into the house very cool and sweet was the kitchen with white washed walls and hard earthen floor a table and a settle stood by the window and a dresser that was an armory of bright pewter dishes trenchers and piggins crossed the opposite wall nay but sista here laal man said the old charcoal burner and he dived into a great pocket at his side have you brought it is it the kitten oh dear let the boy see it a kitten came out of the old man's pocket and was set down on the rug at the hearth the timid creature sat dazed then raised itself on its hind legs and mewed where's ralphie is he watching it father what is he doing the little one had dropped on hands and knees before the kitten and was gazing up into its face the mother leaned over him with a face that would have beamed with sunshine if the sun of sight had not been missing is he looking doesn't he want to coddle it the little chap had pushed his nose close to the nose of the kitten and was prattling to it in various inarticulate noises boo loo lal la mamma isn't he a darling father it's a winsome wee thing said the old man still standing with drooping head over the group on the hearth the mother's face saddened and she turned away then from the opposite side of the kitchen where she was making pretense to take plates from a plate rack there came the sound of suppressed sobs the old man's eyes followed her nay lass let's have a sup of broth he said in a tone that carried another message the young woman put plates and a bowl of broth on the table to think that i can never see my own child and everybody else can see him she said and then there was another bout of tears the charcoal burner supped at his broth in silence a glistening bead rolled slowly down his wizened cheek and the interview on the hearth went on without interruption mew mew mew boo loo lal la mamma there was a foot on the gravel in front how fend ye mattha said a voice from without come thy ways gubblum answered the old man gubblum oglethorpe entered dressed differently than of old he wore a suit of canvas stained deeply with iron ore i's thinking maybe mercy will let me warm up my poddish said gubblum and welcome said mercy and took down from the dresser a saucepan and porridge thivel i'll make it for you while father sups his broth nay lass you're as thrang as an auld peat wife i's warn

amain and his eyes are they changing color going brown maybe i'll not be for saying nay is he is he very like me nay weel nay i's fancying i see summat of the stranger in the laal chap at whiles the young mother turned her head gubblum twisted to where matthew sat that man and all his raggabrash are raking about this morning it caps all it does for sure the old charcoal burner did not answer he paused with the spoon half raised glanced at mercy and then went on with his broth hasta heard of the lang yammer in the papers about yon matter said gubblum nay said matthew i hears nowt of the papers he's like to hang a lang crag when he hears about it i mak' na doubt said matthew showing no curiosity it's my belief 'at the auld woman at hendon is turning tail you mind she was down last back end and he wadn't have nowt to say to her ey i mind her said matthew every dog has his day and i reckon yon dog's day is nigh amaist done and it wad have been a vast shorter on'y mercy hadn't her eyes ey ey said matthew quietly if the lass had no'but been able to say 'yon man is drayton and yon as you've got in prison is ritson and i saw the bad wark done' that would have settled it na doot said matthew his head in the bowl they warn't for hearing me when the parson took me up to lunnon mair nor a twelvemonth agone they sent us baith home with our tails atween our legs 'bring us the young woman' they said 'your evidence will stand aside hers but not alone bring the young woman to 'dentify' they says 'she's gone blind' we says 'we can't help that' they says and that's what they call justice up in lunnon ey ey said matthew but then thoo has to mak' 'lowances for them gentry folk they've never been larn't no better thoo sees gubblum's porridge was bubbling and the thivel worked vigorously matthew had picked up the child from the hearth the little fellow was tugging at his white beard it were bad luck that me and mercy didn't stay a day or so langer in hendon yon time she had her eyes then but the lass was badly and dropping his voice that way thoo knows and i warn't to prophesy what was to happen to poor paul ritson so i brought her straight away home so thoo did gubblum said matthew stroking the child's head it's that hugh as is at the bottom of it all i reckon i'm not afraid to say it if he is my master i allus liked paul ritson the reet one thoo knows not this taistrel that calls hisself paul ritson but i cared so laal for hugh that i could have taken him and wrowk't the fire with him the porridge was ready and mercy set a wooden bowl on the table i's fullen thy bicker my lass said gubblum i's only a laal man but i's got a girt appetite thoo sees then turning to matthew he continued but he's like to pay for it he brought his raggabash here and now

of leggins and clogs for natt that's the way it's manish'd mercy had taken her child from her father's knee and was sitting on the sconce bench with it holding a broken piece of a mirror before its face and listening for its laugh when it saw itself in the glass but he's none cummerland hearken to his tongue said matthew gubblum put down his spoon on his plate now empty that minds me he said laughing that i met him out one day all dressed in his brave claes them as might do for a nigger that plays the banjo 'off for a spogue' i says 'what's a spogue' he says looking thunder 'nay' i says 'you're no'but a dalesman ax folks up hendon way' i says i was peddling then but master hugh 'counters me another day and he says 'gubblum' he says 'i's wanting a smart laal man same as you to weigh the ore on the bank top pund a week' he says ey i mak' no doot they thowt to buy thee ower said matthew they've made a gay canny blunder if they think they've put a swine ring on gubblum's snout buy or beat that's the word they've bought most of the folk and made them as lazy as libbed bitches but they warn't able to buy the ritson's bitch itself what dusta mean gubblum what man thoo's heard how the taistrel killed poor auld fan no weel thoo knows she was paul ritson's dog fan was and when she saw this man coming up the lonnin she frisk't and wag't her tail but when she got close to him she found her mistake and went slenken off he made shift to coax her but fan wad none be coaxed and folks were takin' stock so what dusta think the taistrel does but ups with a stone and brains her that's like him for sure said matthew but don't the folk see that his wife as it might be miss greta as was won't have nowt to say to him nay they say that's no'but a rue bargain and she found out her mind after she wedded that's all the clot heads think about it hark said mercy half rising from the sconce it's mrs ritson's foot the men listened nay lass there's no foot said gubblum yes she's on the road said mercy her face showed that pathetic tension of the other senses which is peculiar to the blind a moment later greta stepped into the cottage the telegram which brother peter gave her at the church was still in her hand good morning matthew good morning gubblum i have news for you mercy the doctors are coming to day mercy's face fell perceptibly the old man's head drooped lower there don't be afraid said greta touching her hand caressingly it will soon be over the doctors didn't hurt you before did they no but this time it will be the operation said mercy there was a tremor in her voice greta had lifted the child from the sconce the little fellow cooed close to her ear and babbled his inarticulate nothings only think when it's all over you will be able to see your darling ralphie for the first time mercy's sightless face brightened oh yes she said and watch him play and see him spin his tops and chase the butterflies oh that will be very good dusta say to day mistress ritson asked matthew the big drops standing in his eyes yes matthew i will stay to see it over and mind baby and help a little mercy took the little one from greta's arms and cried over it and laughed over it and then cried and laughed again mamma and ralphie shall play together in the garden darling and ralphie shall see the horses and the flowers and the birdies and mamma yes mamma shall see ralphie oh mrs ritson how selfish i am how can i ever repay you the tears were trickling down greta's cheeks it is i who am selfish mercy she said and kissed the sightless orbs your dear eyes shall give me back my poor husband chapter iii two hours later the doctors arrived they had called at the vicarage in driving up the valley and parson christian was with them they looked at mercy's eyes and were satisfied that the time was ripe for the operation at the sound of their voices mercy trembled and turned livid by a maternal instinct she picked up the child who was toddling about the floor and clasped it to her bosom the little one opened wide his blue eyes at sight of the strangers and the prattling tongue became quiet take her to her room and let her lie on the bed said one of the doctors to greta a sudden terror seized the young mother no no no she said in an indescribable accent and the child cried a little from the pressure to her breast come mercy dear be brave for your darling's sake said greta listen to me said the doctor quietly but firmly you are now quite blind and you have been in total darkness for a year and a half we may be able to restore your sight by giving you a few minutes' pain will you not bear it mercy sobbed and kissed the child passionately just think it is quite certain that without an operation you will never regain your sight continued the doctor you have nothing to lose and everything to gain are you satisfied come go away to your room quietly oh oh oh sobbed mercy just imagine only a few minutes' pain and even of that you will scarcely be conscious before you know what is doing it will be done mercy clung closer to her child and kissed it again and yet more fervently the doctors turned to each other strange vanity muttered the one who had not spoken before her eyes are useless and yet she is afraid she may lose them mercy's quick ears caught the whispered words it is not that she said passionately no gentlemen said greta you have mistaken her thought tell her she runs no danger of her life the doctors smiled and laughed a little oh that's it eh well we can tell her that with certainty then there was another interchange of half amused glances ah we that be men sirs don't know the depth and tenderness of a mother's heart said parson christian and mercy turned toward him a face that was full of gratitude greta took the child out of her arms and hushed it to sleep in another room then she brought it back and put it in its cradle that stood in the ingle come mercy she said for the sake of your boy and mercy permitted herself to be led from the kitchen so there will be no danger she said i shall not leave my boy who said that the doctor oh good gracious it's nothing only think i shall live to see him grow to be a great lad her whole face was now radiant it will be nothing oh no it will be nothing how silly it was to think that he would live on and grow up and be a man and i lie cold in the church yard and me his mother that was very childish wasn't it but then i have been so childish since ralphie came there lie and be quiet and it will soon be over said greta let me kiss him first do let me kiss him only once you know it's a great risk after all and if he grew up and i wasn't here if if there dear mercy you must not cry again it inflames your eyes and that can't be good for the doctors no no i won't cry you are very good everybody is very good only let me kiss my little ralphie just for the last greta led her back to the side of the cot and she spread herself over it with outstretched arms as the mother bird poises with outstretched wings over her brood then she rose and her face was peaceful and resigned the laird fisher sat down before the kitchen fire with one arm on the cradle head parson christian stood beside him the old charcoal burner wept in silence and the good parson's voice was too thick for the words of comfort that rose to his lips the doctors followed into the bedroom mercy was lying tranquilly on her bed her countenance was without expression she was busy with her own thoughts greta stood by the bedside anxiety was written in every line of her beautiful brave face we must give her the gas said one of the doctors addressing the other mercy's features twitched who said that she asked nervously my child you must be quiet said the doctor in a tone of authority yes i will be quiet very quiet only don't make me unconscious she said never mind me i will not cry no if you hurt me i will not cry out i will not stir i will do everything you ask and you shall say how quiet i have been only don't let me be insensible the doctors consulted aside and in whispers who spoke about the gas it wasn't you mrs ritson was it you must do as the doctors wish dear said greta in a caressing voice oh i will be very good i will do every little thing yes and i will be so brave i am a little childish sometimes but i can be brave can't i the doctors returned to the bedside very well we will not use the gas said one you are a brave little woman after all there be still very still one of the doctors was tearing linen into strips for bandages while the other fixed mercy's head to suit the light there was a faint sound from the kitchen wait said mercy that is father he's crying tell him not to cry say it's nothing she laughed a weak little laugh there he will hear that go and say it was i who laughed greta left the room on tiptoe old matthew was still sitting over a dying fire gently rocking the sleeping child parson christian's eyes were raised in prayer when greta returned to the bedroom mercy called her and said very softly let me hold your hand greta may i say greta there and her fingers closed on greta's with a convulsive grasp the operation began mercy held her breath she had the stubborn north country blood in her once only a sigh escaped there was a dead silence in two or three minutes the doctor said just another minute and all will be over at the next instant greta felt her hand held with a grasp of iron doctor doctor i can see you cried mercy and her words came in gusts be quiet said the doctor in a stern voice in half a minute more the linen bandages were being wrapped tightly over mercy's eyes doctor dear doctor let me see my boy cried mercy be quiet i say said the doctor again dear doctor my dear doctor only one peep one little peep i saw your face let me see my ralphie's not yet it is not safe but only for a moment don't put the bandage on for one moment just think doctor i have never seen my boy i've seen other people's children but never once my own own darling oh dear doctor you are exciting yourself listen to me if you don't behave yourself now you may never see your child yes yes i will behave myself i will be very good only don't shut me up in darkness again until i see my boy greta bring him to me listen i hear his breathing go for my darling the kind doctor won't be angry with you tell him that if i see my child it will cure me i know it will greta's eyes were swimming in tears rest quiet mercy everything may be lost if you disturb yourself now my dear the doctors were wrapping bandage over bandage and fixing them firmly at the back of their patient's head now listen again said one of them this bandage must be kept over your eyes for a week a week a whole week oh doctor you might as well say forever i say a week and if you should ever remove it not for an instant not raise it a little if you ever remove it for an instant or raise it ever so little you will assuredly lose your sight forever remember that oh doctor it is terrible why did you not tell me so before oh this is worse than blindness think of the temptation and i have never seen my boy the doctor had fixed the bandage and his voice was less stern but no less resolute you must obey me he said i will come again this day week and then you shall see your child and your father and this young lady and everybody but mind if you don't obey me you will never see anything you will have one glance of your little boy and then be blind forever or perhaps yes perhaps die mercy lay quiet for a moment then she said in a low voice dear doctor you must forgive me i am very willful and i promised to be so good i will not touch the bandage no for the sake of my little boy i will never never touch it you shall come yourself and take it off and then i shall see him the doctors went away greta remained all night in the cottage you are happy now mercy said greta oh yes said mercy just think only a week and he must be so beautiful by this time when greta took the child to her at sunset there was an ineffable joy in her pale face and next morning when greta awoke mercy was singing softly to herself in the sunrise chapter iv there was a gathering of miners near the pit head that morning it was pay day the rule was that the miners on the morning shift should pass through the pay office before going down the shaft at eight o'clock and that those on the night shift should pass through on their way home a few minutes afterward when the morning men passed through the office they had found the pay door shut and a notice posted over it saying all wages due at eight o'clock to day will be paid at the same hour to morrow presently the men on the night shift came up in the cages and after a brief explanation both gangs with the banksmen and all top ground hands except the engine man trooped away to a place suitable for a conference there was a worked out open cutting a hundred yards away it was a vast cleft dug into the side of the mountain square on its base vertical in its three gray walls and sweeping up to a dizzy height over which the brant sides of the green fell rose sheer into the sky it was to this natural theatre that the two hundred miners made their way in groups of threes and fours their lamps and cans in their hands their red stained clothes glistening in the morning sun it was decided to send a deputation to the master asking that the order might be revoked and payment made as usual the body of the men remained in the clearing conversing in knots while two miners buirdly fellows rather gruffer of tongue than the rest went to the office to act as spokesmen the deputation were approaching the pit head when the engine man shouted that he had just heard the master's knock from below and in another moment hugh ritson in flannels and fustian stepped out of the cage he heard the request and at once offered to go to the men and give his answer the miners made way for him respectfully and then closed about him when he spoke men he said with a touch of his old resolution let me tell you frankly as between man and man that i can not pay you this morning because i haven't got the money i tried to get it and failed this afternoon i shall receive much more than is due to you and to morrow you shall be promptly paid the miners twisted about and compared notes in subdued voices that's no'but fair said one he cannut say na fairer said another but there were some who were not so easily appeased and one of these crushed his way through the crowd and said mr ritson we're not same as the bettermer folk as can get credit for owt 'at they want we ax six days' pay because we have to do six days' payin' wi' it and if we're back a day in our pay we're a day back in our payin' and that means clemmin' a laal bit and the wife and barns forby there were murmurs of approval from the crowd and then another malcontent added times has changed to a gay tune sin' we could put by for a rainy day it's hand to mouth now on'y the mouth's allus ready and the hand's not it's na much as we ha' gotten to put away these times said the first speaker not same as the days when a pitman's wife 'at i ken on flung a five pound note in his face and axed him what he thowt she were to mak' o' that nay nay responded the others in a chorus men i'm not charging you with past extravagance said hugh ritson and it's not my fault if the pit hasn't done as well for all of us as i had hoped he was moving away when the crowd closed about him again mates shouted one of the miners there's another word as some on us wad like to say to the master and that's about the timber what is it asked hugh ritson facing about there be some on us 'at think the pit's none ower safe down the bottom working where the seam of sand runs cross ways we're auld miners maistly and we thowt maybe ye wadna tak' it wrang if we telt ye 'at it wants a vast mair forks and upreets thank you my lads i'll see what i can do said hugh ritson and then added in a lower tone but i've put a forest of timber underground already and where this burying of money is to end god alone knows he turned away this time and moved off halting more noticeably than usual on his infirm foot he returned to his office near the pit bank and found mr bonnithorne awaiting him the day is young but i'm no sluggard you know said the lawyer i thought we might want a word or two before the meeting at the ghyll hugh ritson did not notice the explanation he looked anxious and disturbed while stripping off his pit flannels and putting on his ordinary clothes he told mr bonnithorne what had just occurred and then added if anything had been necessary to prove that this morning's bad business is inevitable i should have found it in this encounter with the men it comes as a fillip to your already blunted purpose said the lawyer with a curious smile odd isn't it blunted said hugh ritson and there was a perceptible elevation of the eyebrows presently he drew a long breath and said with an air of relief ah well if she suffers who has suffered enough already he at least will be out of the way forever bonnithorne shifted slightly on his seat you think so he asked something cynical in the tone caught hugh ritson's ear it was a bad change wasn't it added the lawyer this one is likely to be a deal more troublesome hugh ritson went on with his dressing in silence you see by the interchange your positions were reversed continued the lawyer what do you mean well not to put too fine a point on it the other was in your hands while you are in the hands of this one hugh ritson's foot fell heavily at that instant but he merely said with suppressed quietness there was this one's crime was precisely said mr bonnithorne hugh ritson looked up with a look of inquiry when you gave the crime to the other this one became a free man the lawyer explained there was a silence what does it all come to said hugh ritson sullenly that your hold of paul drayton is gone forever how so because you can never incriminate him without first incriminating yourself said the lawyer who talks of incrimination said hugh ritson testily to day this man is to take upon himself the name of paul lowther his true name though he doesn't know it blockhead as he is therefore i ask again what does it all come to mr bonnithorne shifted uneasily nothing he said meekly but the curious smile still played about his downcast face then there was silence again do you know that mercy fisher is likely to regain her sight said hugh you don't say so dear me dear me said the lawyer sincere at last in all the annals of jurisprudence there is no such extraordinary case of identity being conclusively provable by one witness only and of that witness becoming blind odd isn't it hugh ritson smiled coldly odd say providential he answered i believe that's what you church folk call it when the almighty averts a disaster that is made imminent by your own short sightedness a disaster indeed if her sight ceases to be so providentially short said the lawyer get the man out of the way and the woman is all right said hugh he picked a letter out of a drawer and handed it to mr bonnithorne you will remember that the other was to have shipped to australia mr bonnithorne bowed his head this letter is from the man for whom he intended to go out an old friend of my father answer it bonnithorne in what terms asked the lawyer say that a long illness prevented but that paul ritson is now prepared to fulfill his engagement and what then what then hugh ritson echoed why what do you think send him with a motion of the thumb over the shoulder of course said hugh again the cynical tone caught hugh ritson's ear and he glanced up quickly but made no remark he was now dressed i am ready and on reaching the door and taking a last look round the room he added i'll have the best of this furniture removed to the ghyll to morrow the house has been unbearable of late and i've been forced to spend most of my time down here then you don't intend to give him much grace asked bonnithorne not an hour the lawyer bent his forehead very low at that moment chapter v the sun was high over the head of hindscarth but a fresh breeze was blowing from the north and the walk to the ghyll was bracing mr bonnithorne talked little on the way but hugh ritson's spirits rose sensibly and he chatted cheerfully on indifferent subjects it was still some minutes short of nine o'clock when they reached the house the servants were bustling about in clean aprons and caps have the gentlemen arrived asked hugh not yet sir answered one of the servants it was old dinah wilson the two men stepped up to hugh ritson's room there the table was spread for breakfast the lawyer glanced at the chairs and said then you have invited other friends hugh nodded his head and sat down at the organ three or four neighbors of substance he said opening the case in a matter like this it is well to have witnesses bonnithorne replied with phlegm but what about the feelings of the man who is so soon to be turned out of the house hugh ritson's fingers were on the keys he paused and faced about i had no conception that you had such a delicate sense of humor bonnithorne he said with only the shadow of a smile feelings his feelings there was a swift glide up the notes and other sounds were lost the window was half open the lawyer walked to it and looked out at that moment the two men were back to back hugh ritson's head was bent over the keyboard mr bonnithorne's eyes were on the tranquil landscape lying in the sun outside the faces of both wore curious smiles hugh ritson leaped from his seat ah i feel like another man already he said and took a step or two up and down the room his infirm foot betraying no infirmity there was the noise of fresh arrivals in the hall a minute later a servant entered followed by three gentlemen who shook hands effusively with hugh ritson delighted to be of service i'm sure said one glad the unhappy connection is to be concluded it was a scandal said the other you could not go on living on such terms life wasn't worth it you know said the first the third gentleman was more restrained but hugh paid him marked deference they had a short muttered conference apart get the other mortgages wiped off the deeds and i have no objection to lend you the money on the security of the house and land said the gentleman at that remark hugh ritson bowed his head and appeared satisfied he rang for breakfast ask mr paul if he is ready he said when dinah brought the tray master paul is abed sir said dinah and then she added for herself it caps all sec feckless wark it dudn't use to be so for sure i'll not say but a man may be that changed in a twelvemonth ah i'll go to him myself said hugh and begging to be excused he left the room mr bonnithorne followed him to the other side of the door have you counted the cost he asked it will be a public scandal hugh smiled and answered with composure whose will be the loss god knows said the lawyer with sudden energy hugh glanced up quickly there was the murmur of voices from within the room they had just left is it that you are too jealous of your good name to allow it to be bruited abroad in a scandal as you say mr bonnithorne's face wore a curious expression at that moment it's not my good name that is in question he said quietly and turned back to the door whose then his but the lawyer already held the door ajar and was passing into the room hugh ritson made his way to the bedroom occupied by paul drayton he opened the door without knocking it was dark within thin streaks of dusty sunlight shot from between a pair of heavy curtains the air was noisome with dead tobacco smoke and the fumes of stale beer hugh's gorge rose but he conquered his disgust who's there said a husky voice from behind the dark hangings of a four post bed that was all but hidden in the gloom the friends are here said hugh ritson cheerily how long will you be there was a suppressed chuckle all right we will begin breakfast said hugh he was turning to go is that lawyer man back from scotland asked drayton bonnithorne he's here he didn't say that he'd been away said hugh all right hugh ritson returned to the bed head have you heard he said in a subdued voice that the doctors have operated on the girl mercy and that she is likely to regain her sight eh what drayton had started up in bed then rolling down his sleeves and buttoning them leisurely he added but that ain't nothing to me hugh ritson left the room he was in spirits indeed for he had borne even this encounter with equanimity as he passed through the house brother peter entered at the porch with a letter in his hand is parson christian coming said hugh don't know 'at i've heard said peter he's boddered me to fetch ye a scribe of a line here 'tis hugh ritson opened the envelope the note ran i cannot reconcile it to my conscience to break bread with one who has broken the peace of my household nor is it agreeable to my duty as a minister of christ to give the countenance of my presence to proceedings which must be a sham inasmuch as the person concerned is an imposter with the which name i yet hope to brand him when the proper time and circumstances arrive hugh smiled as he read the letter then he thrust a shilling into peter's unyielding hand and shot away the parson will not come said hugh drawing bonnithorne aside but that can not matter if he is greta's guardian you are her father's executor then raising his voice gentlemen he said my brother wishes us to begin breakfast he will join us presently the company was soon seated the talk was brisk and cheerful glorious prospect said a gentleman sitting opposite the open window often wonder you don't throw out a bay mr ritson i've thought of it said hugh but it's not worth while to spend such money until one is master of one's own house ah true true said several voices in chorus drayton entered his eyes red his face sallow morning gents he said in his thick guttural two of the gentlemen rose and bowed with frigid politeness good morning mr ritson said the third the servant had followed drayton into the room with a beefsteak underdone post not come he asked shifting his plates it can't be long now said bonnithorne consulting his watch sooner the better drayton muttered he took some papers from a breast pocket and counted them then fixed them in his waistcoat where his watch would have been if he had worn one when breakfast was done hugh ritson took certain documents from a cabinet be seated gentlemen he said all sat except drayton who lighted a pipe and rang to ask if the postman had come he had not then go and sharpen up his heels my duty would be less pleasant said hugh ritson if some of the facts were not already known then we'll take 'em as read so we will put in drayton perambulating behind a cloud of smoke paul i will ask you to be seated said hugh in an altered tone drayton sat down with a snort i have to tell you continued hugh ritson that my brother known to you as paul ritson is now satisfied that he was not the heir of my father who died intestate there were sundry nods of the grave noddles assembled about the table fearful shock to any man said one no wonder he has lost heart and grown reckless said another on becoming aware of this fact he was anxious to relinquish the estate to the true heir there were further nods and some muttered comments on the requirements of honor i show you here a copy of the register of my father's marriage and a copy of the register of my own birth occurring less than a year afterward from these in the absence of extraordinary testimony it must be the presumption that i am myself my father's rightful heir the papers were handed about and returned with evident satisfaction so far all is plain continued hugh ritson but my brother has learned that he is not even my father's son three astonished faces were lifted from the table bonnithorne sat with head bent drayton leaned an elbow on one knee and smoked sullenly it turns out that he is the son of my mother by another man said hugh ritson the guests twisted about ah that explains all they whispered you will be surprised to learn that my mother's husband by a former invalid marriage was no other than robert lowther and that he who sits with us now as paul ritson is really paul lowther at this hugh placed two further documents on the table drayton cleared his throat noisily dear me dear me yet it's plain enough said one of the visitors then what about mrs ritson miss greta i mean asked another she is paul lowther's half sister and therefore his marriage with her must be annulled the three gentlemen turned in their seats and looked amazed drayton still smoked in silence bonnithorne did not raise his head he will relinquish to me my father's estates but he is not left penniless continued hugh ritson by his own father's will he inherits five thousand pounds drayton snorted contemptuously then spat on the floor friends said hugh ritson again there is only one further point and i am loath to touch on it my brother i speak of paul lowther on taking possession of the estates exercised what he believed to be his legal right to mortgage them i am sorry to say he mortgaged them deeply there was an interchange of astute glances if i were a rich man i should be content to be the loser but i am a poor man and am compelled to ask that those mortgages stand forfeit is it the law it is and as you will say only a fair one hugh answered who are the mortgagees that is where the pity arises the chief of them is no other than the daughter of robert lowther greta sundry further twists and turns pity for her well she should have seen to his title who was her lawyer her father's executor our friend mr bonnithorne how much does she lose i'm afraid a great deal perhaps half her fortune said hugh no matter it's but fair mr ritson is not to inherit an estate impoverished by the excesses of the wrong man drayton's head was still bent but he scraped his feet restlessly i have only another word to say said hugh in affairs of this solemn nature it is best to have witnesses or perhaps i should have preferred to confer with paul and mr bonnithorne in private he dropped his voice and added you see there is my poor mother and though in a sense she is no longer of this world her good name must ever be sacred with me the astute glances again and two pairs of upraised hands the lawyer had twisted toward the window but our friend bonnithorne will tell you that the law in effect compelled me to evict my brother you may not know that there is a condition of english law in which a bastard becomes a permanent heir that is when he is called in the language of the law the bastard eigne there was a tremor in his voice as he added softly believe me i had no choice drayton stamped his heavy foot threw down his pipe and jumped to his feet it's a lie the lot of it he blurted then he fumbled at his watch pocket and pulled out a paper that's my register straight and plain he stammered it aloud ritson paul father allan ritson mother grace ritson date of birth april place crieff scotland hugh ritson a little pale smiled the others turned to him in their amazement in an instant he had regained an appearance of indifference where does it come from he asked the registrar's at edinburgh d'ye say it ain't right no but i say what is it worth gentlemen said hugh turning to the visitors compare it with the register of my father's marriage observe the one date is april the other is june even if genuine does it prove legitimacy drayton laid his hand on the lawyer's arm here you speak up will ye he said mr bonnithorne rose and then hugh ritson's pale face became ghastly this birth occurred in scotland he said now if the father happened to hold a scotch domicile and the mother lived with him as his wife the child would be legitimate without a marriage without a ceremony natt pushed into the room his cap in one hand a letter in the other he had knocked twice and none had heard the post sir one letter for master paul good lad drayton clutched it with a cry of delight but my father had no scotch domicile said hugh with apparent composure oh but he had said drayton tearing open his envelope he was a scotsman born said bonnithorne taking another document from drayton's hand see this is his register odd isn't it hugh ritson's eyes flashed he looked steadily into the face of the lawyer then he took the paper the next moment he crushed it in his palm and flung it out of the window i shall want proof both of your facts and your law he said eh and welcome said drayton shouting in his agitation listen to this and he proceeded to read wait from whom asked hugh ritson some pettifogger the solicitor general said bonnithorne is that good enough asked drayton tauntingly go on said hugh rapping the table with his finger tips drayton handed the letter to the lawyer do you read it he said i ain't flowery i'm a gentleman and he stopped suddenly and tramped the floor while bonnithorne read if there is no reason to suppose the father lost his scotch domicile the son is legitimate if the husband recognized his wife in registering his son's birth the law of scotland would presume that there was a marriage but whether of ceremony or consent would be quite indifferent there was a pause drayton took the letter from the lawyer's hands folded it carefully and put it in his fob pocket then he peered into hugh ritson's face with a leer of triumph bonnithorne had slunk aside the guests were silent d'ye hear said drayton the son is legitimate he gloated over the words and tapped his pocket as he repeated them what d'ye say to it eh at first hugh ritson struggled visibly for composure and in an instant his face was like marble drayton came close to him you were going to give me the go by eh turn me out o' doors eh damme it's my turn now so it is so saying drayton stepped to the door and flung it open this house is mine he said go and be damned to you at this unexpected blow hugh ritson beat the ground with his foot he looked round at the strangers and felt like a wretch who was gagged and might say nothing then he halted to where drayton stood with outstretched arm let me have a word with you in private he said in a voice that was scarcely audible drayton lifted his hand and his fist was clinched not a syllable he said his accent was brutal and frenzied hugh ritson's nostrils quivered and his eyes flashed drayton quailed an instant and burst into a laugh there was a great silence bonnithorne was still before the window his face down his hands clasped behind him his foot pawing the ground hugh ritson walked to his side he contemplated him a moment and then touched him on the shoulder when he spoke his face was dilated with passion and his voice was low and deep there is a book he said that a churchman may know which tells of an unjust steward the master thought to dismiss him from his stewardship then the steward said within himself 'what shall i do' there was a pause what did he do continued hugh ritson and every word fell on the silence like the stroke of a bell he called his master's debtors together and said to the first 'how much do you owe' 'one hundred measures' then he said 'write a bill for fifty' there was another pause what did that steward mean he meant that when the master should dismiss him from his stewardship the debtor should take him into his house hugh ritson's manner was the white heat of calm he turned half round to where drayton stood and raised his voice that debtor was henceforth bound hand and foot let him but parley with the steward and the steward cried 'thief' 'forger' 'perjurer' bonnithorne shuffled uneasily he opened his mouth as if to speak but the words would not come at last he gulped down something that had seemed to choke him smiled between his teeth a weak bankrupt smile and said how are we to read your parable are you the debtor bound hand and foot and is your brother the astute steward hugh ritson's foot fell heavily is it so he said catching at the word then be it so and his voice rose to a shrill cry that steward shall come to the ground and his master with him at that he stepped back to where drayton stood with eyes as full of bewilderment as frenzy paul lowther he said call me paul ritson interrupted drayton paul lowther ritson drayton shouted and then dropping his voice he said rapidly you gave it me and by god i'll keep it hugh ritson leaned across the table and tapped a paper that lay on it that is your name he said and i'll prove it drayton burst into another laugh you daren't try he chuckled hugh turned upon him with eyes of fire so you measure my spirit by your own man man he said do you know what you are doing there was another brutal laugh from drayton but it died suddenly on his lips then hugh ritson stepped to the door he took a last look round it was as if he knew that he had reached the beginning of the end as if he realized that he was never again to stand in the familiar room the future that seemed so near an hour ago was gone from him forever the cup that he had lifted to his lips lay in fragments at his feet he saw it all in that swift instant on his face there were the lines of agony but over them there played the smile of resolve he put one hand to his forehead and then said in a voice so low as to be no more than a whisper wait and see when the guests who stood huddled together like sheep in a storm had recovered their stunned senses hugh ritson was gone from the room drayton had sunk into a chair near where bonnithorne stood and was whining like a whipped hound go after him what will he do you know i was always against it but presently he stood up and laughed and bantered and crowed and observed that it was a pity if a gentleman could not be master in his own house and that what couldn't be cured must be endured precisely interposed one of the guests and you have my entire sympathy mr ritson a more cruel deception was never more manfully exposed i fully agree with you neighbor said another and such moral tyranny is fearful to contemplate paul lowther indeed now that is a joke well it is rather ain't it said drayton and then he laughed and they all laughed and shook hands and were excellent good friends chapter vi greta stayed with mercy until noon that day begging entreating and finally commanding her to lie quiet in bed while she herself dressed and fed the child and cooked and cleaned in spite of the laird fisher's protestations when all was done and the old charcoal burner had gone out on the hills greta picked up the little fellow in her arms and went to mercy's room mercy was alert to every sound and in an instant was sitting up in bed her face beamed her parted lips smiled her delicate fingers plucked nervously at the counterpane how brightsome it is to day greta she said i'm sure the sun must be shining the window was open and a soft breeze floated through the sun's rays into the room mercy inclined her head aside and added ah you young rogue you you are there are you give him to me the rascal the rogue was set down in his mother's arms and she proceeded to punish his rascality with a shower of kisses how bonny his cheeks must be they will be just like two ripe apples and forthwith there fell another shower of kisses then she babbled over the little one and lisped and stammered and nodded her head in his face and blew little puffs of breath into his hair and tickled him until he laughed and crowed and rolled and threw up his legs and then she kissed his limbs and extremities in a way that mothers have and finally imprisoned one of his feet by putting it ankle deep into her mouth would you ever think a foot could be so tiny greta she said and the little one plunged about and clambered laboriously up its mother's breast and more than once plucked at the white bandage about her head no no ralphie must not touch said mercy with sudden gravity only think ralphie pet one week only one ay less only six days now and then oh then a long hug and the little fellow's boisterous protest against the convulsive pressure abridged the mother's prophecy all at once mercy's manner changed she turned toward greta and said i will not touch the bandage no never but if ralphie tugged at it and it fell would that be breaking my promise greta saw what was in her heart i'm afraid it would dear she said but there was a tremor in her voice mercy sighed audibly just think it would be only ralphie the kind doctors could not be angry with my little child i would say 'it was the boy' and they would smile and say 'ah that is different' give me the little one said greta with emotion mercy drew the child closer and there was a pause i was very wrong greta she said in a low tone oh you would not think what a fearful thing came into my mind a minute ago take my ralphie just imagine my own innocent baby tempted me as greta reached across the bed to lift the child out of his mother's lap the little fellow was struggling to communicate by help of a limited vocabulary some wondrous intelligence of recent events that somewhat overshadowed his little existence puss dat many times repeated was further explained by one chubby forefinger with its diminutive finger nail pointed to the fat back of the other hand he means that the little cat has scratched him said greta but bless the mite he is pointing to the wrong hand puss dat continued the child and peered up into his mother's sightless face mercy was all tears in an instant she had borne yesterday's operation without a groan but now the scratch on her child's hand went to her heart like a stab lie quiet mercy said greta it will be gone to morrow go on echoed the little chap and pointed out at the window the darling how he picks up every word said greta he means the horse explained mercy go on man go on prattled the little one with a child's indifference to all conversation except his own bless the love he must remember the doctor and his horse said greta mercy was putting her lips to the scratch on the little hand oh greta i am very childish but a mother's heart melts like butter batter echoed the child and wriggled out of greta's arms to the ground where he forthwith clambered on to the stool and possessed himself of a slice of bread which lay on the table at the bedside then the fair curly head disappeared like a glint of sunlight through the door to the kitchen what shall i care if other mothers see my child i shall see him too said mercy and she sighed yes she added softly his hands and his eyes and his feet and his soft hair try to sleep an hour or two dear said greta and then perhaps you may get up this afternoon only perhaps you know but we'll see yes greta yes how kind you are you will be far kinder to me some day said greta very tenderly no ah yes i remember how very selfish i am i had quite forgotten but then it is so hard not to be selfish when you are a mother only fancy i never think of myself as mercy now no never i'm just ralphie's mamma when ralphie came mercy must have died in some way that's very silly isn't it only it does seem true man go on batter was heard from the kitchen mingled with the patter of tiny feet listen to him how tricksome he is and you should hear him cry 'oh' you would say 'that child has had an eye knocked out' and then in a minute behold he's laughing once more there i'm selfish again but i will make up for it some day if god is good yes mercy he is good said greta her arms rested on the door jamb and her head dropped on to it her eyes swam did it seem at that moment as if god had been very good to these two women greta said mercy and her voice fell to a whisper do you think ralphie is like anybody yes dear he is like you there was a pause then mercy's hand strayed from under the bedclothes and plucked at greta's gown do you think she asked in a voice all but inaudible that father knows who it is i can not say we have never told him nor i he never asked never once only you know he gave up his work at the mine and went back to the charcoal pit when ralphie came but he never said a word greta did not answer there was another pause then mercy said in a stronger voice will it be soon the trial as soon as your eyes are better said greta earnestly everything depends on your recovery at that moment the bedroom door was pushed open with a little lordly bang and the great wee man entered with his piece of bread stuck rather insecurely on one prong of a fork toas he explained complacently toas and walked up to the empty grate and stretched his arm over the fender at the cold bars why there's no fire for toast you darling goose said greta catching him in her arms much to his masculine vexation mercy had risen on an elbow and her face was full of the yearning of the blind then she lay back never mind she said to herself in a faltering voice let me lie quiet and think of all his pretty ways chapter vii greta returned to the vicarage toward noon and overtook parson christian and peter in the lonnin the one carrying a scythe over his shoulder the other a bundle of rushes under his one arm the parson was walking in silence under the noontide sun his straw hat tipped back from his forehead and his eyes on the ground he was busy with his own reflections it was not until greta had tripped up to his side and slipped his scythe stone from its strap in the pole that the parson was awakened from his reverie great news greta great news my lass he said in answer to her liberal tender in exchange for his thoughts how well it's said that he that diggeth a pit for another should look that he fall not into it himself what news mr christian said greta and her color heightened well we've been mowing the grass in the church yard peter and i and the scythe is old like ourselves and it wanted tempering so away we went to the smithy to have it ground and who should come up but robbie atkinson leading hassocks from longridge and robbie would fain have us go with him and be cheerful at the flying horse well we'd each had a pot of ale and milk when in came natt the stableman at ritson's all lather like one of his horses after his master has been astride her and natt was full of a great quarrel at the ghyll wherein young mr hugh had tried to turn yonder man out of the house in the way i told you of before but the man denied that he was what hugh called him and clung to it that he was paul ritson and brought documents to show that paul was his father's rightful heir after all well well asked greta breathlessly peter had shambled on to the house well natt is no very trustworthy chronicler i fear but one thing is plain and that is that mr hugh who thought to turn yon man out of the house has been turned out of it himself greta stood in the road trembling from head to foot my poor husband she said in a whisper then came a torrent of questions when did this happen what think you will come of it where will hugh go what will he do ah mr christian you always said the cruel instrument would turn in his hand there was a step behind them in their anxiety they had not noticed it until it was close at their heels they turned and were face to face with mr bonnithorne the lawyer bowed but before they had exchanged the courtesies of welcome a horse's tramp came from the road and in a moment drayton rode up the lonnin his face was flushed and his manner noisy as he leaped from the saddle into their midst greta lifted one hand to her breast and with the other hand she clasped that of the parson the old man's face grew rigid in an instant and all the mellowness natural to it died away drayton made up to greta and the parson with an air of braggadocio i've come to tell you once for all that my wife must live under my roof no one answered drayton took a step near and slapped his boot with his riding whip the law backs me up in it and i mean to have it out still there was no answer and drayton's braggadocio gathered assurance from the silence not as i want her none of your shrinking away madame a hoarse laugh burn my body if i wouldn't as soon have my mother for a wife what then said the parson in a low tone appearances i ain't to be a laughing stock of the neighborhood any longer my wife's my wife a husband's a husband and wants obedience and what if you do not get it asked the parson his old face whitening what imprisonment that's what drayton twisted about and touched the lawyer with the handle of his whip here you tell 'em what's what thus appealed to mr bonnithorne explained that a husband was entitled to the restitution of connubial rights and in default to the attachment of his spouse the law said mr bonnithorne can compel a wife to live with her husband or punish her with imprisonment for not doing so d'ye hear said drayton slapping furiously at the sole of his boot punish her with imprisonment there was a pause and then the parson said quietly but firmly i gather that it means that you want to share this lady's property well what of it hain't i a right to share it eh you have thus far enjoyed the benefit of her mortgages on the pretense that you are her husband but now you are going too far we'll see here you prodding the lawyer take proceedings at once if she won't come imprison her d'ye hear imprison her he swung about and caught the reins from the horse's mane laughing a hollow laugh greta disengaged her hand from the hand of the parson and stepped up to drayton until she stood before him face to face her eyes flashing her lips quivering her cheeks pale her whole figure erect and firm and what of that she said do you think to frighten me with the cruelties of the law me me she echoed with scorn in every syllable have i suffered so little from it already that you dare to say 'imprison her' as if that would drive me to your house drayton tried to laugh but the feeble effort died on his hot lips he spat on the ground and then tried to lift his eyes back to the eyes of greta but they fell to the whip that he held in his hand imprison me paul drayton i shall not be the first you've imprisoned imprison me and i shall be rid of you and your imposture she said raising her voice drayton leaped to the saddle i'll do it he muttered and now pale crushed his braggadocio gone he tugged his horse's head aside and brought down the whip on its flank parson christian turned to mr bonnithorne follow him he said resolutely and lifted his hand the lawyer made a show of explanation then assumed an air of authority but finally encountered the parson's white face and turned away in another moment greta was hanging on parson christian's neck sobbing and moaning while the good old christian with all the mellowness back in his wrinkled face smoothed her hair as tenderly as a woman my poor paul my dear husband cried greta ah thanks be to god things are at their worst now and they can't move but they must mend said the parson he took her indoors and bathed her hot forehead and dried with his hard old hand the tears that fell from eyes that a moment before had flashed like a basilisk's toward five o'clock that evening a knock came to the door of the vicarage and old laird fisher entered his manner was more than usually solemn and constrained i's coom't to say as ma lass's wee thing is taken badly he said and rayder sudden't greta rose from her seat and put on her hat and cloak she was hastening down the road while the charcoal burner was still standing in the middle of the floor chapter viii when greta reached the old charcoal burner's cottage the little one was lying in a drowsy state in mercy's arms its breathing seemed difficult sometimes it started in terror it was feverish and suffered thirst the mother's wistful face was bent down on it with an indescribable expression there were only the trembling lips to tell of the sharp struggle that was going on within but the yearning for a sight of the little flushed countenance the tearless appeal for but one glimpse of the drowsy little eyes the half articulate cry of a mother's heart against the fate that made the child she had suckled at her breast a stranger whose very features she might not know all this was written in that blind face is he pale said mercy is he sleeping he does not talk now but only starts and cries and sometimes coughs when did this begin asked greta toward four o'clock he had been playing and i noticed that he breathed heavily and then he came to me to be nursed is he awake now listen the little one in its restless drowsiness was muttering faintly man go on batter toas the darling is talking in his sleep isn't he said mercy then there was a ringing brassy cough it is croup thought greta she closed the window lighted a fire placed the kettle so that the steam might enter the room then wrung flannels out of hot water and wrapped them about the child's neck she stayed all that night at the cottage and sat up with the little one and nursed it mercy could not be persuaded to go to bed but she was very quiet it had not yet taken hold of her that the child was seriously ill he was drowsy and a little feverish his pulse beat fast and he coughed hard sometimes but he would be better in the morning oh yes he would soon be well again and tearing up the flowers in the garden toward midnight the pulse fell rapidly the breathing become quieter and the whole nature seemed to sink mercy listened with her ear bent down at the child's mouth and a smile of ineffable joy spread itself over her face bless him he is sleeping so calmly she said greta did not answer the 'puss' and the 'man' don't darken his little life so much now continued mercy cheerily no dear said greta in as strong a voice as she could summon all will be well with my darling boy soon will it not yes dear said greta with a struggle happily mercy could not read the other answer in her face mercy had put her sensitive fingers on the child's nose and was touching him lightly about the mouth greta she said in a startled whisper does he look pinched a little said greta quietly and his skin is it cold and clammy we must give him another hot flannel said greta mercy sat at the bedside and said nothing for an hour then all at once and in a strange harsh voice she said i wish god had not made ralphie so winsome greta started at the words but made no answer the daylight came early as the first gleams of gray light came in at the window greta turned to where mercy sat in silence it was a sad face that she saw in the mingled yellow light of the dying lamp and the gray of the dawn mercy spoke again greta do you remember what mistress branthet said when her baby died last back end gone twelvemonth greta looked up quickly at the bandaged eyes what she asked well parson christian tried to comfort her and said 'your baby is now an angel in paradise' and she turned on him with 'shaf on your angels i want none on 'em i want my little girl' mercy's voice broke into a sob toward ten o'clock the doctor came he had been detained very sorry to disoblige mrs ritson but fact was old mr de broadthwaite had an attack of lumbago complicated by a bout of toothache and everybody knew he was most exacting young person's baby ill feverish restless starts in its sleep and cough ah croupy cough yes croup true croup not spasmodic let him see how old a year and a half ah bad very most frequent in second year of infancy dangerous highly so forms a membrane that occludes air passages often ends in convulsions and child suffocates sad very let him see again how long since the attack began yesterday at four ah far gone far the great man soon vanished leaving behind him a harmless preparation of aconite and ipecacuanha mercy had heard all and her pent up grief broke out in sobs oh to think i shall hear my ralphie no more and to know his white cold face is looking up from a coffin while other children are playing in the sunshine and chasing the butterflies no no it can not be god will not let it come to pass i will pray to him and he will save my child why he can do anything and he has all the world what is my little baby boy to him he will not let it be taken from me greta's heart was too full for speech but she might weep in silence and none there would know mercy stretched across the bed and tenderly folding the child in her arms she lifted him up and then went down on her knees merciful father she said in a childish voice of sweet confidence this is my baby my ralphie and i love him so dearly you would never think how much i love him but he is ill and doctor says he may die oh dear father only think what it would be to say 'his little face is gone' and then i have never seen him you will not take him away until his mother sees him so soon too only five days more why it is quite close not to morrow nor the next day nor the next but the day after that she put in many another child like plea and then rose with a smile on her pale lips and replaced the little one on his pillow how patient he is she said he can't say 'thank you' but i'm sure his eyes are speaking let me feel she put her finger lightly on the child's lids no they are shut he must be sleeping oh dear he sleeps very much is he gaining color how quiet he is if he would only say 'mamma' how i wish i could see him she was very quiet for awhile and then plucked at greta's gown suddenly greta she said eagerly something tells me that if i could only see ralphie i should save him greta started up in terror no no no you must not think of it she said but some one whispered it it must have been god himself you know we ought to obey god always mercy it was not god who said that it was your own heart you must not heed it i'm sure it was god said mercy and i heard it quite plain mercy my darling think what you are saying think what it is you wish to do if you do it you will be blind forever but i shall have saved my ralphie no no you will not will he not be saved greta only our heavenly father knows well he whispered it in my heart and as you say he knows best greta was almost distraught with fear the noble soul in her would not allow her to appeal to mercy's gratitude against the plea of maternal love but she felt that all her happiness hung on that chance if mercy regained her sight all would be well with her and hers but if she lost it the future must be a blank the day wore slowly on and the child sunk and sunk at evening the old charcoal burner returned and went into the bedroom he stood a moment and looked down at the pinched little face and when the child's eyes opened drowsily for a moment he put his withered forefinger into its palm but there was no longer a responsive clasp of the chubby hand the old man's lips quivered behind his white beard it were a winsome wee thing he said faintly and then turned away he left his supper untouched and went into the porch there he sat on a bench and whittled a blackthorn stick the sun was sinking over the head of the eel crag the valley lay deep in a purple haze the bald top of cat bells stood out bright in the glory of the passing day a gentle breeze came up from the south and the young corn chattered with its multitudinous tongues in the field below the dog lay at the charcoal burner's feet blinking in the sun and snapping lazily at a buzzing fly the little life within was ebbing away no longer racked by the ringing cough the loud breathing became less frequent and more harsh mercy lifted the child from the bed and sat with it before the fire greta saw its eyes open and at the same moment she saw the lips move slightly but she heard nothing he is calling his mamma said mercy with her ear bent toward the child's mouth there was a silence for a long time mercy pressed the child to her breast its close presence seemed to soothe her greta stood and looked down she saw the little lips move once more but again she heard no sound he is calling his mamma repeated mercy wistfully and oh he seems such a long way off once again the little lips moved he is calling me said mercy listening intently and she grew restless and excited he is going away i can hear him he is far off ralphie ralphie she had lifted the child up to her face ralphie ralphie she cried give me the baby mercy said greta but the mother clung to it with a convulsive grasp ralphie ralphie ralphie there was a sudden flash of some white thing in an instant the bandage had fallen from mercy's head and she was peering down into the child's face with wild eyes ralphie ralphie hugh she cried the mother had seen her babe at last and in that instant she had recognized the features of its father at the next moment the angel of god passed through that troubled house and the child lay dead at the mother's breast mercy saw it all and her impassioned mood left her she rose to her feet quietly and laid the little one in the bed there was never a sigh more never a tear only her face was ashy pale and her whitening lips quivered greta she said very slowly will you go for him greta kissed the girl's forehead tenderly her own calm steadfast enduring spirit sunk all the world was dead to her now yes dear she whispered the next minute she was gone from the room chapter ix the evening was closing in now and then the shrill cries of the birds pealed and echoed in the still air a long fibrous streak of silver in the sky ebbed away over the head of hindscarth greta hastened toward the pit brow the clank of the iron chain in the gear told that the cage in the shaft was working it was a year and a half since her life had first been overshadowed by a disaster more black and terrible than death itself and never for an instant had the clouds been lifted until three days ago then in a moment the light had pierced through the empty sky and a way had been wrought for her out of the labyrinth of misery but even that passage for life and hope and love seemed now to be closed by the grim countenance of doom mercy would be blind forever all was over and done greta's strong calm spirit sunk and sunk she saw the impostor holding to the end the name and place of the good man and she saw the good man dragging his toilsome way through life an outcast a by word loaded with ignominy branded with crime and that unhappy man was her husband and he had no stay but in her love no hope but in her faith greta stopped at the door of hugh ritson's office and knocked a moment later he and she were face to face he was dressed in his pit flannels and was standing by a table on which a lamp burned when he recognized her he passed one hand across his brow the other he rested on the mantel piece there was a momentary twitching of her lips and he involuntarily remarked that in the time that had passed since they last met she had grown thinner come with me she said in a trembling whisper mercy's child is dead and the poor girl is asking for you in her great trouble he did not speak at once but shaded his eyes from the lamp then he said in a voice unlike his own i will follow you she had held the door in her hand and now she turned to go he took one step toward her greta have you nothing more to say to me he asked what do you wish me to say he did not answer his eyes fell before her there was a slight wave of her hand as she added the same room ought never to contain both you and me it never should have done so but this is not my errand i have deserved it he said humbly the cruel work is done yes done past undoing you have not heard the last of it then since you ask me what i have to say to you it is this that man that instrument of your malice who is now your master has been to say that he can compel me to live with him or imprison me if i refuse can he do it hugh ritson lifted his eyes with a blind vacant stare to live with him him you to live with him he said absently to live under his roof those were his words can he do it i mean if the law recognizes him as my husband hugh ritson's eyes wandered do it your husband he echoed incoherently i know well what he wants said greta breathing heavily it is not myself he is anxious for but he can not have the one without the other the one without the other echoed hugh ritson in a low tone then he strode across the room in visible agitation greta that man is do you know who he is paul drayton the innkeeper of hendon she answered calmly no no he is your he paused his brows knit his fingers interlaced her bosom swelled would you tell me that he is my husband she said indignantly hugh ritson again passed his hand across his brow greta i have deserved your distrust he said in an altered tone what is done can never be undone she answered his voice had regained its calmness but his manner was still agitated i may serve you even yet he said i have done you too much wrong i know that what is your remorse worth now she asked it comes too late then he looked her steadily in the face and replied greta it is well said that the most miserable man in all the world is he who feels remorse before he does the wrong i was i am that man i did what i did knowing well that i should repent it ay to the last hour of my life but i was driven to it i had no power to resist it it mastered me then it would master me now the finger tips of greta's right hand were pressed close against her cheek hugh ritson took a step nearer greta he said and his voice fell to a broken whisper there are some men to whom love is a passing breath a gentle gale that beats on the face and sports in the hair and then is gone to me it is a wound a deep corrosive inward wound that yearns and burns greta shuddered it was as if his words stung her then with an impatient gesture she turned again toward the door saying this is the death hour of your child and heaven pardon you it seems to be the death hour of your brother's hopes too she faced about do you think of him she added lifting her voice when you see this man in his place wasting his substance and mine do you ever think of him where he is her voice trembled and broke there was a moment's silence she had turned her head aside and he heard the low sound of sobs yes i think of him he answered slowly at night in the sleepless hours i do think of him where he is and i think of him as a happy man yes a happy man what if he wears a convict's dress his soul is yoked to no deadening burden as for me well look at me he smiled grimly i have heard everything said greta you have sown the wind and you are reaping the whirlwind something like a laugh broke from him it came from the waters of bitterness that lay deep in his heart not that he said all that will pass away she was on the threshold a force of which she knew nothing held her there greta i am not so bad a man as perhaps i seem i am a riddle that you may not read the time is near when i shall trouble the world no more and it will be but a poor wounded name i shall leave behind me will it not greta would it be a mockery to ask you to forgive me there are others who have more to forgive said greta one of them is waiting for you at this moment and poor girl her heart is broken hugh ritson bent his head slightly and greta pulled the door after her chapter x the evening had closed in the watery veil that goes between day and night was hanging in the air the wind had risen and the trees were troubled when hugh ritson reached the cottage all was dark about the house save for the red glow from the peat fire which came out into the open porch the old laird fisher was sitting there a blackthorn stick at his feet his elbows on his knees his cheeks rested on his hands the drowsy glow fell on his drooping white head as hugh ritson passed into the kitchen the old man lifted to his a countenance on which grief and reproach were stamped together hugh ritson's proud spirit was rebuked by the speechless sorrow of that look it was such a look as a wounded hound lifts to the eyes of a brutal master a sheep dog was stretched at full length before the slumbering fire the kitchen was empty and silent too except for the tick of the clock and the colly's labored breathing but at the sound of hugh's uncertain step on the hard earthen floor the door of the bedroom opened and greta motioned him to enter a candle burned near the bed before a fire mercy fisher sat with parson christian her head lay on a table that stood between her face buried in her encircled arms one hand lay open beside the long loose tresses of yellow hair and the parson's hand rested upon it caressingly parson christian rose as hugh ritson entered and bowing coldly he left the room greta had already gone out and he rejoined her in the kitchen mercy lifted her head and looked up at hugh there was not a tear in her weary red swollen eyes and not a sigh came from her heaving breast she rose quietly and taking hugh's hand in her own she drew him to the bedside see where he is she said in a voice of piercing earnestness and with her other hand she lifted a handkerchief from the little white face hugh ritson shuddered he saw his own features as if memory had brought them in an instant from the long past mercy disengaged her hand and silently hid her face but she did not weep my little ralphie she said plaintively how quiet he is now oh but you should have seen him when he was like a glistening ray of morning light why did you not come before hugh ritson stood there looking down at the child's dead face and made no answer it is better as it is his heart whispered at that moment the next instant his whole frame quivered what was the thought that had risen unbidden within him better that his child should lie there cold and lifeless than that it should fill this desolate house with joy and love was he then so black a villain god forbid yet it was better so all is over now said mercy and her hands fell from her face she turned her weary eyes full upon him and added we have been punished already punished said hugh we there was silence for a moment and then dropping his voice until it was scarcely audible he said your burden is heavy to bear my poor girl her slight figure swayed a little i could bear it no longer she answered many a one has thought that before you he said but god alone knows what we can not bear until we are tried well all is over now she repeated listlessly she spoke of herself as if her days were already ended and past as if her orb of life had been rounded by the brief span of the little existence that lay finished upon the bed hugh ritson looked at her and the muscles of his face twitched her weary eyes were still dry their dim light seemed to come from far away how i prayed that i might see my ralphie she said i thought surely god had willed it that i should never see my child perhaps that was to be my punishment for all that had taken place but i prayed still oh you would not think how much i pray but it must have been a wicked prayer she hid her face once more in her hands and added with unexpected animation god heard my prayer and answered it but see she pointed to the child i saw him yes i saw him die hugh ritson was moved but his heart was bitter at that moment he cursed the faith that held in bondage the soul of the woman at his side would that he could trample it underfoot and break forever the chains by which it held the simple hugh she said and her voice softened we are about to part forever our little ralphie yours and mine he calls me i could not live without him god would not make me do that he has punished me already and he is merciful only think our ralphie is in heaven she paused and bit her lip and drew her breath audibly inward her face took then a death like hue and all at once her voice overflowed with anguish do you know something whispered at that instant that god had not punished us enough that ralphie was not in heaven and that the sins of the fathers oh my darling my darling with a shrill cry she stopped turned to the bed threw her outspread arms about the child and kissed it fervently the tears came at length and rained down on that little silent face hugh ritson could support the strain no longer mercy he said and his voice had a deep tremor mercy if there is any sin it is mine and if there is to be any punishment hereafter that will be mine too as for your little boy be sure he is in heaven he had stepped to the door and his thumb was on the wooden latch you say rightly we shall never meet again he said in a muffled voice good bye mercy lifted her tearful face give me your hand at parting she said in an imploring tone he was on the opposite side of the bed from where she stood and she reached her hand across it he took a step nearer and his hand closed in hers between them and beneath their clasped hands lay the child hugh we could not love in this world something went astray with us but we shall meet again shall we not he turned his eyes away perhaps he answered promise me she said promise me he drew his breath hard if there is a god and a judgment be sure we shall meet he said his voice broke he turned abruptly aside and hurried out of the house chapter xi the night was now dark there was no moon and there were no stars the wind soughed mournfully through the trees in the occasional lull the rumble of the cataracts drifted heavily through the air hugh ritson walked in the darkness with drooping head he was not making for the pit brow he had taken the opposite direction when he reached the village he stopped at the flying horse loud peals of laughter came from the parlor hidden by red blinds from the road he stood at the door that opened into the bar the landlady her face turned from him was talking with obvious animation to a daleswoman who stood with a jug in her hand at the other side of the counter what woman thoo's surely heard what happen't at the ghyll this morning nay bessie i's been thrang as throp wife cleaning and tittivating well lass they've telt me as it were shocking two brothers and such a fratch it coom't to blows at last and they do say 'at master hugh is nigh amaist dead with a bash the girt fellow gave him hugh ritson rapped sharply at the door tell your husband i wish to see him he said the landlady looked up fumbled with a napkin and answered nervously yes sir then she hobbled to the door of the parlor and opened it a wave of mingled noise vapor and foul odors came through the aperture tommy she screamed above the babel the landlord appeared can you send me a dog cart at half past four in the morning said hugh maybe it's a gay canny hour i reckon said the landlord he pulled at a long pipe as he spoke and his face which was flushed wore an impudent smile i have to catch the five o'clock train hugh answered to london one cheek was twisted into numerous wrinkles i said the five train said hugh sternly can you do it i's niver said nay it'll be three half crowns hugh put half a sovereign on the counter let it be sent at half past four promptly to the ghyll the twist of the cheek was a shade less perceptible to the pit brow the parlor door opened again and natt stood on the threshold the stableman's sleepy eyes awakened to a knowing twinkle then his flat face disappeared and a thin titter mingled audibly with the clamor within in another moment the door was thrown wide open and drayton came slouching out his hair fell back over his forehead from which his hat was tipped back a cigar was perched between his teeth the tips of his fingers were thrust into his waistcoat pockets come in i've summat to show you he said hugh did not stir but he lifted his head and looked into the room half a score of the riff raff of the dale were seated amid clouds of smoke on the wooden mantel shelf above the wide ingle a large book stood open and the leaves fluttered with the wind that came through the door i hain't forgotten what you said long ago about the parson's book said drayton so here it is and a mighty valuable thing i call it you thought to frighten me with it but bless yer soul i like it i do listen drayton stepped back into the room turned the leaves and began to read in a lusty tone november thomas said allan was fresh from scotland being scottish born and that his wife was irish and that they had a child called paul only a few months old and not yet walking it was the parson's diary that's good enough ain't it master hugh ritson said drayton with an ungainly bow and a vast show of civility followed instantly by a sidelong leer at his cronies about him hugh ritson held himself stiffly and merely said where did you get it at this question there were sundry snorts and titters and muttered responses from the men at the tables hugh's eyes passed over them with a steely glance stolen it i suppose he said quietly ay said drayton and a neat job too natt 'ticed away the methodee man while i borrowed it drayton seemed to be proud of his share in the transaction and his friends laughed loudly at the adroit turn he had given to the matter natt's drowsy eyes were preternaturally bright at that great moment hugh ritson's forehead darkened with ire this is your gratitude to the clergyman he said sundry further snorts and sniggers went round the tables there's not a man of you who is not beholden to parson christian said hugh sternly he twisted sharply round upon one graybeard whose laugh still rumbled between his teeth reuben rae who nursed your sick wife john proudfoot to the blacksmith what about your child down with the fever his quick eye traversed the parlor and more than one lusty crony was fain to bury his face in his breast yet you laugh brave fellows as you are when the good man's house is broken into by a thief drayton took a swift stride toward him drop it and quick he shouted hugh ritson governed himself with an effort i'm not here to brawl he said quietly pigeon livered blatherskite that's what i call ye d'ye hear said drayton hugh's face flinched but he turned on his heel and was on the road at the next instant drayton followed him out laughing boisterously hugh made one quick step backward and shut the door then he turned about on drayton whose cruel face could be dimly seen in the hazy red light that came through the blinds you have tried to torture me he said just as you would hang a dog by its tail or draw the teeth of a rat you have threatened with worse torture a good and loyal woman you are a scoundrel and you know it but even you would hesitate if you knew for certain who or what you are let me tell you again now when we are alone and while i have no personal interest to serve you are the man whose name i gave you paul lowther son of robert lowther and that lady my brother's wife whom for reason of profit you would compel to live under the same roof with you is your own sister drayton's loud guffaw rang out above the wind's moan in the trees his cronies within heard it and listened it's a rare old story that is let me see you've told it before i fancy then it was a lie now it's god's truth said hugh drayton laughed again and then it was believed but now it's not no no master hugh it won't pass we will see hugh ritson had swung about and was gone drayton went back to his friends hasn't the pluck of a pigeon when it comes to the push he muttered ey he wears a bonny white feather in his cap for sure said old reuben rae no fight in'im no'but tongue lather said john the blacksmith hugh ritson walked through the darkness to the pit brow the glow of the furnace lighted up the air to the south and showed vaguely the brant sides of the fell the dull thud of the engine the clank of the chain and the sharp crack of the refuse tumbling down the bank from the banksman's barrow were the only sounds that rose above the wind's loud whistle gubblum was at the mouth of the shaft oglethorpe said hugh how many of the gangs are below to night all but two auld reuben's and jim south'et's then they have chosen to work on ey another fortnight trusting to get their wage afore that please god they shall not be disappointed hugh ritson turned away gubblum trundled his last wheelbarrow to the edge of the bank and then rested and said to himself he takes it cool enough onyway but the outside tranquillity disappeared when hugh ritson reached his own room on the pit brow he bathed his hot forehead again and again his fingers twitched nervously and he plunged his perspiring hands into cold water above the wrists holding them there for several minutes not for long did he sit in one seat he tramped the room uneasily his infirm foot trailing heavily then he threw himself on the couch tossed from side to side rose and resumed his melancholy walk thus an hour passed drearily his mind recalled one by one the events of the day and one by one there came crowding back upon him the events of the two years that had passed since his father's death a hurricane was upheaving every memory of his mind and every memory had its own particular sting and came up as a blight to fret his soul he tried to guard himself from himself what he had first thought to do was but in defense of his strict legal rights and if he had gone further if he had done more without daring to think of it until it was done then it was love that had led him astray was it so cruel a thing to be just so foul a thing to love but above the shufflings of remorse above the stiflings of regret above the plea of a maddening love was the voice of revenge speaking loudly in his soul that man his instrument now his master paul lowther must be brought down and his time serving sponsor with him but how there was but one way by denouncing himself yes that was the sole outlet for his outraged and baffled spirit he must go to the proper quarter and say i have perjured myself and sworn away my brother's liberty the man who was condemned as paul drayton is paul ritson i did it all that would bring this vulgar scoundrel to the dust but at what a price the convict's dress now worn by his brother would soon be worn by him and what solace would it be then that the same suit would be worn by the impostor also yet why prate of solace in a matter like this what alternative was left to him in what quarter of the sky was the light dawning for him he was traveling toward the deepening night and the day of his life was done what if he allowed everything to take its course well he was a disgraced and ruined man turned adrift from his father's house and doomed to see a stranger living there did he lack gall to make such a climax bitter bitter eh and a thousand times the more bitter because he himself had for ends of his own first placed the scoundrel where he sat no no no paul lowther must be brought down and with him must fall the poor ruins of a better man yes a better man let the world say what it would could it occur that he would not be believed that when he said take me i am a perjurer they would answer no your self denunciation is only a freak of revenge a mad attempt to injure the relative who has turned you out of his house hugh ritson laughed as the grim irony of such a possible situation flashed upon him a man self condemned and saved from punishment by the defense of his enemy there was a knock at his door in his stupor he was not at first conscious of what the knock meant at length he recalled himself and cried come in gubblum oglethorpe entered the men on the twelve o'clock shift are just about ganging down and they want to tak' a few mair forks with them they've telt me 'at the timber is splitting like matchwood under the sandy vein hugh ritson made an effort to gather the purport of gubblum's message tell them to take the forks he said in a low tone gubblum was backing out and stopped i reckon thoo's not heard the last frae auld mattha's he said in another voice what is it oglethorpe said hugh his head bent over the table robbie south'et's wife has been up to t' brow and says that mercy's laal thing is gone hugh did not lift his eyes is that the last he said nay but warse the lass herself tore the bandage frae her eyes and she's gone stone blind and that's foriver hugh's head bent closer over the table good night oglethorpe he said gubblum backed out muttering to himself as he returned to the shaft a cool hand how an' iver the moment the door closed hugh ritson tramped the floor in restless perambulations what had he thought of doing delivering himself to justice as a perjurer had he then no duty left in life that he must needs gratify his revenge in a kind of death what of the woman who had suffered for him what of the broken heart and the wretched home were these as nothing against the humiliation of a proud spirit never for an instant never in his bitterest agony did hugh ritson lie to his own soul and say that the resolution he had formed was prompted by remorse for what he had done to paul ritson not revenge for what he had suffered from paul drayton to be a saint when sick to find the conscience active when defeat overwhelmed it that was for the weak dregs of humanity but such paltering was not for him on the one hand revenge on the other duty which was he to follow the wretched man could come to no decision and when the fingers of his watch pointed to one o'clock he lay down on the couch to rest it was not sleep that he wanted sleep had of late become too full of terrors but sleep overcame him nevertheless his face when he slept was the face of a man in pain and dreams came that were the distorted reflections of his waking thoughts he dreamed that he had died in infancy calm serene very sweet and peaceful his little innocent face of childhood looked up from the white pillow he thought his mother bent over him and shed many tears but he himself belonged to another world of beings and looked down on both it is better so he thought and the tears she weeps are blest at this he awoke and rose to his feet what soft nothings men had said of sleep oh sleep it is a gentle thing beloved from pole to pole gentle more tyrannous than death the melancholy perambulation ended and he lay down once more he slept and dreamed again this time he had killed his own brother a moment before they had stood face to face vigorous wrathful with eyes that flashed and hands uplifted now his brother lay quiet and awful at his feet and the great silence was broken by a voice from heaven crying a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be on the earth he started to his feet in terror mercy mercy he cried then he drew his breath hard and looked about him a dream only another dream he said to himself and laughed between his close set teeth the lamp still burned on the table he rose drew a key from his pocket opened a cupboard and took out a small bottle it contained an opiate since i must sleep let my sleep at least be dreamless he said and he measured a dose he was lifting the glass to his lips when he caught sight of his face in the glass pitiful pitiful a mere dream unnerves me pitiful enough forsooth and so i must needs hide myself from myself behind a bulwark like this he held the drug to the light and while his hand trembled he laughed then he drank it off put out the light and sat on the couch the dawn had fretted the sky and the first streaks of day crept in at the window when the lamp's yellow light was gone hugh ritson sat in the gray gloom his knees drawn close under his chin his arms folded over his breast his head bent heavily forward he was crooning an old song presently the voice grew thick the eye became clouded and then the head fell back he was asleep and in his sleep he dreamed again or was it a vision and not a dream that came to him now he thought he stood in a room which he had seen before on the bed some white thing lay it was a child and the little soul had fled beside it a woman cowered and moaned guilty guilty her eyes were fixed on the child yet she saw nothing the sightless orbs were bleached but with her heart she saw the child and she saw himself also as he entered then it seemed that she turned her blind face toward him and called on him by name the next instant she was gone her seat was vacant the bed was empty only a gray bearded man sat by a cold grate with an overpowering weight pressing him down it seemed to hugh that he threw up his head and again he heard his name he leaped to his feet big beads of cold sweat stood on his forehead mercy is dead he whispered with awe she has gone to put in her plea of guilty she is in god's great hand the next moment a voice shouted mr ritson he listened and in the gray light his stony countenance smiled grimly mr ritson once more followed by the rap of a whip handle against the door tommy the landlord said hugh and he broke into a harsh laugh so you were my angel tommy eh another harsh laugh the landlord sitting in the dog cart outside heard it and thought to himself some one with him hugh ritson plunged his head into the wash basin and rubbed himself vigorously with a rough towel my last sleep is over he said glancing aside with fearful eyes at the couch i'll do this thing that i am bent upon but no more sleep and no more dreams he opened the door threw a rug up to the landlord put on an ulster and leaped into the dog cart they started away at a quick trot a chill morning breeze swept down the vale the sun was rising above cat bells but hugh ritson still felt as if he were traveling toward the deepening night he sat with folded arms and head bent on his breast hasta heard what happened at auld laird fisher's this morning said the landlord hugh answered in a low voice i've heard nothing the lass has followed her barn rather sudden't ey she's gone for sure died a matter of half an hour ago i heard it frae the parson as i coom't by hugh ritson bent yet lower his drooping head chapter xii at o'clock that day hugh ritson arrived at euston he got into a cab and drove to whitehall at the home office he asked for the secretary of state a hundred obstacles arose to prevent him from penetrating to the head of the department one official handed him over to another the second to a third the third to a fourth hugh ritson was hardly the man to be balked by such impediments his business was with the secretary of state and none other parliament was in session and the home secretary was at the afternoon sitting of the house hugh ritson sought and found him there he explained his purpose in few words and was listened to with a faint smile of incredulity the secretary was a stolid yorkshireman who affected whatever measure of bluffness had not been natural to him from birth he first looked at his visitor with obvious doubts of his sanity and when this suspicion had been set at rest by hugh's incisive explanation with an equally obvious desire to feel his bumps but the face of the yorkshireman soon became complicated by other shades of expression than such as come of distrust of a man's reason or contempt of his sentimentality hadn't you better sleep on it and come to see me at whitehall in the morning he said with more respect than he had yet shown then if you are still of the same mind i will send for the public prosecutor hugh ritson bowed his acquiescence and can i have the order for portland he said probably it will be against the new regulation that none may visit a convict prison except prison officials and persons interested in prison discipline but we'll see what can be done that night hugh ritson called at the convent of st margaret it was late when he entered and when he came out again half an hour afterward the lamps were lighted in the abbey gardens the light fell on the face of the lay sister who opened the door to him she wore a gray gown but no veil or scapular and beneath the linen band that covered her hair her eyes were red and swollen hugh ritson hailed a hansom in the broad sanctuary and drove to hendon the bar of the hawk and heron was full of carriers carters road menders and farm laborers all drinking and all noisy but despite this evidence of a thriving trade the whole place had a bankrupt appearance as of things going to wreck jabez served behind the counter he had developed a good deal of personal consequence and held up his head and repeatedly felt the altitude of a top knot that curled there and bore himself generally with the cockety air of the young rooster after the neck of the old one has been screwed mrs drayton sat knitting in the room where mercy and the neighbor's children once played together when hugh ritson went in to her the old body started lor's a mercy me sir to think it's you i'm that fearsome that i declare i shiver and quake at nothing and good for nowt i' the world neither not since my own flesh and blood as you might say disowned me do you mean at the trial asked hugh ritson the trial sir said the landlady lifting bewildered eyes while the click of the needles ceased my paul weren't there cummerland sir and you heard him yourself what he said of me a corner of her house wife's apron went up to her face me as had brought him up that tender well recovering composure i've lost heart and serve him right i just lets the house and things go i do i trusts to providence and that jabez he's no better nor a babby in the public line when hugh ritson left the inn the old body's agitation increased she had set down the knitting and was fidgeting first with her cap and then her apron listen to me said hugh to day is friday on monday you must go to the convent where you saw the mother of paul ask for sister grace will you remember sister grace she will tell you all it was hard on eleven o'clock when hugh ritson returned to town the streets were thronged and he walked for a long hour amid the crowds that passed through the strand in all that multitudinous sea of faces there was not a countenance on which the mark of suffering was more indelibly fixed than on his own his sensibilities were wrought up to an unwonted pitch he was like a waif adrift in unknown waters a cloud without anchor in a tempestuous sky yet he felt that night as he had never felt before that he had suddenly become possessed of another and most painful sense not a face in that sea of faces but he seemed to know its secret fear its joy and sorrow the watchful dread that seared the hidden heart the fluttering hope that buoyed it up it was an awful thing to be turned adrift in a world of sin and suffering with this agonizing sense he could look whether he would or not beneath the smiling and rubicund countenance of the hail fellow well met to that corrosive spot within where the trust of the widow and fatherless had been betrayed or see beyond the stolid and heavy appearance proper to the ox the quivering features of the man who had stood long years ago above the dead body of the woman who had thrown her death at his door as sole reward for the life he had wrecked nay not only did the past write its manual there but the future wrote its sign he knew that the young girl in pink ribbons who was hurrying along with a smile on her lips from the shop in the west to that unknown home in the east where the child of her shame had laughed and crowed and climbed up her bosom to her chin was doomed to find that the source of all her joy and half her sorrow lay cold and stiff in its crib he grew fearful of himself he shuddered as the unsuspected murderer brushed his elbow he shuddered yet more as a mirror flashed back the reflection of his own hard face and the idea came to him that perhaps other eyes could see what his eyes saw he turned down arundel street and on to the embankment no no no the merciful god had not willed it that any man should look so deeply into the heart of his fellow man that was indeed to know good and evil and the thought stole over him that perhaps it was in degree as a man had eaten of the forbidden fruit of the tree of life that he was cursed with this bitter knowledge here on the quiet pavement that echoed to his footsteps the air was free he uncovered his head and the light west wind played in his hair and cooled his temples not a star shone overhead and the river that flowed in the bed below was dark more dark to him was the sea of humanity that flowed above he had heard that the death roll of the thames was one of every day for the year and he leaned over the granite wall and wondered if the old river had claimed its toll for the day that was now almost done his hair seemed to rise from its roots as he thought that perhaps at that very instant in the black waters beneath him the day's sacrifice was washing past he walked on and the dull buzz of the strand fell on his ear what after all was the old god of the river to the juggernaut of the city and it was now when the fret of the day had worn down that hugh ritson thought of all that he had left behind him in the distant north there in the darkness and the silence amid the mountains by the waving trees and the rumbling ghylls lay half the ruins of his ruined life the glow of old london's many lights could not reach so far but the shadow of that dark spot was here chapter xiii the clocks struck midnight and he returned to the hotel at which he had engaged a bed he did not lie down to sleep but walked to and fro the night through next morning at ten he was at the home office again he saw the secretary and some of the law officers of the crown when he came out he carried in his pocket an order to visit a convict in portland and was attended by a police sergeant in plain clothes they took train from waterloo at two in the afternoon and reached weymouth at six when they crossed the strip of sea the best of the day was gone and a fresh breeze blew across the breakwater the saxon walls of the castle at the foot of the vern hill reflected the chill blue of the water but far above where the rocky coast dipped to the beach the yellow stone with the bluish clay in its crevices shone in the glow of the sinking sun hugh ritson and his companion put up for the night at the portland arms inn a ruddy round faced man in middle life clean shaven and dressed youthfully was smoking in the parlor he exchanged a salutation with the cordiality of one who was nothing loath for a chat then he picked up the old reeve staff and explained the ancient method of computing tithes but hugh ritson was in no humor for conversation and after dinner he set out for a solitary walk he took the road that turns from the beach through the villages of chiswell and fortune's well when he reached the top of the hill the sea lay around him and beneath him to the right and left of the summit were the quarries where the convicts labored with two branches of an inclined railway leading down to the breakwater on the summit itself known as the grove was a long high granite wall with a broad gate way and the lancet lights of a lodge at one side of it this was the convict prison and the three or four houses in front of it were the residences of governor chaplain and chief warder a cordon of cottages at a little distance were the homes of the assistant warders there were a few shops amid this little group of cottages and one public house the spotted dog hugh ritson strolled into the tavern and sat down in a little snuggery which was separated from a similar apartment by a wooden partition that stood no higher than a tall man's height and left a space between the top stile and the ceiling a company of men gossiped at the other side of the partition talk of b said a guttural voice hugh ritson started at the sound i took the stiff'ning out of him first go off when he'd done he separates and come on from the moor i saw he wasn't an old lag so says i to 'im 'green 'un' i says 'if you're leary you'll fetch a easy lagging and if you're not it'll be bellows to mend with you' 'what d'ye mean' he says 'it's bloomin' 'ard work here' i says 'and maybe you don't get shin of beef soup to do it on bread and water for a word' i says 'you're in my gang quarrying and i won't work you 'ard except i'm druv to it but i want wide men in my gang' i says 'and no putting the stick on agen the screw' 'don't understand' he says 'then follow a straight tip' i says 'stand by your warder and he'll stand by you' blest if that lag as i'd give that good advice to didn't get me fined the very next day never said sundry incredulous voices it was a hot afternoon and i'd just whipped a quid in my mouth and leaned atop of my musket for forty winks after dinner the second timers was codding afront of me and and the young chap as was dying of the consumption was wheeling and filling ahead well up comes the governor right in front of and shouts 'warder' he shouts 'you're fined for inattention' then off he goes all right mr i says i'll not misremember what did you do do a loud hollow laugh that was when the barracks was building and one day a bit of a newspaper blowed over from the officers' quarters and came on it and the botcher picked it up he'd chucked hisself quick 'right about face march' he got seven stretch a month's marks and lost his bedding a hearty laugh followed this account of a screw's revenge on a green convict hugh ritson listened and shuddered i ain't surprised at anything from that luny said another voice he was in my gang at the moor and i know'd 'im they put 'im in the soap suds gang first but he got hisself shifted then they sent 'im botching with the tailors but he put out his broom for the governor and said a big lusty man same as 'im wasn't for sitting on a board all day the flat didn't want to fetch a easy lagging that's the fact there was a loud guffaw so they put 'im in my turf gang out on the moor and one day a old clergyman come in gaiters and a broad brimmer and a face as if the master of the house were a shaking at his hand and the missis flopping down stairs to give him a smack of the lips well saw him in principal warder rennell's office and not afore the bars so next day i says 'got anybody outside as would like to send you summat by the underground' 'the what' he says reg'lar black in the face 'the underground railway' i says tipping him a wink 'get away from me you bloodsucker' he says but i pinched 'im the old lags were laughing at one of the grave digger's oyster openers when up comes rennell 'who's laughing' he says 'it's ' i says 'he's always idling and malingering' ha ha ha what did he get three days' bread and water a week's marks and loss of class privileges he didn't mind the grub and the time but jack in the box who was warder on his landing said he took it proper bad as he couldn't write home to the missis what's his dose three one of the old lags would do it on his head and fetch it easy too he's a scholar and could get to be a wardsman in the infirmary or medicine factotum for the croaker or maybe book keeper for the governor but he's earned no remissions and he'll fill his time afore he slings his hook again hugh ritson could support the gossip no longer he got up to leave the house but before doing so he pushed open the door that led to the adjoining room and stood a moment on the threshold comprehending everything and everybody in one quick glance the air breathed fresh outside he walked in the gathering gloom of evening to the ruins of the church by the cliff and passing through the lych gate he came on the beaten track to the rocks the rocks lay a hundred feet beneath torn from the mainland in craggy masses that seemed ready to slide from their base to the deep chasm between could it be possible that men who were the slaves of hinds like those in yonder tavern could cling to their little lives while a deliverance like this beetling cliff stood near a cold smile played on hugh ritson's face as he thought that come what would such slavery was not for him the sycamore by the ruined chancel pattered in the breeze and the wheatear's last notes came from its top most bough far below the waves were rocking lazily there were other waves at hugh ritson's feet the graves of dead men some who were buried there long ago were buried in their chains under the earth the fettered men on the ruins of the church the singing bird across the sea the light was every moment fading in another hour the day would be done and then the moon would look down peacefully on the fettered and the free hugh ritson returned to the portland arms inn he found the police sergeant in conversation with the ruddy faced gentleman who had wished to explain to him the mysteries of the reeve staff he is the doctor at the prison whispered the sergeant aside presently hugh turned to the doctor and said do you happen to know the convict b yes drayton said the doctor calls himself ritson are you a friend hugh ritson's face quivered slightly no he answered i am not his friend then after a pause but i have an order to see him besides i have just heard him discussed by a company of wardens in a pot house on the hill who were they what were they like a tall man one of them fifty five years of age gray hair grizzly beard dark vindictive eyes a gash on one cheek and a voice like a crow's humph jim the ladder a discharged soldier another a cadaverous fellow with a plausible tongue horrocks an old second classer served his time at dartmoor and got promotion doubtful official discipline they both deserve one more and much higher promotion said hugh ritson with emphasis you mean this the doctor laughed and put the forefinger of one hand held horizontally to the tip of the other held upright can it be possible that the law is unable to maintain a fair stand up fight with crime and must needs call a gang of poltroons and blackmailers to its assistance you heard a bad account of b i judge i heard of nothing that he had done which the pope of rome might have feared to acknowledge you are right he's as good a man as there's on portland bill said the doctor and if he's not quite as immaculate as his holiness he's in the right of it this time hugh ritson glanced up you've heard he's in the punishment cells said the doctor by the way you'll not see him until monday he can't join his gang before and he hasn't a class privilege left poor devil hugh inquired the cause since he came here he's been yoked to a young fellow dying of consumption the lad didn't relish the infirmary he lost his marks toward remission there he knew the days he had to serve and used to nick them off every night on his wooden spoon it was a weary way from a thousand back back back to one and that jim the ladder took delight in keeping up the count by reports the poor boy wanted to die in his mother's arms he had got his time down to a week when the 'screw' clapped as many marks on to him as added a month to his imprisonment then he lost heart and dropped down like a flounder and when they picked him up he was dead was b with him as usual he was and he broke the strap sprung on the warder and tore his rifle out of his hands jim the ladder has been a prize fighter in his day and there was a tussle he leaped back on b with a howl and the blows fell like rain drops there was a fearful clamor the convicts screaming like madmen b is a powerful man said hugh ritson the doctor nodded he closed with the warder gripped him by the waist twisted him on his loins turned him heels overhead and brought him down in a sweep that would have battered the life out of any other man up came the civil guard and the convict was brought into the lodge covered with dust sweat and blood his eyes flashing like balls of fire they had the lad's body on a stretcher beside him the lips white and the cheeks a mask of blue it was a tremendous spectacle i can tell you hugh ritson's breast heaved and somewhere deep down in his soul he surprised a feeling of pride that man was a hero and his own brother and so the convict was punished fourteen days' penal class diet and marks enough for six months he'll be out on monday and then he'll wear the blue cap that denotes a dangerous man hugh ritson shuddered is it impossible to see him to morrow he asked come up before church in the morning and ask for me and we'll speak to the governor chapter xiv early next morning hugh ritson showed his order at the prison gates and was admitted to the doctor's quarters hugh and the doctor went in search of the governor but learned that he was away from home for the day the deputy governor was abed with a raging tooth and there was nothing to do but to wait until morning in order to speak with the convict you can stay here until to morrow said the doctor i can give you a shake down and now let us go off to church but come this way first they walked in the direction of that portion of the parade ground which was marked in great white letters gang with the broad arrow beneath near to this stood a building composed chiefly of wood and iron and marked in similar letters e hall they entered a corridor that led to an open landing in the shape of a many sided polygon each side being a door in the middle of the landing there was an iron circular staircase that led to landings above and below a warder paraded the open space which was lighted by gas jets hush look said the doctor standing by the peep hole in one of the doors and at the same time putting out the gas jet that burned on the door jamb hugh ritson approached and at first he could see nothing in the darkness but he heard a curious clanking noise from within then the glimmer of a feeble candle came through the bars and he saw a box like apartment some seven feet long by four feet broad and eight feet high it was a punishment cell there was a shelf at the opposite end and a tin wash basin stood on it on the side of the door there must have been a similar shelf on which the candle burned a broom a can and a bowl were on the brick floor there was no other furniture except a hammock swung from end to end and the convict was lying in it at this moment it could be seen that a heavy chain was fastened with riveted rings around each ankle and linked about the waist by a strap at every movement this chain clanked night and day it was there if the prisoner shifted in his sleep its grating sound broke on the silence of the cell and banished the only sunshine of his life the sunshine of his dreams his head was back to the door so that the light of the candle burning on the shelf might fall on a slate which rested on his breast though he occupied a punishment cell he was writing and hugh ritson's quick eyes could decipher the words oh that it would please god to destroy me that he would but loose his hand and cut me off oh wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death he paused in his writing and pecked like a bird at a hard piece of bread beside him hugh ritson fell back and as his infirm foot grated along the floor the convict started and turned his face it was a blank pale face full of splendid resolution and the nobility of suffering but without one ray of hope do you know him asked the doctor but hugh ritson's eyes were on the ground and he made no answer they went to church the civil guard was drawn up under the gallery with loaded rifles eight hundred convicts attended service some of them were penitent most of them were trying to make a high profession of contrition as a bid for the good graces of the chaplain the obtrusive reverence of one sinister gray head near at hand attracted hugh ritson's especial attention he knelt with his face to the gallery in which the choir sat beside him was a youth fresh from millbank the hoary sinner was evidently initiating the green hand into the mysteries of his new home he was loud in his responses but his voice had a trick of dropping suddenly to a whispered conference who's the fat 'un in the choir a chap as is doing his ten his missis chared to keep the kids and one morning early he popped the old girl's shoes the voice of the chaplain interrupted further explanation but after another loud response the old rascal's mouth was twisted awry with the words he's a wide 'un he is seat in the choir got comfortable cushions besides he gets off saturday morning's work for practicing got no more voice nor a corn crake evidently it was no disadvantage here to be the greatest of vagabonds when a cadaverous old jew came hobbling up the aisle with his gang the gray head whispered with awe it's old mo he's in the stocking gang but i did business with him when he could ha' sent old rothschild home for a pauper at one moment the attention of the green hand was arrested by a tall man in the black and gray that indicated a convict who had attempted to escape says he's in for twenty thousand but it's a lie whispered the old man he only knocked a living out of the religious fake the last of the conference that hugh ritson overheard was a piece of touching advice them as 'as any pluck in 'em turns savage same as b them as 'asn't knocks under same as me and i says to you knock under after service the sacrament was celebrated there must have been many hundreds of communicants all humble in their piety it could be noticed that the chaplain had sometimes to keep a tight grip of the goblet containing the wine that night hugh ritson lodged at the doctor's quarters he did not lie but as on the night before he walked the long hours through steadfastly resisting every temptation to sleep at five in the morning he heard the great bell at the gate ring for two minutes and shortly afterward the tramp tramp tramp of many feet under his window the convicts to the number of fifteen hundred were drawn up on the parade ground they looked chill in the cold light of early morning their gray jackets lay loose on their spare shoulders their hands hung inertly at their sides and they walked with the oscillating motion of men whose feet were sore in their heavy boots the civil guard was drawn up the chief warder whistled and then the men fell out into gangs of twenty five each attended by an assistant warder rear rank take two paces to the right march then the tramp tramp again as the outside gangs passed through the gate each officer in charge received his rifle bayonet belt and cartridge box from the armorer at the lodge the stone dressing gang passed close under the window and hugh ritson reeled back as one of the men a stalwart fellow in a blue cap who was walking abreast of a misshapen creature with a face full of ferocity lifted his eyes upward from the file at eight o'clock the governor appeared at his receiving office he was a slight man with the face and figure of a greyhound his military frock coat was embossed with crimean medals and he was redolent of the odor of whitehall he received hugh ritson's papers with a curious mixture of easy courtesy and cold dignity a sort of combination of the different manners in which he was wont to bow to a secretary of state and condemn a convict to the chain and bread and water the men are back to breakfast at nine he said watkins to the chief warder have b brought round to the office immediately gang returns hugh ritson had left the receiving office and was crossing the parade ground when a loud hubbub arose near the lodge the boat shouted twenty voices and a covey of convicts ran in the direction of a shed where an eight oar boat was kept on the chocks a man has mizzled run a wagon into the sea and is drifting down the race how the demons laughed how they cursed in jest how they worked how luminous were their eyes and haggard faces at the prospect of recapturing one of their fellow prisoners who had tried to make his escape every convict who helped to catch a fugitive was entitled to a remission of six days the doctor took hugh ritson up on to the lead flat that covered his quarters from that altitude they could see over the prison wall to the rocky coast beyond near the ruins of the old church a gang of convicts were running to and fro waving their hands and shouting in wild excitement it's gang said the doctor jim the ladder's gang the sun had risen the sea was glistening in its million facets and into many a rolling wave a sea bird dipped its corded throat in the silvery water way there was something floating that looked as if it might have been a tub it was the wagon that the convict had driven into the water for a boat it will sink it's shod with thick hoops of iron said the doctor the convict could be seen standing in it he had thrown off his coat and cap and his sleeveless arms were bare to the armpits the civil guard ran to the cliff and fired one shot hit the man could be seen to tear the coarse linen shirt from his breast and bind it above the wrist why does he not crouch down said hugh ritson he did not know who this convict was but in his heart there was a feverish desire that the prisoner should escape he's a doomed man he's in the race it's flowing hard and he'll drift back to the island said the doctor half an hour later a posse of the civil guard with two assistant warders brought the recaptured fugitive into the governor's receiving office the stalwart fellow strode between the warders with a firm step and head erect he wore no jacket or cap and on one bare arm a strip of linen was roughly tied his breast was naked his eyes were aflame and save for a black streak of blood across the cheek his face was ashy pale but that man was not crushed by his misfortunes he seemed to crush them take that man's number said the governor ay take it and see you take it rightly said the convict it's b said the chief warder the governor consulted a paper that lay on his table send for the gentleman he said to an attendant it's well for you that you are wanted by the law officers of the crown he added turning to the prisoner the convict made no answer he was neither humble nor sullen his manner was frank but fierce and made almost brutal by a sense of wrong the next moment hugh ritson stepped into the office his eyes dropped and his infirm foot trailed heavily along the floor he twitched at his coat with nervous fingers his nostrils quivered his whole body trembled perceptibly this is the man said the chief warder with a deferential bow hugh ritson tried to raise his eyes but they fell suddenly he opened his lips to speak but the words would not come and meantime the wet soiled naked close cropped blood stained convict flanked by armed warders stood before him with head erect and eyes that searched his soul the convict rested one hand on his hip and pointed with the other at hugh ritson's abject figure what does this man want with me he said and his voice was deep at that hugh ritson broke in impetuously paul i will not outrage your sufferings by offering you my pity the officers looked into each other's faces i want none of your pity said the convict bitterly no it is i who need yours said hugh ritson in a low tone the convict laughed a hard laugh and turned to the warders here take me away i've had enough of this listen i have something to say to you something to do for you too the convict broke afresh into a laugh take me away will you what if i say i am sorry for the past said hugh then you are a hypocrite the convict answered hugh ritson drew himself up and took his breath audibly in one swift instant his face became discolored and his features pinched and rigid there was silence and then in a low broken tone he said paul you know well what sort of a man i am don't drive me too hard i have come here to do you a service remember your sufferings once again the convict broke into a cold laugh remember that others one other may be suffering with you the convict's haughty look fled like a flash of light here take me out of this he muttered in a low hoarse voice he took a step back but the guard closed around him i won't stand to listen to this man do you hear i won't listen he said hotly he has come to torture me that's all i have come to undo what i have done said hugh paul let me undo it don't rouse the bad part of me at this crisis of your life and mine the convict paused and said more quietly then it's your policy to undo it hugh ritson flinched the words had gone to his heart like a spear if he had dared to mask his motive that thrust would have left it naked i will not wrong the truth by saying i am a changed man he answered meekly my motive is my own but my act shall be all in all to you the convict's face lightened you have used me for your vengeance he said you shall not use me for your contrition also guards let me out let me out i tell you the governor interposed when you leave this room you go direct to the cells ay take me to your cells and let me lie there and die and rot said the convict take him away said the governor paul i beseech you to hear me cried hugh amid the clanking of the arms of the guard take him away the governor shouted again an hour after b was recalled to the receiving office he was quiet enough now we have an order respecting you from the secretary of state said the governor you are required to give evidence at a trial at two o'clock you leave portland for cumberland and your guard goes with you the convict bent his head and went out in silence chapter xv paul ritson let him be known by his official number no more was not taken to the punishment cells he was set to work with the stone dressing gang stationed near the gate of the prison the news of his attempt to escape had not spread more rapidly than rumors of his approaching departure i say shouted a hoary convict take a crooked message out what's your message on'y a word to the old girl telling her where she'll find a bunch of keys as she wants partic'lar write her yourself my man what and the governor read it and me get a bashing and the crushers pinch the old moll well i am surprised at ye but i forgot you're a straight man you are a mocking laugh followed this explanatory speech a young fellow with a pale meek face and the startled eyes of a hare crept close up to where paul ritson worked and took a letter out of one of his boots this is the last i had from home he said quietly and put the letter into paul's hands it was a soiled and crumpled paper so greasy from frequent handlings and so much worn by many foldings that the writing could scarcely be deciphered home it was dated from the union of liverpool and had come from his invalid wife and his children all living there the poor fellow could not read but he had somehow learned the letter by heart and was able to point out each bit of family history in the exact place where it was recorded he had lost his class privileges and was not allowed to reply and now he wanted to know if paul ritson could get down to liverpool and see his wife and little ones and tell them how well he was and how lusty he looked and what fine times he had of it just to keep up their spirits you know i say you sir bawled a sinister gray head the same whose conversation was overheard in church i hear as you're a employer of labor when yer not lagged any chance i wants to leave my sitivation long hours and grub reg'lar onsatisfactory besides my present employer insists on me wearing a collar with a number same as a wild beast or a bobby it's gettin' ridic'lus so i've give notice and i flit in september maybe ye see as i'm growing my wings to fly the hoary sinner pointed upward to his grizzly hair which was longer than the hair of his comrades on'y it's coming out another tint o' awrburn nor what it was ten years ago and the old woman won't have the same pride in my pussonal appearance at two o'clock the assistant warder known as jim the ladder marched paul ritson to the chief warder's office there the convict was handcuffed and the warder armed then they set out on the steamboat that plied between the portland ferry and weymouth the convict dress attracted much attention the day was some sort of chapel festival and great numbers of chapel people in holiday costume crowded the decks and climbed the paddle boxes the weather was brilliant the sun danced on the waters like countless fairies on a floor of glass a brass band played on the bridge again at the weymouth railway station the people gathered in little groups and looked askance at the convict during the few minutes which elapsed before the train left the platform a knot of spectators stood before the carriage and peered in at the window paul ritson paid little heed to these attentions but they were often unwelcome enough keep clear of him see the blue cap what an ill looking fellow to be sure his looks are enough to hang him paul laughed bitterly his heart felt cold within him at that moment if he had worn broadcloth and a smile how different the popular verdict might have been who then would have said that he was a villain certainly not yonder sleek minister of christ who was humming a psalm tune a moment ago and paused to whisper be sure your sin will find you out the black coated pharisee was handing a lady into a first class carriage the train started paul threw himself back in his seat and thought of all that had occurred since he made this journey before he was traveling in the other direction then and what an agony was that first experience of convict life he had never thought of it from that day to this other and more poignant memories had day after day obliterated the recollection of that experience but it came back now as freshly as if it had all occurred yesterday he was one of a gang of twenty who were traveling from millbank to dartmoor the journey to waterloo in the prison van had been a terrible ordeal he had thought in the cells that it would be nothing to him if people in the streets recognized him the shameful punishment of an innocent man was not his but the law's disgrace yet when he was marched out into the prison grounds abreast of a cadaverous wretch with shrunken brows and the eyes of a hawk an old thief in front of him and a murderer convicted of manslaughter treading on his heels the cold sweat burst in great beads from his forehead he had meant to hold up his head and if people looked into his face to look frankly back into their faces but when his turn came he leaped into the van and his chin buried itself in his breast then the crowds drawn up on the pavement outside as the gates rolled back and the van passed through the crush in a busy thoroughfare when the van stopped to let a line of crowded omnibuses go by the horrible scene at the station when the convicts were marched down the platform and every ear was arrested by the tramp tramp of twenty fettered men above all the jests and the laughter of the older hands who had served their time before and were superior to all small considerations of public shame i say you with the gig lamps toss a poor devil a bit o' 'bacco seen us afore in coorse you have you in the white choker look hard while yer at it and you'll know us again oh mother shipton and is that yourself and how pleased we is to see ye and just tip us yer welwet purse and we'll give it yer back when we're this way again and not all the rigor of the attendant warders was enough to suppress such jesting paul ritson could not forbear to laugh aloud when he remembered with what an agony of sweat he had that day crept back into his seat times had changed since then he had spent a year and a half in a government school and had been educated out of all torturing delicacy the warder attempted to draw him into conversation jim the ladder repeatedly protested that he bore no malice i'm a good fellow at bottom he said more than once and paul ritson showed no malice but he laughed bitterly at a grim and an obvious thought that the warder's dubious words suggested failing in his efforts at conciliation the warder charged his pipe and relapsed into a long silence they had a compartment to themselves at a station where the train stopped a man opened the door and had already put one foot into the carriage when he recognized the caste of his traveling companions he disappeared in a twinkling paul ritson did his best to restrain the anger that well nigh choked him he merely sent a ringing laugh after the retreating figure at another station a police inspector dressed in a little brief authority caught sight of the blue cap and gray jacket and bustled up to examine the warder's papers then with a lofty look he strode through the group of spectators whom his presence had attracted arrived at waterloo the warder hailed a cab and they drove to scotland yard to report themselves there they supped on cocoa and brown bread with the addition of a rasher of bacon and a pipe for the warder thence they were driven to euston to catch the nine o'clock train to penrith the journey north was uneventful at rugby stafford and elsewhere the train stopped and little groups of people looked in at the convict and made apposite comments on his appearance crime and condition paul ritson often shut his eyes and said nothing sometimes a sneer curled his lip sometimes he burst into a bitter laugh he was thinking that this was a fitting close to the degradation of his prison life if one feeling of delicacy one tender sentiment one impulse of humanity remained to him when the gates of portland closed behind him it only required this cruel torture to crush it forever in spite of the risk of dismissal and the more immediate danger at the hands of paul ritson the warder coiled himself up and fell asleep it was after midnight when they reached crewe and from that point of the journey the worst of the torment ceased their merciful fellow men were mostly in bed dreaming of heroic deeds that they were doing but the silence of night had its own torture as the train rumbled on through the darkness now rattling in a long tunnel now sliding into open air like a boat into still water paul ritson's mind went back to the day which seemed now to be so far away that it might have belonged to another existence when he traveled this road with the dear soul who had trusted her young and cloudless life to his keeping where was she now peace be with her wheresoever she was he recalled her tenderest glance he seemed to hear her softest tone the light pressure of her delicate fingers was now on his hands the hard hands that wore the irons and even at that moment when all his soul went out to the pure young wife who had shared his sufferings and he felt as if time and space were nothing as if he had drawn her to him by the power of his yearning love it seemed to him that all at once there rang in his ears the shrill sharp voices of the convicts rapping out their foul and frightful oaths he leaped to his feet with a muttered oath on his own lips and when the imagined agony with which he surprised himself had given way to a new sense of his actual sufferings his heart grew yet more cold and bitter he thought of what he had been and of what he was there could be no disguising the truth he was a worse man yes whatsoever had once been pure in him whatsoever had once been generous whatsoever had once been of noble aspiration was now impure and ungenerous and ignoble above all else he had lost that tenderness which is the top and crown of a strong man he felt as if the world had lifted its hand against him and as if he were ready and eager to strike back they reached penrith toward four in the morning and then the carriage in which they traveled was shunted on to the branch line to await the first train toward cockermouth the day was breaking from the window paul ritson could see vaguely the few ruins of the castle that familiar object touched him strangely he hardly knew why but he felt that a hard lump at his heart melted away by and by the brakeman shouted to the signalman in the gray silence of the morning the words were indifferent only some casual message but they were spoken in the broad cumbrian that for a year and a half had never once fallen on paul ritson's ear then the lump that had melted as his heart seemed to rise to his throat the gray light become intermingled with red and soon the sky to the east was aflame paul let down the carriage window and long waves of sweet mountain air laden with the smell of peat flowed in upon him his lips parted and his breast expanded at five o'clock the engine was attached a few carriages were added at the platform and these contained a number of pitmen in their red stained fustian going down for the morning shift when the train moved westward the sun had risen and all the air was musical with the songs of the birds very soon the train ran in among the mountains and then at last the bitterness of paul ritson's heart seemed to fall away from him like a garment that quick thrill of soul which comes when the mountains are first seen after a long absence is a rapture known to the mountaineer alone paul saw his native hills towering up to the sky the white mists flying off their bald crown the torrents leaping down their brant sides and the tears filled his eyes and blotted it all out the sedge warbler was singing with the wheatear and though he could not see them now he knew where they were the sedge warbler was flitting among the rushes of the low land mere the wheatear was perched on the crevice of gray rock in which it had laid its pale blue eggs the sheep were bleating on the fells and he knew their haunts by the lea of the bowlders and along the rocky ledges where grew the freshest grasses down the corries of blencathra long drifts of sheep were coming before the dogs and he knew that the shepherds had been out on the fells during the short summer night numbering the sheep for the washing in the beck below everything came back upon him like a memory of yesterday he stood up and thrust out his head and did not think of his gray jacket and blue cap until a carter who watered his horses at a pool near the railway lines started and stared as if he had seen a boggle at noonday then paul ritson remembered that he was still a convict that his hands wore irons that the man who lay sleeping on the seat of the carriage was his warder and that the steely thing that peeped from the belt of the sleeping man was a revolver to be promptly used if he attempted to escape but not even these reflections sufficed to dissipate the emotion that had taken hold of him he began at length to think of hugh ritson and to wonder why he had been brought back home home home it was a melancholy home coming but it was coming home nevertheless chapter xvi two days later the gray old town hall that stands in the market place of keswick was surrounded by a busy throng the civil court of the county assize was sitting in this little place for the nonce to try a curious case of local interest it was an action for ejectment brought by greta mrs paul ritson against a defendant whose name was entered on the sheet as paul drayton alias paul ritson now of the ghyll in the parish of newlands the court room was crowded it was a large bare room with a long table and two rows of chairs crossing the end the one row occupied by the judge and a special jury the other by the lawyers for the prosecution and defense the rest of the chamber was not provided with seats and there the dalespeople huddled together a seat had been found for greta at one end of the table her cheek rested on her hand she dropped her eyes as the spectators craned their necks to catch a glimpse of her behind her and with one hand on her chair back stood the old parson his jovian white head more white than of old the tenderer lines in his mellow face drawn down to a look of pain immediately facing greta at the opposite end of the table hugh ritson sat one leg was thrown over the other knee and the long nervous fingers of the right hand played with the shoelace his head was inclined forward and the thin pallid clean cut face with the great calm eyes and the full dilated nostrils was more than ever the face of a high bred horse none would have guessed the purpose with which hugh ritson sat there one would have said that indifference was in those eyes and on that brow indifference or despair near where the rustle was loudest and most frequent among the spectators drayton sat by the side of mr bonnithorne he was dressed in his favorite suit of broad plaid and had a gigantic orange lily stuck jauntily in his buttonhole his face was flushed and his eyes sparkled now and again he leaned back to whisper something to the blacksmith the miller and the landlord of the flying horse who were grouped behind him his remarks must have been wondrously facetious for they were promptly followed by a low gurgle which was as promptly suppressed the counsel for the plaintiff opened his case the plaintiff sued as the owner in succession to her husband who was at present dead to the law she contended that the man who now stood seized of the ghyll was not her husband paul ritson but paul drayton an innkeeper of hendon who bore him a strange personal resemblance and personated him the evidence of identity which should presently be adduced was full and complete in the essential particular of proving that the defendant was not paul ritson by whose title alone the defense would maintain the right of present possession unhappily the complementary evidence as to the actual identity of the defendant with paul drayton the publican had been seriously curtailed by the blindness followed by the death of an important witness still if he the counsel for the plaintiff could prove to the satisfaction of the jury that the defendant was not the man he represented himself to be they would have no course but to grant the ejectment for which the plaintiff asked to this end he would call two witnesses whose evidence must outweigh that of all others the wife of paul ritson and the clergyman who solemnized the marriage greta's name was called and she rose at the end of the table her bosom heaved under the small lace shawl that covered her shoulders and was knotted like a sailor's scarf on her breast she stood erect her eyes raised slightly and her drooping hands clasped in front after the customary formalities she was examined you are the only child of the late robert lowther i am the daughter of robert lowther drayton threw back his head and laughed a little you were married to paul ritson in at the parish church of newlands the minister being the reverend mr christian i was on the day of your marriage you accompanied your husband to london and the same night he left you at the convent of st margaret westminster that is quite true there was a buzz of conversation in the court accompanied by a whispered conference on the bench counsel paused to say that it was not a part of his purpose to trouble the court with an explanation of facts which were so extraordinary that they could only be credited on the oath of a person who though present would not be called at this reference hugh ritson raised his languid eyes and the examination proceeded three days afterward you received a message from your husband requesting you to meet him at st pancras station and return with him to cumberland by the midnight train i did who took you the message mrs drayton the old person at the inn at hendon you went to the station oh yes tell the court what occurred there just on the stroke of twelve when the train was about to leave a man whom at first sight i mistook for my husband came hurrying up the platform and i stepped into the carriage with him do you see that man in court yes he sits two seats to your right drayton rose smiled broadly bowed to the witness and resumed his seat were you alone in the compartment at first we were but just as the train was moving away who should join us but parson christian there was another buzz of conversation and counsel paused again to say that he should not trouble the court with an explanation of the extraordinary circumstances by which parson christian came to be in london at that critical moment these facts formed in themselves a chain of evidence which must yet come before a criminal court involving as it did the story of a conspiracy more painful and unnatural perhaps than could be found in the annals of jurisprudence tell the court what passed in the train i perceived at once that the man was not my husband though strangely like him in face and figure and when he addressed me as his wife i repulsed him did parson christian also realize the mistake oh yes but not quite so quickly what did you do we left the train at the first station at which it stopped did the defendant offer any resistance no he looked abashed and merely observed that perhaps a recent illness had altered him counsel for the defense at whose left mr bonnithorne sat as attorney for the defendant cross examined the witness you say that on the night following the morning of your marriage your husband left you at a convent i do mr bonnithorne dropped his twinkling eyes and muttered something that was inaudible to the witness there was a titter among the people who stood behind him and you say that mrs drayton took you the message of which you have spoken did she tell you that your husband had been ill she did we are to infer that you visited the house of the draytons at hendon a railway accident drove us there did any one accompany the defendant to st pancras that night my husband's brother mr hugh ritson was with him tell the jury where your husband now is if he is not at this moment in court no answer amid a profound silence the plaintiff's lawyer was understood to object to the question well we can afford to waive it said counsel with a superior smile one further question mrs ritson had you any misunderstanding with your husband none whatever will you swear that your voices were not raised in angry dispute while you were at the inn at hendon greta lifted her head and her eyes flashed yes i will swear it she said in a soft voice but with impressive emphasis mr bonnithorne reached up to the ear of counsel and was understood to say that perhaps the point was too delicate to be pressed parson christian was next examined the defendant in the present action was not the man whom he married to the plaintiff he had since seen paul ritson where in the convict prison of dartmoor in cross examination he was asked by what name the convict was known to the directors of dartmoor paul drayton then tell the court how you came to identify the defendant as drayton there were many facts pointing that way give us one on the morning of the marriage i found a letter lying open before the fire in my vestry it was from mr hugh ritson to mr bonnithorne and it mentioned the name of drayton in a connection which by the light of later revelations provoked many inferences mr bonnithorne was unprepared for this answer counsel looked at him inquiringly but the attorney glanced down and colored deeply can you show us the letter no i left it where i found it then it can hardly be received as evidence the attorney smiled and the tension of drayton's face relaxed there was a slight shuffle among the people the witness had stepped back counsel for the defense opened his case they were asked to believe that the defendant in the present action was paul drayton in the teeth of the fact that paul drayton was at that moment a convict in a convict prison the incredible statement was made that a newly married husband had placed his young wife in a convent on the night of their marriage and that when they should have rejoined each other an interchange had been made the husband going to prison in another man's name the other man coming to cumberland to claim the place of the woman's husband moreover they were asked to believe that the husband's brother mr hugh ritson had either been fooled by the impostor or made a party to the imposture happily it was easy to establish identity by two unquestionable chains of evidence resemblance and memory it would be shown that the defendant could be none other than paul ritson first because he resembled him exactly in person second because he knew all that paul ritson ought to know third because he knew nothing that paul ritson might not know no two men's lives had ever been the same from the beginning of the world and as it would be seen that the defendant's life had been the same as paul ritson's it followed that paul ritson and the defendant were one and the same man dick o' the syke was the first witness examined for the defense he swore that paul ritson was active in extinguishing a fire that broke out in the mill two years ago that he had climbed to the cross trees with a hatchet and that within the past month the defendant had described to him the precise locality and shape of the gap made in the roof by the fire no one could have known so much except himself and the man who stood on the cross trees that man was paul ritson and he was there and then recognized by many spectators among whom was parson christian the next witness was mistress calvert of the pack horse paul ritson had slept at their house one night two years ago and a few days since the present defendant had pointed out the bedroom he occupied and recalled the few words of conversation which passed between them natt the stableman was called his sleepy eyes blinked knowingly as he explained that one winter's night when the snow fell heavily mrs ritson then miss greta was startled by what she mistook for the ghost of paul ritson the witness had not been so easily deceived and the defendant had since described to him the exact scene and circumstances of what the lady had thought to be the ghostly appearance then followed john proudfoot the blacksmith tom o' dint the postman giles raisley the pitman job sheepshanks the mason and tommy lowthwaite the landlord of the flying horse all swearing to points of identity one recalled the fact that paul ritson had a scar on his head that was caused by the kick of a horse when he was a boy the defendant had just such a scar another remembered that paul ritson had a mark on the sole of his right foot which had been made by treading on a sharp piece of rock on hindscarth the defendant had exactly such a mark a third had wrestled with paul ritson and knew that he had a mole beneath the left shoulder blade on the back the defendant had a mole in that unusual place counsel for the defense smiled blandly at the special jury the special jury smiled blandly at counsel for the defense was it really necessary that the defendant should be called surely it was a pity to occupy the time of the court the whole case was in a nutshell the lady had quarreled with her husband state of affairs would be promptly gauged when it was explained that this action had been raised to anticipate a forthcoming suit in the divorce court for restitution of connubial rights the counsel for the plaintiff smiled also and his was a weak smile of conscious defeat he stammered a desire to withdraw said he had been promised more conclusive evidence when he undertook the case and sat down with an apologetic air there was a shuffle of feet in the court drayton had risen to receive the congratulations of his friends behind him and the cordial nods of some of the superior people who had been favored with seats at the right hand and left of the judge he was answering in a loud tone when there was a sudden lull of the buzz of gossip and all eyes were directed toward one end of the table hugh ritson had risen from his seat and with a face that was very pale but as firm as a rock he was engaged in a whispered conference with the plaintiff's counsel that gentleman's eager face betrayed the keenest possible interest in what he heard presently he lifted his arm with an impatient gesture and said my lord i have unexpectedly come into possession of new and most important evidence of what nature asked the judge if it is conceivable said counsel that in any question of personal identity the court will accept the evidence of all the tinkers and tailors the riff raff the raggabash of the country side and reject that of the wife of the man whose estate is in question perhaps it will be allowed that there are three persons who are essential to this examination the brother of paul ritson the defendant who claims to be paul ritson and the convict who is suffering penal servitude in the name of paul drayton i might name one other whose evidence might be yet more conclusive than that of any of these alone the mother of paul ritson but she is unhappily dead to the world drayton was still on his feet riveted to the spot where he stood obtuse as he was he saw at a glance what had occurred in all his calculations this chance had never suggested itself that hugh ritson would risk the personal danger to bring him down can you put these persons into the witness box my lord it is i presume within the liberties of the defendant to keep carefully out of that box but the court will not refuse to hear the evidence of the two persons of whom i speak the brother of paul ritson and the convict known as paul drayton at this there was high commotion greta had leaned back in her chair her bosom heaving her face shadowed by lines of pain parson christian stood behind her with a blank expression of bewilderment drayton's brows were tightened and his lips were drawn hard none of their criss crossin' for me he muttered you can ask for a new trial said the judge my lord another case is pending and on the issue in this case the other case must largely depend how far has the present one proceeded the defendant's case is not yet completed during this scene hugh ritson had stood quietly by the table he remained there with complete self possession while counsel proceeded to explain that four days ago in anticipation of this action and of another that had been threatened a statutory declaration had been made in the presence of the home secretary and the law officers of the crown the first result of that statement was that the convict drayton was now present in the court house ready to appear at this trial the judge signified his desire that the convict might be brought in and heard hugh ritson motioned to a tall man who stood near and immediately afterward a door was thrown open and another man stepped into the court room every eye was fixed upon him he wore a convict's gray jacket with the round badge marked b p s and the broad arrow beneath his face was pale and rigid his large eyes glittered he was in his full manhood but his close cropped hair was slightly tinged with gray he pushed his way through the people who fell back to let him pass when he reached the table he tapped it impatiently with one of his hands which were fettered and threw up his head with a glance of defiance his whole bearing was that of a strong man who believed that every man's hand was against him and who intended to let it be seen that his own hand was against every man's counsel rose again and asked that the defendant's witnesses might be recalled this was done john proudfoot job sheepshanks thomas lowthwaite giles raisley look this way who is this man there was a dead hush then one by one the men who had been named shook their heads they did not know the convict indeed he was terribly altered the ordeal of the past two years had plowed strange lines in his face at that moment he was less like himself than was the impostor who came there to personate him hugh ritson's manner did not change only a slight curl of the lip betrayed his feelings counsel continued is there any one in court who recognizes him not a voice responded all was silence will the defendant stand side by side with him drayton leaped up with a boisterous laugh and swaggered his way to the opposite side of the table as he approached the convict looked at him keenly will mrs ritson come forward again greta had already risen and was holding parson christian's hand with a nervous grip she stepped apart and going behind the two men she came to a stand between them on the one side stood drayton with a smirking face half turned toward the spectators on the other stood the convict his hands bound before him his defiant glance softened to a look of tenderness and his lips parted with the unuttered cry that was ready to burst from them greta said hugh ritson in a low tone of indescribable pathos which of these men is your husband counsel repeated the question in form greta had slowly raised her eyes from the ground until they reached the convict's face then in an instant in a flash of light with the quick cry of a startled bird she flung herself on his neck her fair head dropped on the frieze of the convict's jacket and her sobs were all that broke the silence hugh ritson's emotion surged in his throat but he stood quietly at the table only his slight figure swayed a little and his face quivered his work was not yet done this is the answer of nature he said quietly hugh ritson was put into the witness box and in a voice that was full and strong and that penetrated every corner of the court he identified the convict as his brother paul ritson counsel for the defense had seemed to be stunned recovering himself he tried to smile and said after this melodramatic interlude perhaps i may be allowed to ask our new witness a few questions did you at the central criminal court held at the old bailey in swear that the person who stands here in the dress of a convict was not paul ritson i did now for my second question did you also swear that the defendant was your brother and therefore not paul drayton i did then you were guilty of perjury at that time or you are guilty of perjury now i was guilty of perjury then the judge interposed and asked if the witness was awakened to the enormity of the crime to which he confessed hugh ritson bent his head are you conscious that you are rendering yourself liable to penal servitude i have signed a declaration of my guilt the answers were given in perfect calmness but a vein of pathos ran through every word do you know that a few years back many a poor wretch whose crime was trifling compared with yours has gone from the dock to the gallows my guilt is unmitigated guilt i make a voluntary statement i am not here to appeal for mercy there was the hush of awe in the court the face of the convict wore an expression of amazement counsel smiled again i presume you know that the effect of the law officers of the crown believing the story that you tell us now is that if they do so the man whom you call your brother will be put into possession of the estate of which your late father died seized he is entitled to it counsel turned to the jury with a smile it is always necessary to find some standard by which to judge of human actions the witness quarreled with the defendant four days ago and this is his revenge but i appeal to the court is this story credible is it not a palpable imposture the judge again interposed men do not risk so much for a lie the witness knows that when the court rises the sheriff may take him into custody at this counsel rose again and asked the bench not to play into the hands of the witness by apprehending him let the convict be examined said the judge paul ritson raised his head greta sunk into a chair beneath him he was not sworn the warder in charge put in an entry from the books of the prison it ran paul drayton five feet eleven inches brown hair and eyes aged thirty licensed victualer born in london convicted of robbery at the scene of a railway accident does that entry properly describe you asked the judge the convict's eyes wandered what's going on he said in a tone of bewilderment attend my man are you paul ritson the eldest son of the late allan ritson why do you want to know said the convict it befits a witness who is permitted to come from the scene of a degrading punishment to give a prompt and decisive answer what is your name sir find it out my man said the judge more suavely we sit here in the name of the law and the law could wish to stand your friend the convict laughed bitterly pray help us to a decision in the present perplexing case by a few frank answers if you are paul drayton you go back to portland to complete the term of your imprisonment if it can be proved that you are paul ritson your case will be laid before the home officials with the result that you will be liberated and re established in your estate first of all which is your name paul drayton or paul ritson the convict did not answer at first then he said in a low tone no law can re establish me the judge added bethink you if you are paul ritson and an innocent man the law can restore you to your young wife visibly moved by this reference the convict's eyes wandered to where greta sat beside him and the tension of his gaze relaxed the judge began again you have been recognized by two witnesses one claiming to be your brother the other to be your wife as paul ritson are you that person the convict's face showed the agony he suffered in a vague uncertain puzzled way he was thinking of the consequences of his answer if he said he was paul ritson it seemed to him that it must leak out that he was not the eldest legitimate son of his father then all the fabric of his mother's honor would there and then tumble to the ground he recalled his oath could he pronounce six words and not violate it no not six syllables how those mouthing gossips would glory to see a good name trailed in the dust are you paul ritson the eldest son and heir of allan ritson the convict looked again at greta she rose to her feet beside him all her soul was in her face and cried answer answer i can not answer said the convict in a loud piercing voice at that terrible moment his strength seemed to leave him he sunk backward into the chair from which greta had risen she stood over him and put her hand tenderly on his head tell them it is true she pleaded tell them you are my husband tell them so oh tell them tell them she cried in a tone of piteous supplication he raised to hers his weary eyes with a dumb cry for mercy from the appeal of love only hugh ritson of all who were there present understood what was in the convict's heart paul ritson is the rightful heir of his father and his mother's legitimate son he muttered audibly the convict turned to where his brother sat and looked at him with a face that seemed to grapple for the missing links of a chain of facts counsel for the defense arose it will be seen that the unhappy convict witness will not be used as an instrument of deception he said he is paul drayton and can not be made to pretend that he is paul ritson the hush of awe in the court was broken by the opening of a door behind the bench two women stood on the threshold one of them was small wrinkled and old she was mrs drayton the other was a nun in hood and cape she was sister grace hugh ritson leaned toward counsel for the plaintiff who promptly rose and said the witness i spoke of as dead to the world is now present in the court amid a buzz of conversation the nun was handed to the table she raised her long veil and showed a calm pale face after the usual formalities counsel addressed her mrs ritson he said tell us which of the two men who sit opposite is your son sister grace answered in a clear soft voice both are my sons the convict is paul ritson my son by allan ritson the other is paul lowther my son by an unhappy alliance with robert lowther drayton jumped to his feet there that's enough of this he shouted excitedly damme if i can stand any more of it bonnithorne reached over and whispered mad man what are you doing hold your tongue it's all up there's the old woman too come to give me away here i say i'm paul drayton that's what i am if you want to know let the sheriff take that man before a justice of the peace said the judge it was you that led me into this mess shouted drayton at bonnithorne only for you i would have been in australia by this time let the sheriff apprehend mr bonnithorne also said the judge as for you sir he continued turning to hugh ritson i will report your evidence to the public prosecutor who must be in possession of your statutory declaration and leave the law officers to take their own course with regard to you the action for ejectment was adjourned drayton and bonnithorne did not trouble the world much longer within a month they were tried and condemned together the one for personation both for conspiracy paul ritson was removed in charge of his warder to be confined in the town jail pending the arrival of instructions from the secretary of state hugh ritson walked out of the court room a free man chapter xvii hugh ritson returned to his room on the pit brow on his way there he passed a group of people congregated on the bridge at the town end they fell apart as he walked through but not an eye was raised to his and not one glance of recognition came from his stony face toward the middle of the afternoon a solicitor came from carlisle and executed a bill of sale on the machinery and general plant the same evening as the men on the day shift came up the shaft and those on the night shift were about to go below the wages were paid down to the last weights taken at the pit mouth then hugh ritson closed his doors and began afresh his melancholy perambulation of the room that night it was wednesday night as darkness fell on the mountain and moorland there was a great outcry in the vale it started at the pit mouth and was taken up on every side in less than a quarter of an hour a hundred people men women and children were gathered about the head of the shaft there had been a run of sand in the pit and some of the hands were imprisoned in the blocked up workings cries moans and many sounds of weeping arose on the air in one dismal chorus i knew it would come i telt the master lang ago where's my man and mine and my poor barn no'but fifteen anybody seen my willie is that thee robbie ma lad no as every cageful of men and boys came to the surface there was a rush of mothers wives and fathers to recognize their own hugh ritson went out and pushed his way through the people where is the sand running he asked of a pitman just landed in the sandy vein answered the man then the shaft is clear ay but the water's blocked in the main working and it's not safe to go down hugh ritson had taken the man's candle out of his hand and was fixing it with the putty in the front of his own hat are you ready he shouted to the engine man above the babel of voices in another moment he had stepped into the cage and looped down the iron rail in front of it there was a moment's silence among the panic stricken people as the cage began to move downward at the bottom of the shaft a group of men waited to ascend their faces were lurid in the dim light before the cage grounded hugh ritson could hear their breathing how many of you are left he asked no'but two now giles raisley and auld reuben answered one of the men the others without heeding the master's question had scrambled into the cage and were already knocking the signal for the ascent hugh ritson turned toward the working known among the men as the sandy vein the cage was now rising and the pitman who had spoken found himself left on the pit bottom the single moment that he had given to the master had lost him his chance of a place he cast one stern glance upward and a muttered oath was on his lips at the next instant he had taken the direction followed by hugh ritson and was walking one pace behind him in the silence the dull thud of their footsteps on the rock beneath mingled with the drip drip of the water overhead when they had gone a hundred yards down the narrow working there came another and far more terrible sound it was such a sound as the sea might have made if it had rushed through a thousand crevices in the rock it was the sound of the thousands of tons of sand as they forced their way from the dense mass above and over the hiss as of the sea was the harsh crack of great timbers splitting like matchwood toward the awful scene of this tumult hugh ritson quickened his steps the man followed close at his heels presently their passage was blocked with sand like a wall then over their heads the cross trees cracked and the upright forks split and bent at the right and left of them in another moment the ground beneath them shook under the new weight that lay on it they stepped quickly back and in an instant with a groan such as the sea makes when it is sucked by the ebbing tide from a cave in a rock the floor with all its freight went down a score of feet it had fallen to an old working that lay below then the bent forks hung from the roof in empty air silence followed this shock and through the silence there came a feeble cry for help hugh ritson stepped out plucked his candle from his hat and held it before his feet where are you he called and his voice came back through the echoing depths beyond presently a man could be dimly seen clinging to a cross piece in an alcove made for an air shaft from the main working to get to him the treacherous ground must be crossed with its cracking roof through which the sand slid even yet and under the split timbers that still creaked hugh ritson did not hesitate he turned to leap down saying follow me but the man clung to him from behind for god's sake dunnot he cried i can not go there it's mair nor my life is worth hugh ritson twisted about and looked him steadily in the face what is your name my man davey braithwaite then you are the young fellow whose wife died last week ey with a drooping head your child died before her did it not ey he did poor laal thing your father and mother are gone too they're gone for sure and you have neither kith nor kin left in all the world nay no'but mysel' left hugh ritson said no more a hard smile played on his white face and at the next instant he had leaped down on to the bed of sand below the man recoiled a pace or two and wrung his hands before he was aware of what had happened giles raisley and the master were standing beside him where were old reuben and his gang stationed said hugh ritson in the main working but the water is dammed up we can never pass they returned to the shaft bottom and walked thence down the cutting that ran from it at right angles a light burned far away in the dim vista of that long dark burrowing it was a candle stuck to the rock the men who worked by it had left it there when they rushed off for their lives through the bottom of this working there ran a deep trough but it was now dry this was the channel by which the whole pit was drained beyond the light the three men encountered another wall of sand and from behind it and through it there came to them the dull thud and the plash of heavy water if auld reuben's theer he's a dead man said giles raisley and he turned to go hugh ritson had struggled to the top of the heap and was plowing the sand away from the roof with his hands in a little while he had forced an opening and could see into the dark space beyond the water had risen to a reservoir of several feet deep but it was still four or five feet from the roof and over the black surging bubbling waves the imprisoned miner could be seen clinging to a ledge of rock half his body was already immersed when the candle shot its streak of light through the aperture of sand the poor creature uttered a feeble cry in another moment the master had wormed his body through the hole and dropped slowly into the water wading breast deep he reached the pitman gave him his hand and brought him safely through the closing seam when the cage rose to the surface again bringing back to life and the world the last of the imprisoned miners a great cheer broke from many a lusty throat women who had never thought to bless the master blessed him now with fervent tongues men who had thought little of the courage that could rest in that slight figure fell aside at the sense of their own cowardice under the red glow that came from the engine fire many a hard face melted hugh ritson saw little of this and heeded it not at all he plucked the candle still burning from his hat and threw it aside then he walked through the people toward his room and when he got there he shut the door almost slamming it in the faces of those who followed he pulled down the window blinds and began afresh his perambulation to and fro he had grown paler and thinner there was a somber light in his eyes and his lips were whitening his step once quick and sure despite his infirmity was now less certain he had not slept since the night of mercy's death determined never to encounter again the pains and terrors of sleep he had walked through the long hours of the four succeeding nights he knew what the result must be and did not shrink from it once only he had thought of a quicker way to the sure goal that was before him then he had opened a cupboard and looked long and intently at a bottle that he took from its shelf but he had put the bottle back why should he play the fool and leap the life to come thus night after night he had walked and walked never resting never pausing though the enfeebled limbs shook beneath him and the four walls of the room reeled in his dazed eyes before returning to their homes the people gathered in the darkness about the office on the pit brow and gave one last cheer the master heard them and his lip curled simpletons they don't understand he muttered beneath his breath and continued his melancholy walk next morning a banksman who acted as personal attendant on hugh ritson brought him his breakfast it was not early the sun had risen but the blinds of the office were still drawn and a candle burned on the table the man would have put out the candle and let in the sunlight but the master forbid him he was a methodist and hummed psalm tunes as he went about his work this morning he was more than usually fresh and happy when he entered with his tray but at the sight of hugh ritson's pallid face his own face saddened you are a young man yet luke said the master let me see how old are you seventy nine sir i was born in ninety eight that was when auld bonnypart was agate of us and nelson bashed him up i dare say you have grandchildren by this time bless you ey and great grandchilder and ten of them too and all well and hearty thank the lord the sound of a bell slowly tolling came from across the dale hugh ritson's face contracted and his eyes fell what bell is that he asked in an altered tone it's like to be the church bell they're burying poor auld matha's lass and her wee barn this morning hugh ritson did not touch his breakfast luke close the shutters he said and bring more candles he did not go out that day but continued to walk to and fro in the darkened room toward nightfall he grew feverish and rang frequently the bell that summoned the banksman he had only some casual order some message some unimportant explanation at length the old man understood his purpose and settled himself there for the night they talked much during the early hours and often the master laughed and jested but the atmosphere that is breathed by a sleepless man is always heavy with sleep and in spite of his efforts to keep awake luke dozed away in his chair then for hours there was a gloomy silence broken only by the monotonous footfall within and the throb of the engine without the next day friday the sun shone brilliantly but the shutters of the little house on the pit brow remained closed and the candle still burned on the table hugh ritson had grown perceptibly feebler yet he continued his dreary walk the old banksman was forbidden to send for a doctor but he contrived to dispatch a messenger for parson christian that night he watched with the master again when the conversation failed he sung first a psalm of david the fool hath said in his heart there is no god then a revival hymn of charles wesley about ransom by christ's blood it would have been a strange spectacle to strange eyes the old man young still though seventy nine dear to troops of dear ones encircled in his age by love and honor living in poverty that was abundance with faith that was itself the substance of things hoped for his simple face ruddier and mellower than before rocking his head and singing in the singleness of his heart the other man barely thirty yet already old having missed his youth his thin cheeks pallid as linen his eyes burning with a somber light alone in the world desolate apart walking with an uncertain step and a tremor of the whole frame which seemed to lurch for poise and balance yet swinging his arms with the sweep of the melody and smiling a forced smile through his hard and whitened lips when the singing ceased hugh ritson paused suddenly and turned to the old banksman luke he said abruptly i suppose there will be many to follow you when your time comes ey please god answered the banksman dashing away a furtive drop that had rolled on to his cheek there'll be my childer and my childer's childer and their childer forby maybe the barns will lay me behind the mother poor auld body hugh ritson's face darkened and he resumed his walk tut what matter he asked himself the night winds are enough to moan over a man's grave and he laughed a little next morning saturday morning he wrote a letter and sent luke to the village to post it then he attended to some business relating to the pit after that he shut the door and bolted it when the old man brought the midday meal he knocked in vain and had to go away night closed in and still there came no answer to the old man's knock when the sun had set the wind had risen it threatened to be a tempestuous night toward ten o'clock parson christian arrived he had wrestled long with his own heart as to what course it was his duty to take he had come at last in answer to the banksman's summons and now he knocked at the door there was no answer the wind was loud in the trees overhead but he could hear the restless footfall within he knocked again and yet again then the bolt was drawn and a voice at once strange and familiar cried come in parson christian he had not called or spoken the parson entered when his eyes fell on hugh ritson's face he shuddered as he had never shuddered before many a time he had seen death in a living face but never anything like this the livid cheeks were stony the white lips were drawn hard the somber eyes burned like a deep slow fire the yellow hands were gaunt and restless there was despair on the contracted brow but no repentance and the enfeebled limbs trembled but still shuffled on on on on through their longer journey than from gabbatha to golgotha the very atmosphere of the room breathed of death let me pray with you said the parson softly and without any other words he went down on his knees ay pray for me pray for me but you lose your labor nothing can save me let us call on god said the parson a bitter laugh broke from hugh ritson's lips what and take to him the dregs and rinsings of my life no the blood of christ has ransomed the world it can save the worst sinner of us all and turn away the heavy wrath of god hugh ritson broke again into a bitter laugh the end has come of sin as of trouble no matter then with an awful solemnity he added my soul is barren it is already given over to the undying worm i shall die to morrow at sunrise no man knows the day nor the hour hugh ritson repeated with a fearful emphasis i shall die as the sun rises on sunday morning parson christian remained with him the weary night through the wind moaned and howled outside it licked the walls as with the tongues of serpents the parson prayed fervently but hugh ritson's voice never once rose with his to and fro to and fro the dying man continued his direful walk at one moment he paused and said with a ghastly smile this dying is an old story it has been going on every day for six thousand years and yet we find it as terrible as ever toward three in the morning he threw open the shutters the windows were still dark it seemed as if the dawn were far away it is coming he said calmly i knew it must come soon let us go out to meet it with infinite effort he pulled his ulster over his shoulders put on his hat and opened the door where are you going said the parson and his voice broke to the top of the fell why there hugh ritson turned his heavy eyes upon him to see the new day dawn he said with an awful pathos he had already stepped out into the gloom parson christian followed him they took the path that led through the moor end to the foot of cat bells the old man offered his arm but hugh ritson shook his head and walked one pace ahead it was a terrible journey the wind had dropped in the air the night and day commingled the dying man struggled along with the firm soul of a stricken lion step by step and with painful labor they ascended the bare side of the fell in the gray light of morning they reached the top at last below them the moorland lay dark and mute the mist was around them they seemed to stand on an islet of the clouds in front the day break was bursting the confines of the bleak racks of cloud then the day came in its wondrous radiance and flooded the world in a vast ocean of light on the mountain brow hugh ritson resumed his melancholy walk the old parson muttered as if to himself wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro wilt thou pursue the dry stubble hugh ritson overheard the words and all his manner changed the stubborn lips softened the somber eye melted the contracted brow relaxed and for the first time in all this length of years he cried like a little child at the same instant the sun swept up and he fell parson christian bent over him the crimson of the east twas reflected on his white face the new day had dawned on the tuesday following two mourners stood by an open grave in the church yard of newlands one of them was white headed the other wore the jacket and cap the badge and broad arrow of a convict the sexton and his man had lowered the coffin to its last home and then stepped aside a tall man leaned on the lych gate and a group of men and women stood in silence by the porch of the church the afternoon sun was low and the shadows of the tombstones stretched far on the grass the convict went down on his knees and looked long into the grave when he arose the company that had gathered about the porch had gone and voices singing a hymn came from within the old church it was the village choir practicing the world's work had begun again chapter xviii two days later the fell behind the ghyll was a scene of unusual animation it was the day of the shearing the sheep visibly whiter and more fleecy for a washing of some days before had been gathered into stone folds clippers were seated on creels ranged about a turf fire over which a pot of tar hung from a triangle of boughs boy catchers brought up the sheep one by one and girl helpers carried away the fleeces hot and odorous and hung them over the open barn doors as the sheep were stripped they were tugged to the fire and branded from the bubbling tar with the smet mark of the ritsons the metallic click of the shears was in the air and over all was the blue sky and the brilliant sunshine in a white overall stained with patches of tar and some streaks of blood smudged with soap and scraps of the clinging wool parson christian moved among the shearers applying plentiful doses of salve from a huge can to the snips made in the skin of the sheep by the accidents of the shears we might have waited for the maister afore shearing eh said reuben from one of the creels he'll be here before we finish please the lord answered the parson is it to day you're to gang for him yes this afternoon a daub on this leg parson where she kicked deuced take her it's like you'll bring him home in a car ay randal alston has loaned me his mare why man what a upshot we'll have for sure bacon pie and veal and haggis and top stannin pie and puddings i reckon just a hand to her leg parson while i strip the coat and waistcoat off this black faced herdwick is the mistress to come home too nay reuben mrs ritson has gone back to where she came from weel it's no'but naturable after all that's happent easy now be quiet wilta dusta want another snip eh and young mistress greta it's like she'll be mistress now it's very likely she'll come to the ghyll with her husband reuben god bless her and there's been no luck on the land since he left it and everything a fault too there she's stripped away with her natt man and de'il tak' her in the afternoon a vast crowd of men women and children had gathered once more about the old town hall at keswick they laughed and bantered and sung presently the door of the hall was thrown open and two men came out one was paul ritson no longer clad as a convict the other was parson christian the people hailed them with a mighty shout lifted them into a gig that was drawn up in the market place took out the horses and crowded into the shafts then they set off with a great cheer through the town and the country road the dust rising in clouds behind them they took the road to the west of the valley and as they passed under the wood an old man much bent was easing a smoking fire in the charcoal pit he paused and raised himself his iron rod in his hand and lifted his heavy eyes toward the clamorous company the gig flew past with its shouts its cheers and its noisy laughter and the old man turned silently back to his work when they came near to the vicarage paul leaped from the carriage over the heads of the men who pulled it vaulted the gate and bounded into the house there was one who waited for him there and in an instant she was locked close in his arms at last he whispered her heart overflowed she dropped her fair young head on his heaving breast and wept sweet tears parson christian came rolling up the path surrounded by a tumultuous throng foremost and lustiest were the blacksmith and the miller and close behind came the landlord and the postman all were shouting as if their brassy throats might crack there was high revel at the ghyll that evening first came the feasting in the old kitchen huge rounds of beef quarters of lamb pease and sweet puddings and pies then came the dancing in the barn lighted by candles in cloven sticks and lanterns of turnips that were scooped out hollow but at the vicarage paul and greta sat alone in silence and with clasped hands parson christian came in and out at intervals gossiping cheerily of the odds and ends of daily life as if its even tenor had never been disturbed they supped together and sat on till midnight and then the old christian took down his green tome and wrote june so paul being to return home after his long absence i spent the forenoon on the fell shearing and earned a stone of wool and a windle of rye in the afternoon i set forward toward keswick wherefor randal alston had loaned me his mare and gig at the flying horse i lighted not but stood while i drank a pot of ale with john proudfoot and richard parkinson and a neighbor that comes to morrow to thatch the low barn for me then direct to keswick where there was a great concourse and a hearty welcome and much rejoicings that warmed me and came nigh to break me withal got son paul at last and would have driven direct home but the good folk were not minded that it should be so and naught would do but that they must loose the mare and run in the shafts so we reached home about six and found all well and my love greta after long waiting in her closet very busy with paul who had run in ahead of me so i went out again and foddered and watered the mare for peter is sometimes a sad fatch and will not always give a horse what is worth its trouble in the eating and being thrang this evening a mending the heels of my old clock boots with lath nails whereof i bought a pennyworth at thomas seed's shop in the market place i saw little of paul but left him to greta then supped and read a psalm and prayed in my family and sat till full midnight so i retire to my lodging room at peace with all the world and commend my all to god the lord forgive the sins of me and mine that we have committed in these our days of trial blessed be god who has wrought our victory and overcome our enemies and brought us out more than conquerors amen parson christian had put down the pen and was sprinkling the writing with sand from a pepper castor when brother peter came in with candles in his hand and a letter under his abridged arm laal tom o' dint gave me this for thee he said to paul and dropped the letter on to his knees i was sa thrang with all their bodderments that i don't know as i didna forget it parson christian returned the green clad book to its shelf took up his candle bid good night and went to bed brother peter shambled out and then paul and greta were left alone paul opened the letter it was inclosed in a sheet of paper that bore the stamp of the convent of st margaret and these words only sent on by sister grace paul began to read the letter aloud greta looking over his shoulder but as he proceeded his voice faltered and then he stopped then in silence the eyes of both traversed the written words they ran mother i have wronged you deeply and yours is a wrong that may never be repaired the past does not return and what is done is done with it is not allowed to us to raze out the sins and the sufferings of the days that are gone they stand and will endure i am not so bad a man as perhaps i seem but of what avail is it to defend myself now and who would believe me my life has been one long error and the threads of my fate have been tangled have i not passed before our little world for a stern and callous man yet the blight of my soul has been passion yearning for love where love could never be returned i am the ruins of what i might have been if i did wrong knowingly it was not until passion mastered me if i saw things as they did not exist it was because passion made me blind mother if there is one above to watch and judge our little lives surely he sees this and reckons the circumstances with the deed tell her that i wish her peace if i were a man used to pray perhaps i would ask heaven to bless her but my heart is barren of prayer and what after all boots my praying i have given her back at last to the love of a noble man and now my wasted life is done and this is the end a sorry end mother i shall not live to suffer the earthly punishment of my crime never fear my hand shall not be lifted against myself be sure of that whatever else may seem doubtful but very soon this passionate and rebellious soul will stand for judgment before its awaiting god farewell my mother farewell
