the blind mother and the last confession by hall caine hall caines best books in three volumes volume ii the bondman the blind mother the last confession illustrated p f collier son new york the blind mother i the vale of newlands lay green in the morning sunlight the river that ran through its lowest bed sparkled with purple and amber the leaves prattled low in the light breeze that soughed through the rushes and the long grass the hills rose sheer and white to the smooth blue lake of the sky where only one fleecy cloud floated languidly across from peak to peak out of unseen places came the bleating of sheep and the rumble of distant cataracts and above the dull thud of tumbling waters far away was the thin caroling of birds overhead but the air was alive with yet sweeter sounds on the breast of the fell that lies over against cat bell a procession of children walked and sang and chattered and laughed it was st peters day and they were rushbearing little ones of all ages from the comely girl of fourteen just ripening into maidenhood who walked last to the sweet boy of four in the pinafore braided with epaulets who strode along gallantly in front most of the little hands carried rushes but some were filled with ferns and mosses and flowers they had assembled at the schoolhouse and now on their way to the church they were making the circuit of the dale they passed over the road that crosses the river at the head of newlands and turned down into the path that follows the bed of the valley at that angle there stands a little group of cottages deliciously cool in their whitewash nestling together under the heavy purple crag from which the waters of a ghyll fall into a deep basin that reaches to their walls the last of the group is a cottage with its end to the road and its open porch facing a garden shaped like a wedge as the children passed this house an old man gray and thin and much bent stood by the gate leaning on a staff a collie with the sheeps dog wooden bar suspended from its shaggy neck lay at his feet the hum of voices brought a young woman into the porch she was bareheaded and wore a light print gown her face was pale and marked with lines she walked cautiously stretching one hand before her with an uncertain motion and grasping a trailing tendril of honeysuckle that swept downward from the roof her eyes which were partly inclined upward and partly turned toward the procession had a vague light in their bleached pupils she was blind at her side and tugging at her other hand was a child of a year and a halfa chubby sunny little fellow with ruddy cheeks blue eyes and fair curly hair prattling laughing singing snatches and waving their rushes and ferns above their happy thoughtless heads the children rattled past when they were gone the air was empty as it is when the lark stops in its song after the procession of children had passed the little cottage at the angle of the roads the old man who leaned on his staff at the gate turned about and stepped to the porch did the boy see themdid he see the children said the young woman who held the child by the hand i mak na doot said the old man he stooped to the little one and held out one long withered finger the soft baby hand closed on it instantly did he laugh i thought he laughed said the young woman a bright smile played on her lips maybe so lass ralphie has never seen the children before father didnt he look frightenedjust a little bit frightenedat first you know i thought he crept behind my gown maybe maybe the little one had dropped the hand of his young mother and still holding the bony finger of his grandfather he toddled beside him into the house very cool and sweet was the kitchen with whitewashed walls and hard earthen floor a table and a settle stood by the window and a dresser that was an armory of bright pewter dishes trenchers and piggins crossed the opposite wall nay but sista here laal lad said the old man and he dived into a great pocket at his side have you brought it is it the kitten oh dear let the boy see it a kitten came out of the old mans pocket and was set down on the rug at the hearth the timid creature sat dazed then raised itself on its hind legs and mewed wheres ralphie is he watching it father what is he doing the little one had dropped on hands and knees before the kitten and was gazing up into its face the mother leaned over him with a face that would have beamed with sunshine if the sun of sight had not been missing is he looking doesnt he want to coddle it the little chap had pushed his nose close to the nose of the kitten and was prattling to it in various inarticulate noises booloolallamama isnt he a darling father its a winsome wee thing said the old man still standing with drooping head over the group on the hearth the mothers face saddened and she turned away then from the opposite side of the kitchen where she was making pretense to take plates from a platerack there came the sound of suppressed weeping the old mans eyes followed her nay lass lets have a sup of broth he said in a tone that carried another message the young woman put plates and a bowl of broth on the table to think that i can never see my own child and everybody else can see him she said and then there was another bout of tears the charcoalburner supped at his broth in silence a glistening bead rolled slowly down his wizened cheek and the interview on the hearth went on without interruption mewmewmew booloolallamama the child made efforts to drag himself to his feet by laying hold of the old mans trousers nay laddie said the old man mind my claestheyll dirty thy brannew brat for thee is he growing father said the girl growingamain and his eyesare they changing colorgoing brown childrens eyes do you know maybeill not be for saying nay is heis he very like me father naywellnayis fancying i see summat of the stranger in the laal chap at whiles the young mother turned her head aside the old mans name was matthew fisher but the folks of the countryside called him laird fisher this dubious dignity came of the circumstance that he had been the holder of an absolute royalty in a few acres of land under hindscarth the royalty had been many generations in his family his grandfather had set store by it when the lord of the manor had worked the copper pits at the foot of the eal crags he had tried to possess himself of the royalties of the fishers but the present families resisted the aristocrat luke fisher believed there was a fortune under his feet and he meant to try his luck on his holding some day that day never came his son mark fisher carried on the tradition but made no effort to unearth the fortune they were a cool silent slow and stubborn race matthew fisher followed his father and his grandfather and inherited the family pride all these years the tenders of the lord of the manor were ignored and the fishers enjoyed their title of courtesy or badinage matthew married and had one daughter called mercy he farmed his few acres with poor results the ground was good enough but matthew was living under the shadow of the family tradition one dayit was sunday morning and the sun shone brightlyhe was rambling by the po bett that rises on hindscarth and passed through his land when his eyes glanced over a glittering stone that lay among the pebbles at the bottom of the stream it was ore good full ore and on the very surface then the laird sank a shaft and all his earnings with it in an attempt to procure iron or copper the dalespeople derided him but he held silently on his way how dusta find the cobbles todayany softer they would say in passing as soft as the hearts of most folk he would answer and then add in a murmur and maybe a vast harder nor their heads the undeceiving came at length and then the laird fisher was old and poor his wife died brokenhearted after that the laird never rallied the shaft was left unworked and the holding lay fallow laird fisher took wage from the lord of the manor to burn charcoal in the wood the breezy irony of the dalesfolk did not spare the old mans bent head there was a rime current in the vale which ran theres tauld laird and tyoung laird and tlaird among tbarns if iver there comes another laird well hang him up by tarms a second man came to matthews abandoned workings he put money into it and skill and knowledge struck a vein and began to realize a fortune the only thing he did for the old laird was to make him his banksman at a pound a weekthe only thing save one thing and that is the beginning of this story the mans name was hugh ritson he was the second son of a cumbrian statesman in a neighboring valley was sevenandtwenty and had been brought up as a mining engineer first at cleaton moor and afterward at the college in jerman street when he returned to cumberland and bought the old lairds holding he saw something of the old lairds daughter he remembered mercy as a pretty prattling thing of ten or eleven she was now a girl of eighteen with a simple face a timid manner and an air that was neither that of a woman nor of a child her mother was lately dead her father spent most of his days on the fell some of his nights also when the charcoal was burning and she was much alone hugh ritson liked her sweet face her gentle replies and her few simple questions it is unnecessary to go further the girl gave herself up to him with her whole heart and soul then he married another woman the wife was the daughter of the vicar parson christian her name was greta she was beautiful to look upona girl of spirit and character greta knew nothing of hugh ritsons intercourse with mercy until after he had become her husband mercy was then in the depth of her trouble and greta had gone to comfort her down to that hour though idle tongues had wagged no one had lighted on mercys lover and not even in her fear had she confessed greta told her that it was brave and beautiful to shield her friend but he was unworthy of her friendship or he would stand by her sidewho was he it was a trying moment greta urged and pleaded and coaxed and mercy trembled and stammered and was silent the truth came out at last and from that moment the love between the two women was like the love of david and jonathan hugh ritson was compelled to stand apart and witness it he could not recognize it he dared not oppose it he could only drop his head and hold his tongue it was coals of fire on his head from both sides the women never afterward mentioned him to each other and yet somehowby some paradox of lovehe was the bond between them a month before the birth of the child mercy became blind this happened suddenly and without much warning a little cold in the eyes a little redness around them and a total eclipse of sight if such a disaster had befallen a married wife looking forward to a happy motherhood death itself might have seemed a doom more kind but mercy took it with a sombre quietness she was even heard to say that it was just as well these startling words repeated to greta just told her something of the mystery and misery of mercys state but their full meaning the whole depth of the shame they came from were only revealed on the morning after the night on which mercys child was born they were in the room upstairs where mercy herself had been born less than nineteen years before a little chamber with the low eaves and the open roof rising to the ridge a peaceful place with its whitewashed walls and the odor of clean linen on the pillow of the bed lay the simple face of the girlmother with its fair hair hanging loose and its blind eyes closed mercy had just awakened from the first deep sleep that comes after all is over and the long fingers of one of her thin hands were plucking at the white counterpane in a nervous voice she began to speak where was mrs ritson greta answered that she was there and the baby was sleeping on her knee anybody else no nobody else was it morning yes it was eight in the morning and her father who had not been to bed had eaten his breakfast and lighted his pipe and gone to work was the day fine very fine and the sun shining yes shining beautifully was the blind down yes the little white blind was down then all the room was full of that soft light oh yes full of it except in the corner by the washstand well except in the corner was the washstand still there why yes it was still there and mothers picture on the wall above it oh dear yes and the chest of drawers near the door with the bits of sparkling lead ore on top of course and the texts pinned on to the wallpaper come unto meeh yes they were all there then everything was just the same oh yes everything the same the same cried mercy everything the same but o lord jesus how different the child was awakened by the shrill sound of her voice and it began to whimper and greta to hush it swaying it on her knee and calling it by a score of pretty names mercy raised her head a moment and listened then fell back to the pillow and said how glad i am im blind good gracious mercy what are you saying said greta im glad i cant see it mercy ah youre different mrs ritson i was thinking of that last night when your time comes perhaps youll be afraid youll die but youll never be afraid youll not and youll say to yourself it will be over soon and then what joy that wasnt my case when i was at the worst i could only think its dreadful now but oh tomorrow all the world will be different one poor little day changed all this toward sunset the child had to be given the breast for the first time ah that mystery of life that mystery of motherhood what are the accidents of social law the big conventions of virtue and vice of honor and disgrace before the touch of the spreading fingers of a babe as they fasten on the mothers breast mercy thought no more of her shame she had her baby for it at all events the world was not utterly desolate after all god was very good then came a great longing for sight she only wished to see her child that was all wasnt it hard that a mother had never seen her own baby in her darkness she would feel its little nose as it lay asleep beside her and let her hand play around its mouth and over its eyes and about its ears her touch passed over the little one like a look it was almost as if there were sight in the tips of her fingers the child lived to be six months old and still mercy had not seen him a year and yet she had no hope then greta in pity of the yearning gaze of the blind girlface whenever she came and kissed the boy and said how bonny he was sent to liverpool for a doctor that at least they might know for a certainty if mercys sight was gone forever the doctor came yes there was hope the mischief was cataract on both eyes sight might return but an operation would be necessary that could not however be performed immediately he would come again in a month and a colleague with him and meantime the eyes must be bathed constantly in a liquid which they would send for the purpose at first mercy was beside herself with delight she plucked up the boy and kissed and kissed him the whole day long she sang all over the house like a liberated bird her face though it was blind was like sunshine for the joyous mouth smiled like eyes then suddenly there came a change she plucked up the boy and kissed him still but she did not sing and she did not smile a heavy thought had come to her ah if she should die under the doctors hands was it not better to live in blindness and keep her boy than to try to see him and so lose him altogether thus it was with her on st peters day when the children of the dale went by at their rushbearing there was the faint sound of a footstep outside hark said mercy half rising from the sconce its mrs ritsons foot the man listened nay lass theres no foot said matthew yes shes on the road said mercy her face showed that pathetic tension of the other senses which is peculiar to the blind a moment later greta stepped into the cottage with a letter in her hand goodmorning matthew i have news for you mercy the doctors are coming today mercys face fell perceptibly the old mans head dropped lower there dont be afraid said greta touching her hand caressingly it will soon be over the doctors didnt hurt you before did they no but this time it will be the operation said mercy there was a tremor in her voice greta had lifted the child from the sconce the little fellow cooed close to her ear and babbled his inarticulate nothings only think when its all over you will be able to see your darling ralphie for the first time mercys sightless face brightened oh yes she said and watch him play and see him spin his tops and chase the butterflies oh that will be very good dusta say today mistress ritson asked matthew the big drops standing in his eyes yes matthew i will stay to see it over and mind baby and help a little mercy took the little one from gretas arms and cried over it and laughed over it and then cried and laughed again mama and ralphie shall play together in the garden darling and ralphie shall see the horsesand the flowersand the birdiesand mamayes mama shall see ralphie ii two hours later the doctors arrived they looked at mercys eyes and were satisfied that the time was ripe for the operation at the sound of their voices mercy trembled and turned livid by a maternal instinct she picked up the child who was toddling about the floor and clasped it to her bosom the little one opened wide his blue eyes at sight of the strangers and the prattling tongue became quiet take her to her room and let her lie on the bed said one of the doctors to greta a sudden terror seized the young mother no no no she said in an indescribable accent and the child cried a little from the pressure to her breast come mercy dear be brave for your boys sake said greta listen to me said the doctor quietly but firmly you are now quite blind and you have been in total darkness for a year and a half we may be able to restore your sight by giving you a few minutes pain will you not bear it mercy sobbed and kissed the child passionately just think it is quite certain that without an operation you will never regain your sight continued the doctor you have nothing to lose and everything to gain are you satisfied come go away to your room quietly oh oh oh sobbed mercy just imagine only a few minutes pain and even of that you will scarcely be conscious before you know what is doing it will be done mercy clung closer to her child and kissed it again and yet more fervently the doctors turned to each other strange vanity muttered the one who had not spoken before her eyes are useless and yet she is afraid she may lose them mercys quick ears caught the whispered words it is not that she said passionately no gentlemen said greta you have mistaken her thought tell her she runs no danger of her life the doctors smiled and laughed a little oh thats it eh well we can tell her that with certainty then there was another interchange of halfamused glances ah we that be men sirs dont know the depth and tenderness of a mothers heart said old matthew and mercy turned toward him a face that was full of gratitude greta took the child out of her arms and hushed it to sleep in another room then she brought it back and put it in its cradle that stood in the ingle come mercy she said for the sake of your boy and mercy permitted herself to be led from the kitchen so there will be no danger she said i shall not leave my boy who said that the doctor oh good gracious its nothing only think i shall live to see him grow to be a great lad her whole face was now radiant it will be nothing oh no it will be nothing how silly it was to think that he would live on and grow up and be a man and i lie cold in the churchyardand me his mother that was very childish wasnt it but then i have been so childish since ralphie came there lie and be quiet and it will soon be over said greta let me kiss him first do let me kiss him only once you know its a great risk after all and if he grew upand i wasnt hereifif there dear mercy you must not cry again it inflames your eyes and that cant be good for the doctors no no i wont cry you are very good everybody is very good only let me kiss my little ralphiejust for the last greta led her back to the side of the cot and she spread herself over it with outstretched arms as the motherbird poises with outstretched wings over her brood then she rose and her face was peaceful and resigned the laird fisher sat down before the kitchen fire with one arm on the cradle head parson christian stood beside him the old charcoalburner wept in silence and the good parsons voice was too thick for the words of comfort that rose to his lips the doctors followed into the bedroom mercy was lying tranquilly on her bed her countenance was without expression she was busy with her own thoughts greta stood by the bedside anxiety was written in every line of her beautiful brave face we must give her the gas said one of the doctors addressing the other mercys features twitched who said that she asked nervously my child you must be quiet said the doctor in a tone of authority yes i will be quiet very quiet only dont make me unconscious she said never mind me i will not cry no if you hurt me i will not cry out i will not stir i will do everything you ask and you shall say how quiet i have been only dont let me be insensible the doctors consulted together aside and in whispers who spoke about the gas it wasnt you mrs ritson was it you must do as the doctors wish dear said greta in a caressing voice oh i will be very good i will do every little thing yes and i will be so brave i am a little childish sometimes but i can be brave cant i the doctors returned to the bedside very well we will not use the gas said one you are a brave little woman after all there be stillvery still one of the doctors was tearing linen into strips for bandages while the other fixed mercys head to suit the light there was a faint sound from the kitchen wait said mercy that is fatherhes crying tell him not to cry say its nothing she laughed a weak little laugh there he will hear that go and say it was i who laughed greta left the room on tiptoe old matthew was still sitting over a dying fire gently rocking the sleeping child when greta returned to the bedroom mercy called her and said very softly let me hold your hand gretamay i say gretathere and her fingers closed on gretas with a convulsive grasp the operation began mercy held her breath she had the stubborn northcountry blood in her once only a sigh escaped there was a dead silence in two or three minutes the doctor said just another minute and all will be over at the next instant greta felt her hand held with a grasp of iron doctor doctor i can see you cried mercy and her words came in gusts be quiet said the doctor in a stern voice in half a minute more the linen bandages were being wrapped tightly over mercys eyes doctor dear doctor let me see my boy cried mercy be quiet i say said the doctor again dear doctor my dear doctor only one peepone little peep i saw your facelet me see my ralphies not yet it is not safe but only for a moment dont put the bandage on for one moment just think doctor i have never seen my boy ive seen other peoples children but never once my own own darling oh dear doctor you are exciting yourself listen to me if you dont behave yourself now you may never see your child yes yes i will behave myself i will be very good only dont shut me up in darkness again until i see my boy greta bring him to me listen i hear his breathing go for my darling the kind doctor wont be angry with you tell him that if i see my child it will cure me i know it will gretas eyes were swimming in tears rest quiet mercy everything may be lost if you disturb yourself now my dear the doctors were wrapping bandage over bandage and fixing them firmly at the back of their patients head now listen again said one of them this bandage must be kept over your eyes for a week a weeka whole week oh doctor you might as well say forever i say a week and if you should ever remove it not for an instant not raise it a very little if you ever remove it for an instant or raise it ever so little you will assuredly lose your sight forever remember that oh doctor it is terrible why did you not tell me so before oh this is worse than blindness think of the temptation and i have never seen my boy the doctor had fixed the bandage and his voice was less stern but no less resolute you must obey me he said i will come again this day week and then you shall see your child and your father and this young lady and everybody but mind if you dont obey me you will never see anything you will have one glance of your little boy and then be blind forever or perhapsyes perhaps die mercy lay quiet for a moment then she said in a low voice dear doctor you must forgive me i am very wilful and i promised to be so good i will not touch the bandage no for the sake of my little boy i will never never touch it you shall come yourself and take it off and then i shall see him the doctors went away greta remained all that night in the cottage you are happy now mercy said greta oh yes said mercy just think only a week and he must be so beautiful by this time when greta took the child to her at sunset there was an ineffable joy in her pale face and next morning when greta awoke mercy was singing softly to herself in the sunrise iii greta stayed with mercy until noon that day begging entreating and finally commanding her to lie quiet in bed while she herself dressed and fed the child and cooked and cleaned in spite of the laird fishers protestations when all was done and the old charcoalburner had gone out on the hills greta picked up the little fellow in her arms and went to mercys room mercy was alert to every sound and in an instant was sitting up in bed her face beamed her parted lips smiled her delicate fingers plucked nervously at the counterpane how brightsome it is today greta she said im sure the sun must be shining the window was open and a soft breeze floated through the suns rays into the room mercy inclined her head aside and added ah you young rogue you you are there are you give him to me the rascal the rogue was set down in his mothers arms and she proceeded to punish his rascality with a shower of kisses how bonny his cheeks must be they will be just like two ripe apples and forthwith there fell another shower of kisses then she babbled over the little one and lisped and stammered and nodded her head in his face and blew little puffs of breath into his hair and tickled him until he laughed and crowed and rolled and threw up his legs and then she kissed his limbs and extremities in a way that mothers have and finally imprisoned one of his feet by putting it ankledeep into her mouth would you ever think a foot could be so tiny greta she said and the little one plunged about and clambered laboriously up its mothers breast and more than once plucked at the white bandage about her head no no ralphie must not touch said mercy with sudden gravity only think ralphie pet one weekonly onenay lessonly six days now and thenoh then a long hug and the little fellows boisterous protest against the convulsive pressure abridged the mothers prophecy all at once mercys manner changed she turned toward greta and said i will not touch the bandage no never but if ralphie tugged at it and it fellwould that be breaking my promise greta saw what was in her heart im afraid it would dear she said but there was a tremor in her voice mercy sighed audibly just think it would be only ralphie the kind doctors could not be angry with my little child i would say it was the boy and they would smile and say ah that is different give me the little one said greta with emotion mercy drew the child closer and there was a pause i was very wrong greta she said in a low tone oh you would not think what a fearful thing came into my mind a minute ago take my ralphie just imagine my own innocent baby tempted me as greta reached across the bed to lift the child out of his mothers lap the little fellow was struggling to communicate by help of a limited vocabulary some wondrous intelligence of recent events that somewhat overshadowed his little existence pussdat many times repeated was further explained by one chubby forefinger with its diminutive finger nail pointed to the fat back of the other hand he means that the little cat has scratched him said greta but bless the mite he is pointing to the wrong hand pussdat continued the child and peered up into his mothers sightless face mercy was all tears in an instant she had borne yesterdays operation without a groan but now the scratch on her childs hand went to her heart like a stab lie quiet mercy said greta it will be gone tomorrow goon echoed the little chap and pointed out at the window the darling how he picks up every word said greta he means the horse explained mercy goonmangoon prattled the little one with a childs indifference to all conversation except his own bless the love he must remember the doctor and his horse said greta mercy was putting her lips to the scratch on the little hand oh greta i am very childish but a mothers heart melts like butter batter echoed the child and wriggled out of gretas arms to the ground where he forthwith clambered on to the stool and possessed himself of a slice of bread which lay on the table at the bedside then the fair curly head disappeared like a glint of sunlight through the door to the kitchen what shall i care if other mothers see my child i shall see him too said mercy and she sighed yes she added softly his hands and his eyes and his feet and his soft hair try to sleep an hour or two dear said greta and then perhaps you may get up this afternoononly perhaps you know but well see yes greta yes how kind you are you will be kinder to me some day said greta very tenderly how very selfish i am but then it is so hard not to be selfish when you are a mother only fancy i never think of myself as mercy now no never im just ralphies mama when ralphie came mercy must have died in some way thats very silly isnt it only it does seem true mangoonbatter was heard from the kitchen mingled with the patter of tiny feet listen to him how tricksome he is and you should hear him cry oh you would say that child has had an eye knocked out and then in a minute behold he is laughing once more there im selfish again but i will make up for it some day if god is good yes mercy he is good said greta her arm rested on the doorjamb and her head dropped on to it her eyes swam did it seem at that moment as if god had been very good to these two women greta said mercy and her voice fell to a whisper do you think ralphie is likeanybody yes dear he is like you there was a pause then mercys hand strayed from under the bedclothes and plucked at gretas gown do you think she asked in a voice all but inaudible that father knows who it is i can not saywe have never told him nor ihe never asked never onceonly you know he gave up his work at the mine and went back to the charcoalpit when ralphie came but he never said a word greta did not answer at that moment the bedroom door was pushed open with a little lordly bang and the great wee man entered with his piece of bread insecurely on one prong of a fork toas he explained complacently toas and walked up to the empty grate and stretched his arm over the fender at the cold bars why theres no fire for toast you darling goose said greta catching him in her arms much to his masculine vexation mercy had risen on an elbow and her face was full of the yearning of the blind then she lay back never mind she said to herself in a faltering voice let me lie quiet and think of all his pretty ways iv greta returned home toward noon laughing and crying a little to herself as she walked for she was full of a dear delicious envy she was thinking that she could take all the shame and all the pain for all the joy of mercys motherhood god had given greta no children hugh ritson came in to their early dinner and she told him how things went at the cottage of the old laird fisher only once before had she mentioned mercy or the child and he looked confused and awkward after the meal was over he tried to say something which had been on his mind for weeks but if anything should happen after all he began and mercy should not recoveror if she should ever want to go anywheremight we not takewould you mind gretai mean it might even help heryou see he said breaking down nearly there is the child its a sort of duty you knowand then a good home and upbringing dont tempt me said greta ive thought of it a hundred times about five oclock the same evening a knock came to the door and old laird fisher entered his manner was more than usually solemn and constrained is coomt to say as ma lasss wee thing is taken badly he said and rayder suddent greta rose from her seat and put on her hat and cloak she was hastening down the road while the charcoalburner was still standing in the middle of the floor when greta reached the old charcoalburners cottage the little one was lying in a drowsy state in mercys arms its breathing seemed difficult sometimes it started in terror it was feverish and suffered thirst the mothers wistful face was bent down on it with an indescribable expression there were only the trembling lips to tell of the sharp struggle that was going on within but the yearning for a sight of the little flushed countenance the tearless appeal for but one glimpse of the drowsy little eyes the halfarticulate cry of a mothers heart against the fate that made the child she had suckled at her breast a stranger whose very features she might not knowall this was written in that blind face is he pale said mercy is he sleeping he does not talk now but only starts and cries and sometimes coughs when did this begin asked greta toward four oclock he had been playing and i noticed that he breathed heavily and then he came to me to be nursed is he awake now listen the little one in its restless drowsiness was muttering faintly mangoonbattertoas the darling is talking in his sleep isnt he said mercy then there was a ringing brassy cough it is croup thought greta she closed the window lighted a fire placed the kettle so that the steam might enter the room then wrung flannels out of hot water and wrapped them about the childs neck she stayed all that night at the cottage and sat up with the little one and nursed it mercy could not be persuaded to go to bed but she was very quiet it had not yet taken hold of her that the child was seriously ill he was drowsy and a little feverish his pulse beat fast and he coughed hard sometimes but he would be better in the morning oh yes he would soon be well again and tearing up the flowers in the garden toward midnight the pulse fell rapidly the breathing became quieter and the whole nature seemed to sink mercy listened with her ear bent down at the childs mouth and a smile of ineffable joy spread itself over her face bless him he is sleeping so calmly she said greta did not answer the puss and the man dont darken his little life so much now continued mercy cheerily no dear said greta in as strong a voice as she could summon all will be well with my darling boy soon will it not yes dear said greta with a struggle happily mercy could not read the other answer in her face mercy had put her sensitive fingers on the childs nose and was touching him lightly about the mouth greta she said in a startled whisper does he look pinched a little said greta quietly and his skinis it cold and clammy we must give him another hot flannel said greta mercy sat at the bedside and said nothing for an hour then all at once and in a strange harsh voice she said i wish god had not made ralphie so winsome greta started at the words but made no answer the daylight came early as the first gleams of gray light came in at the window greta turned to where mercy sat in silence it was a sad face that she saw in the mingled yellow light of the dying lamp and the gray of the dawn mercy spoke again greta do you remember what mistress branthet said when her baby died last back end gone twelvemonth greta looked up quickly at the bandaged eyes what she asked well parson christian tried to comfort her and said your baby is now an angel in paradise and she turned on him with shaf on your angelsi want none on emi want my little girl mercys voice broke into a sob toward ten oclock the doctor came he had been detained very sorry to disoblige mrs ritson but fact was old mr de broadthwaite had an attack of lumbago complicated by a bout of toothache and everybody knew he was most exacting young persons baby ill feverish restless starts in its sleep and cough ah croupy coughyes croup true croup not spasmodic let him see how old a year and a half ah bad very most frequent in second year of infancy dangerous highly so forms a membrane that occludes airpassages often ends in convulsions and child suffocates sad very let him see again how long since the attack began yesterday at four ah far gone far the great man soon vanished leaving behind him a harmless preparation of aconite and ipecacuanha mercy had heard all and her pentup grief broke out in sobs oh to think i shall hear my ralphie no more and to know his white cold face is looking up from a coffin while other children are playing in the sunshine and chasing the butterflies no no it can not be god will not let it come to pass i will pray to him and he will save my child why he can do anything and he has all the world what is my little baby boy to him he will not let it be taken from me gretas heart was too full for speech but she might weep in silence and none there would know mercy stretched across the bed and tenderly folding the child in her arms she lifted him up and then went down on her knees merciful father she said in a childish voice of sweet confidence this is my baby my ralphie and i love him so dearly you would never think how much i love him but he is ill and doctor says he may die oh dear father only think what it would be to say his little face is gone and then i have never seen him you will not take him away until his mother sees him so soon too only five days more why it is quite close not tomorrow nor the next day nor the next but the day after that she put in many another childlike plea and then rose with a smile on her pale lips and replaced the little one on his pillow how patient he is she said he cant say thank you but im sure his eyes are speaking let me feel she put her finger lightly on the childs lids no they are shut he must be sleeping oh dear he sleeps very much is he gaining color how quiet he is if he would only say mama how i wish i could see him she was very quiet for a while and then plucked at gretas gown suddenly greta she said eagerly something tells me that if i could only see ralphie i should save him greta started up in terror no no no you must not think of it she said but something whispered it it must have been god himself you know we ought to obey god always mercy it was not god who said that it was your own heart you must not heed it im sure it was god said mercy and i heard it quite plain mercy my darling think what you are saying think what it is you wish to do if you do it you will be blind forever but i shall have saved my ralphie no no you will not will he not be saved greta only our heavenly father knows well he whispered it in my heart and as you say he knows best greta was almost distraught with fear the noble soul in her would not allow her to appeal to mercys gratitude against the plea of maternal love but she felt that all her happiness hung on that chance if mercy regained her sight all would be well with her and hers but if she lost it the future must be a blank the day wore slowly on and the child sank and sank at evening the old charcoalburner returned and went into the bedroom he stood a moment and looked down at the pinched little face and when the childs eyes opened drowsily for a moment he put his withered forefinger into its palm but there was no longer a responsive clasp of the chubby hand the old mans lips quivered behind his white beard it were a winsome wee thing he said faintly and then turned away he left his supper untouched and went into the porch there he sat on a bench and whittled a blackthorn stick the sun was sinking over the head of the eal crag the valley lay deep in a purple haze only the bald top of cat bells stood out bright in the glory of the passing day a gentle breeze came up from the south and the young corn chattered with its multitudinous tongues in a field below the dog lay at the charcoalburners feet blinking in the sun and snapping lazily at a buzzing fly the little life within was ebbing away no longer racked by the ringing cough the loud breathing became less frequent and more harsh mercy lifted the child from the bed and sat with it before the fire greta saw its eyes open and at the same moment she saw the lips move slightly but she heard nothing he is calling his mama said mercy with her ear bent toward the childs mouth there was a silence for a long time mercy pressed the child to her breast its close presence seemed to soothe her greta stood and looked down she saw the little lips move once more but again she heard no sound he is calling his mama repeated mercy wistfully and oh he seems such a long way off once again the little lips moved he is calling me said mercy listening intently and she grew restless and excited he is going away i can hear him he is far off ralphie ralphie she had lifted the child up to her face ralphie ralphie she cried give me the baby mercy said greta but the mother clung to it with a convulsive grasp ralphie ralphie ralphie there was a sudden flash of some white thing in an instant the bandage had fallen from mercys head and she was peering down into the childs face with wild eyes ralphie ralphie hugh she cried the mother had seen her babe at last and in that instant she had recognized the features of its father at the next moment the angel of god passed through that troubled house and the child lay dead at the mothers breast mercy saw it all and her impassioned mood left her she rose to her feet quietly and laid the little one in the bed there was never a sigh more never a tear only her face was ashy pale and her whitening lips quivered greta she said very slowly goodby all is over now she spoke of herself as if her days were already ended and past as if her own orb of life had been rounded by the brief span of the little existence that lay finished on the bed when they come in the morning earlyvery earlyand find us here my boy and me dont let them take him away from me greta we should go togetheryes both together thats only right with ralphie at my bosom the bandage lay at her feet her eyes were very red and heavy their dim light seemed to come from far away only that she said and her voice softened my ralphie is in heaven then she hid her face in her hands and cried out loud but i prayed to god that i might see my child on earth oh how i prayed and god heard my prayer and answered itbut see i saw him die end of the blind mother the last confession

i will listen it is my duty speak it is less than a year since my health broke down but the soul lives fast and it seems to me like a lifetime i had overworked myself miserably my life as a physician in london had been a hard one but it was not my practise that had wrecked me how to perform that operation on the throat was the beginning of my trouble you know what happened i mastered my problem and they called the operation by my name it has brought me fame it has made me rich it has saved a thousand lives and will save ten thousand more and yet iifor taking one lifeoneunder conditions father bear with me i will tell all my nerves are burned out gloom depression sleeplessness prostration sometimes collapse a consuming fire within a paralyzing frost withoutyou know what it iswe call it neurasthenia i watched the progress of my disease and gave myself the customary treatment hygiene diet drugs electricity i tried them all but neither dumbbells nor indian clubs neither walking nor riding neither liberal food nor doses of egg and brandy neither musk nor ergot nor antipyrin neither faradization nor galvanization availed to lift the black shades that hung over me day and night and made the gift of life a mockery i knew why my work possessed me like a fever i could neither do it to my content nor leave it undone i was drawing water in a sieve my wife sent for gull full well i knew what he would advise it was rest i must take six months absolute holiday and in order to cut myself off entirely from all temptations to mental activity i must leave london and go abroad change of scene of life and of habit new peoples new customs new faiths and a new climatethese separately and together with total cessation of my usual occupations were to banish a long series of functional derangements which had for their basis the exhaustion of the sympathetic nervous system i was loth to go looking back upon my condition i see that my reluctance was justified to launch a creature who was all nerves into the perpetual if trifling vexations of travel was a mistake a folly a madness but i did not perceive this i was thinking only of my home and the dear souls from whom i must be separated during the seven years of our married life my wife had grown to be more than the object of my love that gentle soothing that soft healing which the mere presence of an affectionate woman who is all strength and courage may bring to a man who is wasted by work or worry my wifes presence had long brought to me and i shrank from the thought of scenes where she could no longer move about me meeting my wishes and anticipating my wants this was weakness and i knew it but i had another weakness which i did not know my boy a little son of six years of age the day before i set sail was all the world to me paternal love may eat up all the other passions it was so in my case the tyranny of my affection for my only child was even more constant and unrelenting than the tyranny of my work nay the two were one for out of my instinct as a father came my strength as a doctor the boy had suffered from a throat trouble from his birth when he was a babe i delivered him from a fierce attack of it and when he was four i brought him back from the jaws of death thus twice i had saved his life and each time that life had become dearer to me but too well i knew that the mischief was beaten down and not conquered some day it would return with awful virulence to meet that terror i wrought by day and night no slave ever toiled so hard i denied myself rest curtailed my sleep and stole from tranquil reflection and repose halfhours and quarterhours spent in the carriage going from patient to patient the attack might come suddenly and i must be prepared i was working against time you know what happened the attack did not come my boy continued well but my name became known and my discovery established the weakness of my own child had given the bent to my studies if i had mastered my subject it was my absorbing love of my little one that gave me the impulse and direction but i had paid my penalty my health was a wreck and i must leave everything behind me if it had been possible to take my wife and boy along with me how different the end might have been should i be lying here nowhere on this bedwith you father you we spent our boys birthday with what cheer we could command for my wife it seemed to be a day of quiet happiness hallowed by precious memoriesthe dearest and most delicious that a mother ever knewof the babyhood of her boyhis pretty lisp his foolish prattle his funny little ways and sayingsand sweetened by the anticipation of the health that was to return to me as the result of rest and change the child himself was bright and gamesome and i for my part gave way to some reckless and noisy jollity thus the hours passed until bedtime and then as i saw the little fellow tucked up in his crib it crossed my mind for a moment that he looked less well than usual such fancies were common to me and i knew from long experience that it was folly to give way to them to do so at that time must have been weakness too pitiful for my manhood i had already gone far enough for my own selfrespect to my old colleague and fellowstudent granville wenman i had given elaborate instructions for all possible contingencies if this happened he was to do that if that happened he was to do this in case of serious need he was to communicate with me by the swiftest means available for neither the width of the earth nor the wealth of the world nor the loss of all chances of health or yet life should keep me from hastening home if the one hope of my heart was in peril wenman had smiled a little as in pity of the morbidity that ran out to meet so many dangers i did not heed his goodnatured compassion or contempt whatever it was for i knew he had no children i had reconciled myself in some measure to my absence from home and before my little man was awake in the morning i was gone from the house it had been arranged that i should go to morocco wenman had suggested that country out of regard to the freshness of its life and people the east in the west the costumes of arabia the faiths of mohammed and of moses a primitive form of government and a social life that might have been proper to the land of canaan in the days of abrahamsuch had seemed to him and others to be an atmosphere of novelty that was likely to bring spring and elasticity to the overstretched mind and nerves of a victim of the civilization of our tumultuous century but not in all the world could fate have ferreted out for me a scene more certain to develop the fever and fret of my natural temperament had the choice fallen on any other place any dead or dying country any corner of gods earth but that blighted and desolate land ah bear with me bear with me i know it my son it is near to my own country my home is in spain i came to your england from seville go on i sailed to gibraltar by a p and o steamer from tilbury and the tender that took my wife back to the railway pier left little in my new condition to interest me you know what it is to leave home in search of health if hope is before you regret is behind when i stood on the upper deck that night alone and watched the light of the eddystone dying down over the dark waters it seemed to me that success had no solace and fame no balm and riches no safety or content one reflection alone sufficed to reconcile me to where i wasthe work that had brought me there was done neither for fame nor for riches but at the prompting of the best of all earthly passionsor what seemed to be the best three days passed and beyond casual words i had spoken to no one on the ship but on the fourth day as we sailed within sight of finisterre in a calm sea having crossed the bay with comfort the word went round that a stormsignal was hoisted on the cape no one who has gone through an experience such as that is likely to forget it everybody on deck the blanched faces the hushed voices the quick whispers the eager glances around the interrogations of the officers on duty and their bantering answers belied by their anxious looks then the darkening sky the freshening breeze the lowering horizon the tingling gloomy atmosphere creeping down from the mastheads and the air of the whole ship above and below charged as it were with sudden electricity it is like nothing else in life except the buglecall in camp telling those who lie smoking and drinking about the fires that the enemy is coming and is near i was standing on the quarterdeck watching the lascars stowing sails battening down the hatches clewing the lines and making everything snug when a fellowpassenger whom i had not observed before stepped up and spoke his remark was a casual one and it has gone from my memory i think it had reference to the native seamen and was meant as a jest upon their lumbering slowness which suggested pitiful thoughts to him of what their capacity must be in a storm but the air of the man much more than his words aroused and arrested my attention it was that of one whose spirits had been quickened by the new sense of danger he laughed his eyes sparkled his tongue rolled out his light remarks with a visible relish i looked at the man and saw that he had the soul of a warhorse tall slight dark handsome with bushy beard quivering nostrils mobile mouth and eyes of fire alive in every fibre and full of unconquerable energy he appeared to be a man of thirty to thirtyfive but proved to be no more than fourandtwenty i learned afterward that he was an american and was traveling for love of adventure that night we flew six hours before the storm but it overtook our ship at last what befell us then in the darkness of that rockbound coast i did not know until morning can you believe it i took my usual dose of a drug prescribed to me for insomnia and lay down to sleep when i went up on deck in the late dawn of the following daythe time was springthe wind had slackened and the ship was rolling and swinging along in a sea that could not be heard above the beat and thud of the engines only the memory of last nights tempest lay around in sullen wave and skyonly there and in the quarters down below of the native seamen of our ship the first face i encountered was that of the american he had been on deck all night and he told me what had happened through the dark hours the storm had been terrible and when the first dead light of dawn had crept across from the east the ship had been still tossing in great white billows just then a number of lascars had been ordered aloft on some urgent dutyi know not whatand a sudden gust had swept one of them from a crosstree into the sea efforts had been made to rescue him the engines had been reversed boats put out and lifebuoys thrown into the water but all in vain the man had been swept away he was gone and the ship had steamed on the disaster saddened me inexpressibly i could see the lascar fall from the rigging catch the agonizing glance of the white eyes in his black face as he was swept past on the crest of a wave and watch his outstretched arms as he sank to his death down and down and down it seemed to me an iniquity that while this had happened i had slept perhaps the oversensitive condition of my nerves was at fault but indeed i felt that in his way in his degree within the measure of his possibilities that poor fellow of another skin another tongue with whom i had exchanged no word of greeting had that day given his life for my life how much of such emotion i expressed at the time it is hard to remember now but that the american gathered the bent of my feelings was clear to me by the pains he was at to show that they were uncalled for and unnatural and false what was life i had set too great a store by it the modern reverence for life was eating away the finest instincts of mans nature life was not the most sacred of our possessions duty justice truth these were higher things so he talked that day and the next until from thoughts of the loss of the lascar we had drifted far into wider and more perilous speculations the american held to his canon war was often better than peace and open massacre than corrupt tranquillity we wanted some of the robust spirit of the middle ages in these our piping days the talk turned on the persecution of the jews in russia the american defended ita stern people was purging itself of an alien element which like an interminate tapeworm had been preying on its vitals the remedy was drastic but necessary life was lost but also life was saved then coming to closer quarters we talked of murder the american held to the doctrine of sterne it was a hard case that the laws of the modern world should not have made any manner of difference between murdering an honest man and only executing a scoundrel these things should always be rated ad valorem as for blood spilled in selfdefense it was folly to talk of it as crime even the laws of my own effeminate land justified the man who struck down the arm that was raised to kill him and the mind that reckoned such an act as an offense was morbid and diseased such opinions were repugnant to me and i tried to resist them there was a sanctity about human life which no man should dare to outrage god gave it and only god should take it away as for the government of the world let it be for better or for worse it was in gods hands and god required the help of no man my resistance was useless the american held to his doctrine it was good to take life in a good cause and if it was good for the nation it was good for the individual man the end was all i fenced these statements with what force i could command and i knew not how strongly my adversary had assailed me now i know too well that his opinions sank deep into my soul only too well i know it nownow that we arrived at gibraltar the following morning and going up on deck in the empty void of air that follows on the sudden stopping of a ships engines i found the american amid a group of swarthy gibraltarians bargaining for a boat to take him to the mole it turned out that he was going to morocco also and we hired a boat together the morning was clear and cold the great broad rock looked whiter and starker and more like a gigantic oystershell than ever against the blue of the sky there would be no steamer for tangier until the following day and we were to put up at the spanish hotel called the calpe immediately on landing i made my way to the postoffice to despatch a telegram home announcing my arrival and there i found two letters which having come overland arrived in advance of me one of them was from wenman telling me that he had called at wimpole street the morning after my departure and found all well at my house and also enclosing a resolution of thanks and congratulation from my colleagues of the college of surgeons in relation to my recent labors which were said to be memorable in the cause of humanity and science the other letter was from my wife a sweet affectionate little note cheerful yet tender written on her return from tilbury hinting that the dear old house looked just a trifle empty and as if somehow it missed something but that our boy was up and happy with a new toy that i had left for him as a consolation on his awakeninga great elephant that worked its trunk and roared i have just asked our darling wrote my wife what message he would like to send you tell papa he answers im all right and jumbos all right and is he all right and will he come werry quick and see him grunting that night at the calpe i had some further talk with the american young as he was he had been a great eastern traveler egypt arabia syria the holy landhe knew them all for his forthcoming sojourn in morocco he had prepared himself with elaborate care the literature of travel in barbary is voluminous but he had gone through the best of it with the faith of islam he had long been familiar and of the corrupt and tyrannical form of government of mulai el hassan and his kaids and kadis he had an intimate knowledge he had even studied the language of the moorish peoplethe moroccan arabic which is a dialect of the language of the koranand so that he might hold intercourse with the sephardic jews also who people the mellahs of morocco he had mastered the spanish language as well this extensive equipment sufficient to start a crusade or to make a revolution was meant to do more than provide him with adventure his intention was to see the country and its customs to observe the manners of the people and the ordinances of their religion i shall get into the palaces and the prisons of the kasbahs he said yes and the mosques and the saints houses and the harems also little as i knew then of the moors and their country i foresaw the dangers of such an enterprise and i warned him against it you will get yourself into awkward corners i said yes he said and i shall get myself out of them i remembered his doctrine propounded on the ship and i saw that he was a man of resolution but i said remember you are going to the land of this people for amusement alone it is not necessity that thrusts you upon their prejudice their superstition their fanaticism true he said but if i get into trouble among them it will not be my amusements but my liberty or my life that will be in danger then in such a case you will stick at nothing to plow your way out nothing i laughed for my mind refused to believe him and we laughed noisily together with visions of bloody daggers before the eyes of both father my heart believed silently secretly unconsciously it drank in the poison of his thoughtdrank it inay next day about noon we sailed for tangier our ship was the jackal a little old iron steamtug battered by time and tempest clamped and stayed at every side and just holding together as by the grace of god the storm which we had outraced from finisterre had now doubled cape st vincent and the sea was rolling heavily in the straits we saw nothing of this until we had left the bay and were standing out from tarifa nor would it be worthy of mention now but that it gave me my first real understanding of the tremendous hold that the faith or the fanaticism of the moorish peoplecall it what you willhas upon their characters and lives the channel at that point is less than twenty miles wide but we were more than five hours crossing it our little crazy craft labored terribly in the huge breakers that swept inward from the atlantic pitching until the foredeck was covered rolling until her boats dipped in the water creaking shuddering leaping she had enough to do to keep afloat with the american i occupied the bridge between the paddleboxes which served as a saloon for firstclass passengers and below us in the open hold of the afterdeck a number of moors sat huddled together among cattle and sheep and baskets of fowl they were pilgrims hadjis returning from mecca by way of gibraltar and their behavior during the passage was marvelous in its callousness to the sense of peril they wrangled quarreled snarled at each other embraced kissed laughed together made futile attempts to smoke their keefpipes and quarreled barked and bleated again surely i said these people are either wondrously brave or they have no sense of the solemnity of death neither said the american they are merely fatalists by virtue of their faith if it is not now it is to come if it is not to come then it is now there is a sort of bravery in that i answered and cowardice too said the american the night had closed in when we dropped anchor by the ruins of the mole at tangier and i saw no more of the white town than i had seen of it from the straits but if my eyes failed in the darkness my other senses served me only too well the shrieking and yelping of the boatloads of moors and negroes who clambered aboard to relieve us of our luggage the stench of the town sewers that emptied into the baythese were my first impressions of the gateway to the home of islam the american went through the turmoil with composure and an air of command and having seen to my belongings as well as his own passing them through the open office at the watergate where two solemn moors in white sat by the light of candles in the receipt of customs he parted from me at the foot of the street that begins with the grand mosque and is the main artery of the town for he had written for rooms to the hotel called the villa de france and i before leaving england had done the same to the hotel called the continental thither i was led by a barefooted courier in white jellab and red tarboosh amid sights and sounds of fascinating strangeness the low drone of mens voices singing their evening prayers in the mosques the tinkling of the bells of men selling water out of goats skins the allah of blind beggars crouching at the gates the arrah of the mule drivers and the hooded shapes going by in the gloom or squatting in the red glare of the cafes without windows or doors and open to the streets i met the american in the sokthe marketplacethe following day and he took me up to his hotel to see some native costumes which he had bought by way of preparations for his enterprise they were haiks and soolhams jellabs kaftans slippers rosaries korans sashes satchels turbans and tarbooshesblue white yellow and redall right and none too new for he had purchased them not at the bazaars but from the son of a learned moor a taleb who had been cast into a prison by a usurer jew in these said he i mean to go everywhere and ill defy the devil himself to detect me take care i said take care he laughed and asked me what my own plans were i told him that i would remain in tangier until i received letters from home and then push on toward fez ill see you there he said but if i do not hail you please do not know me goodby goodby i said and so we parted i stayed ten days longer in tangier absorbed in many reflections of which the strangest were these two first the moors were the most religious people in the world and next that they were the most wickedly irreligious and basely immoral race on gods earth i was prompted to the one by observations of the large part which allah appears to play in all affairs of moorish life and to the other by clear proof of the much larger part which the devil enacts in allahs garments on the one side prayers prayers prayers the moodden the moodden the moodden the mosque the mosque the mosque allah from the mouths of the beggars allah from the lips of the merchants mohammed on the inscriptions at the gate the koran on the scarfs hung out at the bazaars and on the satchels hawked in the streets and on the other side shameless lying cheating usury buying and selling of justice cruelty and inhumanity raw sores on the backs of the asses blood in the streets blood blood blood everywhere and secret corruption indescribable nevertheless i concluded that my nervous malady must have given me the dark glasses through which everything looked so foul and i resolved in the interests of health to push on toward fez as soon as letters arrived from home assuring me that all were well and happy there but no letters came and at the arrival of every fresh mail from cadiz and from gibraltar my impatience increased at length i decided to wait no longer and leaving instructions that my letters should be sent on after me to the capital i called on the english consul for such official documents as were needful for my journey when these had been produced from the kasbah and i was equipped for travel the consul inquired of me how i liked the moors and their country i described my conflicting impressions and he said both were right in their several ways the religion of the moor said he is genuine of its kind though it does not put an end to the vilest government on earth and the most loathsome immoralities ever practised by man islam is a sacred thing to him he is proud of it jealous of it and prepared to die for it half his hatred of the unbeliever is fear that the nazarene or the jew is eager to show his faith some dishonor and that added the consul reminds me to offer you one word of warning avoid the very shadow of offense to the religion of these people do not pry into their beliefs do not take note of their ordinances pass their mosques and saints houses with downcast eyes if need be in a word let islam alone i thanked him for his counsel and remembering the american i inquired what the penalty would be if a foreign subject offended the religion of this people the consul lifted his eyebrows and shoulders together with an eloquence of reply that required no words but might not a stranger i asked do so unwittingly truly he answered and so much the worse for his ignorance is british life then i said at the mercy of the first ruffian with a dagger is there no power in solemn treaties what are treaties he said against fanaticism give the one a wide berth and youll have small need for the other after that he told me something of certain claims just settled for long imprisonment inflicted by the moorish authorities on men trading under the protection of the british flag it was an abject story of barbarous cruelty broken health shattered lives and wrecked homes atoned for after weary procrastination in the manner of all oriental courts by a sorry money payment the moral of it all was conveyed by the consul in the one word with which he parted from me at his gate respect the fanaticism of these fanatics he said as you would value your liberty or your life and keep out of a moorish prisonremember that remember that i did remember it every day of my travels i remembered it i remembered it at the most awful moment of my life if i had not remembered it then should i be lying here now with thatwith thatbehind me ah wait wait little did i expect when i left the consul to light so soon upon a terrible illustration of his words with my guide and interpreter a moorish soldier lent to me by the authorities in return for two pesetas one shilling and ninepence a day i strolled into the greater sok the marketplace outside the walls it was friday the holy day of the moslems somewhere between one and two oclock in the afternoon when the body of the moors having newly returned from their onehour observances in the mosques had resumed according to their wont their usual occupations the day was fine and warm a bright sun was shining and the sok at the time when we entered it was a various and animated scene dense crowds of hooded figures clad chiefly in whitesoiled or dirty whitemen in jellabs women enshrouded in blankets barefooted girls boys with shaven polls watercarriers with their tinkling bells snakecharmers storytellers jugglers preachers and then donkeys nosing their way through the throng mules lifting their necks above the peoples heads and camels munching oats and fightingit was a wilderness of writhing forms and a babel of shrieking noises with my loquacious moor i pushed my way along past booths and stalls until i came to a whitewashed structure with a white flag floating over it that stood near the middle of the marketplace it was a roofless place about fifteen feet square and something like a little sheepfold but having higher walls through the open doorway i saw an inner enclosure out of which a man came forward he was a wildeyed creature in tattered garments and dirty disheveled and malevolent of face see said my guide see my lord a moorish saints house look at the flag so shall my lord know a saints house here rest the bones of sidi gali and that is the saint that guards them a holy man yes a holy man moslems pay him tribute sacred place yes sacred no nazarene may enter it but moslem yes moslems may fly here for sanctuary life to the moslem death to the nazarene so it is my soldier was rattling on in this way when i saw coming in the sunlight down the hillside of which the sok is the foot a company of some eight or ten men whose dress and complexion were unlike those of the people gathered there they were a band of warlike persons swarthy tall lithe sinewy with heads clean shaven save for one long lock that hung from the crown each carrying a gun with barrel of prodigious length upon his shoulder and also armed with a long naked reefian knife stuck in the scarf that served him for a belt they were berbers the descendants of the race that peopled barbary before the moors set foot in it between whom and the moors there is a longcontinued suppressed but ineradicable enmity from their mountain homes these men had come to the town that day on their pleasure or their business and as they entered it they were at no pains to conceal their contempt for the townspeople and their doings swaggering along with long strides they whooped and laughed and plowed their way through the crowd over bread and vegetables spread out on the ground and the people fell back before them with muttered curses until they were come near to the saints house beside which i myself with my guide was standing then i saw that the keeper of the saints house the halfdistraught creature whom i had just observed was spitting out at them some bitter and venomous words clearly they all heard him and most of them laughed derisively and pushed on but one of the numbera young berber with eyes of firedrew up suddenly and made some answer in hot and rapid words the man of the saints house spoke again showing his teeth as he did so in a horrible grin and at the next instant almost quicker than my eyes could follow the swift movement of his hands the berber had plucked his long knife from his belt and plunged it into the keepers breast i saw it all the man fell at my feet and was dead in an instant in another moment the police of the market had laid hold of the murderer and he was being hauled off to his trial come whispered my guide and he led me by short cuts through the narrow lanes to the kasbah in an open alcove of the castle i found two men in stainless blue jellabs and spotless white turbans squatting on rush mats at either foot of the horseshoe arch these were the judges the kadi and his khalifa sitting in session in the hall of justice there was a tumult of many voices and of hurrying feet and presently the police entered holding their prisoner between them and followed by a vast concourse of townspeople i held my ground in front of the alcove the berber was brought up near to my side and i saw and heard all this man said one of the police killed soandso of sidi galis saints house when said the kadi this moment said the police how said the kadi with this knife said the police the knife stained and still wet was handed to the judge he shook it and asked the prisoner one question why then the berber flung himself on his kneeshis shaven head brushed my handand began to plead extenuating circumstances it is true my lord i killed him but he called me dog and infidel and spat at me the kadi gave back the knife and waved his hand take him away he said that was all as my guide interpreted it come he whispered again and he led me by a passage into a sort of closet where a man lay on a mattress this was the porch to the prison and the man on the mattress was the jailer in one wall there was a low door barred and clamped with iron and having a round peephole grated across at the next instant the police brought in their prisoner the jailer rattled a big key in the lock the low door swung open i saw within a dark den full of ghostly figures dragging chains at their ankles a foul stench came out of it the prisoner bent his head and was pushed in the door slammed backand that was the end everything occurred in no more time than it takes to tell it is that all his trial i asked all said my guide how long will he lie there until death but i said i have heard that a kadi of your country may be bribed to liberate a murderer ah my lord is right said my guide but not the murderer of a saint less than five minutes before i had seen the stalwart young berber swaggering down the hillside in the afternoon sunshine now he was in the gloom of the noisome dungeon with no hope of ever again looking upon the light of day doomed to drag out an existence worse than death and all for what for taking life no no nolife in that land is cheap cheaper than it ever was in the middle agesbut for doing dishonor to a superstition of the faith of islam i remembered the american and shuddered at the sight of this summary justice next morning as my tentmen and muleteers were making ready to set out for fez my soldierguide brought me a letter which had come by the french steamer by way of malaga it was from home a brief note from my wife with no explanation of her prolonged silence merely saying that all was as usual at wimpole street and not mentioning our boy at all the omission troubled me the brevity and baldness of the message filled me with vague concern and i had half a mind to delay my inland journey would that i had done so would that i had oh would that i had terrible my son terrible a blighted and desolated land but even worse than its own people are the renegades it takes from mine ah i knew one such long ago an outcast a pariah a shedder of blood an apostate but go on go on ii father what voice was it that rang in my ears and cried stay do not travel all your past from the beginning until today all your future from today until the end hangs on your action now go and your past is a waste your fame a mockery your success a reproach remain and your future is peace and happiness and content what voice father what voice i shut my ears to it and six days afterward i arrived at fez my journey had impressed two facts upon my mind with startling vividness first that the moor would stick at nothing in his jealousy of the honor of his faith and next that i was myself a changed and coarsened man i was reminded of the one when in el kassar i saw an old jew beaten in the open streets because he had not removed his slippers and walked barefoot as he passed the front of a mosque and again in wazzan when i witnessed the welcome given to the grand shereef on his return from his home in tangier to his house in the capital of his province the jew was the chief usurer of the town and had half the moorish inhabitants in his toils yet his commercial power had counted for nothing against the honor of islam i said he to me that night in the jewish inn the fondak i who could clap every man of them in the kasbah and their masters with them for moneys they owe me i to be treated like a dog by these scurvy sons of ishmaelgod of jacob the grand shereef was a drunkard a gamester and worse there was no ordinance of mohammed which he had not openly outraged yet because he stood to the people as the descendant of the prophet and the father of the faith they groveled on the ground before him and kissed his robes his knees his feet his stirrups and the big hoofs of the horse that carried him as for myself i realized that the atmosphere of the country had corrupted me when i took out from my baggage a curved knife in its silvermounted sheath which i had bought of a hawker at tangier and fixed it prominently in the belt of my norfolk jacket the morning after my arrival in fez i encountered my american companion of the voyage our meeting was a strange one i had rambled aimlessly with my guide through the new town into the old until i had lighted by chance upon the slave market in front of the ruins of the ancient grand mosque and upon a human auction which was then proceeding no scene so full of shame had i ever beheld but the fascination of the spectacle held me and i stood and watched and listened the slave being sold was a black girl and she was beautiful according to the standard of her skin bareheaded barefooted and clad as lightly over her body as decency allowed so as to reveal the utmost of her charms now brothers cried the salesman look see pinching the girls naked arms and rolling his jeweled fingers from her chin downward over her bare neck on to her bosom sound of wind and limb and with rosy lips fit for the kisses of a kinghow much a hundred dollars cried a voice out of the crowd i thought i had heard the voice before and looked up to see who had spoken it was a tall man with haik over his turban and blue selam on top of a yellow kaftan a hundred dollars offered cried the salesman only a hundred brothers nows the chance for all true believers a hundred and five cried another voice a hundred and ten a hundred and fifteen a hundred and fifteen for this jewel of a girl cried the salesman its giving her away brothers by the prophets if you are not quick ill keep her for myself come look at her sidi isnt she good enough for a sultan the prophet god rest him would have leaped at her he loved sweet women as much as he loved sweet odors now for the third and last timehow much remember i guarantee her seventeen years of age sound strong plump and sweet a hundred and twenty cried the voice i had heard first i looked up at the speaker again it was the american in his moorish costume i could bear no more of the sickening spectacle and as i turned aside with my interpreter i was conscious that my companion of the voyage was following me when we came to some dark arches that divided old fez from new fez the american spoke and i sent my interpreter ahead you see i am giving myself full tether in this execrable land he said indeed you are i answered well as the romans in rome you knowit was what i came for he said take care i replied take care he drew up shortly and said by the way i ought to be ashamed to meet you i thought he ought but for courtesy i asked him why because he said i have failed to act up to my principles in what i inquired in saving the life of a scoundrel at the risk of my own he answered then he told me his story i left tangier he said with four men in my caravan but it did not suit me to bring them into fez so i dismissed them a days ride from here paying in full for the whole journey and making a present over my generosity was a blunder the moor can not comprehend an act of disinterested kindness and i saw the ruffians lay their heads together to find out what it could mean three of them gave it up and went off home but the fourth determined to follow the trace his name was larby larby el arby my son did you say el arby of tangier too a moor or was he a spanish renegade turned muslim but no matterno matter he was my guide said the american and a most brazen hypocrite always cheating me i let him do so it amused mealways lying to my face and always fumbling his beadsgod forgive me god forgive mean appropriate penance you know the way of it peace sidi said the rascal farewell allah send we meet in paradise but the devil meant that we should meet before that we have met it was a hot moment do you know the hamadsha mosque it is a place in a side street sacred to the preaching of a fanatical follower of one sidi ali bin hamdoosh and to certain wild dances executed in a glass and fire eating frenzy i thought i should like to hear a moorish d l moody and one day i went there as i was going in i met a man coming out it was larby beeba he whispered with a tragic startthat was his own name for me on the journey keep your tongue between your teeth i whispered back i was beeba yesterday today im sidi mohammed then i entered i spread my prayermat chanted my first sura listened to a lusty sermon and came out there as i expected in the blind lane leading from the hamadsha to the town was larby waiting for me beeba said he with a grin you play a double hand of cards then said i take care i dont trump your trick the rascal had thought i might bribe him and when he knew that i would not i saw murder in his face he had conceived the idea of betraying me at the next opportunity at that moment he was as surely aiming at my life as if he had drawn his dagger and stabbed me it was then that i disgraced my principles how how i said though truly i had little need to ask we were alone i tell you in a blind lane said the american but i remembered stories the man had told me of his children little hoolia he called his daughter a pretty blackeyed mite of six who always watched for him when he was away i was breaking into perspiration do you mean i said that you should have i mean that i should have killed the scoundrel there and then said the american god forbid it i cried and my hair rose from my scalp in horror why not said the american it would have been an act of selfdefense the man meant to kill me he will kill me still if i give him the chance what is the difference between murder in a moment and murder after five ten fifteen twenty days only that one is murder in hot blood and haste and the other is murder in cold blood and by stealth is it life that you think so precious then why should i value his life more than i value my own i shivered and could say nothing you think me a monster said the american but remember since we left england the atmosphere has changed remember too i said that this man can do you no harm unless you intrude yourself upon his superstitions again leave the country immediately depend upon it he is following you thats not possible said the american for i am following him until i come up with him i can do nothing and my existence is not worth a pins purchase i shuddered and we parted my mind told me that he was right but my heart clamored above the voice of reason and said you could not do it no not to save a hundred lives ah father how little we know ourselveshow little oh how little when i think that he shrank backhe who held life so cheapwhile ii who held it so dear so sacred so godlikebear with me i will tell all i met the american at intervals during the next six days we did not often speak but as we passed in the streetshe alone i always with my loquacious interpreteri observed with dread the change that the shadow of death hanging over a mans head can bring to pass in his face and manner he grew thin and sallow and wildeyed one day he stopped me and said i know now what your buckshot forster died of and then he went on without another word but about ten days after our first meeting in the slave market he stopped me again and said quite cheerfully he has gone homeim satisfied of that now thank god i answered involuntarily ah he said with a twinkle of the eye who says that a man must hang up his humanity on the peg with his hat in the hospital hall when he goes to be a surgeon if the poet keats had got over the first shock to his sensibilities he might have been the greatest surgeon of his day youll be more careful in future i said not to cross the fanaticism of these fanatics he smiled and asked if i knew the karueein mosque i told him i had seen it it is the greatest in morocco he said the moors say the inner court stands on eight hundred pillars i dont believe them and i mean to see for myself i found it useless to protest and he went his way laughing at my blanched and bewildered face that man i thought is fit to be the hero of a tragedy and he is wasting himself on a farce meanwhile i had a shadow over my own life which would not lift that letter which i had received from home at the moment of leaving tangier had haunted me throughout the journey its brevity its insufficiency its delay and above all its conspicuous omission of all mention of our boy had given rise to endless speculation every dark possibility that fancy could devise had risen before me by way of explanation i despised myself for such weakness but selfcontempt did nothing to allay my vague fears the child was ill i knew it i felt it i could swear to it as certainly as if my ears could hear the labored breathing in his throat nevertheless i went on so much did my philosophy do for me but when i got to fez i walked straightway to the english postoffice to see if there was a letter awaiting me of course there was no letter there i had not reflected that i had come direct from the port through which the mails had to pass and that if the postal courier had gone by me on the road i must have seen him which i had not i was ashamed before my own consciousness but all the same the postoffice saw me every day whatever the direction that i took with my interpreter it led toward that destination in the end and whatever the subject of his ceaseless gabblea very deluge of wordsit was forced to come round at last to the times and seasons of the mails from england these were biweekly with various possibilities of casual arrivals besides fez is a noble city the largest and finest oriental city i had yet seen fit to compare in its own much different way of beauty and of splendor with the great cities of the west the great cities of the earth and of all time but for me its attractions were overshadowed by the gloom of my anxiety the atmosphere of an older world the spirit of the east the sense of being transported to bible times the startling interpretations which the biblical stories were receiving by the events of every daythese brought me no pleasure as for the constant reminders of the presence of islam every hour at every corner the perpetual breath of prayer and praise which filled this land that was corrupt to the core they gave me pain more poignant than disgust the call of the mueddin in the early morning was a daily agony i slept three streets from the karueein minarets but the voice seemed to float into my room in the darkness and coil round my head and ring in my ears always i was awakened at the first sound of the stentorian allahukabar or if i awoke in the silence and thought with a feeling of relief it is over i have slept through it the howling wail would suddenly break in upon my thanksgiving there was just one fact of life in fez that gave me a kind of melancholy joy at nearly every turn of a street my ears were arrested by the multitudinous cackle the broken variousvoiced singsong of a childrens school these moorish schools interested me they were the simplest of all possible institutes consisting usually of a rushcovered cellar two steps down from the street with the teacher the taleb often a halfblind old man squatting in the middle of the floor and his pupils seated about him and all reciting together some passages of the koran the only textbook of education one such school was close under my bedroom window i heard the drone of it as early as seven oclock every morning and as often as i went abroad i stood for a moment and looked in at the open doorway a black boy sat there with a basket for the alms of passersby he was a brighteyed little fellow six or seven years of age and he knew one english phrase only come on he would say and hold up the basket and smile what pathetic interest his sunny face had for me how he would cheer and touch me with what strange memories his voice and laugh would startle me it would be pitiful to tell bear with me i was far from my own darling i was in a strange land i was a weak man for all that i was thought so strong and my one besetting infirmitymore consuming than a mothers lovewas preyed upon by my failing health which in turn was preying upon it and if the sights of the streets brought me pain or pleasure that was akin to pain what of the sights the visions the dreams of my own solitary mind i could not close my eyes in the darkness but i saw my boy his little childghost was always with me he never appeared as i had oftenest seen himlaughing romping and kicking up his legs on the hearthrug sometimes he came as he would do at home after he committed some childish trespass and i had whipped himopening the door of my room and stepping one pace in quietly nervously half fearfully to say goodnight and kiss me at his bedtime and i would lift my eyes and see over the shade of my library lamp his little sober redandwhite face just dried of its recent tears or again sometimes i myself would seem in these dumb dramas of the darkness to go into his room when he was asleep that i might indulge my hungry foolish heart with looks of fondness that the reproving parent could not give and find him sleeping with an open book in his hands which he had made believe to read and then for sheer folly of love i would pick up his wee knickerbockers and turn out its load at either side to see what a boys pockets might be like and discover a curiosity shop of poor little treasuresa knife with a broken blade a nail two marbles a bit of brass some string a screw a crust of bread a cork and a leg of a lobster while i was indulging this weakness the conviction was deepening in my mind that my boy was ill so strong did this assurance become at length that though i was ashamed to give way to it so far as to set my face toward home being yet no better for my holiday i sat down at length to write a letter to wenmani had written to my wife by every mailthat i might relieve my pentup feelings i said nothing to him of my misgivings for i was loth to confess to them having no positive reasons whatever and no negative grounds except the fact that i was receiving no letters but i gave him a full history of my boys case described each stage of it in the past foretold its probable developments in the future indicated with elaborate care the treatment necessary at every point and foreshadowed the contingencies under which it might in the end become malignant and even deadly unless stopped by the operation that i had myself after years of labor found the art of making i spent an afternoon in the writing of this letter and when it was done i felt as if a burden that had been on my back for ages had suddenly been lifted away then i went out alone to post it the time was close to evening prayers and as i walked through the streets the talebs and tradesmen with their prayermats under their arms were trooping into the various mosques going by the karueein mosque i observed that the good muslimeen were entering it by hundreds some special celebration i thought my heart was light my eyes were alert and my step was quick for the first time since my coming to the city fez seemed to me a beautiful place the witchery of the scenes of the streets took hold of me to be thus transported into a world of two thousand years ago gave me the delight of magic when i reached the english postoffice i found it shut up on its shutters behind its iron grating a noticeboard was hung out saying that the office was temporarily closed for the sorting of an incoming mail and the despatch of an outgoing one there was a little crowd of people waiting in frontchiefly moorish servants of english visitorsfor the window to open again and near by stood the horses of the postal couriers pawing the pavement i dropped my letter into the slit in the window and then stood aside to see if the mail had brought anything for me at last the window was thrown up and two letters were handed to me through the grating over the heads of the moors who were crushing underneath i took them with a sort of fear and half wished at the first moment that they might be from strangers they were from home one was from my wifei knew the envelope before looking at the handwritingthe other was from wenman i read wenmans letter first good or bad the news must be broken to me gently hardly had i torn the sheet open when i saw what it contained my little noel had been ill he was still so but not seriously and i was not to be alarmed the silence on their part which i had complained of so bitterly had merely been due to their fear of giving me unnecessary anxiety for his part wenmans he would have written before relying on my manliness and good sense but my wife had restrained him saying she knew me better there was no cause for apprehension the boy was going along as well as could be expected etc etc etc etc etc not a word to indicate the nature and degree of the attack such an insufficient epistle must have disquieted the veriest nincompoop alive to send a thing like that to meto me of all men was there ever so gross a mistake of judgment i knew in an instant what the fact must bemy boy was down with that old congenital infirmity of the throat surely my wife had told me more she had not by design but unwittingly she had revealed the truth to me granville wenman had written to me she said explaining everything and i was not to worry and bother all that was possible was being done for our darling and if i were there i could do no more the illness had to have its course so i must be patient all this is the usual jargon of the surgeryi knew that wenman had dictated itand then a true line or two worth all the rest from my dear girls own bleeding mothers heart our poor noel was this and that he complained of soandso and first began to look unwell in such and such ways it was clear as noonday the attack of the throat which i had foreseen had come five years i had looked for it through five long years i had waited and watched to check it i had labored day and night that when it should come i might meet it my own health i had wastedand for what for fame for wealth for humanity for science no no no but for the life of my boy and now when his enemy was upon him at length where was ii who alone in all this world of god could save him i was thirteen hundred miles from home oh the irony of my fate my soul rose in rebellion against it staggering back through the darkening streets the whole city seemed dead and damned how far i walked in this state of oblivion i do not know but presently out of the vague atmosphere wherein all things had been effaced i became conscious like one awakening after a drug of an unusual commotion going on around people were running past me and across me in the direction of the karueein mosque from that place a loud tumult was rising into the air the noise was increasing with every moment and rising to a babel of human voices i did not very much heed the commotion what were the paltry excitements of life to me now i was repeating to myself the last words of my poor wifes letter how i miss you and wish you were with me i will go back i was telling myself i will go back in the confusion of my mind i heard snatches of words spoken by the people as they ran by me nazarene christian cursed jew these were hissed out at each other by the moors as they were scurrying past at length i heard a spaniard shout up to a fellowcountryman who was on a housetop englishman caught in the mosque at that my disordered senses recovered themselves and suddenly i became aware that the tumult was coming in my direction the noise grew deeper louder and more shrill at every step in another moment it had burst upon me in a whirlpool of uproar round the corner of the narrow lane that led to the karueein mosque a crowd of people came roaring like a torrent they were moors arabs and berbers and they were shouting shrieking yelling and uttering every sound that the human voice can make at the first instant i realized no more than this but at the next i saw that the people were hunting a man as hounds hunt a wolf the man was flying before them he was coming toward me in the gathering darkness i could see him his dress which was moorish was torn into shreds about his body his head was bare his chest was bleeding i saw his faceit was the face of the american my companion of the voyage he saw me too and at that instant he turned about and faced full upon his pursuers what happened then i dare not tell father he was a brave man and he sold his life dearly but he fell at last he was but one to a hundred the yelping human dogs trod him down like vermin i am a coward i fled and left him when i got back to my lodgings i called for my guide for i was resolved to leave fez without an hours delay the guide was not to be found and i had to go in search of him when i lighted on him at length he was in a dingy coffeehouse squatting on the ground by the side of another moor an evillooking scoundrel who was reciting some brave adventure to a group of admiring listeners i called my man out and told him of my purpose he lifted his hands in consternation leave fez tonight he said impossible my sultan impossible my lord has not heard the order what order i asked i was alarmed must i be a prisoner in morocco while my child lay dying in england that the gates be closed and no christian allowed to leave the city until the morning it is the order of the kaleefa my sultan since the outrage of the christian in the mosque this morning i suspected the meaning of this move in an instant and the guides answer to my questions ratified my fears one man out of madness or thirst for revenge had led the attack upon the american and a crowd of fanatics had killed himgiving him no chance of retreat with his life either by circumcision or the profession of islam but cooler heads had already found time to think of the penalty of shedding christian blood that penalty was twofold first the penalty of disgrace which would come of the idea that the lives of christians were not safe in morocco and next the penalty of hard dollars to be paid to the american minister at tangier to escape from the double danger the outrage was to be hushed up circumstances lent themselves to this artifice true that passage of the american across country had been known in every village through which he had passed but at the gates of fez he had himself cut off all trace of his identity he had entered the city alone or in disguise his arrival as a stranger had not been notified at any of the clubs or bazaars only one man had recognized him that man was larby his guide the body was to be buried secretly no christian being allowed to see it then the report was to be given out that the dead man had been a moorish subject that he had been killed in a bloodfued and that the rumor that he was a christian caught in the act of defying the mosque was an error without the shadow of truth in it but until all this had been done no christian should be allowed to pass through the gates as things stood at present the first impulse of a european would be to fly to the consul with the dangerous news i knew something of the moors and their country by this time and i left fez that night but it cost me fifty pounds to get out of it there was a bribe for the kaid a bribe for the kaleefa and bribes for every ragged jack of the underlings down to the porter at the gate with all my horror and the fever of my anxiety i could have laughed in the face of the first of these functionaries between his greedy desire of the present i was offering him his suspicion that i knew something of the identity of the christian who had been killed his misgivings as to the reasons of my sudden flight and his dread that i would discover the circumstances of the americans death the figure he cut was a foolish one but why should i reproach the mans duplicity i was practising the like of it myself too well i knew that if i betrayed any knowledge of what had happened it would be impossible that i should be allowed to leave fez so i pretended to know nothing it was a ridiculous interview on my way back from it i crossed a little company of moors leading surrounding and following a donkey the donkey was heavily laden with what appeared to be two great panniers of rubbish it was dusk but my sight has always been keen and i could not help seeing that hidden under the rubbish there was another burden on the donkeys back it was the body of a dead man i had little doubt of who the dead man must be but i hastened on and did not look again the moors turned into a garden as i passed them i guessed what they were about to do there but my own danger threatened me and i wished to see and know no more as i was passing out of the town in the moonlight an hour before midnight with my grumbling tentmen and muleteers at my heels a man stepped out of the shadow of the gateway arch and leered in my face and said in broken english so your christian friend is corrected by allah moorish english my son or spanish spanish it was the scoundrel whom i had seen in the coffeehouse i knew he must be larby and that he had betrayed his master at last also i knew that he was aware that i had seen all at that moment looking down from my horses back into the mans evil face my whole nature changed i remembered the one opportunity which the american had lost out of a wandering impulse of human tendernessof saving his own life by taking the life of him that threatened it and i said in my heart of hearts now god in heaven keep me from the like temptation ah father do not shrink from me think of it only think of it i was fifteen hundred miles from home and i was going back to my dying boy god keep you indeed my son your feet were set in a slippery place el arby you say a man of your own age dark sallow it must be the same long ago i knew the man you speak of it was under another name and in another country yes he was all you say god forgive him god forgive him poor wrecked and bankrupt soul his evil angel was always at his hand and his good one far away he brought his father to shame and his mother to the grave there was a crime and conviction then banishment and after that his father fled from the world but the church is peace he took refuge with her and all is well go on now iii father i counted it up every mile of the distance i counted it and i reckoned every hour since my wifes letter had been written against the progress and period of my boys disease so many days since the date of the letter and noel had been ailing and ill so many days before that the gross sum of those days was so much and in that time the affection if it ran the course i looked for must have reached such and such a stage while i toiled along over the broad wastes of that desolate land i seemed to know at any moment what the condition must be at the utmost and best of my boy in his bed at home then i reckoned the future as well as the past so many days it would take me to ride to tangier so many hours to cross from tangier to cadiz so many days and nights by rail from cadiz to london the grand total of time past since my poor noel first became unwell and of time to come before i could reach his side would be so much what would his condition be then i knew that also it would be so and so thus step by step i counted it all up the interval would be long very long between the beginning of the attack and my getting home but not too long for my hopes all going well with me i should still arrive in time if the disease had taken an evil turn my boy might perhaps be in its last stages but then i would be there and i could save him the operation which i had spent five years of my life to master would bring him back from the gates of death itself father i had no doubt of that and i had no doubt of my calculations lying here now it seems as if the fiends themselves must have shrieked to see me in that faroff land gambling like a fool in the certainty of the life i loved and reckoning nothing of the hundred poor chances that might snuff it out like a candle call it frenzy call it madness nevertheless it kept my heart alive and saved me from despair but oh the agony of my impatience if anything should stop me now let me be one day lateronly oneand what might not occur then how many were the dangers of delay first there was the possibility of illness overtaking me my health was not better but worse than when i left home i was riding from sunrise to sunset and not sleeping at nights no matter i put all fear from that cause away from me though my limbs refused to bear me up and under the affliction of my nerves my muscles lost the power to hold the reins yet if i could be slung on to the back of my horse i should still go on but then there was the worse danger of coming into collision with the fanaticism of the people through whose country i had to pass i did not fear the fate of the american for i could not be guilty of his folly but i remembered the admission of the english consul at tangier that a stranger might offend the superstitions of the moslems unwittingly i recalled his parting words of counsel spoken half in jest keep out of a moorish prison and the noisome dungeon into which the young berber had been cast arose before my mind in visions of horror what precautions i took to avoid these dangers of delay would be a long and foolish story also it would be a mean and abject one and i should be ashamed to tell it how i saluted every scurvy beggar on the way with the salutation of his faith and country how i dismounted as i approached a town or a village and only returned to the saddle when i had gone through it how i uncovered my headin ignorance of eastern customas i went by a saints house and how at length remembering the jewish banker who was beaten i took off my shoes and walked barefoot as i passed in front of a mosque yes it was i who paid all this needless homage i whose pride has always been my bane i who could not bend the knee to be made a knight i who had felt humility before no man even so it was in my eagerness my impatience my dread of impediment on my journey home to my darling who waited for me there i was studying the faces and groveling at the feet of that race of ignorant fanatics but the worst of my impediments were within my own camp the american was right the moor can not comprehend a disinterested action my foolish homage to their faith awakened the suspicions of my men when they had tried in vain to fathom the meaning of it they agreed to despise me i did not heed their contempt but i was compelled to take note of its consequences from being my servants they became my masters when it pleased them to encamp i had to rest though my inclination was to go on and only when it suited them to set out again could i resume my journey in vain did i protest and plead and threaten the moor is often a brave man but these men were a gang of whitelivered poltroons and a blow would have served to subdue them with visions of a moorish prison before my eyes i dared not raise my hand one weapon alone could i in my own cowardice employ against thembribes bribes bribes such was the sole instrument with which i combated their laziness their duplicity and their deceit father i was a pitiful sight in my weakness and my impatience we had not gone far out of fez when i observed that the man larby was at the heels of our company this alarmed me and i called to my guide alee i said who is that evillooking fellow alee threw up both hands in amazement evillooking fellow he cried god be gracious to my father who does my lord mean not larby no not larby larby is a good man he lives in one of the mosque houses at tangier the nadir leased it to him and he keeps his shop on the sok de barra allah bless larby should you want musk should you want cinnamon larby is the man to sell to you but sometimes he guides christians to fez and then his brother keeps his shop for him but why is the man following us i asked my sultan said alee am i not telling you larby is returning home the christian he took to fez where is he yes i said where is he alee grinned and answered he is gonesouthward my lord why should you lie to me like that i said you know the christian is dead and that this larby was the means of killing him shoo what is my lord saying cried alee lifting his fat hands with a warning gesture what did my lord tell the basha my lord must know nothingnothing it would not be safe then with glances of fear toward larby and dropping his voice to a whisper alee added it is true the christian is dead he died last sunset allah corrected him so larby is going back alone going back to his shop to his house to his wives to his little daughter hoolia allah send larby a safe return not following us sidi no no larby is going back the same waythat is all the answer did not content me but i could say no more nevertheless my uneasiness at the mans presence increased hour by hour i could not think of him without thinking also of the american and of the scene of horror near to the karueein mosque i could not look at him but the blood down my back ran cold so i called my guide again and said send that man away i will not have him in our company alee pretended to be deeply wounded sidi he said ask anything else of me what will you ask will you ask me to die for you i am ready i am willing i am satisfied but larby is my friend larby is my brother and this thing you ask of me i can not do allah has not written it sidi it can not be with such protestationsthe common cant of the countryi had need to be content but now the impression fixed itself upon my mind that the evilfaced scoundrel who had betrayed the american to his death was not only following us but me oh the torment of that idea in the impatience of my spirit and the racking fever of my nerves to be dogged day and night as by a bloodhound never to raise my eyes without the dread of encountering the mans watchful eyethe agony of the incubus was unbearable my first thought was merely that the rascal meant robbery however far i might ride ahead of my own people in the daytime he was always close behind me and as surely as i wandered away from the camp at nightfall i was overtaken by him or else i met him face to face alee i said at last that man is a thief of course alee was horrified ya allah he cried what is my lord saying the moor is no thief the moor is true the moor is honest none so true and honest as the moor wherefore should the moor be a thief to be a thief in barbary is to be a fool say i rob a christian good i kill him and take all he has and bury him in a lonely place all right what happens behold sidi this is what happens your christian consul says where is the christian you took to fez i can not tell i lie i deceive i make excuses no use your christian consul goes to the kasbah and says to the basha cast that moor into prison he is a robber and a murderer then he goes to the sultan at marrakesh in the name of your queen who lives in the country of the nazarenes over the sea pay me twenty thousand dollars he says for the life of my christian who is robbed and murdered just so the sultanallah preserve our mulai hassanhe pays the dollars good all right just so but is that all sidi no sidi that is not all the sultangod prolong the life of our merciful lordhe then comes to my people to my basha to my bashalic and he says pay me back my forty thousand dollarsdo you hear me sidi forty thousandfor the nazarene who is dead all right but we can not pay good the sultanallah save himhe comes he takes all we have he puts every man of my people to the sword we are gone we are wiped out did i not say sidi to be a thief in barbary is to be a fool it was cold comfort that the man larby was following me i was confident and that he meant to rob me i was at first convinced small solace therefore in the thought that if the worst befell me and my boy at home died for want of his father who lay robbed and murdered in those desolate wastes my government would exact a claim in paltry dollars my next thought was that the man was merely watching me out of the country that he was aware that i knew his secret was only too certain that he had betrayed my knowledge to the authorities at the capital after i had parted from them was more than probable and it was not impossible that the very men who had taken bribes of me had in their turn bribed him that he might follow me and see that i did not inform the ministers and consuls of foreign countries of the murder of the american in the streets of fez that theory partly reconciled me to the mans presence let him watch his constant company was in its tormenting way my best security i should go to no minister and no consul should see me i had too much reason to think of my own living affairs to busy myself with those of the dead american but such poor unction as this reflection brought me was dissipated by a second thought what security for the man himself or for the authorities who might have bribed himor perhaps menaced himto watch me would lie in the fact that i had passed out of the country without revealing the facts of the crime which i had witnessed safely back in england i might tell all with safety once let me leave morocco with their secret in my breast and both the penalties these people dreaded might be upon them merely to watch me was wasted labor they meant to do more or they would have done nothing thinking so another idea took possession of me with a shock of terrorthe man was following me to kill me as the sole christian witness of the crime that had been committed by the light of that theory everything became plain when i visited the kasbah nothing was known of my acquaintance with the murdered man my bribes were taken and i was allowed to leave fez in spite of public orders but then came larby with alarming intelligence i had been a friend of the american and had been seen to speak with him in the public streets perhaps larby himself had seen me or perhaps my own guide alee had betrayed me to his friend and brother at that the kaid or his kaleefa had raised their eyebrows and sworn at each other for simpletons and fools to think that the very man who had intended to betray them had come with an innocent face and a tale of a sick child in england to think that they had suffered him to slip through their fingers and leave them some paltry bribes of fifty pounds fifty pounds taken by stealth against twenty thousand dollars to be plumped down after the christian had told his story these nazarenes were so subtle and the sons of ishmael were so simple but diamond cut diamond everything was not lost one hundred and twentyfive miles this christian had still to travel before he could sail from barbary and not another christian could he encounter on that journey then up larby and after him god make your way easy remember larby remember good fellow it is not only the pockets of the people of fez that are in danger if that christian should escape let him leave the gharb alive and your own neck is in peril you were the spy you were the informer you were the hotheaded madman who led the attack that ended in the spilling of christian blood if the sultan should have to pay twenty thousand dollars to the minister for america at tangier for the life of this dead dog whom we have grubbed into the earth in a garden if the basha of fez should have to pay forty thousand dollars to the sultan if the people should have to pay eighty thousand dollars to the basha then you larby you in your turn will have to pay with your life to the people it is your life against the life of the christian so follow him watch him silence him he knows your secretaway such was my notion of what happened at the kasbah of fez after i had passed the gates of the city it was a wild vision but to my distempered imagination it seemed to be a plausible theory and now larby the spy upon the american larby my assassinelect larby who to save his own life must take mine larby was with me was beside me was behind me constantly god help you my son god help you larby o larby again again what was i to do open my heart to larby to tell him it was a blunder that i meant no man mischief that i was merely hastening back to my sick boy who was dying for want of me that was impossible larby would laugh in my face and still follow me bribe him that was useless larby would take my money and make the surer of his victim it was a difficult problem but at length i hit on a solution father you will pity me for a fool when you hear it i would bargain with larby as faust bargained with the devil he should give me two weeks of life and come with me to england i should do my work here and larby should never leave my side my boys life should be saved by that operation which i alone knew how to perform after that larby and i should square accounts together he should have all the money i had in the world and the passport of my name and influence for his return to his own country i should write a confession of suicide and thenand thenonly thenat homehere in my own roomlarby should kill me in order to satisfy himself that his own secret and the secret of his people must be safe forever it was a mad dream but what dream of dear life is not mad that comes to the man whom death dogs like a bloodhound and mad as it was i tried to make it come true the man was constantly near me and on the third morning of our journey i drew up sharply and said larby sidi he answered would you not like to go on with me to england he looked at me with his glittering eyes and i gave an involuntary shiver i had awakened the mans suspicions in an instant he thought i meant to entrap him but he only smiled knowingly shrugged his shoulders and answered civilly i have my shop in the sok de barra sidi and then there are my wives and my sons and my little hooliagod be praised for all his blessings hoolia i asked my little daughter sidi how old is she six sidi only six but as fair as an angel i dare say she misses you when you are away larby i said you have truth sidi she sits in the sok by the tents of the brassworkers and plaits rushes all the day long and looks over to where the camels come by the saints houses on the hill and waits and watches larby i said i too have a child at home who is waiting and watching a boy my little noel six years of age just as old as your own little hoolia and so bright so winsome but he is ill he is dying and he is all the world to me larby i am a surgeon i am a doctor if i could but reach england it was worse than useless i stopped for i could go no farther the cold glitter of the mans eyes passed over me like frost over flame and i knew his thought as well as if he had spoken it i have heard that story before he was telling himself i have heard it at the kasbah and it is a lie and a trick my plan was folly and i abandoned it but i was more than ever convinced of my theory this man was following me to kill me he was waiting an opportunity to do his work safely secretly and effectually his rulers would shield him in his crime for by that crime they would themselves be shielded father my theory like my plan was foolishness only a madman would have dreamt of concealing a crime whereof there was but one witness by a second crime whereof the witnesses must have been five hundred the american had traveled in disguise and cut off the trace of his identity to all men save myself when he died at the hands of the fanatics whose faith he had outraged i alone of all christians knew that it was christian blood that had stained the streets of fez but how different my own death must have been i had traveled openly as a christian and an englishman at the consulate of tangier i was known by name and repute and at that of fez i had registered myself my presence had been notified at every town i had passed through and the men of my caravan would not have dared to return to their homes without me in the case of the murder of the american the chances to the moorish authorities of claim for indemnity were as one to five hundred in the case of the like catastrophe to myself they must have been as five hundred to one thus in spite of fanaticism and the ineradicable hatred of the moslem for the nazarene morocco to me as to all christian travelers traveling openly and behaving themselves properly was as safe a place as england itself but how can a man be hot and cold and wise and foolish in a moment i was in no humor to put the matter to myself temperately and though i had been so cool as to persuade myself that the authorities whom i had bribed could not have been madmen enough to think that they could conceal the murder of the american by murdering me yet i must have remained convinced that larby himself was such a madman as a surgeon i had some knowledge of madness and the cold clear steely glitter of the mans eyes when he looked at me was a thing that i could not mistake i had seen it before in religious monomaniacs it was an infallible and fatal sign with that light in the eyes like the glance of a dagger men will kill the wives they love and women will slaughter the children of their bosom when i saw it in larby i shivered with a chilly presentiment it seemed to say that i should see my home no more i have seen my home once more i am back in england i am here but no no not that larby dont tell me you did that father is my crime so dark that hour comes back and back how long will it haunt me how long for ever and ever when time for me is swallowed up in eternity eternity will be swallowed up in the memory of that hour peace do you say peace ah yes yes god is merciful before i had spoken to larby his presence in our company had been only as a dark and fateful shadow now it was a foul and hateful incubus never in all my life until then had i felt hatred for any human creature but i hated that man with all the sinews of my soul what was it to me that he was a madman he intended to keep me from my dying boy why should i feel tenderness toward him because he was the father of his little hoolia by killing me he would kill my little noel i began to recall the doctrines of the american as he propounded them on the ship it was the life of an honest man against the life of a scoundrel these things should be rated ad valorem if the worst came to the worst why should i have more respect for this madmans life than for my own i looked at the man and measured his strength against mine he was a brawny fellow with broad shoulders and i was no better than a weakling i was afraid of him but i was yet more afraid of myself sometimes i surprised my halfconscious mind in the act of taking out of its silvermounted sheath the large curved knife which i had bought of the hawker at tangier and now wore in the belt of my norfolk jacket in my cowardice and my weakness this terrified me not all my borrowed philosophy served to support me against the fear of my own impulses meantime i was in an agony of suspense and dread the nights brought me no rest and the mornings no freshness on the fourth day out of fez we arrived at wazzan and there though the hour was still early my men decided to encamp for the night i protested and they retorted i threatened and they excused themselves the mules wanted shoeing i offered to pay double that they might be shod immediately the tents were torn by a heavy wind the previous night i offered to buy new ones when their trumpery excuses failed them the men rebelled openly and declared their determination not to stir out of wazzan that night but they had reckoned without their host this time i found that there was an english consul at wazzan and i went in search of him his name was smith and he was a typical englishmanample expansive firm resolute domineering and not troubled with too much sentiment i told him of the revolt of my people and of the tyranny of the subterfuges whereby they had repeatedly extorted bribes the good fellow came to my relief he was a man of purpose and he had no dying child twelve hundred miles away to make him a fool and a coward men he said youve got to start away with this gentleman at sundown and ride night and daydo you hear me night and dayuntil you come to tangier a servant of my own shall go with you and if you stop or delay or halt or go slowly he shall see that every man of you is clapped into the kasbah as a blackmailer and a thief there was no more talk of rebellion the men protested that they had always been willing to travel sidi had been good to them and they would be good to sidi at sundown they would be ready you will have no more trouble sir said the consul but i will come back to see you start i thanked him and we parted it was still an hour before sunset and i turned aside to look at the town i had barely walked a dozen paces when i came face to face with larby in the turmoil of my conflict with the men i had actually forgotten him for one long hour he looked at me with his glittering eyes and then his cold clear gaze followed the consul as he passed down the street that double glance was like a shadowy warning it gave me a shock of terror how had i forgotten my resolve to baffle suspicion by exchanging no word or look with any european minister or consul as long as i remained in morocco the expression in the mans face was not to be mistaken it seemed to say so you have told all very well sidi we shall see with a sense as of creeping and cringing i passed on the shadow of death seemed to have fallen upon me at last i felt myself to be a doomed man that madman would surely kill me he would watch his chance i should never escape him my home would see me no more my boy would die for want of me a tingling noise as of the jangling of bells was in my ears perhaps it was the tinkling of the bells of the watercarriers prolonged and unbroken a gauzy mist danced before my eyes perhaps it was the palpitating haze which the sun cast back from the gilded domes and minarets domes and minarets were everywhere in this town of wazzan it seemed to be a place of mosques and saints houses where the wide arch and the trough of the mosque were not there was the open door in the low whitewashed wall of the saints house surmounted by its white flag in my dazed condition i was sometimes in danger of stumbling into such places unawares at the instant of recovered consciousness i always remembered the warnings of my guide as i stood by the house of sidi gali at tangier sacred place yes sacred no nazarene may enter it but moslems yes moslems may fly here for sanctuary life to the moslem death to the nazarene so it is oh it is an awful thing to feel that death is waiting for you constantly that at any moment at any turn at any corner it may be upon you such was my state as i walked on that evening waiting for the sunset through the streets of wazzan at one moment i was conscious of a sound in my ears above the din of trafficthe arrah of the assdrivers the balak of the men riding mules and the general clamor of tongues it was the steady beat of a footstep close behind me i knew whose footstep it was i turned about quickly and larby was again face to face with me he met my gaze with the same cold glittering look my impulse was to fly at his throat but that i dare not do i knew myself to be a coward and i remembered the moorish prison larby i said what do you want nothing sidi nothing he answered then why are you following me like this following you sidi the fellow raised his eyebrows and lifted both hands in astonishment yes following me dogging me watching me tracking me down what does it mean speak out plainly sidi is jesting he said with a mischievous smile is not this wazzanthe holy city of wazzan sidi is looking at the streets at the mosques at the saints houses so is larby that is all one glance at the mans evil eyes would have told you that he lied which way are you going i asked this way with a motion of the head he indicated the street before him then i am going to this i said and i walked away in the opposite direction i resolved to return to the english consul to tell him everything and claim his protection though all the moorish authorities in morocco were in league with this religious monomaniac yet surely there was life and safety under english power for one whose only offense was that of being witness to a crime which might lead to a claim for indemnity that it should come to this and i of all men should hear it god help me god lead me god give me light light light o god give me light iv full of this new purpose and of the vague hope inspired by it i was making my way back to the house of the consul when i came upon two postal couriers newly arrived from tangier on their way to fez they were drawn up amid a throng of the townspeople before the palace of the grand shereef and with the moorish passion for powderplay they were firing their matchlocks into the air as salute and signal sight of the mailbags slung at their sides and of the shereefs satchel which they had come some miles out of their course to deliver suggested the thought that they might be carrying letters for me which could never come to my hands unless they were given to me now the couriers spoke some little english i explained my case to them and begged them to open their bags and see if anything had been sent forward in my name from tangier to fez true to the phlegmatic character of the moor in all affairs of common life they protested that they dare not do so the bags were tied and sealed and none dare open them if there were letters of mine inside they must go on to fez and then return to tangier but with the usual results i had recourse to my old expedient a bribe broke the seals the bags were searched and two letters were found for me the letters like those that came to fez were one from my wife and one from wenman i could not wait till i was alone but broke open the envelopes and read my letters where i stood a little crowd of moors had gathered about memen youths boys and childrenthe ragged inhabitants of the streets of the holy city they seemed to be chaffing and laughing at my expense but i paid no heed to them just as before so now and for the same reason i read wenmans letter first i remember every word of it for every word seemed to burn into my brain like flame my dear fellow wrote wenman i think it my duty to tell you that your little son is seriously ill i knew iti knew it who knew it so well as i though i was more than a thousand miles away it is a strange fact that he is down with the very disease of the throat which you have for so long a time made your especial study such at least is our diagnosis assisted by your own discoveries the case has now reached that stage where we must contemplate the possibility of the operation which you have performed with such amazing results our only uneasiness arises from the circumstance that this operation has hitherto been done by no one except yourself we have however your explanations and your diagrams and on these we must rely and even if you were here his is not a case in which your own hand should be engaged therefore rest assured my dear fellow etc etc blockheads if they had not done it already they must not do it at all i would telegraph from tangier that i was coming not a case for my hand fools fools it was a case for my hand only i did not stop to read the friendly part of wenmans letter the good souls expression of sympathy and solicitude but in the fever of my impatience sweating at every pore and breaking into loud exclamations i tore open the letter from my wife my eyes swam over the sheet and i missed much at that first reading but the essential part of the message stood out before me as if written in red we so delighted your letters glad you are having warm beautiful weather trust make you strong and well we are having blizzards here snowing today i am sorry to tell you dearest that our darling is very ill it is his throat again this is friday and he has grown worse every day since i wrote on monday when he can speak he is always calling for you he thinks if you were here he would soon be well he is very weak for he can take no nourishment and he has grown so thin poor little fellow but he looks very lovely and every night he says in his prayers god bless papa and bring him safely home i could bear no more the page in my hands was blotted out and for the first time since i became a man i broke into a flood of tears o omnipotent lord of heaven and earth to think that this child is as life of my life and soul of my soul that he is dying that i alone of all men living can save him and that we are twelve hundred miles apart wipe them out o lordwipe out this accursed space dividing us annihilate it thou canst do all thou canst remove mountains and this is but a little thing to thee give me my darling under my hands and i will snatch him out of the arms of death itself did i utter such words aloud out of the great tempest of my trouble i can not say i do not know only when i had lifted my eyes from my wifes letter did i become conscious of where i was and what was going on around me i was still in the midst of the crowd of idlers and they were grinning and laughing and jeering and mocking at the sight of tearsweak womanish stupid tearson the face of a strong man i was ashamed but i was yet more angry and to escape from the danger of an outbreak of my wrath i turned quickly aside and walked rapidly down a narrow alley as i did so a second paper dropped to the ground from the sheet of my wifes letter before i had picked it up i saw what it was it was a message from my boy himself in the handwriting of his nurse he is brighter tonight the good creature herself wrote at the top of the page and he would insist on dictating this letter my dear dear papa when i had read thus far i was conscious again that the yelling barking bleating mob behind were looking after me to avoid the torment of their gaze i hurried on passed down a second alley and then turned into a narrow opening which seemed to be the mouth of a third but i paid small heed to my footsteps for all my mind was with the paper which i wished to read finding myself in a quiet place at length i read it the words were my little darlings own and i could hear his voice as if he were speaking them my dear dear papa i am ill with my throat and sometimes i cant speak last night the ceiling was falling down on me and the fire was coming up to the bed but im werry nearly all right now we are going to have a thanksgiving party soonme and jumbo and scotty the puppy when are you coming home do you live in a tent in morocco i have a fire in my bedroom do you write and send me some foreign stamps from tangier are the little boys black in morocco nurse showed me a picture of a lady who lives there and shes all black except her lips and her mouth stands out have you got a black servant have you got a horse to ride

so thin from your little boy noel come home yes my darling i will come home nothing shall stop me nownothing nothing the sun is almost set everything is ready the men must be saddling the horses again in less than half an hour i shall have started afresh i will ride all night tonight and all day tomorrow and in a week i shall be standing by your side a week how long how long lord of life and death keep my boy alive until then i became conscious that i was speaking hot words such as these aloud even agony like mine has its lucidities of that kind at the same moment i heard footsteps somewhere behind me they were slow and steady footsteps but i knew them too well the blood rushed to my head and back to my heart i looked up and around where was i where where i was in a little court surrounded by low whitewashed walls before me there was an inner compartment roofed by a rude dome from the apex of this dome there floated a tiny white flag i was in a saints house in the confusion of my mind and the agonizing disarray of all my senses i had stumbled into the sacred place unawares the footsteps came nearer they seemed to be sounding on the back of my neck i struggled forward a few paces by a last mechanical resource of despair i tried to conceal myself in the inner chamber i was too late a face appeared in the opening at which i had entered it was larbys face contracted into a grimacing expression i read the thought of the mans face as by a flash of light good sidi good you have done my work as well as my masters you are a dead man no one will know and i need never to lift my hand to you at the next instant the face was gone in the moment following i lived a lifetime my brain did not think it lightened i remembered the death of the american in the streets of fez i recalled the jeering crowd at the top of the alley i reflected that larby was gone to tell the mob that i had dishonored one of their sanctuaries i saw myself dragged out trampled under foot torn to pieces and then smuggled away in the dusk on a donkeys back under panniers of filth my horses ready my men waiting my boy dying for want of me and myself dead in a dunghill great jehovah lend me thy strength i cried as i rushed out into the alley larby was stealing away with rapid steps i overtook him i laid hold of him by the hood of his jellab he turned upon me all my soul was roused to uncontrollable fury i took the man in both my arms i threw him off his feet i lifted him by one mighty effort high above my shoulders and flung him to the ground he began to cry out and i sprang upon him again and laid hold of his throat i knew where to grip and not a sound could he utter we were still in the alley and i put my left hand into the neck of his kaftan and dragged him back into the saints house he drew his dagger and lunged at me i parried the thrust with my foot and broke his arm with my heel then there was a moment of horrible bedazzlement red flames flashed before me my head grew dizzy the whole universe seemed to reel beneath my feet the man was doubled backward across my knee i had drawn my knifei knew where to strikeand for my boy my boy i cried in my heart it was done the man died without a groan his body collapsed in my hands rolled from my knee and fell at my feetdoubled up the head under the neck the broken arm under the trunk in a heap a heap oh oh larby larby then came an awful revulsion of feeling for a moment i stood looking down overwhelmed with the horror of my act in a sort of drunken stupor i gazed at the wideopen eyes and the grimacing face fixed in its hideousness by the convulsion of death o god o god what had i done what had i done but i did not cry out in that awful moment an instinct of selfpreservation saved me the fatal weapon dropped from my hand and i crept out of the place my great strength was all gone now i staggered along and at every step my limbs grew more numb and stiff but in the alley i looked around i knew no way back to my people except that way by which i came down the other alley and through the crowd of idlers i must go would they be there still if so would they see in my face what i had done i was no criminal to mask my crime in a dull stupid drowsy comatose state i tottered down the alley and through the crowd they saw me they recognized me i knew that they were jeering at me but i knew no more skairi shouted one and shairi shouted another and as i staggered away they all shouted skairi together father they called me a drunkard i was a drunkard indeed but i was drunk with blood the sun had set by this time its last rays were rising off the gilded top of the highest minaret in a golden mist that looked like flame leaping out of a kiln i saw that as i saw everything through a palpitating haze when at length i reached the place where i had left my people i found the horses saddled the mules with their burdens packed on their panniers the men waiting and everything ready full well i knew that i ought to leap to my seat instantly and be gone without delay but i seemed to have lost all power of prompt action i was thinking of what i wanted to do but i could not do it the men spoke to me and i know that i looked vacantly into their faces and did not answer one said to another sidi is growing deaf the other touched his forehead and grinned i was fumbling with the stirrup of my saddle when the english consul came up and hailed me with cheerful spirits by an effort that was like a spasm i replied allow me doctor he said and he offered his knee that i might mount ah no no i stammered and i scrambled to my seat while i was fumbling with my double rein i saw that he was looking at my hand youve cut your fingers doctor he said there was blood on them the blood was not mine but a sort of mechanical cunning came to my relief i took out my handkerchief and made a pretense to bind it about my hand alee the guide was at my right side settling my lumbering foot in my stirrup i felt him touch the sheath of my knife and then i remembered that it must be empty sidi has lost his dagger he said look the consul who had been on my left wheeled round by the horses head glanced at the useless sheath that was stuck in the belt of my jacket and then looked back into my stupid face sidi is ill he said quietly ride quickly my men lose no time get him out of the country without delay i heard alee answer rightall right then the consuls servant rode uphe was a berberand took his place at the head of our caravan all ready asked the consul in arabic ready the men answered then away as if you were flying for your lives the men put spurs to their mules alee gave the lash to my horse and we started goodby doctor cried the consul may you find your little son better when you reach home i shouted some incoherent answers in a thick loud voice and in a few minutes more we were galloping across the plain outside the town the next two hours are a blank in my memory in a kind of drunken stupor i rode on and on the gray light deepened into the darkness of night and the stars came out still we rode and rode the moon appeared in the southern sky and rose into the broad whiteness of the stars overhead then consciousness came back to me and with it came the first pangs of remorse through the long hours of that night ride one awful sight stood up constantly before my eyes it was the sight of that dead body stark and cold lying within that little sanctuary behind me white now with the moonlight and silent with the night o larby larby you shamed me you drove me from the world you brought down your mother to the grave and yet and yetmust i absolve your murderer father i reached my home at last at gibraltar i telegraphed that i was coming and at dover i received a telegram in reply four days had intervened between the despatch of my message and the receipt of my wifes anything might have happened in that time and my anxiety was feverish stepping on to the admiralty pier i saw a telegraph boy bustling about among the passengers from the packet with a telegram in his hand what name i asked he gave one that was not my own and yet sounded like it i looked at the envelope clearly the name was intended for mine i snatched the telegram out of the boys hand it ran welcome home boy very weak but not beyond hope i think i read the words aloud amid all the people so tremendous was my relief and so overwhelming my joy the messenger got a gold coin for himself and i leaped into the train at charing cross i did not wait for my luggage but gave a foolish tip to a porter and told him to send my things after me within half a minute of my arrival i was driving out of the station what i suffered during those last moments of waiting before i reached my house no tongue of man could tell i read my wifes telegram again and observed for the first time that it was now six hours old six hours they were like six days to my tortured mind from the moment when we turned out of oxford street until we drew up at my own door in wimpole street i did not once draw breath and being here i dared hardly lift my eyes to the window lest the blinds should be down i had my latchkey with me and i let myself in without ringing a moment afterward i was in my darlings room my beloved wife was with our boy and he was unconscious that did not trouble me at all for i saw at a glance that i was not too late throwing off my coat i sent to the surgery for my case dismissed my dear girl with scant embraces drew my darlings cot up to the window and tore down the curtains that kept out the light for the spring day was far spent then being alone with my darling i did my work i had trembled like an aspen leaf until i entered his room but when the time came my hand was as firm as a rock and my pulse beat like a childs i knew i could do it and i did it god had spared me to come home and i had kept my vow i had traveled ten days and nights to tackle the work but it was a short task when once begun after i had finished i opened the door to call my wife back to the room the poor soul was crouching with the boys nurse on the threshold and they were doing their utmost to choke their sobs there i cried theres your boy hell be all right now the mischief was removed and i had never a doubt of the childs recovery my wife flung herself on my breast and then i realized the price i had paid for so much nervous tension all the nerves of organic life seemed to collapse in an instant im dizzy lead me to my room i said my wife brought me brandy but my hand could not lift the tumbler to my mouth and when my dear girls arms had raised my own the glass rattled against my teeth they put me to bed i was donedone god will forgive him why should not i father that was a month ago and i am lying here still it is not neurasthenia of the body that is killing me but neurasthenia of the soul no doctors drug will ever purge me of that it is here like fire in my brain and here like ice in my heart was my awful act justifiable before god was it right in the eyes of him who has written in the tables of his law thou shalt do no murder was it murder was it crime if i outraged the letter of the holy edict did i also wrong its spirit speak speak for pitys sake speak have mercy upon me as you hope for mercy think where i was and what fate was before me would i do it again in spite of all yes yes a thousand thousand times yes i will go to god with that word on my lips and he shall judge me and yet i suffer these agonies of doubt life was always a sacred thing to me god gave it and only god should take it away he who spilt the blood of his fellowman took the government of the world out of gods hands and thenand thenfather have i not told you all yes yes the father of all fathers will pardon him on the day when i arrived at tangier from fez i had some two hours to wait for the french steamer from malaga that was to take me to cadiz in order to beguile my mind of its impatience i walked through the town as far as the outer sokthe sok de barra it was market day thursday and the place was the same animated and varied scene as i had looked upon before crushing my way through the throng i came upon the saints house near the middle of the market the sight of the little white structure with its white flag brought back the tragedy i saw enacted there and the thought of that horror was now made hellish to my conscience by the memory of another tragedy at another saints house i turned quickly aside and stepping up to the elevated causeway that runs in front of the tents of the brassworkers i stood awhile and watched the jewish workmen hammering the designs on their trays presently i became aware of a little girl who was sitting on a bundle of rushes and plaiting them into a chain she was a tiny thing six years of age at the utmost but with the sober look of a matron her sweet face was the color of copper and her quiet eyes were deep blue a yellow gown of some light fabric covered her body but her feet were bare she worked at her plaiting with steady industry and as often as she stopped to draw a rush from the bundle beneath her she lifted her eyes and looked with a wistful gaze over the feedingground of the camels and down the lane to the bridge and up by the big house on the hillside to where the sandy road goes off to fez the little demure figure amid so many romping children interested and touched me this was noticed by a jewish brassworker before whose open booth i stood and he smiled and nodded his head in the direction of the little woman dear little sobersides i said does she never play with other children no said the jew she sits here every day and all day longthat is when her father is away whose child is she i asked an awful thought had struck me a great rascals the jew answered though the little one is such an angel he keeps a spice shop over yonder but he is a guide as well as a merchant and when he is out on a journey the child sits here and waits and watches for his coming home again she can catch the first sight of travelers from this place and she knows her father at any distance seedo you know where shes looking now over the road by el minzahthats the way from fez her father has gone there with a christian the sweat was bursting from my forehead whats his name i asked the moors call him larby said the jew and the christians nickname him ananias they say he is a spanish renegade escaped from ceuta who witnessed to the prophet and married a moorish wife but hes everything to the little onebless her innocent face look do you see the tiny brown dish at her side thats for her drinking water she brings it full every day and also a little cake of bread for her dinner shes never tired of waiting and if larby does not come home tonight shell be here in the morning i do believe that if anything happened to larby she would wait until doomsday my throat was choking me and i could not speak the jew saw my emotion but he showed no surprise i stepped up to the little one and stroked her glossy black hair hoolia i said she smiled back into my face and answered iyyehyes i could say no more i dare not look into her trustful eyes and think that he whom she waited for would never come again i stooped and kissed the child and then fled away god show me my duty the priest or the manwhich listen do you hear him thats the footstep of my boy overhead my darling he is well again now my little sunny laddie he came into my bedroom this morning with a hop skip and a jumpa gleam of sunshine poor innocent thoughtless boy they will take him into the country soon and he will romp in the lanes and tear up the flowers in the garden my son my son he has drained my life away he has taken all my strength do i wish that i had it back yes but onlyyes only that i might give it him again hark thats his voice thats his laughter how happy he is when i think how soonhow very soonwhen i think that i god sees all he is looking down on little hoolia waiting waiting waiting where the camels come over the hills and on my little noel laughing and prancing in the room above us father i have told you all at last there are tears in your eyes father you are crying tell me then what hope is left you know my sin and you know my suffering did i do wrong did i do right my son gods law was made for man not man for his law if the spirit has been broken where the letter has been kept the spirit may be kept where the letter has been broken your earthly father dare not judge you to your heavenly father he must leave both the deed and the circumstance it is for him to justify or forgive if you are innocent he will place your hand in the hand of him who slew the egyptian and yet looked on the burning bush and if you are guilty he will not shut his ears to the cry of your despair he has gone i could not tell him it would have embittered his parting hour it would have poisoned the wine of the sacrament o larby larby flesh of my flesh my sorrow my shame my prodigalmy son end of the last confession
