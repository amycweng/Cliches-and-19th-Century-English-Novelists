or swim ill darken your doors no more the lady and gentleman who blazed at each other with these burning words which were pointed and driven home by flashing eyes and quivering lips were newlymarried husband and wife they were staying at the old castle mona in douglas isle of man and their honeymoon had not yet finished its second quarter the gentleman was captain davy quiggin commonly called captn davy a typical manx seadog thirty years of age stalwart stout shaggy lustylunged with the tongue of a trooper the heavy manners of a bear the stubborn head of a stupid donkey and the big soft heart of the baby of a girl the lady was ellen kinvig known of old to all and sundry as nelly ness or nell but now to everybody concerned as mistress captn davy quiggin sixandtwenty years of age tall comely as blooming as the gorse once as free as the air and as racy of the soil as newcut peat but suddenly grown stately smooth refined proud and reserved they loved each other to the point of idolatry and yet they parted ten days after marriage with these words of wroth and madness something had come between them what was it another man no another woman still no what then a ghost an intangible almost an invisible but very real and divorcemaking corespondent they call it education davy quiggin was born in a mud house on the shore near the old church at ballaugh the house had one room only and it had been the livingroom sleepingroom birthroom and deathroom of a family of six davy who was the youngest saw them all out the last to go were his mother and his grandfather they lay ill at the same time and died on the one day the old man died first and davy fixed up a herringnet in front of him where he lay on the settle by the fire so that his mother might not see him from her place on the bed not long after that davy who was fifteen years of age went to live as farm lad with kinvig of ballavolley kinvig was a solemn person very stiff and starchy and sententious in his way a mighty man among the methodists and a power in the pulpit he thought he had done an act of charity when he took davy into his home and davy repaid him in due time by falling in love with nelly his daughter when that happened davy never quite knew thats the way of it he used to say a girl slips in and there ye are nelly was in to a certainty when one night davy came home late from the club meeting on the street and rapped at the kitchen window that was the signal of the home circle that some member of it was waiting at the door now there are ways and ways of rapping at a kitchen window there is the pitapat of a light heart and the thudthud of a heavy one and there is the sharp crackcrack of haste and the dithering quewewe of fear davy had a rap of his own and nelly knew it there was a sort of a trip and dance and a rumtumtum in davys rap that always made nellys heart and feet leap up at the same instant but on this unlucky night it was nellys mother who heard it and opened the door what happened then was like the dismal sneck of the outside gate to davy for ten years thereafter the porch was dark and so was the little square lobby behind the door on numerous other nights that had been an advantage in davys eyes but on this occasion he thought it a snare of the evil one seeing something white in a petticoat he thew his arms about it and kissed and hugged it madly it struck him at the time as strange that the arms he held did not clout him under the chin and that the lips he smothered did not catch breath enough to call him a gawbie and whisper that the old people inside were listening the truth dawned on him in a moment and then he felt like a man with an eel crawling down his back and he wanted nothing else for supper it was summer time and davy though a most accomplished sleeper found no difficulty in wakening himself with the dawn next morning he was cutting turf in the dubs of the curragh just then and he had four hours of this pastime with spells of sober meditation between before he came up to the house for breakfast then as he rolled in at the porch and stamped the water out of his longlegged boots he saw at a glance that a thundercloud was brewing there nelly was busy at the long table before the window laying the bowls of milk and the deep plates for the porridge her print frock was as sweet as the may blossom her cheeks were nearly as red as the red rose and like the rose her head hung down she did not look at him as he entered neither did mrs kinvig who was bending over the pot swung from the hook above the fire and working the porridgestick round and round with unwonted energy but kinvig himself made up for both of them the big man was shaving before a lookingglass propped up on the table and against the pilgrims progress and clarks commentaries his left hand held the point of his nose aside between the tip of his thumb and first finger while the other swept the razor through a hillock of lather and revealed a portion of a mouth twisted threequarters across his face but the moment he saw davy he dropped the razor and looked up with as much dignity as a man could get out of a countenance half covered with soap come in sir said he with a pretense of great deference mawther he said twisting to mrs kinvig just wipe down a chair for the gentleman davy slithered into his seat im in for it he thought theyre telling me said kinvig that there is a fortune coming at you aw yes though and that youre taking notions on a farmers girl respectable man tooone of the first thats going with sixty acres at him and more amazing thick theyre telling me kissing behind the door and the like of that the capers it was only yesterday you came to me with nothing on your back but your fathers ould trowis cut down at the knees nelly slipped out her mother made a noise with the porridgepot davy was silent kinvig walloped his razor on the strop with terrific vigor then paused pointed the handle in davys direction tried to curl up his lip into a withering sneer that was half lost in the lather and said with bitter irony my house is too mane for you sir you must lave me it isnt the isle of man itself thatll hould the likes of you then davy found his tongue youre right sir said he leaping to his feet its too poor i am for your daughter is it maybe ill be a piece richer someday and then youll be a taste civiler behold ye now said kinvig as bould as a goat cut your stick and quick im off sir said davy and then looking round and remembering that he was being kicked out like a dog and would see nelly no more day by day the devil took hold of him and he began to laugh in kinvigs ridiculous face goodby ould sukee he cried i lave you to your texes and turning to where mrs kinvig stood with her back to him he cried again goodby mawther take care of his ould headits swelling so much that his chapel hat is putting corns on it that night with his chiss of clothes on his shoulders davy came down stairs and went out at the porch there he slipped his burden to the ground for somebody was waiting to say farewell to him it was the right petticoat this time and she was on the right side of the door the stars were shining overhead but two that were better than any in the sky were looking into davys face and they were twinkling in tears it was only a moment the parting lasted but a world of love was got into it davy had to do penance for the insults he had heaped upon nellys father and in return he got pity for those that had been shoveled upon himself goodby nell he whispered theres thistles in everybodys crop but no matter ill come back and then its married well be my goodness yes and take ballacry and have six bases and ten pigs and a pony but nelly will ye wait for me dye doubt me davy no but will ye though yes then its all serene said davy and with another hug and a kiss and a lock of brown hair which was cut ready and tied in blue ribbon he was gone with his chest into the darkness davy sailed in an irish schooner to the pacific coast of south america there he cut his stick again and got a berth on a coasting steamer trading between valparaiso and callao the climate was unhealthy the ports were foul the government was uncertain the dangers were constant and the hands above him dropped off rapidly in two years davy was skipper and in three years more he was sailing a steamer of his own then the money began to tumble into his chest like crushed oats out of a crowns shaft the first hundred pounds he had saved he sent home to dumbells bank because he could not trust it out of the isle of man but the hundreds grew to thousands and the thousands to tens of thousands and to send all his savings over the sea as he made them began to be slow work like supping porridge with a pitchfork he put much of it away in paper rolls at the bottom of his chest in the cabin and every roll he put by stood to him for something in the isle of man thats a new cowhouse at ballavolly thats balladry thats ould brews mill at sulbyhell be out by this time all his dreams were of coming home and sometimes he wrote letters to nelly the writing in them was uncertain and the spelling was doubtful but the love was safe enough and when he had poured out his heart in small is and capital us he always inquired how more material things were faring hows the herrings this sayson and did the men do well with the mackrel at kinsale and is the cowhouse new thatched and hows the chapel going and is the ould man still playing hang with the texes kinvig heard of davys prosperity and received the news at first in silence then with satisfaction and at length with noisy pride his boy was a bould fellow none o yer randytandytissimeetea tied to the old mawthers apronstrings about him hes coming home rich and hell buy half the island over and make a donation of a harmonia to the chapel and kick ould cowley and his fiddle out awaiting that event kinvig sent nelly to england to be educated according to the station she was about to fill nelly was four years in liverpool but she had as many breaks for visits home the first time she came she minced her words affectedly and kinvig whispered the mother that she was getting a fine english tongue at her the second time she came she plagued everybody out of peace by correcting their plaze to please and the mate to meat and the lave to leave the third time she came she was silent and looked ashamed and the fourth time it was to meet her sweetheart on his return home after ten years absence davy came by the sneafell from liverpool it was augustthe height of the visiting seasonand the deck of the steamer was full of tourists davy walked through the cobweb of feet and outstretched legs with the face of a man who thought he ought to speak to everybody fifty times in the first three hours he went forward to peer through the wind and the glaring sunshine for the first glimpse of the isle of man when at length he saw it like a gray bird lying on the waters far away with the suns light tipping the hilltops like a feathery crest he felt so thick about the throat that he took six steerage passengers to the bar below to help him to get rid of his hoarseness there was a brass band aboard and during the trip they played all the outlandish airs of germany but just as the pacquet steamed into douglas bay and davy was watching the land and remembering everything upon it and shouting thats castle mona theres fort ann yonders ould st mathewss they struck up home sweet home that was too much for davy he dived into his breeches pockets gave every german of the troupe five shillings apiece and then sat down on a coil of rope and blubbered aloud like a baby kinvig had sent a grand landau from ramsey to fetch captn davy to ballaugh but before the english driver from the mitre had identified his fare davy had recognized an old crony with a high springless country cartbilliam ballaneddan who had come to douglas to dispatch a barrel of salted herrings to his married daughter at liverpool and was going back immediately so davy tumbled his boxes and bags and other belongings into the landau piling them mountains high on the cushioned seats and clambered into the cart himself then they set off at a race which should be home firstthe cart or the carriage the luggage or the owner of it the english driver on his box seat with his tall hat and starchy cravat or billiam twidling his rope reins and davy on the plank seat beside him bobbing and bumping and rattling over the stones like a parched pea on a frying pan that was a tremendous drive for davy he shouted when he recognized anything and as he recognized everything he shouted throughout the drive they took the road by old braddan church and union mills past st johns under the tynwald hill and down creg willies hill as he approached kirk michael his excitement was intense he was nearing home and he began to know the people lord save us theres tommy billbeghow do tommy and theres ould betty my gough shes in yethow do mawther theres little juan caine growed up to a man how do johnny and hows the girls and hows the ould man and hows yourself goodness me heres liza corlett and a baby at her i knew her when she was no more than a babby herself this last remark to the english driver who was coming up sedately with his landau at the tail of the springless cart drive on billiam come up ould girljust a taste of the whip billiam do her no harm at all bishops court deary me the ould house is in the same place still at length the square tower of ballaugh church was seen above the trees with the last rays of the setting sun on its topmost story and then davys eagerness swept down all his patience he jumped up in the cart at the peril of being flung out took off his billycock whirled it round his head bellowed hurrah hurrah hurrah after that he would have leaped alongside to the ground and run hould hard he cried ill bate the best mare thats going but billiam pinned him down to the seat with one hand while he whipped up the horse to a gallop with the other they arrived at ballavolly an hour and a half before they were expected mistress kinvig was washing dishes in a tub on the kitchen table kinvig himself was sitting lame with rheumatism in the elber chair by the ingle they wiped down a chair for davy this time and nelly said davy wheres nelly shes coming captn said kinvig nelly he called up the kitchen stairs with a knowing wink at davy heres a gentleman asking after you davy was dying of impatience would she be the same dear old nell nellnelly he shouted ive kep my word aw give her time captn said kinvig a new frock isnt rigged up in no time not to spake of a silk handkercher going pinning round your throat but davy who had waited ten years would not wait a minute longer and he was making for the stairs with the purpose of invading nells own bedroom when the lady herself came sweeping down on tiptoes davy saw her coming in a cloud of silk and at the next moment the slippery stuff was crumbling and whisking and creaking under his hands for his arms were full of it aw mawther said he theyre like honeysucklesdont spake to me for a week manys the time ive been lying in my bunk atwigging the rats squeaking and coorting overhead and thinking to myself kisses is skess with you now davy the wedding came off in a week there were terrific rejoicings the party returned from church in the landau that brought up davys luggage at the bridge six strapping fellows headed by the blacksmith and surrounded by a troop of women and children stretched a rope across the road and would not let the horses pass until the bridegroom had paid the toll davy had prepared himself in advance with two pounds in sixpenny bits which made his trowsers pockets stand out like a couple of cannon balls he fired those balls and they broke in the air like shells at the wedding breakfast in the barn at ballavolly davy made a speech it was a sermon to young fellows on the subject of sweethearts dont you marry for land said he its muck said he what dye say billiamyoud like more of it i wouldnt trust but its spaking the truth i am for all maybe you think about some dirty ould trouss shes a warm girl shes got nice things at herbases and pigs and the like of that but dont if yourr not a reglar blundering blockit then looking down at the top of nellys head where she sat with her eyes in her lap beside him he softened down to sentiment and said marry for love boys stick to the girl thats good and then go where you will shell be the star above that youll sail your barque by and if you stay at home and theres no place like it her parting kiss at midnight will be helping you through your work all next day the parting kiss at midnight brought davys oration to a close for a tug at his coattails on nellys side fetched him suddenly to his seat two hours afterward the landau was rolling away toward the castle mona hotel at douglas where by nells arrangement captn davy and his bride were to spend their honeymoon chapter ii now it so befell that on the very day when captn davy and mrs quiggin quarreled and separated two of their friends were by their urgent invitation crossing from england to visit them davys friend was jonathan lovibond an englishman whose acquaintance he had made on the coast mrs quiggins was jenny crow a young lady of lively manners whom she had annexed during her four years residence at liverpool these two had been lovers five years before had quarreled and parted on the eve of the time appointed for their marriage and had not since set eyes on each other they met for the first time afterward on the steamer that was taking them to the isle of man and neither knew the destination of the other miss crow looked out of her twinkling eyes and saw a gentleman promenading on the quarterdeck before her whom she must have thought she had somewhere seen before but that his gigantic black mustache was a puzzle and the little imperial on his chin was a baffling difficulty mr lovibond puffed the smoke from a colossal cigar and wondered if the world held two pair of eyes like those big black ones which glanced up at him sometimes from a deck stool a puffy pile of wool two long crochet needles and a couple of white hands from which there flashed a diamond ring he somehow thought he knew these mutual meditations lasted two long hours and then a runaway ball of the wool from the lap of the lady on the deck stool was hotly pursued by the gentleman with the mustache and instantly all uncertainty was at an end after exclamations of surprise at the strange recognition it was all so sudden the two old friends came to closer quarters they touched gingerly on the past had some tender passages of delicate fencing gave various sly hits and digs threw out certain subtle hints and came to a mutual and satisfactory understanding neither had ever looked at anybody else since their rupture and therefore both were still unmarried having reached this stage of investigation the wool and its needles were stowed away in a basket under the chair in order that the lady might accept the invitation of the gentleman to walk with him on the deck and as the wind had freshened by this time and walking in skirts was like tacking in a stiff breeze the gentleman offered his arm to the lady and thus they sailed forth together and with whom are you to stay when we reach the island jenny said lovibond with a young manx friend lately married said jenny thats strange for i am going to do the same said lovibond where at castle mona said jenny thats stranger still for its the place to which i am going said lovibond whats your manx friends name mrs quiggin now said jenny thats strangest of all said lovibond for my friend is captain quiggin and we are bound for the same place on the same errand this series of coincidences thawed down the remaining frost between the pair and they exchanged mutual confidences they had gone so far as to promise themselves a fortnights further enjoyment of each others society when their arrival at douglas put a sudden end to their anticipations two carriages were waiting for them on the pierone with a maid inside was to take jenny to castle mona the other with a boy was to take lovibond to fort ann the maid was peggy quine seventeen years of age of dark complexion nearly as round as a dolleytub and of deadly earnest temperament when jenny found herself face to face and alone with this person she lost no time in asking how it came to pass that mrs quiggin was at castle mona while her husband was at fort ann theyve parted maam said peggy parted shrieked jenny above the rattle of the carriage glass ah yes maam peggy stammered cruel maam right cruel cruel extraordinary its a wonder the captn doesnt think shame of his conduck the poor misthress shes clane heartbroken its a mercy to me she didnt clout him in two minutes more jenny was in mrs quiggins room at castle mona crying gracious me ellen what is this your maid tells me nelly had been eating out her heart in silence all day long and now the flood of her pride and wrath burst out and she poured her wrongs upon jenny as fiercely as if that lady stood for the transgressions of her husband he reproached me with my poverty she cried what well he told me i had only married him for his moneytheres not much difference and what did you say said jenny say what could i say what would any woman say who had any respect for herself but how did he come to accuse you of marrying him for his money had you asked him for any not i indeed perhaps you hadnt loved him enough not that eitherthat i know of then why did he say it just because i wanted him to respect himself and have some respect for his wife too and behave as a gentleman and not as a raw manx rabbit from the calf jenny gave a look of amused intelligence and said oh oh i see i see well let me take off my bonnet at all events while this was being done in the bedroom nelly who was furtively wiping her eyes continued the recital of her wrongs would you believe it jenny the first thing he did when we arrived here after the wedding was to shake hands with the hall porter and the boots who took our luggage and ask after their sisters and their mothers and their sweetheartsthe man knew them all and when he heard from his boy willie quarrie that the cook was a person from michael it was as much as i could do to keep him from tearing down to the kitchen to talk about old times yes i see said jenny he has made a fortune but he is just the same simple manx lad that he was ten years ago just just we cant go out for a walk together but he shouts how do fine day mates to the drivers of the hackney cabs across the promenade and the joy of his life is to get up at seven in the morning and go down to the quay before breakfast to keep tally with a chalk for the fishermen counting their herrings out of the boats into the barrels not a bit changed then since he went away said jenny before the glass not a bit and because i asked him to know his place and if he is a gentleman to behave as a gentleman and speak as a gentleman and not make so easy with such as dont respect him any the better for it he turns on me and tells me ive only married him for his money dreadful said jenny fixing her fringe and is this the old sweetheart you have waited ten years for indeed it is and now that he has come back and youve married him he has parted from you in ten days yes and it will be the talk of the islandindeed it will shocking and so he has left you here on your honeymoon without a penny to bless yourself oh for the matter of that he fixed something on me before the weddinga jointure the advocates called it terrible let me see hes the one who sent you presents from america oh he piled presents enough on me its the way of the men the stingiest will do that they like to think theyre such generous creatures but let a poor woman count on it and shell soon be wakened from her dream you married me for my moneydeny it fearful jenny was leaning her forehead against the window sash and looking vacantly out on the bay nelly observed her a moment stopped suddenly in the tale of her troubles and said in another voice jenny crow i believe you are laughing at me its always the way with you you can take nothing seriously jenny turned back to the room with a solemn face and said nellie if you waited ten years for your husband i suppose that he waited ten years for you i suppose he did and if he is the same man as he was when he went away i suppose his love is the same then how could he say such things and if he is the same and his love is the same isnt it possible that somebody else is different now jenny crow you are going to say its all my fault not all nelly something has come between you its the money oh jenny if you ever marry marry a poor man and then he cant fling it in your face that you are poorer than he no it cant be the money nelly for the money is his and yet it hasnt changed him and nelly isnt it a good thing in a rich man not to turn his back on his old poor comradesnot to think because he has been in the sun that people are black who are only in the shadenot to pretend to have altered his skin because his coat has changedisnt it i see what you mean you mean that ive driven my husband away with my bad temper no not that but nellydear old nellthink what youre doing take warning from one who once made shipwreck of her own life think no man common who loves youno matter what his ways are or his manners or his speech love makes the true nobility it ennobles him who loves you and you who are beloved cling to itprize itdo not throw it away money can not buy it nor fame nor rank atone for it when a woman is loved she is a queen and he who loves her is her king mrs quiggin was weeping behind her hands by this time but she lifted swollen eyes to say i see you would have me go to him and submit and explain and beg his pardon dear david i didnt marry you for your money no leaping to her feet ill scrub my fingers to the bone first but nelly say no more jenny crow were hotheaded people both of us and well quarrel then jennys solemn manner was gone in an instant she snapped her fingers kicked up one leg a little and said lightly very well and now let us have some dinner meantime lovibond was hearing the other side of the story from captain davy at forte ann on the way there he had heard of the separation from the boy willie quarrie a lugubrious manx lad eighteen years old with a face as white as a haddock and as grim as a gannet aw terrble doings sir terrble terrble moaned willie young mistress quiggin ateing

soon as they were alone he said but whats this that your boy tells me captain im foundered said davy broke wrecked the screw of my tides gone twisting on the rocks im done mate im done then he

whats left to do why take it back said lovibond no deng my buttons if i will why not cause its true lovibond waited again and then said in another voice and is this the little girl you used to tell of

said noyesnowell it is and it isnt its nelly kinvig thats sarten sure but the juice of the womans sowls dried up the little thing that used to know your rap at the kitchen window and come tripping out

said i darnt say no the one that stuck to you like wax when her father gave you the great bounce outeh davy wriggled and spat and then muttered you go bail you have known her since you were children

dying to love said jenny colney hatch is nothing to it said lovibond smaller things have parted people for years said jenny yes five years said lovibond the longer apart the wider the breach and the

other through other eyes the very thing said lovibond then why dont you give me your arm at once and let me think me over said jenny in less than an hour these two wise heads had devised a scheme to bring captn davy and his bride together what that scheme was and how it worked let those who read discover chapter iii six days passed as with feet of lead and captn davy and mrs quiggin were still in douglas they could not tear themselves away morning and night the good souls were seized by a morbid curiosity about their servants sweethearts seen peggy lately captn davy would say i suppose youve not come across willie quarrie lately mrs quiggin would ask thus did they squeeze to the driest pulp every opportunity of hearing anything of each other jenny crow with mrs quiggin at castle mona had not yet set eyes on captain davy and lovibond with captain davy at fort ann had never once seen mrs quiggin jenny had said nothing of lovibond to nelly and lovibond had said nothing of jenny to davy

never a hapoth maam deed no but terble onaisy at it and rigging him constant but no use at all at all the captns intarmined to ruin hisself somebody should just take him and wallop him ding dong afore hes wasted all hes got and hasnt a penny left at him how dare you peggy peggy was dismissed in anger and mrs quiggin sat down to write a letter to lovibond she begged him to pardon the liberty of one who was no stranger though they had never met in asking him to come to her without delay this done and marked private she called peggy back and bade her to take the letter to willie quarrie and tell him to give it to the gentleman before the captain came down to breakfast in the morning the day was sunday the weather was brilliant the window was open and the salt breath of the sea was floating into the room with the rustle of silk like a breeze in a pine tree jenny crow came back from a walk swinging a parasol by a ring about her wrist such an adventure she said sinking into a chair a man of course i saw him first on the head at the skirts of the crowd that was listening to the bishops preaching such a manly fellow broadshouldered bigchested standing square on his legs like a rock dark of course and such eyes nelly brownno blackbrown i like blackbrown eyes in a man dont you captain davys eyes were of the darkest brown mrs quiggin gave no sign then his dressso simple none of your cuffs and ruffs and great high collars like a cart going for coke just a blue serge suit and a monkey jacket i like a man in a monkey jacket captain davy wore a monkey jacket mrs quiggin colored slightly a sailor thinks i theres something so free and open about a sailor isnt there do you think so jenny said mrs quiggin in a faint voice im sure of it nelly the sailor is just like the sea hes noisyso is the sea liable to stormsso is the sea blusters and boils and rocks and reelsso does the sea but hes sunny too and open and free and healthy and bracing and the sea is all that as well mrs quiggin was thinking of captain davy and tingling with pleasure and shame but she only said falteringly didnt you talk of some adventure oh of course certainly said jenny after he had listened a moment he went on and i lost sight of him presently i went on too and walked across the head until i came within sight of port soderick then i sat down by a great bowlder so quiet up there nelly not a sound except the squeal of the sea birds the boooo of the big waves outside and the plashash of the little ones on the beach below all at once i heard a sigh at that i looked to the other side of the bowlder and there was my friend of the monkey jacket i was going to rise but he rose instead and begged me not to trouble then i was vexed with myself and said i hoped he wouldnt disturb himself on my account you never said that jenny crow why not my dear you wouldnt have had me less courteous than he was so he stood and talked you never heard such a voice nelly deep as a bell and his manx tongue was like music talk of the irish brogue theres no brogue in the world like the manx is there now not if the right man is speaking it so he was a manxman said mrs quiggin with a faraway look through the open window didnt i say so before but he has quite saddened me im sure theres trouble hanging over him ive been sailing foreign maam said he and i dont know nothing oh then he wasnt a gentleman said mrs quiggin jenny fired up sharply depends on what you call a gentleman my dear now any man is a gentleman to me who can afford to dispense with the first two syllables of the name mrs quiggin looked down at her feet i only meant she said meekly that your friend hasnt as much education then perhaps he has more brains said jenny thats the way theyre sometimes divided you know and education isnt everything do you think that jenny said mrs quiggin with another long look through the window of course i do said jenny and what did he say ive been sailing foreign maam he said and i dont know nothing that cuts a mans heart from its moorings like coming home same as a homing pigeon and then wishing yourself back again same as a lost one poor fellow said mrs quiggin he must have found things changed since he went away he must said jenny perhaps he has lost some one who was dear to him said mrs quiggin perhaps said jenny with a sigh his mother may be or his sister began mrs quiggin yes or his wife continued jenny with a moan mrs quiggin drew up suddenly whats his name she asked sharply nay how could i ask him that said jenny where does he live said mrs quiggin or that either said jenny mrs quiggins eyes wandered slowly back to the window weve all got our troubles jenny she said quietly all said jenny i wonder if i shall ever see him again tell me if you do jenny said mrs quiggin i will nelly said jenny poor fellow poor fellow said mrs quiggin as jenny rose to remove her bonnet she shot a sly glance out of the corners of her eyes and saw that mrs quiggin was furtively wiping her own meanwhile lovibond at fort ann was telling a similar story to captain davy he had left the house for a walk before davy had come down to breakfast and on returning at noon he found him immersed in the usual occupation of his mornings this was that of reading and replying to his correspondence davy read with difficulty and replied to all letters by check his method of business was peculiar and original he was stretched on the sofa with a pipe in his mouth and the mornings letters pigeonholed between his legs willie quarrie sat at a table with a checkbook before him while davy read the letters one by one he instructed willie as to the nature of the answer and willie with his head aslant his mouth awry and his tongue in his cheek turned it into figures on the checkbook as lovibond came in davy was knocking off the last batch for the day respected sir he was reading i know youve a tender heart send her five pounds willie and tell her to take that talk to the butchers honored captain we are going to erect a new school in connection with ballajora chapel and if you will honor us by laying the foundation stone never laid a stone in my life cept one and that was my mawthers

become a member of our committee committee i know the sortkind of religious firm where theres three partners only two of thems sleeping ones dirty ould hypocrite fifteen pounds willie this was the scene that lovibond interrupted by his entrance still bent on spending your money captain he said dont you see that the people who write you these begging letters are impostors coorse i do said davy whats it saying in the ould book where the carcass is there will the eagles be gathered together only as parson howard used to say bless the ould angel summats gone screw with the translation theer friends should have been vultures half of them will only drink your money captain said lovibond and what for shouldnt they thats what im doing said davy its poor work captain poor work you didnt always think money was a thing to pitch into a ditch always my goodness no said davy time was once when i thought money was just all and tommy in this world my gough yes when i was a slip of a lad didnt i said he sobering very suddenly the father was lost in a gale at the herrings and the mawther had to fend for the lot of us they all went off except myselfthe sisters and brothers poor things they wasnt willing to stay with us and no wonder but theres mostly an ould person about every manx house that sees the young ones out and the mawthers father was at us still lame though of his legs with the rheumatics and wake in his intellecs for all couldnt do nothing but lie in by the fire with his bit of a blanket hanging over his head same as snow atop of a hawthorn bush just stirring the peats and boiling the kettle and lifting the gorse when there was any fire the mawther weeded for jarvis kewleysixpence a day dry days and fourpence all weathers middling hard dos mate and when shed give the ould man his basin of broth hed be saying squeakylike give it to the boy woman hes a growing lad chut take it man the mawther would say and then hed be whimpering im keeping you long liza im keeping you long and there was herself making a noise with her spoon in the bottom of a basin and there was me grinding my teeth and swearing to myself like mad as sure as the living god ill be ruch some day and now davy snapped his fingers laughed boisterously rolled to his feet and said shortly whereve you been to to churchthe church with a spire at the end of the parade said lovibond st thomassi know it said davy st thomass was half way up to castle mona the men strolled out at the window which opened on to the warm soft turf of the head and lay down there with their faces to the sunlit bay who preached said davy clasping hands at the back of his head a young woman said lovibond davy lifted his head out of its socket my goodness he said well at all events explained lovibond it was a girl who preached to me the moment i went into the church i saw her and i saw nothing else until i came out again davy laughed ay thats the way a girl slips in said he who was she nay i dont know said lovibond but she sat over against me on the opposite side of the aisle and her face was the only prayerbook i could keep my eyes from wandering from and what was her tex mate beauty grace truth the tenderness of a true heart the sweetness of a soul that is fresh and pure davy looked up with vast solemnity take care said he theres odds of women sir theyre like sheeps broth is women if theres a heart and head in them theyre good and if there isnt you might as well be supping hot water faces isnt the chronometer to steer your boat to the good ones now ive seen some you could swear to ill swear to this one said lovibond with an appearance of tremendous earnestness davy looked at him gravely dye say so said he such eyes captnbig and full and blue and then pale pale blue in the whites of them too likelike i know said davy like a blackbirds eggs with the young birds just breaking out of them just said lovibond and then her hair captnbrown that brown with a golden bloom as if it must have been yellow when she was a child i know the sort sir said davy proudly like the ling on the mountains in may with the gorse creeping under it exactly and then her voice cap tain her voice so you were speaking to her said davy no but didnt she sing said lovibond such tones soft and tremulous rising and falling the same asas same as the larks mate said davy eagerly same as the larksfirst a burst and a mount and then a trimble and a tumble as if shed got a drink of water out of the clouds of heaven and was singing and swallowing togetheri know the sort go on lovibond had kept pace with davys warmth but now he paused and said quietly im afraid shes in trouble poor thing said davy hows that mate people can never disguise their feelings in singing a hymn said lovibond you say true mate said davy nor in giving one out neither now there was old kinvig he had a sow once that wasnt too reglar in her pigging sometimes she gave many and sometimes she gave few and sometimes she gave none she was a hitandamissy sort of a sow you might say but you always knowd how the ould sow done by the way kinvig gave out the hymn if it was six he was as loud as a clarnet and if it was one his voice was like the trambones but go on about the girl thats all said lovibond when the service was over i walked down the aisle behind her and touched her dress with my hand and somehow i know cried davy gave you a kind of lectricity shock didnt it lord alive mate girls is quare things then she walked off the other way said lovibond so you dont know where she comes from said davy i couldnt bring myself to follow her captn and right too mate its sneaking following a girl in the streets is sneaking and the man that done it ought to be wallopped till alls blue but youll see her again ill go bail and maybe hear who she is rael true women is skess these days sir but im thinking youve got your flotes down for a good one give her line mategive her lineand if i wasnt such a downhearted chap myself id be helping you to land her lovibond observed that captn davy was more than usually restless after this conversation and in the course of the afternoon while he lay in a hazy dose on the sofa he overheard this passage between the captain and his boy willie quarrie didnt you say there was an english lady staying with mistress quiggin at castle mona miss crows yes said willie so peggy quine is telling mea little person with a spyglass and that fond of the mistress you wouldnt think then just slip across in the morning and spake to herself and say can i see her somewheres or will she come here and never say nothing to nobody davys uneasiness continued far into the evening he walked alone to and fro on the turf of the head in front of the house until the sun set behind the hills to the west where a golden rim from its falling light died off on the farthest line of the sea to the east and the town between lay in a haze of deepening purple lovibond knew where his thoughts were and what new turn they had taken but he pretended to see nothing and he gave no sign sunday as it was captn davys cronies came as usual at nightfall they were a sorry gang but davy welcomed them with noisy cheer the lights were brought in and the company sat down to its accustomed amusements these were drinking and smoking with gambling in disguise at intervals davy lost tremendously and laughed with a sort of wild joy at every failure he was cheated on all hands and he knew it now and again he called the cheaters by hard name but he always paid them their money they forgave the one for the sake of the other and went on without shame lovibonds gorge rose at the spectacle he was an old gambler himself and could have stripped every rascal of them all as naked as a lettuce after a locust his indignation got the better of him at last and he went out on to the head the calm sea lay like a dark pavement dotted with the reflection of the stars overhead lights in a wide halfcircle showed the line of the bay below was the black rock of the island of the tower of refuge and the narrow strip of the old red pier beyond was the dark outline of the head and from the seaward breast of it shot the light of the lighthouse like the glow of a kiln it was as quiet and beautiful out there as it had been noisy and hideous within lovibond had been walking to and fro for more than an hour listening to the slumberous voices of the night and hearing at intervals the louder bellowing from the room where captain davy and his cronies were sitting when davy himself came out i cant stand no more of it and ive sent them home he said its like saying your prayers to a hornpipe thinking of her and carrying on with them wastrels he was sober in one sense only tell me more about the little girl in church aw matey matey something under my waistcoat went creep creep creep same as a sarpent when you first spake of her but its easier to stand till that jaw inside anyway go on sir love at first sight was it aw well the eyes isnt the only place that love is coming in at or blind men would all be bachelors now mine came in at the ear did you fall in love with her singing captn said lovibond yes did i said davy and her spaking too and her whispering as well but it wasnt music that brought love in at my earmy left ear it was matey whatever was it then captn said lovibond milk said davy milk cried lovibond drawing up in their walk just milk said davy again come along and i tell you it was this way ould kinvig kep two cows and we were calling the one whitie and the other brownie nelly and me was milking the pair of them and she was like a young goat that full of tricks and i was same as a big calf that shy one eveningit was just between the lightsthats when girls is like kittens terrble full of capers and mischievousnessnelly rigged up her kopiethats her milkingstoolagen mine so that we sat back to back her milking brownie and me milking whitie what she agate of now thinks i but she was looking as innocent as the bases themselves with their ould solem faces when they were twisting round then we started and there wasnt no noise in the cowhouse but just the cows chewing constant and maybe the rope running on their necks at whiles and the rattle of the milk in the pails and i got to draeming same as i was used of with the smell of the hay stealing down from the loft and the breath of the cows coming puff when they were blowing and the tits in my hands agoing when the rattlerattle aback of me stopped sudden and i felt a squish in my ear like the syringe at the doctors whats that thinks i is it deaf im going but its deaf id been and blind too and stupid for all down to that blessed minute for there was nessy laughing like fits and working like mad and drops of brownies milk going trickling out of my ear on to my shoulder its not deafness thinks i its love and my breath was coming and going and making noises like the smithy bellows so i twisted my wrist and blazed back at her and we both fired away dingdong till the cows was as dry as kinvig when he was teetotal and the cowhouse was like a snowstorm with a gale of wind through it and you couldnt see a face at the one of us for swansdown thats how nelly and me came engage he was laughing noisily by this time and crying alternately with a merry shout and a husky croak aw dear aw dear the days that was sirthe days that was lovibond let him rattle on and he talked of nelly for an hour he had stories without end of her some of them as simple as a babys prattle some as deep as the heart of man and splitting open the very crust of the fires of buried passion it was late when they turned in for the night the lights on the line of the land were all put out and save for the reflection of the stars only the lamps of ships at anchor lit up the waters of the bay good night captn said lovibond i suppose youll go to bed now maybe so maybe no said davy you see im like kinvig these days and go to bed to do my thinking the ould mans cartwheel came off in the road once and we couldnt rig it on again no how hould hard boys says kinvig and he went away home and up to the loft and whipped off his clothes and into the blankets and stayed there till hed got the lay of that cartwheel aw yes thoughthinking thinking thinking constantthats me when im in bed but it isnt the lying awake im minding och no its the wakening up again thats like nothing in the world but a rusty nail going driving into your skull afore a blacksmiths sevenpound sledge good night mate good night chapter iv next day lovibond saw mrs quiggin at castle mona he had come at once in obedience to her summons and she took his sympathies by storm it was hard for him to realize that he had not seen her somewhere before he had seen herin his own description of the girl in church helped out led on directed vivified and transfigured by captn davys own impetuous picture just as the mesmerist sees what he pretends to show by aid of the eye of the mesmerized there she sat like one for whom life had lost its savor her great slow eyes her pale and quivering face her long deep look as she took his hand and her softly tightening grasp of it went through him like a knife not all his loyalty to captn davy could crush the thought that the man who had thrown away a jewel such as this must be a brute and a blockhead but the sweet woman was not so lost to life that she did not see her advantage there were some weary sighs and then she said i am in great great trouble about my husband they say he is wasting his money is it true too true said lovibond and that if he goes on as he is now going he will be penniless not impossible said lovibond provided the mad fit last long enough is remonstrance quite useless mr lovibond quite mrs quiggin the great slow eyes began to fill and lovibonds gaze to seek the laces of his boots it is sorrow enough to me mr lovibond that my husband and i have quarreled and parted but it will be the worst grief of all if some day i should have to think that i came into his life to wreck it dont blame yourself for that mrs quiggin it will be his own fault if he ruins himself you are very good mr lovibond your husband will never blame you either that will hardly reconcile me to his misfortunes the mans an ass thought lovibond i shall not trouble him much longer with my presence here mrs quiggin continued and lovibond looked up inquiringly i am going back home soon she added but if before i go some friend would help me to save my husband from himself lovibond rose in an instant i am at your service mrs quiggin he said briskly have you thought of anything yes they tell me that he is gambling and that all the cheats of the island are winning from him well the pale face turned very red and quivered visibly about the lips i have heard him say when he has spoken of you mr lovibond thatthatbut will you forgive what i am going to tell you anything said lovibond that out on the coast you could win from anybody i remembered this when they told me that he was gambling and i thought if you would play against my husbandfor me i see what you mean mrs quiggin said lovibond i dont want the money though he was so cruel as to say i had only married him for sake of it but you could put it back into dumbells bank day by day as you got it in whose name said lovibond the great eyes opened very wide his surely she said falteringly lovibond saw the folly of that thought but he also recognized its tenderness very well he said ill do my best will it be wrong to deceive him mr lovibond it will be mercy itself mrs quiggin to be sure it is only to save him from ruin but you will not believe that i am thinking of myself mr lovibond trust me for that mrs quiggin and when the wild fit is over and my husband hears of what has been done you will be careful not to let him know that it was i who thought of it you shall tell him yourself mrs quiggin ah that can never never be she said with a sigh and then she murmured softly i dont know what my husband may have told you about me mr lovibond lovibonds ardor overcame his prudence he has told me that you were an angel onceand he has wronged you the dunce and dulbertyou are an angel still while lovibond was with mrs quiggin jenny crow was with captn davy she had clutched at his invitation with secret delight just the thing she thought now wont i give the other simpleton a piece of my mind too so she had bowled off to fort ann with a heart as warm as toast and a tongue that was stinging hot but when she had got there her purpose had suddenly changed the first sight of captn davys face had conquered her it was so childlike and yet so manly so strong and yet so tender so obviously made for smiles like sunshine and yet so full of the memories of recent tears jenny recalled her description of the sailor on the head and thought it no better than a vulgar caricature davy wiped down a chair for her with the outside of his billycock and led her up to it with rude but natural manners the girl was a ninny to quarrel with a man like this she thought nevertheless she remembered her purpose of making him smart and she stuck to her guns for a round or two its rael nice of you to come maam said davy its more than you deserve said jenny i shouldnt wonder but you think me a blundering blocket said davy i didnt think you had sense enough to know it said jenny with that second shot jennys powder was spent davy looked down into her face and said im terrble onaisy about herself maam and cant take rest at nights for thinking whats to come to her when i am gone gone said jenny rising quietly thats so maam said davy im going awayback to that ould nicks oven i came from and ill want no money there is that why youre wasting it here captain quiggin said jenny her gayety was gone by this time noyes wasting well maybe so maam may be so its the way with money comes like the droppings out of the spout at the gable maam but goes like the tub when the bull has tipped it now i was thinking maam well captain she wont take any of it coming from me but i was thinking maam yes davy was pawing the carpet with one foot and jennys eyes were creeping up the horn buttons of his waistcoat i was thinking maam if you could take a mossle of it yourself before its all gone and go and live with heryou and she together somewheressome quiet placeand make out somehowwomens mortal clever at rigging up yarns that do no harmmake out that somebody belonging to you is deadit cant kill nobody to say that maamand left you a bit of a fortune out of hand davys restless foot was digging away at the carpet while he was stammering out these broken words havent you no ould uncle maam that would do for the like of that jenny had to struggle with herself not to leap up and hug captn davy then and there what a ninny the girl was she thought but she said aloud as well as she could for her throat that was choking her i see what you mean captain quiggin but cap tain maam said davy if you have so much thoughtgulp gulpfor your wifes welfare gulp youmust love her still gulp gulp i darent say no maam said davy with downcast eyes and if you love her however deeply she may have offended you surely you should never leave her come now captain forgive and forget she is only a woman you know thats just where the shoe pinches maam so im taking it off out yonder itll be easier to forgive and if itll be harder to forget what matter jennys eyes were beginning to fill no use crying over spilled milk is it maam the heartache is a sort of colic that isnt cured by drops jenny was breaking down fast aw the hearts a quare thing maam got its hunger same as anything else starve it and itll know why gives you a kind of a sinking at the pit of your stomach maam did you never feel it maam davys speech was rude enough but that only made its emotion the more touching to jenny between gulp and gulp she tried to say that if he went away he would never be happy again happy maam dye say happy im not happy now said davy it isnt everybody would think so captain said jenny considering how you spend your eveningssinging and laughing laughing more cry till wool maam same as clipping a pig so your new friends captain those that your riches have brought you friends dye say friends them wastrels what are they nothing but a parcel of betty quilleashs babys stepmothers and im nothing but betty quilleashs baby myself maam thats what i am the stalwart fellow did not look much like anybodys infant but davy could not laugh and jennys eyes were streaming betty lived at michael maam and died when her baby was suckling there wasnt no feedingbottles in them days and the little one was missing the poor dead mawther mortal but babies is like lammies maam theyve got their season and mostly all the women of the parish had babies that year so first one woman would whip up bettys baby and give it a taste of the breast and then another would whip it up and do likewise until the little baby cuckoo was in every baby nest in the place and living all over the street like the rumbutter bowl and the preserving pan but no use at all at all the little mite wasted away poor thing poor thing twenty mawthers wasnt making up to it for the right one it had lost thats me maam thats me jenny crow went away crying openly having promised to be a party to the innocent deception which captain davy had suggested that nelly kinvig is as hard as a flint she told herself bitterly ive no patience with such flinty people and wont i give it her piping hot at the very next opportunity chapter v jennys opportunity was a week in coming and various events of some consequence in this history occurred in the mean time the first of these was that captn davys fortune changed hands davys savings had been invested in two securitiesthe liverpool dock trust and dumbells manx bank his property in the former he made over by help of the advocates and with vast show of secrecy to the name of jenny crow and she on her part by help of other advocates and with yet more real secrecy transferred it to the name of mrs quiggin the remains of his possessions in the latter he lost to lovibond who gambled with him constantly beginning with a sovereign which mrs quiggin had lent him for the purpose and going on by a process of doubling until the stakes were prodigious every night he discharged his debt by check on dumbells and every morning lovibond repaid it into the same bank to the account of his wife thus within a week unknown to either of the two persons chiefly concerned the money which had been the immediate cause of strife between them passed from the offender to the offended from the strong to the weak that was the more material of the changes that had come to pass and the more spiritual were of still greater consequence lovibond and jenny met constantly they made various excursions through the islandto the tynwald hill to peel castle to castle rushen the chasms and the calf of course they persuaded each other that these trips were taken solely in the interests of their friends it was necessary to meet it was desirable to do so where they would be unobserved what else was left to them but to steal away together on these little jaunts and journeys then their talk was of love and estrangement and reconciliation and how easy to quarrel and how hard to come together again captn davy and mrs quiggin provided all their illustrations to these interesting themes for naturally they never spoke of themselves its astonishing what geese some people can be said jenny astonishing echoed lovibond just for sake of a poor little word of confession to hold off like this said jenny just a poor little word said lovibond he has only to say my dear i behaved like a brute but only that said lovibond and she has merely to say my love i behaved like a cat but thats all said jenny but he doesntmen never do never said lovibond and she wontwomen never will then there would be innocent glances on both sides and sly hints cast out as grappling hooks for jealousy ah well hes the dearest simplest manliest fellow in the world and there are women who would give their two ears for him said jenny and shes the sweetest tenderest loveliest woman alive and there are men who would give their two eyes for her said lovibond pity they dont said jenny for all the use they make of them amid such bouts of thrust and counterthrust the affair of captn davy and mrs quiggin nevertheless made due progress shes half in love with my manx sailor on the head said jenny and hes more than half in love with my lady in the church said lovibond and now that weve made each of them fond of each other in disguise we have just to make both of them ashamed of themselves in reality said jenny just that said lovibond ah me said jenny it isnt every pair of geese that have friends like us to prevent them from going astray it isnt said lovibond were the good old ganders that keep the geese together speak for yourself sir said jenny then came jennys opportunity she had been out on one of her jaunts with lovibond leaving mrs quiggin alone in her room at castle mona mrs quiggin was still in her room and still alone since the separation a fortnight before that had been the constant condition of her existence never going out never even going down for her meals rarely speaking of her husband always thinking of him and eating out her heart with pride and vexation and anger and selfreproach it was the hour when the life of the island rises to the fever point the hour of the arrival of the steamers from england all day long the town had droned and dosed under a drowsy heat the boatmen and carmen with both hands in their breeches pocket had been burning the daylight on the esplanade the band on the pier had been blowing music out of lungs that snored between every other blast and the visitors had been lolling on the seats of the parade and watching the sea gulls disporting on the bay with eyes that were drawing straws but the first trail of smoke had been seen across the sea by the point of the lighthouse and all the slugs and marmots were wide awake promenade deserted streets quiet and pothouses empty but every front window of every front house occupied and the pier crowded with people looking seaward shes the snaefell no but the benmychreesee she has four funnels then the steaming up the firing of the gun the landing of the passengers the mails and newspapers the shouting of the touts the bawling of the porters the salutations the welcomes the passings of the time of day the rattling of the oars the tinkling of the trams and the cries of the newsboys this way for castle mona falcon cliff this way echo evening express good passage john good five hours and ten minutes what news over the water theyve caught him never express fort anne herehere for villiers comfortable lodgings sir take a card maam what verdict dye say shes got ten years had fine weather in the island fine echo evening echo fort anne this way gladstone in liverpool yes spoke at henglers last nightfearful crush castle mona evening news peveril this way falcon cliff express thus leaving the pier and the steamers behind them through the streets and into the hotels the houses the cars and the trains go the new comers and the newspapers and the letters from england all hot and active bringing word of the main land with its hubbub and hurlyburly to the island that has been fourandtwenty hours cut off from itlike the throbbing and bounding globules of fresh blood fetching life from the fountainhead to some halfsevered limb it is an hour of tremendous vitality coming once a day when the little island pulsates like a living thing but that evening as always since the time of the separation mrs quiggin was unmoved by it with a book in her hand she was sitting by the open window fingering the pages but looking listlessly over the tops of them to the line of the sea and sky and asking herself if she should not go home to her fathers house on the morrow she had reached that point of her reverie at which something told her that she should and something else told her that she should not when down came jenny crow upon her troubled quiet like the rush of an evening breeze such news cried jenny ive seen him again mrs quiggins book dropped suddenly to her lap seen him she said with bated breath you rememberthe manx sailor on the head said jenny oh said mrs quiggin languidly and her book went back to before her face been to laxey to look at the big wheel said jenny and found the manxman coming back in the same coach we were the only passengers and so i heard everything didnt i tell you that he must be in trouble and is he said mrs quiggin monotonously my dear said jenny hes married im very sorry said mrs quiggin with a listless look toward the sea i mean she added more briskly that i thought you liked him yourself liked him cried jenny i loved him hes splendid hes glorious hes the simplest manliest tenderest most natural creature in the world but its just my luckanother woman has got him and such a woman too a nagger a shrew a cat a piece of human flint a thankless wretch whose whole selfish body isnt worth the tip of his little finger is she so bad as that said mrs quiggin smiling feebly above the top edge of her book which covered her face up to the mouth my dear said jenny solemnly she has turned him out of the house good gracious said mrs quiggin and away went the book on to the sofa then jenny told a woeful tale her eyes flashing her lips quivering and her voice ringing with indignation and anxious to hit hard she hovered so closely over the truth as sometimes to run the risk of uncovering it the poor fellow had made long voyages abroad and saved some money he had loved his wife passionatelythat was the only blot on his character he always dreamt of coming home and settling down in comfort for the rest of his life he had come at last and a fine welcome had awaited him his wife was as proud as luciferthe daughter of some greengrocer of course she had been ashamed of her husband apparently and settling down hadnt suited her so she had nagged the poor fellow out of all peace of mind and body taken his money and turned him adrift jennys audacity carried her through and mrs quiggin who was now wide awake listened eagerly can it be possible that there are women like that she said in a hushed whisper indeed yes said jenny and men are simple enough to prefer them to better people but jenny said mrs quiggin with a faraway look we have only heard one story you know if we were inside the manxmans houseif we knew allmight we not find that there are two sides to its troubles there are two sides to its streetdoor said jenny and the husband is on the outside of it she took his money you say jenny indeed she did nelly and is living on it now and then turned him out of doors well so to speak she made it impossible for him to live with her what a cat she must be said mrs quiggin she must said jenny and would you believe it though she has treated him so shamefully yet he loves her still why do you think so jenny said mrs quiggin because said jenny though he is always sober when i see him i suspect that he is drinking himself to death he said as much poor fellow said mrs quiggin but men should not take these things so much to heart such women are not worth it no are they said jenny they have hardly a right to live said mrs quiggin no have they said jenny there should be a law to put down nagging wives the same as biting dogs said mrs quiggin yes shouldnt there said jenny once on a time men took their wives like their horses on trial for a year and a day and really with some women there would be something to say for the old custom yes wouldnt there said jenny the woman who is nothing of herself apart from her husband and has no claim to his consideration except on the score of his love and yet uses him only to abuse him and takes his very money having none of her own and still did i say she took his money nelly said jenny well of coursenot to be unfairsome men are such generous fools you knowhe may have given it to her no matter taken or given she has got it i suppose and is living on it now oh yes certainly thats very sure said jenny but then shes his wife you see and naturally her maintenance maintenance cried mrs quiggin how many children has she got none said jenny at least i havent heard of any then she ought to be ashamed of herself for thinking of such a thing i quite agree with you nelly said jenny if i were a man said mrs quiggin and my wife turned me out of doors did i say that nelly well not exactly thatno not turned him out of doors exactly nelly its all one jenny if a woman behaves so that her husband can not live with her what is she doing but turning him out of doors but nelly cried jenny rising suddenly what about captain davy then there was a blank silence mrs quiggin had been borne along on the torrent of her indignation brooking no objection and sweeping down every obstacle until brought up sharply by jennys questionlike a river that flows fastest and makes most noise where the bowlders in its course are biggest but breaks itself at last against the brant sides of some impassable rock she drew her breath in one silent spasm turned from feverish red to deadly pale quivered about the mouth twitched about the eyelids rose stiffly on her halfrigid limbs and then fell on jenny with loud and hot reproaches how dare you jenny crow she cried dare what my dear said jenny say that ive turned my husband out of doors and that ive taken his money and that i am a cat and shrew and a nagger and that there ought to be a law to put me down my dear nelly said jenny it was yourself that said so i was speaking of the wife of the manx sailor yes but you were thinking of me said mrs quiggin i was thinking of her said jenny you were thinking of me as well said mrs quiggin i tell you that i was only thinking of her said jenny you were thinking of me jenny crowyou know you were and you meant that i was as bad as she was but circumstances alter cases and my case is different my husband is turning me out of doors and as for his money i didnt ask for it and i dont want it ill go back home tomorrow morning i willindeed i will ill bear this torment no longer so saying with many gasps and gulps breaking at last into a burst of weeping she covered her face with both hands and flounced out of the room jenny watched her go then listened to the sobs that came from the other side of the door and said beneath her breath let her cry poor girl the crying has to be done by somebody and it might as well be she crying is good for a woman sometimes but when a man cries it hurts so much half an hour later as jenny was leaving the room for dinner she heard mrs quiggin telling peggy quine to ask at the office for her bill and to order a carriage to be ready at the door for her at eleven oclock in the morning when the first burst of her vexation was spent mrs quiggin made a secret and startling discovery the man whom jenny crow had stumbled upon first on the head and afterward on the laxey coach could be no one in the world but her own husband a certain shadowy suspicion of this had floated hazily before her mind at the beginning but she had dismissed the idea and forgotten it now she felt so sure of it that it was beyond contempt of question so the manx sailor in whom jenny had found so much to admirethe simple brave manly generous natural soul all fresh air and by rights all sunshinewas no other than captn davy quiggin that thought brought the hot blood tingling to mrs quiggins cheeks with sensations of exquisite delight and never before had her husband seemed so fine in her own eyes as now when she saw him so noble in the eyes of another but close behind this delicious reflection like the green blight at the back of the apple blossom lay a withering and cankering thought the manx sailors wifeshe who had so behaved that it was impossible for him to live with hershe who was a cat a shrew a nagger a thankless wretch a piece of human flint a creature that should be put down by the law as it puts down biting dogsshe whose whole selfish body was not worth the tip of his little fingerwas no one else than herself then came another burst of weeping but this time the tears were of shame not of vexation and they washed away every remaining evil humor and left the vision clear she had been in the wrong she was judged out of her own mouth but she had no intention of fitting on the cap of the unknown woman why should she jenny did not know who the woman wasthat was as plain as a pickle then where was the good of confessing chapter vi while jenny crow was doing her easy duty at castle mona lovibond was engaged in a task of yet more simplicity at fort ann on returning from laxey he found captain davey occupied with willie quarrie in preparations for a farewell supper to be given that night to the cronies who had helped him to spend his fortune these worthies had deserted his company since lovibond had begun to take all the winnings including some of their own earlier ones and hence the necessity to invite them theres ould billy the carrierask him davy was saying as he lay stretched on the sofa puffing whorls of gray smoke from a pipe of thick twist and then theres kerruish the churchwarden and kewley the crier and hugh corlett the blacksmith and tommy tubman the brewer and willie qualtrough that keeps the lodginghouse contagious and the fat man that bosses the sick and indignant society and the long lanky shanks that is the headpiece of the friendly and malevolent associationgot them all down boy theyre all through there in my head already captn groaned willie quarrie in despair as he struggled at the table to keep pace with his slow pen to davys impetuous tongue then ask whosomever you plaze boy said davy whats it saying in the ould book go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in only its the backcourts and the publichouses this time and youll be wanting no grappling hooks to fetch them just whip a whisky bottle under your arm and theyll be asking for no other invitation reminds me sir he added looking up as lovibond entered reminds me of little jimmy quayles aisy way of fetching poor hughie collister from the bottom of ramsey harbor himself and hughie were same as brothersthat thickand theyd been middling hard on the drink together and one night hughie going home to andreas tumbled over the bridge by the sandy road and got hisself washed away and drowned so the boys fetched grapplings and went out immadient to drag for the body but jimmy took another notion he rigged up a tremenjous long pole like your mawthers clothes prop on washing day and tied a string to the top of it and baited the end of the string with an empty bottle of ould tom and then sat hisself down on the end of the jetty same as a man thats going fishing lordamassy jemmy says the boys looking up out of the boat whatever in the name of goodness are you doing there theyre telling me says jemmy bobbing the ginbottle up and down constant flipaflop flipaflop atop of the water theyre telling me says he that poor ould hughie is down yonder and im thinking there isnt nothing in the island thatll fetch him up quicker till this but what is going on here captn said lovibond with an inclination of his head toward the table where willie quarrie was still laboring with his invitations its railly wuss till ever sir groaned willie from behind his pen what does it mean said lovibond it manes that im sailing tomorrow said davy sailing cried lovibond thats so said davy back to the ould oven we came from pacific steamer laves liverpool by the afternoon tide and well catch her aisy if we take the snaefell in the morning fixed a couple of berths by telegraph and paid through dumbells only ninety pounds the twoforard passagebut nearly claned out at that whats the odds though enough left to give the boys a blowout tonight and then heigho stone broke cut your stick and get out of it a couple of berths did you say two said lovibond im taking willie along with me said davy and hes that joyful at the thought of it that you cant get a word out of him for hallelujahs willies joy expressed itself at that moment in a moan as he rose from the table with a woebegone countenance and went out on his errand of invitation but youll stay on said davy eh no said lovibond in a melancholy voice why not then said davy lovibond did not answer at once and davy heaved up to a sitting posture that he might look into his face why man whats thiswhats this said davy youre looking as down as ould kinvig at the camp meeting when the preacher afore him had used up all his texes whats going doing lovibond settled himself on the sofa beside davy and drew a deep breath ive seen her again captn he said solemnly the sweet little lily in the church sir said davy yes said lovibond and after another deep breath ive spoken to her out with it sir out with it said davy and then putting one hand on lovibonds knee caressingly ive seen trouble in my time mate you may trust mego on what is it shes married said lovibond davy gave a prolonged whistle thats bad he said im symperthizing with you youve been fishing with another mans floats and losing your labor im feeling for you deed i am its not myself im thinking of said lovibond its that angel of a woman shes not only married but married to a brute thats wuss still said davy and not only married to a brute said lovibond but parted from him davy gave a yet longer whistle oho oho a quarrel is it he cried husband and wife eh aw take care sir take care women is cute extraordinary wayses theyve at them of touching a man up under the watchpocket of the weskit till youd never think nothing but theyre angels fresh down from heaven and you could work at the docks to keep them but maybe cunning as ould harry all the time and playing the divil with some poor man its me for knowing them husband and wife thatll do thatll do lave them alone mate lave them alone ah the sweet creature has had a terrible time of it said lovibond lying back and looking up at the ceiling i lave it with you said davy charging his pipe afresh as a signal of his neutrality he must have led her a fearful life continued lovibond davy lit up and puffed vigorously it would appear said lovibond that though she is so like a lady she is entirely dependent upon her husband well well said davy between puff and puff he didnt forget that either for he seems to have taunted her with her poverty a growl like an oath half smothered by smoke came from davy indeed that was the cause of quarrel she did well to lave him said davy watching the coils of his smoke going upward nay it was he who left her the villain said davy but after davy had delivered himself so there was nothing to be heard for the next ten seconds but the sucking of lips over the pipe and now said lovibond she can not stir out of doors but she finds herself the gossip of the island and the gaze of every passerby poor thing poor thing said davy he must be a low vulgar fellow said lovibond and yetwould you believe itshe wouldnt hear a word against him the sweet woman said davy its my firm belief that she loves the fellow still said lovibond i wouldnt trust said davy thats the ways of women sir ive seen it myself aw women is quare sir wonderful quare and yet said lovibond while she is sitting pining to death indoors he is enjoying himself night and day with his coarse companions davy put up his pipe on the mantelpiece now the man that does the like of that is a scoundrel he said warmly i agree with you captn said lovibond hes a brute said davy more loudly of course weve only heard one side of the story said lovibond no matter hes a brute and a scoundrel said davy dont you hould with me there mate i do said lovibond but stillwho knows she mayi say she maybe one of those women who want their own way all women wants it said davy its mawthers milk to themmawther eves milk as you might say true true said lovibond but though she looks so sweet she may have a temper and what for shouldnt she said davy dye think god amighty meant it all for the men perhaps said lovibond she turned up her nose at his coarse ways and rough comrades and right too said davy let him keep his dirty trousses to hisself who is he she didnt tell me that said lovibond whoever he is hes a wastrel said davy im afraid youre right captn said lovibond women is privleged where money goes said davy if they havent got it by heirship they cant make it by industry and to accuse them of being without it is taking a mane advantage its hitting below the belt sir accuse a man if you liketen to one hes lazybut a womannever sir never never davy was tramping the room by this time and making it ring with the voice as of a lion and the foot as of an elephant more till that sir he said a good girl with nothing at her who takes a bad man with a million cries talley with the crayther the day she marries him what has he brought her his dirty mucky measley money come from the lord knows where what has she brought him herself and everything she is and will be stand or fall sink or swim blow high blow lowto sail by his side till they cast anchor together at last dont you hould with me there sir i do captn i do said lovibond and the ruch man that goes bearing up alongside a girl thats sweet and honest and then twitting her with being poorer till hisself is a dirt and divil and ought to be walloped out of the company of dacent men but captn said lovibond falteringly captn what wasnt mrs quiggin a poor girl when you married her at that word davy looked like a man newly awakened from a trance his voice which had rung out like a horn seemed to wheeze back like a whistle his eyes which had begun to blaze took a fixed and stupid look his lips parted his head dropped forward his chest fell inward and his big shoulders seemed to shrink he looked about him vacantly put one hand up to his forehead and said in a broken underbreath lordamassy what am i doing what am i saying the painful moment was broken by the arrival of the first of the guests it was keruish the churchwarden a verysecular person deep in the dumps over a horse which he had bought at castletown fair the week before with money cheated out of davy and lost by an attack of the worms that morning butts in the stomach sir he moaned theyre bad sir aw theyre bad nothing wuss said davy i know them ate all the goodness out of you and lave you without bowels men has them as well as horsesonly we call them friends instead the other guests arrived one by onethe blacksmith the crier the brewer the lodginghouse keeper and the two secretaries of the charitable societies whose names were spells too big for davy and the keeper of a home for lost dogs they were a various and motley company of the riffraff and raggabash of the islandyoung and elderly silent and glibrough as a pigskin and smooth as their sleeves at the elbow with just one feature common to the whole pack of pickthanks and that was a look of shallow cunning davy received them with noisy welcomes and equal cheer but he had the measure of every man of them all down to the bottom of their fob pockets the cloth was laid the supper was served and down they sat at the table anywhere anywhere cried davy as they took their places the mate is the same at every seat ay ay they laughed and then fell to without ceremony only wait till ive done the carving and well all start fair said davy coorse coorse they answered from mouths half full already thats what kinvig said when he was cutting up his sermon into firstly secondly thirdly and fourteenthly ha ha kinvig id drink the ould mans health if i had anything cried the blacksmith with a wink at his opposite neighbor no liquor said davy looking up to sharpen the carving knife on the steel am i laving you dry like herrings in the hould season us captn cried the blacksmith amid general laughter from the rest aw lave you alone for that said davy if youre like myself youre in pickle enough already then there were more winks and louder laughter mate shouted davy over his shoulder to the waiter behind him a gallon to every gentleman ay ay from all sides of the table in various tones of satisfaction yes sirof course sir beg pardon sir here sir said the waiter boys healths apiece cried davy healths apiece captn answered numerous thick voices and up leaped a line of yellow glasses ate drinktheres plenty boys theres plenty said davy aw plenty captnplenty come again boys come again said davy from time to time but clane platesaw clane platesi hould with being nice at your males for all and no pigging thus the supper went on for an hour and then davy by way of grace said praise the lord o my soul and all that is within me praise his holy name a propriate tex too said the churchwarden aw its wonderful the scriptural the captns getting when hes a bit crooked he whispered behind the back of his hand after that davy stretched back in his chair and cried your pipes in your faces boys smook up smook up chimleys everywhere same as douglas at breakfast time for davys sake lovibond had sat at table with the guests though their voracity had almost turned his stomach at sight of the green light of greed in their eyes he had said to himself davy is a rough fellow but a born christian these creatures are hogs why doesnt his gorge rise at them when the supper was done and while the cloth was being removed amid the clatter of dishes and the striking of lights lovibond rose and slipped out of the room davy saw him go and from that moment he became constrained and silent sucking at his pipe and devoting himself steadily to the drink he answered in hums and has and thatll dos to the questions put to him and his laughter came out of him at intervals in jumps and jerks like water from the neck of a bottle whats agate of the captn the men whispered hes quiet tonightquiet uncommon after a while davy heaved up and followed lovibond he found him walking too and fro in the soft turf outside the window the night was calm and beautiful in the sky a sea of stars and a great full moon on the land a line of gas jets and on the dark bay a point here and there of rolling light no sound but the distant hum of traffic in the town the inarticulate shout of a sailor on one of the ships outside and the rockrow rockrow of the oars in the rollocks of some unseen boat gliding into the harbor below davy drew a long breath so you think said he that the sweet woman in the church is loving her husband in spite of all fear she is poor fool said lovibond bless her said davy beneath his breath dye think now said he that all women are like that many aretoo many said lovibond equal to forgiving and forgetting eh said davy yesthe sweet simpletonsand taking the men back as well said lovibond extraordinary said davy aw matey matey mens only muck where women comes women is reglar eightteencarat goold its me to know it too there was the mawther herself now my father was a bit of a ripgod forgive his son for saying itand once he went trapsing after a girl and got her into trouble an imperent young hussy anyway but no matter coorse the mawther wouldnt have no truck with her but one day she died sudden and then the child hadnt nobody but the neighbors to look to it go for it davy says the mawther to me it was evening middling late after the herrings and when i got to the kitchen windey there was the little one atop of the bed in her nightdress saying her bits of prayers god bless mawther and everybody and all to that she couldnt get out of the mawther yet being always used of it and there never was no father in her little texes poor thing she come along with me bless you like a lammie that youd pick out of the snow just hitched her hands round my neck and fell asleep in my arms going back with her putty face looking up at the stars same as an angelssoft and woolly to your lips like milk straight from the cow and her little body smelling sweet and damp same as the breath of a calf and when the mawther saw me she smoothed her brat and dried her hands and catched at the little one and chuckled over her and clucked at her and kissed her with her own face slushed like rain till yerd have thought nothing but it was one of her own that had been lost and was found agen aw women for your life mate for forgiveness lovibond did not speak and davy began to laugh in a husky voice bless me the talk a man will put out when hes a bit over the rope and thinking of ould times he said sign that im thirsty he added and then walked toward the window but the father could never forgive hisself he said as he was stepping through and if i done wrong to a woman neither could iive that much of the ould man in me anyway when he got back to the room the air was dense with tobaccosmoke and his guests were shouting for his company captn davy wheres captn davy aw heres the man himself been studying the stars captn well thats a bit of navigation navigation by starlighti know the sort navigating up alongside a pretty girl eh captn there were rough jokes and strange stories and more liquor and loud laughter and for a time davy took his part in everything but after a while he grew quiet again and absent in manner and he glanced up at intervals in the direction of the window a new thought had come to him it made the sweat to break out at the top of his forehead and then he heard no more of the clatter around him than the rumhumdrum as of a train in a tunnel pierced sometimes by the shrill scream as of an occasional whistle presently he rolled up again and went out once more to lovibond the thought that had seized him was agony and he could not broach it at once so he beat about it for a moment and then came down on it with a crash sitting alone is she poor thing he said alone said lovibond i know i know said davy like a bird on a bough calling mournful for her mate but hes gone hes down maybe worse but lost anyway yet if he should ever come back noweh hell have to be quick then said lovibond for she intends to go home to her people soon did you say she was for going home said davy eagerly home wherewhere toto england no said lovibond havnt i told you shes a manx woman a manx woman is she said davy whats her name i didnt ask her that said lovibond then wheres her home said davy i forget

place captn said lovibond davy laughed noisily ay i know it he said and the girls father too i suppose said lovibond davy laughed bitterly ay and the girls father too he said and the girl herself perhaps said lovibond davy laughed almost fiercely ay and the girl herself he said lovibond did not spare him then said he in an innocent way you must know her husband also davy laughed wildly i wouldnt trust he said hes a bruteisnt he said lovibond ugh davys laughter stopped very suddenly a fool toois he not said lovibond aya damned fool said davy out of the depths of his throat and then he laughed and reeled again and gripped at lovibonds sleeve to keep himself erect helloa he cried in another voice im rocking full like a ship with a rolling cargo and my head is as thick as taubmans brewery on boiling day he was a changed man from that instant onward an angel of god that had been breathing on his soul was driven out by a devil of despair the conviction had settled on him that he was a dastard lovibond remembered the story of his father and trembled for what he had done davy stumbled back through the window into the room singing lustily o molla charaine where got you your gold lone lone you have leeft me here o not in the curragh deep under the moold lone loone and void of cheer lone loone and void of cheer his cronies received him with shouts of welcome youll be walking the crank yet captn said they in mockery of his unsteady gait his altered humor suited them cards they cried cardsa game for good luck hould hard said davy fair dos send for the landlord first what for they asked to stop us hell do that quick enough youll see said davy willie he shouted bring up the skipper willie quarrie went out on his errand and davy called for a song the crier gave one line three times and broke down as often i linger round this very spoti linger round this veery spoti linger round this very dont do it any longer mate cried davy your song is like kinvigs first sermon the ould man couldnt get no farther till his tex so he gave it out three timesi am the light of the worldi am the light of the worldi am the light maybe so brother says ould kennish in the pew below but you want snuffing come down out of that loud peals of wild laughter followed and davys own laughter rang out wildest and maddest of all then up came the landlord with his round face smiling what was the captains pleasure landlord cried davy tell your men to fill up these glasses and then send me your bill for all i owe you and make it cover everything ill want till tomorrow morning tomorrow will do for the bill captain said the landlord im not afraid that youll cut your country arent you though then the more fool you said davy send it up my shining sunflower send it up very well captain just to humor you said the landlord backing himself out with his head in his chest why where are you going to captn cried many voices at once wherever theres a big cabbage growing boys said davy the bill came up and willie quarrie examined it shocking cried willie its really shocking shillings apiece for my breakfasesnow thats what i call a reglar piece of ambition davy turned out his pockets on to the table the pockets were many and were hidden away back and front and side in every slack and tight place in his clothes gold silver and copper came mixed and loose from all of them and he piled up the money in a little heap before him when all was out he picked five sovereigns from the haggis of coin and put them back into his waistcoat pocket while he screwed up one eye into the semblance of a wink and said to willie thatll see us over then he called for a sight of the bill glanced at the total and proceeded to count out the amount of it this being done he rolled the money in the paper screwed it up like a penny worth of lozenges and sent it down to the landlord with his bes respecs after that he straightened his chest stuck his thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat nodded his head downward at the money remaining on the table and said men see that its every hapenny im worth in the world a month ago i came home with a nice warm fortune at me thats whats left and when its gone im up the spout the men looked at each other in blank surprise and began to mutter among themselves what game is he agate of now aw its true true enough you go bail i wouldnt trust hes been so reckless twenty thousands theyre saying aw hes been helpedtheres that mister loviboy a power of money the craythur must have had out of him well sarve him right fools and their money is rightly parted thus they croaked and crowed and though davy was devoting himself to the drink he heard them a wild light shot into his eyes but he only laughed more noisily and talked more incessantly come lay down dye hear he cried do you think i care for the fortune i care nothing not i ive had a bigger loss till that in my time lord save us captnwhen cried one never mind whennot long ago any way said davy and you had heart to start afresh capn eh cried another heart you say maybe so maybe no said davy but stow this jaw heres my harvest home boys my melliah only i am bringing back the tareswhos game to toss for it equal stakes sudden death the brewer tossed with him and won davy brushed the money across the table and laughed more madly than ever i care nothing not i say what you like he cried again and again though no one disputed his protestation but the manner of the cronies changed toward him nevertheless some fell to patronizing him some to advising him and some to sneering at the hubbub he was making well well he cried one glass and a toast anyway and part friends for all aisy there silence hush chink up hear hear are you ready here goes boys the biggest blockit in the island bar nonecaptn davy quiggin at that the raggabash who had been clinking glasses pretended to be mightily offended in their dignity they looked about for their hats and began to shuffle out lave me then lave me cried davy lave me now you noahs ark of creeping things lave me im stone broke ay lave me you dogs with your noses in the snow im done im done as the rascals who had cheated and robbed him trooped out like men aggrieved davy broke out into a stave of another wild song im hunting the wren said bobbin to bobbin im hunting the wren said richard to robbin im hunting the wren said jack of the lhen im hunting the wren said every one when the men were gone lovibond came back by the window the room was dense with the fumes of dead smoke and foul with the smell of stale liquor broken pipes lay on the table amid the refuse of spilled beer and a candle at which the pipes had been lighted still stood there burning davy was reeling about madly and singing and laughing in gust on gust his face was afire with the drink that he had taken and his throat was guggling and sputtering i care nothing not isay what you like ive had worse losses in my time he cried he plunged his right hand into his breast and drew out something see that mate he said and held it up under the glass chandelier it was a little curl of brown hair tied across the middle with a piece of faded blue ribbon see it he cried in a husky gurgle its all ive got left in the world he held it up to the light and looked at it and laughed until the glass pendants of the chandelier swung and jingled with the vibration of his voice the gorse under the ling eh there you are then she gave it me yes though on the night i sailed my gough the ruch and proud i was that night anyway i was a homeless beggar but i might have owned the stars for by god i was walking on them going away he reeled again and laughed as if in mockery of himself and then said thats ten year ago mate and ive kep it ever since i have though here in my breast and its druv out wuss things when ive been far away foreign and losing heart a bit and down with the fever maybe in that ould hell and never looking to see herself again no never ive been touching it gentle

curl and holding it over the candle were parting company tonight im going where i cant take you along with meim going to the divil so long slong ill never strook you nor smooth you nor kiss you no

floor i cant i cant he cried god amighty i cant its nellynellymy nellymy little nell the curl went back into his breast he sank into a chair covered his face with his hands and wept aloud as little children do chapter vii when mrs quiggin came down to breakfast next morning a change both in her appearance and in her manner caught the eye and ear of jenny crow her fringe was combed back from her forehead and her speech even in the first salutation gave a delicate hint of the broad manx accent ho ho whats this thought jenny and she had not long to wait for an answer an english waiter who affected the ways of a french one was fussing around with needless inquirieswould madame have this would madame do thatand when this person had scraped himself out of the room mrs quiggin drew a long breath and said i dont think i care so very much for this sort of thing after all jenny what sort of thing nelly waiters and servants and hotels and things said nelly really said jenny its wonderful how much happier you are when you can be your own servant and boil your own kettle and mash your own tea and lay your own cloth and clear away and wash up afterward do you say so nelly deed i do though jenny theres some life in the like of thatseeing to yourself and such like and what are the pleasures of towns and streets and hotels and servants and such botherations to those of a sweet old farm that is all your own somewhere and to thinkto think jenny getting up in the summer morning before the sun itself when the light is that cool dead gray and the last stars are dying off and the first birds are calling to their mates that are still asleep and then going round to the cowhouse in the clear crisp ringing air and startling the rabbits and the hares that are hopping about in the haggardo its delightful really now said jenny and then the men coming down stairs half awake and yawning in their shirt sleeves and their stocking feet and pushing on their boots and clattering out to the stable and shouting to the horses that are stamping in their stalls and then you yoursef busy as thops wife laying the cups and saucers and sending the boys to the well for water and filling the big crock to the brim and hanging the kettle on the hook and setting somebody to blow the fire while the gorse flames and crackles and bustling here and bustling there and stirring yoursef terrble and getting breakfast over and starting everybody away to his work in the fieldsaw theres nothing like it in the world and do you think that nelly said jenny why yes why shouldnt i said nelly well well said jenny theres nowt so queer as folk as they say in manchester what do you mean jenny crow i fancy i see you said jenny bowling off to ballawhat dye call itand doing all that by yourself oh said nelly mrs quiggin had begun to speak in a voice that was something between a shrill laugh and a cry and she ended with a smothered gurgle such as comes from the throat of a peahen after breakfast peggy quine came chirping around with a hundred inquiries about the packing of luggage which was then proceeding with a view to the carriage that had been ordered for eleven oclock mrs quiggin betrayed only the most languid interest in these hurrying operations and settled herself with her needlework in a chair near to jenny crow jenny watched her and thought now wouldnt she jump at a good excuse for not going at all presently mrs quiggin said in a tone of wellacted unconcern and so you say that the poor man you tell me of is still loving his wife in spite of all she has done to him yes nelly all men are like thatmore fools they said jenny nellys face brightened over the needles in her hand and her parted lips seemed to whisper bless them but in a note of delicious insincerity she only said aloud not all jenny surely not all yes all said jenny with emphasis do you think i dont know the men better than you do nelly dropped her needles and raised her face why jenny she said however can that beyouve never even been married thats why my dear said jenny nelly laughed then returning to the attack she said with a poor pretense at a yawn so you think a man may love a woman even afterafter she has turned him out of doors as you say yes but that isnt to say that hell ever come back to her said jenny the needles dropped to the lap again no why shouldnt he then why because men are never good at the bended knee business said jenny a man on his knees is ridiculous it must be his legs that look so silly if i had done anything to a man and he went down on his knees to me i would what jenny jenny lifted her skirt an inch or two and showed a dainty foot swinging to and fro kick him she answered nelly laughed again and said and if you were a man and a woman did so what then why lift her up and kiss her and forgive her of course said jenny nelly tingled with delight and burned to ask jenny if she should not at least let captain davy know that she was leaving douglas and going home but being a true woman she asked something else instead so you think jenny she said that your poor friend will never go back to his wife im sure he wont said jenny didnt i tell you she added straightening up what said nelly with a quiver of alarm that hes going back to sea said jenny to sea cried nelly dropping her needles entirely back to sea she said in a shrill voice and without even saying goodby goodby to whom my dear said jenny to me to his wife of course said nelly huskily well we dont know that do we said jenny and besides why should he if he doesnt hes a cruel heartless unfeeling unforgiving monster said nelly and then jenny burned in her turn to ask if nelly herself had not intended to do as much by captain davy but being a true woman as well as her adversary she found a crooked way to the plain question is it at eleven she said that the carriage is to come for you mrs quiggin had recovered herself in a moment and then there was a delicate bout of thrust and parry im so sorry for your sake jenny she said in the old tone of delicious insincerity that the poor fellow is married gracious me for my sake why said jenny i thought you were half in love with him you know said nelly half cried jenny im over head and ears in love with him thats a pity said nelly for of course youll give him up now that you know he has a wife what of that if he has a wife i have no husbandso its as broad as its long said jenny jenny cried nelly and oh said jenny there is one thing i didnt tell you but youll keep it secret promise me youll keep it secret im to meet him again by appointment this very night but jenny yes in the garden of this houseby the waterfall at eight oclock ill slip out after dinner in my cloak with the hood to it jenny crow its our last chance it seems the poor fellow sails at midnight or tomorrow morning or tomorrow night or the next night or sometime so you see hes not going away without saying goodby to somebody i couldnt help telling you nelly its nice to share a secret with a friend one can trust and if he is another womans husband nell had risen to her feet with her face aflame but you mustnt do it she cried its shocking its horriblecommon morality is against it jenny looked wondrous grave thats it you see she said common morality always is against everything thats nice and agreeable im ashamed of you jenny crow i am indeed i am i could never have believed it of you indeed i couldnt and the man you speak of is no better than you are and all his talk of loving the wife is hypocrisy and deceit and the poor woman herself should know of it and come down on you both and shame youindeed she should cried nelly and she flounced out of the room in a fury jenny watched her go and thought to herself shell keep that appointment for me at eight oclock tonight by the waterfall presently she heard mrs quiggin with a servant of the hotel countermanding the order for the carriage at eleven and engaging it instead for the extraordinary hour of nine at night she intends to keep it thought jenny and now she said settling herself at the writingtable now for the other simpleton tell d q she wrote addressing lovibond that e q goes home by carriage at nine oclock tonight and that you have appointed to meet her for a last farewell at eight by the waterfall in the gardens of castle mona then meet me on the pier at seventhirty chapter viii lovibond received this message while sitting at breakfast and he caught the idea of it in an instant since the supper of the night before he had been pestered by many misgivings and troubled by some remorse captn davy was bent on going away overwhelmed by a sense of what he took to be his dastardly conduct he was in that worst position of the man who can forgive neither himself nor the person he has injured so much had lovibond done for him by the fine scheme that had brought matters to such a pass but having gone so far lovibond had found himself at a stand his next step he could not see captn davy must not be allowed to leave the island but how to keep him from going away was a bewildering difficulty to tell him the truth was impossible and to concoct a further fable was beyond lovibonds invention and so it was that when lovibond received the letter from jenny crow he rose to the cue it offered like a drowning man to a lifebuoy jealousythe very thing he thought and not until he was already in the thick of his enterprise as wizard of that passion did he realize that if it was an effectual instrument to his end it was also a cruel one he found captn davy in the midst of the final preparations for their journey these consisted of the packing of clothes into trunks bags sacks and hampers on the floor of the sittingroom lay a various assortment of coats waistcoats trowsers greatcoats billycock hats and souwesters together with countless shirts and collars scarfs and handkerchiefs at davys order willie quarrie had gathered up the garments in armsful out of drawers and wardrobes and heaped them at his feet for inspection this process they were undergoing with a view to the selection of such as were suitable to the climate in which it was intended that they should be worn the hour was am the snaefell was announced to sail for liverpool at nine but as lovibond entered the room a scene of yet more primitive interest was actively proceeding a waiter of the hotel was strutting across the floor and sputtering out protests against this unseemly use of the sittingroom the person was the same who the night before had haunted davys elbow with his obsequious yes sirs no sirs and beg pardon sirs but the morning had brought him knowledge of davys penury and with that wisdom had come impudence if not dignity the ideal he cried turnin a otel drawrinroom into a charwomans laundry make it a rag shop at once said davy as he went on quietly with his work a rag shop it is and ill ave no more of it said the waiter loftily who ever eard of such a thing no said davy well well now whod have thought it you never did a rael liverpool gentleman eh a reglar aristocrack out of sawney popestreet no sir but its easy to see where you came from said the waiter with withering scorn you say true boy said davy but its aisier still to see where you are going to ever seen the black man on the beach at all no him with the performing birds you knowjacks and ravens and owls and such like well hes been wanting something like you this long time wouldnt trust but hed give twopencehalfpenny for youand drinks all round youd make his fortune as a cockatoo the waiter in fury called downstairs for assistance and when two of his fellow servants had arrived in the room they made some poor show of working their will by force then davy paused from his work scratched the under part of his chin with the nail of his forefinger and said friends some of us four is interrupting the play and theyre wanting us at the pay box to give us back the fare im thinking its yous fellowswhat do you say theyre longing for you downstairswont you go no youll not though then where dye keep the slack of your trowsis saying this davy rose to his feet hitched his left hand into the collar of the first waiter and his right into the depths under his coat tails and ran him out of the room returning for the other two waiters he did much the same by each of them and then came back with a look of awe and said my gough they must have been manxmen after allthey rowled downstairs as if theyd been all legs together lovibond looked grave thats going too far captn he said for your own sake its risking too much risking too much said davy theres only three of them the first bell rang on the steamer it was quarter to nine oclock willie quarrie looked out at the window the snaefell was lying by the red pier in the harbor getting up steam and sending clouds of smoke over the old imperial cars were rattling up the quay passengers were making for the gangways and already the decks fore and aft were thronged with people come along my lad look slippy cried davy only two bells more and three hampers still to pack tumble them inhere goes captn said willie

slip up by the bridge yonder and down the quay like a mill race and up to the gangway like smook and abooard in a jiffy thats ityes ill be off immadient and well bate the blackguards anyway willie was seizing his cap to carry out his intention of going for a cab in order that his master might be spared the humiliation of passing through the line of false friends who had gathered at the ferry steps to see the last of him but davy shouted stop and pointed to the hampers still unpacked im broke said he and what matter who knows it reminds me sir said davy to lovibond of parson cowan the ould man lived up andreas way and after sarvice hed be saying boys lets put a sight on the methodees and theyd be taking a slieu round to the chapel door then as the people came out hed be offering his

ould man wouldnt listen he drew hisself up on the ould woman tremenjous and studdied hisself agen the door and no says he im drunk says he god knows it says he and for what man knows i dont care a damnill walk then away he went down the street past the bishop with his hat aone side and his hair all throughothers tacking a bit with romps in the fetlock joints but driving on like mad the second bell rang on the steamer it was seven minutes to nine and the last of the luggage was packed on the floor there still lay a pile of clothing which was to be left as oil for the wounded joints of the gentlemen who had been flung down stairs willie quarrie bustled about to get the trunks and hampers to the ferry steps davy who had been in his shirtsleeves drew on his coat and lovibond who had been waiting twenty torturing minutes for some opportunity to begin plunged into the business of his visit at last so youre determined to go captn he said i am said davy no message for mrs quiggin dare say i could find her at castle mona no waityestell hersay imif ever ichut whats the odds no no message not even goodby captn she sent none to meno not a word not a word davy was pawing up the carpet with the toe of his boot and filling his pipe from his pouch going back to callao captn said lovibond god knows mate said davy im like the seeding grass blown here and there and the lord knows where but maybe ill find land at last captn about the moneydye owe me any grudge about that said lovibond lordamassy grudge is it said davy aw no man no the money was my mischief its gone and good luck to it but if i could show you a way to get it all back again captn chut i wouldnt have it and i wouldnt stay but matey if you could show me how to get back the money isnt the loss im if i was as poor as ould chalseakilley and had to work my flesh id stay if i could get back the whistle sounded from the funnel of the snaefell and the loud throbs of escaping steam echoed from the head willie quarrie ran in to say that the luggage was down at the ferry steps and the ferryboat was coming over the harbor captn said lovibond she must have injured you badly injured me said davy wish she had i wouldnt go off to the worlds end if that was all betwixt us if she hasnt captn said lovibond youre putting her in the way of it what davy was about to light his pipe but he flung away the match have you never thought of it said lovibond that when a husband deserts his wife like this he throws her in the way of not nelly no said davy promptly ill lave that with her anyway any other woman perhaps but nellynever shes as pure as new milk and no beast milk neither nelly going wrong eh well well id like to see the man that would i may have treated her bad but id like to see the man i say then there was another shrieking whistle from the steamer willie quarrie called up at the window and gesticulated wildly from the lawn outside coming boy coming davy shouted back and looking at his watch he said four minutes and a halftime enough yet then they left the hotel and moved toward the ferry steps as they walked davy begun to laugh well well he said and he laughed again aw to think to think he said and he laughed once more but with every fresh outbreak of his laughter the note of his voice lost freshness lovibond saw his opportunity and yet could not lay hold of it so cruel at that moment seemed the only weapon that would be effectual but davy himself thrust in between him and his timid spirit with another hollow laugh as if half ashamed of keeping up the deception to the last yet convinced that he alone could see through it he said no news of the girl in the church mate eh gone home i suppose not yet said lovibond no said davy the fact isbut youll be secret coorse it isnt a thing id tell everybody what you see if her husband has treated her like a brute shes his wife after all davy drew up on the path what is it he said im to meet her tonight alone said lovibond no yes in the grounds of castle mona by the waterfall after darkat eight oclock in fact castle monaby the waterfalleight oclockthats anow that must be a davy had lifted his pipe hand to give emphasis to the protest on his lips when he stopped and laughed and said amazing thick eh why not said lovibond who wouldnt be with a sweet woman like that if the fool thats left her doesnt know her worth so much the better for somebody else then youre for making it up there said davy clearing his throat itll not be my fault if i dont said lovibond im not one of the wise asses that talk big about gods law and mans law and if i were mans law has tied this sweet little woman to a brute and gods law draws her to methats all and shes willing eh said davy give her time captn said lovibond but didnt you say she was loving thisthis brute of a husband said davy time captn time said lovibond that will mend with time and manewhile shes tellin you all her secrets i leave you to judge captn after dark you saythats middling tidy to begin with eh mateeh lovibond laughed captn davy laughed they laughed together willie quarrie standing by the boat at the bottom of the steps with the luggage piled up at the bow shouted that there was not a minute to spare the throbbing of the steam in the funnel had ceased one of the two gangways had been run ashore and the captain was on the bridge now then captn cried willie but davy did not hear he was watching lovibonds face with eyes of suspicion was the man fooling him did he know the secret goodby captn said lovibond taking davy by the hand goodby mate said davy absently good luck to you and a second fortune said lovibond damn the fortune said davy under his breath then there was another whistle from the snaefell captn davy captn davy cried willie quarrie coming answered davy but still he stood at the top of the ferry steps holding lovibonds hand and looking into his face then there came a loud voice from the bridge of the steamersteam up captn captn cried willie from the bottom of the steps davy dropped lovibonds hand and turned to look across the harbor too late he said quietly not if youll come quick captn see the last gangway is up yet cried willie too late repeated davy more loudly just time to do it by the skin of your teeth captn shouted the ferryman too late i tell you thundered davy sternly meanwhile there was a great commotion on the other side of the harbor out of the way there all ashore ready ready steam upslow the last bell rang the first stroke of nine was struck by the clock of the tower one echoing blast came from the steam whistle and the snaefell began to move slowly from the quay then there were shouts from the deck and adieus from the shore goodby goodby farewell little mona goodby dear elian vannin handkerchiefs waving on the steamer handkerchiefs waving on the quay seagulls wheeling over the stern white churning water in the wake flag down and harbor empty shes gone lovibond smiled behind a handkerchief with which he pretended to wipe his big mustache willie quarrie looked helplessly up the ferry steps davy gnashed his teeth at the top of them after a moment davy said no matter we can take the irish packet at nine and catch the pacific boat at belfast willie he shouted put the luggage in the shed for the belfast steamer well sail tonight instead then the three parted company each with his own reflections the captn done that apurpose thought willie hell keep my engagement for me at eight oclock thought lovibond i wouldnt have believed it of her if the dempster himself had swore to it thought davy chapter ix at halfpast seven that night the iron pier was a varied and animated scene a band was playing a waltz on the circle at the end young people were dancing other young people of both sexes were promenading lines of yet younger people chiefly girls in short frocks but with the wagging heads and sparkling eyes of one type of budding maidenhood were skipping along arminarm singing snatches of the words set to the waltz and beating a halfdancing time with an alternate scrape and stroke of the soles of their shoes upon the wood floor on which they walked the odor of the brine came up from below and mingled with the whiffs of mona bouquet that swept after the young girls as they passed and with the puffs of tobacco smoke that enveloped the young men as they dawdled on sometimes the revolving light of the lightship in the channel could be seen above the flash and flare of the pier lamps and sometimes the dark water under foot gleamed and glinted between the open timbers of the pier pavement and sometimes the deep rumble of the sea could be heard over the clash and clang of the pier band lovibond was there walking to and fro feeling himself for the first time to be an old fellow among so many younger folks watching the clock counting the minutes and scanning every female form that came alone with the crinkcrankcrick through the round stile of the paygate not until five minutes to eight did the right one appear but she made up for the tardiness of her coming by the animation of her spirits i couldnt get away sooner whispered jenny she watched me like a cat shell be out in the grounds by this time its delicious but is he coming trust him said lovibond o dear what a meeting it will be said jenny id love to be there said lovibond umph would you twos company threes noneyoure just as well where you are said jenny better said lovibond the clock struck eight in the tower eight oclock said lovibond theyll be flying at each others eyes by this time eight oclock twenty seconds said jenny and theyll be lying in each others arms by now did she suspect said lovibond of course she did said jenny did he certainly said lovibond o dear o dear said jenny its wonderful how far you can fool people when its to their interest to be fooled wonderful said lovibond they had walked to the end of the pier the band was playing benmychree sweet benmychree i love but thee sweet mona so our little drama is over eh said jenny yes its over said lovibond jenny sighed lovibond sighed they looked at each other and sighed together and these good people have no further use for us said jenny none said lovibond then i suppose weve no further use for each other moaned jenny eh said lovibond tut said jenny and she swung aside mona sweet mona i love but thee sweet mona theres only one thing i regret said lovibond inclining his head toward jennys averted face and pray whats that said jenny without turning about didnt i tell you that captn davy had taken two berths in the pacific steamer to the west coast said lovibond well said jenny thats ninety pounds wasted said lovibond what a pity sighed jenny isnt it said lovibondhis left hand was fumbling for her right if she were any other woman she might be glad to go still said jenny and if he were any other man he would be proud to take her said lovibond some woman without kith or kin to miss her began jenny yes or some man without anybody in the world began lovibond now if it had been my case said jenny wearily or mine said lovibond sadly each drew a long breath do you know if i disappeared tonight theres not a soul said jenny sorrowfully thats just my case too interrupted lovibond ah they said together they looked into each others eyes with a mournful expression and sighed again also their hands touched as their arms hung by their sides ninety pounds did you say ninety two berths said jenny what a shocking waste couldnt somebody else use them just what i was thinking said lovibond and he linked the ladys arm through his own hadnt you better get the tickets from captn davy andand give them to somebody before it is too late said jenny ive got them alreadyhis boy quarrie was keeping them said lovibond how thoughtful of you jonai mean mr lovi jejen benmychree sweet benmychree i love but thee o jonathan whispered jenny o jenny gasped jonathan they were on the dark side of the round house the band was playing behind them the sea was rumbling in front there was a shuffle of feet a sudden rustle of a dress the lady glanced to the right the gentleman looked to the left and then for a fraction of an instant they were locked in each others arms will you go back with me jenny well whispered jenny just to keep the tickets from wasting just that whispered lovibond three quarters of an hour later they were sailing out of douglas harbor on board the irish packet that was to overtake the pacific steamship next morning at belfast the lights of castle mona lay low on the waters edge and from the iron pier as they passed came the faint sound of the music of the band mona sweet mona fairest isle beneath the sky mona sweet mona we bid thee now goodby chapter x the life that davy had led that daywas infernal at the first shaft of lovibonds insinuation against mrs quiggins fidelity he had turned sick at heart when he said it davy had thought the blood went from me like the tide out of the ragged mouth where the ships lie wrecked and rotten he had baffled with his bemuddled brain to recall the conversation he had held with his wife since his return home to marry her and every innocent word she had uttered in jest had seemed guilty and foul youve been nothing but a fool davy he told himself youve been tooken in then he had reproached himself for his hasty judgment hould hard boy hould hard aisy for all though aisy aisy he had remembered how modest his wife had been in the old dayshow simple and how natural she was as pure as the mountain turf he had thought and quiet extraordinary yet there was the ugly fact that she had appointed to meet a strange man in the gardens of castle mona that night alone some charm is put on hersome charm or the like he had thought again that had been the utmost and best he could make of it and he had suffered the torments of the damned during the earlier part of the day he had rambled through the town drinking freely and his face had been a piteous sight to see toward nightfall he had drifted past castle mona toward onchan head and stretched himself on the beach before derby castle there he had reviewed the case afresh and asked himself what he ought to do its not for me to go sneaking after her he had thought shes true ill swear to it the mans lying very well then davy boy dont you take rest till youre proving it the autumn day had begun to close in and the first stars to come out other women are like yonder he had thought just common stars in the sky where theres millions and millions of them but nelly is like the moonthe moon bless her at that thought davy had leaped to his feet in disgust of his own simplicity im a fool he had muttered a reglar ould bleating billygoat talking pieces of poethry to myself like a stupid gawky tommy big eyes he had looked at his watch it was a quarter to eight oclock unconsciously he had begun to walk toward castle mona im not for misdoubting my wife not me but then a man may be over certain ill find out for myself and if its true if shes there if she meets him well well be aisy for all davy be aisy boy be aisy if the worst comes to the worst and youve got to cut your stick youll be doing it without a heartache anyway shell not be worth it and youll be selling yourself to the divil with a clane conscience so its all serene either way davy my man and here goes for it meanwhile mrs quiggin had been going through similar torments i dont blame him she had thought its that mischiefmaking huzzy why did i ask her i wonder what in the world i ever saw in her if i were not going away myself she should pack out of the house in the morning the sly thing how clever she thinks herself too but shell be surprised when i come down on her ill watch her she shant escape me and as for himwell well see mr david well see as the clock in the hall in castle mona was striking eight these good souls in these wise humors were making their several ways to the waterfall under the cliff in the darkest part of the hotel grounds davy got there first going in by the gate at the onchan end it struck him with astonishment that lovibond was not there already the man bragged of coming but i dont see him he thought he felt half inclined to be wroth with lovibond for daring to run the risk of being late i know someone who would have been early enough if he had been coming to meet with somebody he thought presently he saw a female form approaching from the thick darkness at the douglas end of the house it was a tall figure in a long cloak with the hood drawn over the head through the opening of the cloak in front a light dress beneath gleamed and glinted in the brightening starlight its herself davy muttered under his breath shes like the silvery fir tree with her little dark head agen the sky trust me for knowing her id be doing that if i was blind yes would i though if i was only the grass under her feet and she walked on me shes coming my god then its true its true davy hould hard boy shes a woman for all shes here she sees me she thinks im the man in the strange mood of the moment he was half sorry to take her by surprise davy was right that mrs quiggin saw him while still in the shadow of the house she recognized his dark figure among the trees but hes alone she thought then the huzzy must have gone back to her room when i thought she slipped out at the porch hes waiting for her should i wait too no that he is there is enough he sees me he is coming he thinks i am she umph now to astonish him thus thinking and both trembling with rage and indignation and both quivering with love and fear the two came face to face but neither betrayed the least surprise im sorry maam if im not the man faltered davy its a pity sir if im not the woman stammered nelly hope i dont interrupt any tertertatie continued davy i trust you wont allow me began nelly and then having launched these shafts of impotent irony in vain they came to a stand with an uneasy feeling that something unlooked for was amiss what dye mane maam said davy what do you mean sir said nelly i mane that youre here to meet with a man said davy i cried nelly i did you say that i was here to meet dont go to deny it maam said davy i do deny it said nelly and whats more sir i know why you are here you are here to meet with a woman me to meet with a woman me cried davy oh you neednt deny it sir said nelly your presence here is proof enough against you and your presence here is proof enough agen you said davy you had to meet her at eight said nelly thats a reglar bluff maam said davy for it was at eight you had to meet with him how dare you say so cried nelly i had it from the man himself said davy its false sir for there is no man but i had it from the woman said nelly and did you believe her said davy did you believe him said nelly were you simple enough to trust a man who told you that he was going to meet your own wife he wasnt for knowing it was my own wife said davy but were you simple enough to trust the woman who was telling you she was going to meet your own husband she didnt know it was my own husband said nelly but that wasnt the only thing she told me and it wasnt the only thing he tould me said davy he tould me all your secretsthat your husband had deserted you because he was a brute and a blackguard i have never said so cried nelly who dares to say i have i have never opened my lips to any living man against you but you are measuring me by your own yard sir for you led her to believe that i was a cat and a shrew and a nagger and a thankless wretch who ought to be put down by the law just as it puts down biting dogs now begging you pardon maam said davy but thats a damned lie whoever made it after this burst there was a pause and a hush and then nelly said its easy to say that when she isnt here to contradict you but wait sir only wait and its aisy for you to say yonder said davy when he isnt come to deny itbut take your time maam take your time who is it said nelly no matter said davy who is the man demanded nelly my friend lovibond answered davy lovibond cried nelly the same groaned davy mr lovibond cried nelly again awkeep it up maam keep it up said davy and manewhile if you plaze who is the woman my friend jenny crow said nelly then there was another pause and did she tell you that i had agreed to meet her said davy she did said nelly and did he tell you that i had appointed to meet him yes did he said davy at eight oclock did she say yes eight oclock said nelly did he say eight he did said davy the loud voices of a moment before had suddenly dropped to broken whispers davy made a prolonged whistle stop said he havent you been in the habit of meeting him i have never seen him but once said nelly but havent you been in the habit of meeting her never set eyes on the little skute but twice altogether said davy but didnt he see you first in st thomass and didnt you speak with him on the shore ive never been in st thomass in my life said nelly but didnt you meet her first on the head above port soderick and to go to laxey and come home with her in the coach not i said davy then the stories she told me of the manx sailor were all imagination were they said nelly and the yarns he tould me of the girl in the church were all makeups eh said davy dear me what a pair of deceitful people said nelly my gough what a couple of cuffers said davy there was another pause and then davy began to laugh first came a low gurgle like that of suppressed bubbles in a fountain then a sharp crackling breaker of sound and then a long deep roar of liberated mirth that seemed to shake and heave the whole man and to convulse the very air around him davys laughter was contagious as the truth began to dawn on her mrs quiggin first chuckled then tittered then laughed outright and at last her voice rose behind her husbands in clear trills of uncontrollable merriment laughter was the good genie that drew their assundered hearts together it broke down the barrier that divided them it melted the frozen places where love might not pass they could not resist it their anger fled before it like evil creatures of the night at the first sound of davys laughter something in nellys bosom seemed to whisper he loves me still and at the first note of nellys something clamored in davys breast shes mine shes mine they turned toward each other in the darkness with a yearning cry nelly cried davy and he opened his arms to her davy cried nelly and she leaped to his embrace and so ended in laughter and kisses their little foolish comedy of love as soon as davy had recovered his breath he said with what gravity he could command seems to me nelly vauch begging your pardon darling that weve been a couple of fools whoever could have believed it said nelly what does it mane at all said davy it means said nelly that our good friends knew each other and that he told her and she told him and that to bring us together again they played a trick on our jealousy then we were jealous said davy why else are we here said nelly so you did come to see a man after all said davy and you came to see a woman said nelly they had began to laugh again and to walk to and fro about the lawn arminarm and waisttowaist vowing that they would never partno never never neverand that nothing on earth should separate them when they heard a step on the grass behind whos there said davy and a voice from the darkness answered its willie quarrie captn davy

voice aw no woman no and that reminds me of something what is it said nelly i should have been telling you first said davy with downcast head and in a tone of humiliation then what whispered nelly theres never no money at a dirty ould swiper that drinks and gambles everything im on the ebby tide nelly and my boat is on the rocks like a taypot im broke woman im broke nelly laughed lightly do you

kiss me on it again and swear to it he cried again again dont be in a hurry woman aw kissing is mortal hasty work take your time girl once more shocking is it its like the bags of the bees that we were stealing when we were boys another then half a one and im done since they had spoken to willie quarrie they had given no further thought to him when he stepped forward and said out of the darkness if you plaze captn mr lovibond was telling me to give you this lether and this other thing giving a letter and a book to davy hould hard though whats doing now said davy turning them over in his hand let us go into the house and look said nelly but davy had brought out his matchbox and was striking a light hould up my billycock boy said he and in another moment willie quarrie was holding davys hat on end to shield from the breeze the burning match which nelly held inside of it then davy bareheaded proceeded to examine what lovibond had sent him a book tied up in a red tape eh said davy must be the one he was writing in constant morning and evening telling hisself and god amighty what he was doing and wasnt doing and where he was going to and when he was going to go aw yes he always kep a diarrhea a diary davy said nelly have it as you like vauch and dont burn your little fingers said davy and then he opened the letter and with many interjections proceeded to read it dear captain how can i ask you to forgive me for the trick i have played upon you forgive is it i have never had an appointment with the manx lady i have never had an intention of carrying her off from her husband i have never seen her in church and the story i have told you has been a lie from beginning to end davy lifted his head and laughed another match willie he cried and while the boy was striking a fresh one davy stamped out the burning end that nelly dropped on to the grass and said a lie well it was an it wasnt a sort of a scriptural parable eh go on davy said nelly impatiently and davy began again you know the object of that trick by this time wouldnt trust but you have been the victim of another holy sailor to which i must also confess in the gambling by which i won a large part of your money true for you i was not playing for my own hand it was for one who wished to save you from yourself lord a massy that person was your wife goodness me and all my earnings belong to her good thing too they are deposited at dumbells in her name right and therethat will do said nelly nervously and i send you the bankbook together with the dock bonds which you transferred for mrs quiggins benefit to the name of her friend davys lusty voice died off to a whisper what is that said nelly eagerly nothin said davy very thick about the throat and he rammed the letter into his breeches pocket and grabbed at his hat as he did so a paper slipped to the ground nelly caught it up and held it on the breezy side of the flickering match it was a note from jenny crow you dear old goosy your jealous little heart found out who the manx sailor was but your wise little poll never once suspected that mr lovibond could be anything to anybody although i must have told you twenty times in the old days of the sweetheart from whom i parted good thing too glad you were so stupid my dear for by helping you to make up your quarrel we have contrived to patch up our own goodby what lovely stories

davy goodby give your manx sailor one kiss for me do it cried davy do it what youve got to do only once you ought to do it well then they became conscious that a smaller and dumpier figure was standing in the darkness by the side of willie it was peggy quine are you longing peggy willie was saying in a voice of melancholy sympathy and peggy was answering in a doleful tone aw yes thoughlonging mortal becoming conscious that the eyes of her mistress were on her peggy stepped out and said if you plaze maam the carriage is waiting this halfhour then send it away again said davy but the boxes is packed sir send it away repeated davy no no said nelly we must go home tonight tomorrow morning shouted davy with a stamp of his foot and a laugh but i have paid the bill said nelly and everything is arranged and we are all ready tomorrow morning thundered davy with another stamp of the foot and a peal of laughter and davy had his way the end
