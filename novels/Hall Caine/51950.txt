the worldly hope men set their hearts upon turns ashesor it prospers and anon like snow upon the deserts dusty face lighting a little hour or twois gone i iceland had never looked more wonderful the stern old northland which in the daylight bears always and everywhere on its sphinxlike face the mutilating imprint of the burntout fires of ten thousand ages and would seem to be dead but for the murmurings of volcanic life in its sulfurous womb lay in the autumn moonlight like a great creature asleepcalm august and blue as the night the moon was still shining and everything seemed to swim in the soft grace of its silvery light houses ships fishingboats the fiord in front the lake behind the black moorland around and the snowtipped mountains beyondwhen the little wooden capital began to stir in the morning it was the day appointed for the annual sheepgathering at thingvellir the sheepfold was thirty odd miles away there were no railways or coaches and few roads in iceland and hence the younger townspeople who intended to make a holiday of the event had to set out early on their little shaggy ponies as the clock struck four in the tower of the cathedral thora neilsen the daughter of factor neilsen awoke with a start and leapt out of bed she had drawn up her blinds the night before so that the daylight might waken her in the morning but before she realized that it was the moonlight that had been playing upon her eyelids she was standing in the middle of the floor and crying in the ringing voice of youth and happiness aunt margret auntie ive overslept myself ill be late auntie auntie then the measured and sonorous breathing which had been coming through an open door from the adjoining room was interrupted by an older voice a goodnatured voice trying to be angry and saying drowsily drat the girl shell waken the whole house this was followed by the creaking of a bed and the thud of bare feet on the floor accompanied by a running fire of grumbling in which the speaker reminded herself that she was not a cat capable of sleeping in the daytime and if she had to be called up in the dead of night she might at least be permitted to wash her face the girl listened for a moment and laughedthe light and joyous laugh of the soul that has never known sorrow she was young and unusually fair her height was under rather than over the average height of woman and if her face was not beautiful it produced the effect of beauty being one of those softfeatured faces which have a smile always playing upon them even when the owner does not know it to be there she lit her candles dropped her venetians and began to dress herself humming a tune to show she was not concerned by this time the rumbling artillery from the next apartment entered the room in the person of an elderly lady who looked more than usually grotesque if it is fair to take her at such a moment in abbreviated underwear and small calico nightcap with bobs of hair in papers about her forehead like barnacles on the figurehead of a ship that is fresh from a long service in foreign waters this was aunt margret with goodness written on every line of her old face but with a tongue that fell like a fountain on sharp stones and knew nothing of dry weather the moment she set eyes on thora in the preliminary stages of her toilet she cried silk at this time in the morning and who is to see them under your big boots if you please the girl laughed at this as she laughed at everything and said very well give me the woollen ones then but what a cross old thing you are auntie you knew i had to get up early having a six hours ride before me but who wants you to have a six hours ride i wonder said aunt margret bustling about breathlessly to get the girl ready you know quite well who wants me auntiemagnus wants me when they elected him mountainking for the year i promised him faithfully that i would go to the sheepgathering and of course dont try to fool an old fox my dear but come and wash in this water it isnt because magnus wants you at the sheepgathering but because somebody else is going to take you there auntie cried thora lifting a dripping face from the washbasin oh you neednt color up like fire my preciousi know its the truth without that how absurd you are aunt margret you know as well as i do that magnus himself asked oscar to take me he wrote expressly from the farm not having seen oscar since he came from college and wanting to kill two birds with one stone the more fool he said aunt margret the man who expects to marry a girl and asks another man to look after her while he is away is a fool and his friends ought to take care of him its only the simpleton who shuts the door with a bang behind him like that what a nonsensical woman you are auntie said thora oscar is magnuss brother brother indeed so was jacob the brother of esau and cain was the brother of abel and those ten big beauties were the brothers of joseph and benjamin good gracious me aunt margret what a bad disposition youve got thats the worst of youyou have got such a bad disposition you talk of oscar stephenson as if he were a regular reprobate instead of the son of the governor and the idol of everybody its easy to defend some one whom nobody wants to strike i dont say anything against oscar of course you dont you cross old creature youre fonder of him than anybody else and i believe you want him for yourself you jealous thing because you think he is the brightest and cleverest and bestlooking young man in iceland many things glitter in the goldsmiths shop but a sensible woman doesnt want to grab the whole of them and do i you silly it looks as if you do my dear but sit down here before the glass and let me brush your hair you are to be married to magnus and your public betrothal is to take place the day after tomorrow in the presence of both the families yet youve had oscar here every day and all day since he came home from england a week ago and now you are going to ride with him to thingvellir youll make mischief i promise you two dogs at the same bone seldom agree at that the girl was taken with a violent fit of laughing auntie what names you are calling us better i should do so than somebody else the people here are all ears and oscar is all mouthhe is always talking about you not always auntie thoras pretty face was reddening in the glass in front of her always only yesterday he said my future sisterinlaw not future sisterinlaw auntie did i speak or did i not speak thora my future sisterinlaw is perfectly charming he said now im sure it wasnt charming auntie darling yes it was and hold your silly head quiet missperfectly charming he said and im half jealous of old magnus already the blue eyes in the glass were gleaming with delight but the mouth said well of course i should have been dreadfully vexed if i had heard him say that but still it isnt my fault fiddlesticks said aunt margret with a sniff of contempt just take a cranky old womans advice my precious and dont make trouble between two brothers then the shining face in the glass became serious and thoughtful and thora said how can you say such uncomfortable things aunt margret merely because i am going to ride with oscar to the sheepgathering oh a little brook can start a big river but whats the use of talkinga beast can be broken but not a wilful woman then seeing that the tears were in thoras eyes aunt margret gave the girls hair a softer smoothing and said magnus may not be as clever as his brother thora but he is twenty times as solid and steady and he is just as able to take care of a girl and quite as likely to make her happy besides dear its all settled and done and the made road is easiest to travel you know your marriage with magnus has been arranged between your father and the governor they have set their hearts on it the contract is ready and if anything should happen now but thora who had been listening with head aslant to sounds outside the house suddenly leapt to her feet saying i do believe thats silvertops step there was a clatter of hoofs on the cobbles of the street and at the next moment a silvery male voice under the window was crying helloa helloa helloa thora ran to the venetians parted two blades of them and said with an air of surprise its oscar then she tapped the windowpane and cried presently to the person outside and stood for a moment to look down at him a young man of threeandtwenty sat on one pony and held another by its bridle he was tall and slim almost as fair as thora herself and he had a cluster of short curls under the alpine hat which he raised to the moving blind the moon had gone by this time a greyishpink lightthe pioneer of the sunwas filtering through a vaporous atmosphere the ships and fishing boats in the bay were breaking through a veil of mist and vague shadows of men and women muffled up to the throats but chattering and laughing like children were coming and going in the gloom of the streets quick auntie quick cried thora lowering her voice and while the women in the bedroom hustled about and talked in whispers the young man waiting outside slapped his leggings with his riding whip and whistled and sang alternate lines of a lovesong drink to me only with thine eyes and i will pledge with mine must i wear these ugly certainly you must theyre warm and comfortable and its not as if anybody could see auntie dont speak so loud or people will hear or leave a kiss within the cup and ill not ask for wine what a voice he has im certain hell make a success some day maybe so but people dont feed on voicesnot in iceland anywayheres your overskirt for goodness sake aunt margret the thirst that from the soul doth come doth ask a draught divine now for my hat if i have to wear this old black riding habit i must have something sweet on my head at all events that one with the featherno this one and a veil there do i look nice shockingly nice if you ask me the girl laughed gaily and said in a louder voice then let us go downstairsthe poor boy must be tired of waiting and anxious to be off not half so anxious as the poor girl im thinking then the smiling face became serious again and thora said dont say those dreadful things any more theres a dear soul then dont forget my warning and watch over your feelings my precious the door to the street was being opened by this time and a rich barytone voice mingled with the soft murmur of the sea came floating into the hall but might i of joves nectar sip i would not change helloa good morning thora is that aunt margret from behind the bulwark of the door ajar with one eye and two curl papers visible in three inches of opening aunt margret answered that it was and told oscar as he lifted thora to the saddle to take care of her child and deliver her safely to magnus oscar laughed a little jauntily and answerednot she thought with too much conviction thatll be all right auntie goodby goodby goodby aunt margret goodby thora and remember at the next moment the two young people had disappeared in the mists of morning amid a cavalcade of similar shadows dying off in the same direction half an hour afterward the sun had risen and the little capital was going merrily ii the father of oscar stephenson was stephen magnusson according to his icelandic patronymic and he had been governorgeneral of iceland for more than twenty years he was a man of the highest integrity and of the firmest mind in his public character he was zealous and incorruptible and his private life was without stain his chief characteristics were dignity and pride the father of thora was oscar neilsen commonly called factor neilsen of icelandic birth but danish descent and he was the chief merchant and one of the richest citizens of the capital his business methods had often been a subject for discussion and his domestic history a cause of gossip he was a man of untiring industry and great frugality amounting almost to greed these two men had been lifelong friends their friendship had not been founded on any hollow commercial league but nevertheless it had been cemented by community of interest and it was a common saying that the man who could break it could break the constitution it was one of those friendships that are young after fifty years and are constantly growing younger because they are always growing oldera peculiarity of all friendships that are true and constant and the reason why new friendships can never take the place of old ones half a word explained a meaning half a look provoked a laugh their friendship was the unwritten history of their past a living obituary of memories and ideas that were dead it began in boyhood and notwithstanding varying fortunes and some family differences it had never been darkened by so much as the shadow of a cloud but people said that if stephen magnusson and oscar neilsen ever ceased to be friends they would become the bitterest of enemies they went through the latin school together as boys and were two of four icelandic students who were sent with stipends to the university at copenhagen that was in the days when student life was not so regular as it might have been but three of them got through without serious damage while the fourth made a slip which was perhaps the first cause of the present story when the time came to separate one of the four went to oxford as an assistant in the library and became a university lecturer and another went to london to be clerk in a bank and rose to be manager the other two remained faithful to their nationalities and stephen magnusson returned to iceland to practise law while oscar neilsen stayed in denmark to follow commerce within ten years the friends had made rapid progress stephen had risen from advocate to assessor from assessor to deputygovernor and from deputygovernor to governorgeneral while neilsen had reestablished himself in iceland first as factor for a firm in copenhagen and afterward as a merchant on his own responsibility in the meantime both men had married the governor married the daughter and only child of grim owner of the farm at thingvellir one of the largest farms in iceland the factor to everybodys surprise married before he returned home and nobody knew anything of his wife except that she came from copenhagen but scandal seldom loses its way in the dark and it was whispered that the factors wife had been a little actress of the lighter sort and had been compelled to marry the wife of the governor had borne him two sons he christened the first of them magnus after his father but the second he called oscar after his friend who had arrived in time to stand godfather at the baptism in like manner the wife of the factor had borne two daughters she brought the eldest in her arms when she arrived in iceland and the factor called her thora after his mother the second born soon afterward he would have called anna after his friends wife but his own wife objected and it was christened helga after herself there were not many years between the births of the children but magnus was the eldest and helga the youngest while oscar and thora were almost of one age the wives of the two friends could hardly have been more unlike each other anna was homely in looks dress and habits in practical matters she was a typical iceland housewife thrifty and economical although the position of governorgeneral was one of considerable dignity it was far from a fat living and anna set her sail according to the draught of her husbands ship she was shrewd but not well educated and wise but not enlightened and she governed the governor by obeying him stephen found his wife his safest steward and most faithful counsellor he had a profound respect for her instinct but not too much reverence for her intellect when in doubt he always consulted her and while she told him what he ought to do he sat and listened attentively but as soon as she began to explain her reasons he got up and fled the factors wife was distinctly comely volatile and vain and her conduct on coming to iceland might have been calculated to justify the scandal that was coupled with her name she was extravagant in her dress unthrifty in her home restless in her habits and romantic in her tastes and after a while she began to gird at the monotony and dreariness of the life about her a light wife makes a heavy husband and the factor who was not then rich was made to realize that in marrying his danish beauty he had bought a commodity which he could neither exchange nor returna housekeeper who neglected his house and a mother who cared little for his children the children were the first to feel their mothers loss of interest in iceland for while government house was forever warm and joyous with some noisy festivalmagnuss first holiday or oscars last birthdaythere were no holidays or birthdays in their own home which was always quiet and generally cold but the mothers ear is thin and across the gap that opened between the houses of the governor and the factor anna heard the hearts of the little girls and concocted schemes to get at them the factors wife was nothing loth to be rid of her tiresome charges while she devoured dramatic newspapers and french novels and thus it came to pass that thora and helga spent half of their early days with anna and that as long as they lived thereafter hers was the mothers form that stood up in their memory when they looked back to the blue mountains of childhood and youth gathered together under annas wing what times the four children had of it as long as they were little government house was like a nest of songbirds and if at some moments it resembled more nearly a menagerie of monkeys it was always alive and always happy except the governors bureau they took possession of the whole place including the kitchen for there was only one servant in those days and she was as fond of them as her mistress in summer time they ran wild over the homefield and in winter they romped through every room in the house anna spoiled the whole of them for she never knew how to be cross with children and at christmas and new year she helped them to keep up their noisy customsboiling the toffy which they pulled into twisted sticks amid shrieks of delighted laughter and lighting the candles with which they marched in awesome procession from chimney to coalhole to find the hidden folk from the hillsand bad fairies who came to steal good children on such high days and holidays the governor and the factor smoking their long german pipes would come from the bureau to the door of the kitchen to look on at the childish revels and seeing anna in the midst of them like a fairy godmother grown middleaged and matronly but with the loveliness of love still shining over her homely face the governor would say to himself god bless her and the factor would mutter god bless my motherless girls and then the two old friends would drop their heads and go back to talk politics iii the child grows but his clothes do not neither do his characteristics what the children of the governor and the factor were at the beginning of their lives they remained to the end thora was always a merry little woman with a constant smile on her comely face she was usually following or clinging to somebodygenerally oscarbut she could sit for hours coaxing scolding and singing to her doll for the instinct of motherhood was strong in her from the first helga was at all points the opposite of her sister she had black hair a broad brow large hazel eyes that were often half closed a nose that was very slightly turned up at the tip and a large mouth with thin red lips which were generally a little awry a witch may be found under a fair complexion and an angel under a dark skin but helga did not belie her looks she was as bright as a pebble of the brook and just as hard and selfcentered sufficient to herself she clung to no one but loved to have the eyes of everybody upon her she sang like a throstle and was fond of dressing herself up in grand disguises of paper crowns and coronets being full of makebelieve and never quite able to distinguish fact from fiction the sons of the governor were not less unlike each other magnus was a big heavy blackhaired boy silent and slow and thought to be rather stupid he found it hard to learn and his face had often a puzzled expression sometimes a gloomy and morose one on the other hand his moral character was as sensitive as his intellect was sluggish if he borrowed a penny he would never rest until he had paid it back and if any one lent him a pencil he would walk a mile to return it as a consequence his sense of injustice was keen to the point of agony and he suffered more from an unmerited rebuke than from a blow he liked best to visit the family farm at thingvellir and when asked what he was going to be he plumped for being a farmer always fond of animals he filled the house with dogs cats and white mice and seemed to love nothing else except his mother not a lovable boy and a rather surly and unhappy one he was by no means a general favorite but anna was very fond of him oscar was so totally unlike magnus in every quality of mind and heart that it was difficult to believe they could be brothers the fairhaired little fellow with the handsome face was as sweettempered as the sunshine and as full of laughter as a running river he could learn anything without an effort and he had an extraordinary ear for music before he could speak properly he imitated the notes of any instrument from the organ to the guitar and before he knew his alphabet he wrote mysterious musical hieroglyphics on scraps of paper which the governor carried off to his bureau and hoarded up like treasures more precious than gold but in giving him something like genius nature had taken away characterwithout which genius is a curse the merry little soul did not seem to know right from wrong or truth from a lie he was always glancing from one thing to another like the sun on an april day if crying one minute he was laughing the next nothing troubled him long but also nothing seized and held him he began by announcing that he intended to be a king rather later he thought it would be grander to be a general but going one evening with the organist of the cathedral to his weekly rehearsal he finally concluded that to be organblower would be best of all nobody loved him the less for his infirmities of character for it is one of the whims of the human heart that the people who run most strictly within the laws of life find an irresistible fascination in the recklessness of those who kick over the traces oscar was the privileged pet of everybody and the idol of his fathers eyes ah stephen youll never rear that boy said the factor nonsense why shouldnt i whom the gods love die young you know thats only because they never grow old said the governor from the first oscar was fond of a pageant and always wanted to be marching in procession like a victorious general with the juvenile equivalents for banners and bands of music one day he was doing so playing a tune of his own composing on a comb with helga as an eager lieutenant thora as a submissive soldier and magnus as a subservient slave behind him when coming to a river that crossed the homefield a desire for carnage seized the general and backing suddenly on the narrow bridge he toppled his followers into the water magnus and helga escaped without serious consequences but as nobody is anybodys brother in a game thora being dragged down by her sister was drenched to the skin the governor came up at the moment when magnus was hauling thora on to the bank and he was angry was it an accident he asked but the children did not answer then who did it he demanded but thora to whom he spoke looked first at oscar and then at helga and began to cry was it you oscar oscar hesitated for an instant but helga touched his sleeve and he shook his head was it you helga helga promptly answered no then it must have been you magnus said the governor and magnus flushed crimson all over his face and neck but made no reply was it you magnuss mouth quivered but still he did not speak so it was you sir and you can go indoors and to bed immediately without a word or a tear but with a look of defiance magnus wagged his head and turned toward the house seeing him go oscar wanted to blurt out the truth but his melting eyes encountered helgas which held them fast and he said nothing it was one of annas many birthdays and from the upper room where all was silent and cold magnus heard the childrens voices below stairs at first hushed and restrained but after a while merry enough with oscars voice amongst the rest and helgas above everybodys the laughter and joking burnt into his soul and at last he struck the table with his fist and burst into a flood of tears then through the sound of his own sobs a thin whimper came from somewhere whispering magnus magnus it was thora at the keyhole go away said magnus gruffly but thora did not go magnus shall i tell said thora and magnus blinked several times as the big tears rained down his cheeks but still he answered go away i tell you at that thora fell to kissing the keyhole and magnus had stopped his sobbing to listen when he heard another voiceannas voiceoutside the door and then the child was taken away as soon as the birthday party was over and the girls were gone oscar began to ask for magnus but the governor patted his curly head and said magnus had been naughty and must sleep alone that night half an hour later anna found him crying with his head under the bedclothes and she said hide nothing from your father my child the governor was sitting alone in his bureau when a little figure in a dressing gown came in with swimming eyes and trembling lips saying it wasnt magnus papa it was and then a wild outburst of weeping the governor was more touched by oscars confession than by magnuss silence he patted oscars head again and said that was very very wrong of you curly pate but go and beg your brothers pardon and take him off to bed when anna went upstairs again she found two heads on the pillow side by sidethe dark as well as the fair oneand magnus was listening and oscar was talking and both were laughing merrily as soon as the youngest of the children was fourteen winters old they were confirmed together there was only one other candidate little neils the sheriffs son whose mother was dead in the preliminary examination it was expected that oscar would come first helga second neils and thora next and magnus last the rector examined them and when the moment came to declare the order of the candidates he looked serious and even severe oscar with a sparkle in his eyes was carrying himself gaily and helga was at her ease while thora and neils were trembling with anxiety and magnus was nibbling his thumb nail for he was in dread of not being accepted at all and in that case as his new black suit had been bought he would be afraid to go home but when the rector had cleared his throat and called for silence he announced a great surprise magnus is first he said thora second neils third helga fourth and oscaroscar is last then he turned to oscar and said you are rightly served my son for you might have done better and you took no trouble take an old mans word for it oscarin the race of life it isnt always the rider who comes in first that was the last to put on his spurs oscar was crushed with shame but he recovered himself in a moment and while the others looked at him to see what he would dohelga with her mouth awry and thora with eyes that could not see distinctly and a throat that could not swallowhe swung about to where magnus was standing with head down blushing like a baby and gripped and shook his hand it was a beautiful confirmation service the cathedral was full of women but the governor was with anna in their pew in the gallery and the factor who was alone sat in his seat below the children knelt in a line on the lower step of the communion rail the girls in muslin frocks and veils and the boys in black suits and white gloves the morning was bright and warm and the sun was shining from the chancel windows on to the five drooping heads as the old bishop laid his hands on them one by one when the little ones had made their vows the bishop delivered an address be true be strong be faithful think of the covenant you have made with god and resist temptation if satan tempts you with the treasures of this life remember that wealth and power are only for a day while a dishonored name is for a thousand years love one another my children no one knows how soon the world may separate you or with what sorrow and tears you may yet be torn asunder but keep together as long as you can and may god love and bless you all the service ended with the confirmation hymn which the children sang by themselves anna the governor and the factor were deeply affected ah the sweet and happy time of childhood if the children could only remain children but there was nothing to foretell the futurenothing to be seen there except five innocent boys and girls kneeling side by side with their faces toward the altarnothing to be heard but their silvery voices floating up over the heads of the congregation to the blue roof studded with stars iv soon after that the children were separated helga was the first to go the factor had become rich and his wife who had only been waiting until she could claim a separate maintenance parted from her husband and went back to denmark taking their younger daughter with her helga who was then fifteen years of age was glad to go but it was a condition of the separation that at twentyone she should return to iceland if her father wished her to do so or forfeit all interest in his will little neils finsen was the next to leave for his father had married again and his stepmother had persuaded the sheriff that the boy had a genius for the violin and ought to be sent to london oscar remained a few winters longer trying to find out the profession he wished to follow and deciding sometimes in favor of the law sometimes in favor of the church but generally in favor of music which was vetoed by everybody as a beggarly business and being finally despatched to the care of the governors college friend at oxford as a first stage toward an english degree and the pursuit of a public career in iceland thus it happened that within four years of their confirmation only two of the five children were left at home and it had come to pass that these twomagnus and thorawere living under the same roof magnus having failed at the latin school the hector had concluded that it would be waste of time to keep him there any longer and the governor had decided to send him to the farm when the factor volunteered to take him as an apprentice in his business and to receive him into his house the factors house was greatly changed by this time the place of his wife being taken by his sister a shrewd little body with a kindly heart but a sharp tongue which kept everybody in order and reduced everything to rule under margrets regime magnus began as one of four apprentices who ate at the same table with the master and his family but saw no more of them than they could see at meals he found it difficult to learn his masters business it was business of barter in which the farmers exchanged their wool for foreign products and settlements were made on paper magnus made many blunders at the beginning and was constantly being reproved as time went on he grew to be big and powerful and his fellowapprentices christened him jumbo the name stuck and he was treated as a dullard except twice a dayat dinner and at supperhe saw nothing of thora now aunt margret sent her to the girls high school and if he met her in the street coming or going she would drop her head and smile and then run away magnus wanted to run too and always in an opposite direction for the secret of sex had begun to whisper to both of them once a month in winter they met at a dancing class held at the artisans institute why magnus should go there seeing he could never learn to dance was a mystery to everybody until one night the truth became obvious to all and then nobody thought him a dullard any longer or dared to say jumbo beneath his breath a sprightly young sailor named hans thomsen lately home from a voyage was carrying himself with extraordinary freedom he was quickwitted glib and nimble and partly for his merit as a dancer but mainly for the glory of having sailed he was attracting the eyes of the girls seeing this he did his best to make sport for them and when other efforts had been exhausted he looked out for a butt for his ridicule and seized upon magnus he called him jumbo several times and when this jibe began to fail he made a doggerel chorus which he sung to a grotesque caricature of magnuss elephantine steps slowly goes the cow in calf jog along and do not laugh the laughter came in peals yet magnus did not speak and the girls thought he was stupid encouraged by his success hans wagered a group of his friends that he would take his pick of all the girls in the room and to prove his word he strutted up to thorawho was reputed to be the richest heiress in icelandand asked her to dance with him but thora who had flushed up at the previous scene said quietly but in a voice tremulous with anger no thank you and turning aside she danced with magnus hans was at first speechless with amazement but a man has to be hungry to eat his words in silence and after a moment he winked to his friends and whispered wait the next dance was a cotillion and in the first of its figures a girl had to sit blindfold on a chair placed at one end of the room while the boys raced from the other end to capture her the one to reach her first had to lead her to the middle of the floor and kiss herstill blindfoldand then dance her round the room hans whispered to the leader thora was chosen for the chair and all the young men presentmagnus exceptedran to catch her of course hans was the easy victor and taking possession of his prize he led her to the appointed place and then while all were silent and everybody waited to see what he would do he made a mock obeisance before her blindfolded face as much as to say he did not wish to kiss her and left her where she stood at that the girls began to giggle and thora feeling that something was wrong uncovered her eyes and found herself standing alone and the sailor in his seat then the color rushed to her eyes again but thrice redder and hotter than before and covered with confusion she crept back to her place a moment afterward hans was in the middle of the floor kicking his heels higher than a short mans head when magnus pale as a ghost stepped out and took hold of him you must dance with me next he said and the sailor feeling the grip of a lion about his waist cried half in earnest half in jest but its no use dancing with a bull let go of me will you not till i show you how a bull would dance you said magnus and before any one could know what was about to happen the sailor had kicked the beam of the ceiling filling the room with dust and fallen with a crash to the floor hans never went to sea again and the sheriff who was a lifelong rival of the governor fined magnus a hundred crowns after reading him a lecture on bad passions and the duty of parents to check them the factor paid the money and then stopped it ten crowns a month for ten months out of magnuss salary the salary was twenty crowns in all at that time and magnus took the other ten in secret to hans himself as long as hans lived in iceland magnus paid him ten crowns a month whatever his own earnings might be hans became a watercarrier and a drunkard v after that aunt margret invited magnus to spend his evenings with her and thora instead of going upstairs with the other apprentices this led to the happiest period in his life thora played the guitar while aunt margret knitted interminable stockings and in order to find an excuse for his presence magnus began to learn the flute he had no music in his nature but he continued to scream and puff through his instrument like an express train through a ventilated tunnel and when he had blown himself out of breath thora who was sweet and patient would wait while he wiped his forehead those intervals in the harmony were always the dearest part of the evenings to magnus for then he could talk to thora the big silent fellow who rarely spoke to anybody else would sometimes talk to her with a force and eloquence which made aunt margrets closing eyes wink and open wide it was only about business what he had done today or was going to do tomorrow but his face would light up his eyes would flash his tongue would flow and he would become another being as time went on and magnus passed out of his apprenticeship he began to develop great schemes and ideas and he always tried them on thora first the barter business would go to the dogs some day and the fortunes of the future would be made in the fishing he was the richest man in the world whose estate was in the sea and if icelanders had the sense to see where their wealth was waiting for them they would build luggers to replace their open boats and buy quick steamers to run their fish to england that required money but parliament ought to provide it and some daywho could know what might not happenmagnus himself would enter althing and tell those talking automatons what they ought to do the factor heard of this project through aunt margret and he was much impressed by its foresight and practical wisdom one day after smoking various pipes while turning the leaves of his ledger he went over to the governor and said upon my soul stephen that son of yours is no fool he has notions and if he had capital as well i dont know that something mightnt come of him but broad thighs want broad breeches and the question is what are we going to do lend the lad some money and give him a chance said the governor and create a rival to crush me no no near is my shirt but nearer is my skin but look here old friendwhy shouldnt magnus marry thora splendid it has been the dream of my life to cement our friendship in the second generation by a still closer bond lets come down to facts and figures then said the factor and within half an hour the marriage of magnus and thora was a settled matter magnus heard of it from the governor ive been talking with the factor about you magnus and we think it would be a good thing if you and thora made a match he will make you his partner immediately and in due time the heir to half he leaves behind so if you agree but thora magnuss eyes had lit up with a deep glow of delight does thora agree i must leave you to find that out for yourself said the governor thora in her turn heard of the arrangement from aunt margret your father is growing old my precious and its time he took a partner pity he hasnt a son for a place like that but the next best thing is a soninlaw and if you or helga would marry somebody who could carry on the business somebody like magnus but magnus is like my brother aunt margret so much the easier to make him your husband my honey but surely its necessary to love ones husband auntie certainly it is necessary to love him but thats easy enough with magnussuch an old friend and so devoted to the family there seemed to be nothing left except that magnus should speak to thora for himself but that was a task of graver difficulty the great creature who had broken the back of the swaggering bully began to tremble in the mere presence of the softvoiced little lady who dropped her blue eyes whenever he entered the room the music lasted longer of an evening now and the intervals were fewer and more brief but one day magnus who had been to thingvellir on the business of the sheepgathering came back with a young pony and called thora into the yard of her fathers house to look at it the fouryearold colt which was prancing about for sheer joy of being alive had faultless limbs a glossy chestnut coat and a silvery mane and tail is it a good one said magnus its a beauty said thora its perfect its the loveliest thing that ever stepped whomever does it belong to it belongs to you said magnus and when thora gave him her hand to thank him he held it for a moment while he looked into her face and then drew her to his side and kissed her is it to be so thora he whispered and from somewhere in the depths of his breast thora answered yes the world was going round him in a wild dance of joy when somebody touched him on the shoulder it was the factor who had seen everything from the house thats the best days work you ever did in your life my lad and ill take care you never rue it but whats this they tell methat you are mountainking at thingvellir this year that is so said magnus well well im willing take ten days at your sheepgathering and while you are away ill have the contract written out and ready then well sign it the day after you come back and the wedding can be when you please thora and magnus went into the house hand in hand like children and aunt margret who had been crying behind the kitchen door fell on them and kissed them magnus thought he had never been so happy in his life and though the sun had set it shone for him all night long next day he went back to thingvellir and scarcely two hours after he had gone word ran through the town that the steamer laura had arrived in the fiord and his brother oscar had returned in her vi oscar stephenson carried everything before him during the six years of his absence in england he had grown as straight as a poplar and as handsome as a young god both his dress and his manners seemed faultless in iceland eyes and each had a touch of individuality that was irresistible his spirits were as buoyant and boyish as before and his gaiety captivated everybody it counted for nothing that his career abroad had been something like a failure that his infirmities of character had followed him that his father had forbidden him to return before in order to fix him at his studies that he had left oxford nevertheless without taking his degree and that removing to london at his own earnest entreaty he had hitherto done nothing at the academy of music he could and he would was all that anybody thought of this and when he once began he would take the world by storm on landing from the steamer he ran up the street as light of foot as a reindeer shouting salutations on every side plunged into government house hugged his mother at intervals for five minutes spoke so fast that she could not follow him dashed into the governors bureau kissed his father just as he used to do when he was a boy talked for ten minutes explained that he had not written to say that he was coming because he wanted to take everybody unawares then said now i must slip off to see my godfather and vanished like a shaft of april sunshine leaving the air of the room tingling like a candelabra and the old people smiling into each others faces with delighted surprise well oscar was always a master of surprise said the governor and he took up his hat and followed him when oscar reached the factors house he came first upon aunt margret and throwing his arms about her neck he held her so long that to recover her breath and to save her ringlets she had to beat him off with her fists and then there stood thora in her laced bodice and turned down collar her hufa and tassel and plaited hair looking sideways out of her soft blue eyes and smiling with her rows of pure white teeth he thought she was a picture of charming simplicity and took both her hands in both of his and so they stood for some moments while she grew redder and redder every instant and tried to get away can it be possible he said and this is thora when we were children she used to kiss me but now now shes going to be married oscar havent you heard the news thora is to be married to magnus then she belongs to the family and i may kiss her in any case said oscar thora escaped at last and then the factor came in and oscar had to turn round and round like a teetotum that his godfather might see what changes the world had made in him he laughed and laughed again inquiring about the business and the crops and then tramped about the house asking what had become of this piece of furniture and what they had done with that everything seems to speak to me he said and in my den at oxford i used to hear that old bornholme clock ticking away as plainly as i hear it now then the governor arrived and anna followed him and while the old men smoked and aunt margret did the honors oscar poured out the foreign news in a stream of galloping words and then asked what was going on at home they told him of magnuss ideas and schemes but he did not approve them iceland will be iceland no longer if you turn it into a little america he said it is the country of song and story of fire frost volcano glacier and of patriarchal methods of government and trade oscar is right said the factor keep up the old order i say and when oscar had shot away like a meteor the factor said that young fellow has made me feel fifteen years younger i must keep an eye on magnus though he is no fool but he cant reach with his hands where oscar has his feet oscars a boy hes a darling said aunt margret straightening her ringlets thora hardly knew what she thought of him except that he had left her very unhappy when she went to bed that night she could not help comparing magnus unfavorably with his brotherrecalling little things like his hands and his nails and the discolored patches on his cheeks when he neglected to shave next day oscar distributed the presents he had brought from englanda brooch for anna containing a place for his own portrait a pin for aunt margret a silver belt for thora and something for nearly everybody his unselfishness was a subject of general eulogy and nobody remembered for the moment that the governor had paid for everything in the afternoon he came again to the factors and talked for an hour to thora and aunt margret about london and the glory of its sights and scenes you must see them for yourself some day thora he said but then i suppose old magnus will never leave iceland whatever happens thora was more unhappy than ever when she went to bed that second night thinking what a difference it made in a man if he had sailed and what a wondrous life the girl must live who was to marry oscar she was looking at her new belt in the glass and standing off from it to admire her glorified waist when silvertop winnied in the stable and then she felt a little ashamed oscar came the next day also and aunt margret being out on an errand of charity he sat with thora alone until it was quite dark telling of the plays he had seen in england there was a good deal about love in them and one was of a girl beloved by two brothers her father had married her to the elder brother while she was still a child but as soon as her heart awoke she loved the younger one and her husband killed both of them thora cried for the two children who tried to be true but could not and she dreamt that night that she was francesca and oscar was paolo and magnus was giovanni the dream was painful but the awakening was more painful still oscar came the next day also and then he played a number of songs he had composed on subjects in the sagas thora thought she had never heard such playing and do what she would she could not help laughing a little at the thought of magnuss performances on the flute im sure hell become a great composer she said when oscar had gone perhaps so but no one can feed on honor said aunt margret by this time thora had begun to look for oscar every day and the next time he came he persuaded her to fetch out her guitar she played some iceland love songs and sang them in a sweet voice thora was like a flower that had grown under the snow and was opening its eyes to the sun i wonder whom oscar will marry she said and aunt margret answered some english miss with plenty of this worlds goods and none of the next and then thora felt a tingling pain in her breast one day there came a note from oscar saying glorious morning what do you say to a few hours on the fiord will call for you immediately they took a boat belonging to the factor and turned her head toward engey an island inhabited by ten thousand eider duck both were rowing when they left the jetty and the water foamed under their oars but as soon as they were out of sight and hearing they dipped softly and drifted the sea and sky were blue and quiet like two mirrors face to face each reflecting the other and with the boat like a great bumble bee humming between oscar was like a boy he laughed and talked continually telling stories of what they used to do when they were children he was not very chivalrous then he remembered but when she pleaded pitifully he used to allow her to sit on his sledge and they went cracking and crashing through the crisp snow they had tiffs too in those days and people used to say children who make a quarrel often live to make a match wise folks were they not they landed on engey and rambled about in search of the eider duck but all the birds were gone and there was nothing left in their empty nests but a few discolored eggs and these were addled weve come too late said oscar havent we come here too late thora he said again stooping to look sideways into her face and then thora who had been humming a tune suddenly flushed as red as fire their eyes were sparkling and they were quivering with excitement how i wish we could be children again said oscar dont you thora before she was aware thora answered yes and then becoming embarrassed she turned back toward the boat the ground was scored with narrow ruts which had been riven out of the grass by the frosts of winter and oscar said we cant both walk in one rut you know you can catch me then said thora and she ran away laughing oscar ran after her and caught her and held her by the belt and then she became serious after a moment she covered her face and began to cry have i hurt you asked oscar no no its nothing im silly catch me again said thora and snatching his cap off his head she flew over the ruts and had leapt back into the boat before he came up with her when they returned to the factors aunt margret who looked cool and thoughtful gave oscar a letter which his mother had left for him it was from magnus and it ran dear oscari am glad to hear you have come home and i wish i had been there to welcome you you come in a good hour for you must have heard of my good fortune about thora it was long before i could bring myself to grasp my happiness because she was such a happy little girl and it seemed selfish to take her from her fathers house and everybody there so fond of her but now that i have got her i feel new strength and am doing the work of three i am so happy that nothing goes wrong with me and i am like the anvil that could not be made angry though it were to have the heaviest blow but i am longing to see you and i write to ask if you will come to the sheepgathering and bring thora with you now i must conclude for we are camping in the mountains and it will take this letter all its work to reach you in timeyour affectionate brother magnus stephenson oscar read the letter aloud and when he had finished it thora could not see him distinctly for the vapor which floated before her eyeslike the chilling thawcloud that comes down the valley on a bright winters day and hides the shining fells but after a moment oscar laugheda little nervouslyand said let us go by all means ill have silvertop ready and bring him round at five in the morning vii next day magnus awoke on the mountains in the paling light of the moon and the early glimmering of the dawn and thought of thora he always thought of thora first on waking in the morning and her face was the last he saw at night when he closed his eyes under the stars seven days before when he had set his face toward the fells with his forty shepherds and eighty ponies he had found it hard to turn his back on the lowlands because thora was there but when by daybreak the following morning they reached the ridge of the mountains which divides the north district from the south and in the grey light and the running mist they met the shepherds who had come up from the other side and hailed and saluted them and exchanged snuff and drank healths with them and then turned about and parted and begun to descend the way they came his spirits rose rapidly because every step was taking him back to thora five days thereafter magnus and his men scoured the mountains gathering up the sheep that had strayed during the summer and every night when they pitched their tents in some sheltered place where there was water and grass among the lava and screes and every morning when they rose at the first glimpse of daylight he told himself he was one day and one night nearer to thora when he was midway down some one had brought him news of oscars return to iceland and after he had written his letter and despatched it he was happy in the prospect of seeing his young brother after a long separation but happier still in the thought of seeing thora one day sooner than he had expected because oscar would bring her to meet him and now it was the last day of his duty and as he and his shepherds came down the mountains driving five thousand head of sheep before them and the men began to talk of their wives and sweethearts he thought surely nobody had ever loved anybody as he loved thora because there was only one thora in the world the morning was bright and calm and there was no sound in the clear air except the bleating of sheep the barking of dogs and the voices of shepherds calling to each other as they raced across the fells to keep their flocks together but magnus felt as if everything on earth and in heaven were talking to him of thora he began to think of how they should meet and he found it delightful to imagine what would happen oscar would say have i brought her safely magnus and then with one arm about thora he would give his other hand to young oscar and thank him for taking such good care of the sweet girl who was more to him than his own soul at eight oclock they came in sight of the sheepfold they were going to lying in the valley like an inverted honeycomb and then magnus persuaded himself he could see through his fieldglass a line of people like a train of ants coming over the plain beyond he could hardly contain himself at the thought that thora must be among them and when an hour afterward he could plainly distinguish two riders galloping ahead he was happy in the certainty that these were oscar and thora and that they were hurrying to meet him by ten oclock magnus and his company had reached the sheepfold and there the farmers of the district were gathered to greet them with snuff and healthdrinking as before but above the joy of that meeting was the delight of seeing a long cavalcade of the townspeople who had come to make holiday and were riding rapidly up the valley half an hour later magnus saw oscar and thora on the outside of the sheepfold but at that moment he was kneedeep in a palpitating and bleating sea of sheep and he could only wave his hand and try to shout his salutations he found he could not shout for something had gripped him by the throat but oscar called to him and he thought what a man he is now and what a grownup voice he has got during the next three hours magnus was kept busy separating the sheep and settling deputes among the farmers but as he worked he saw the townspeople pitch their tents and light fires to boil their kettles thora is there he thought and he was content by two oclock in the afternoon the last of the sheep had been separated the shepherds were driving away their flocks in different directions the bleating barking and shouting were dying off in the distance and then magnussoiled sunburnt and unshaventurned his face toward the tents the townspeople had finished eating their fires were smouldering out in the sunshine and they were dancing to a guitar on a level piece of green when magnus went up to them and asked for oscar but looked for thora somebody told him they had gonegone for a walk somewhereand magnus was glad because they could meet where they would be more alone he shaded his eyes and looked down the valley and thinking he saw two figures at the foot of the hills he leapt on the back of a pony that was grazing near and rode off in that direction he was humming a tune for he was very happy after some minutes he was sure he saw oscar and thora and began to call to them helloa he cried but there came no answer helloa he cried again but still there was no reply and all was silent now save for the tinkling of the guitar behind him helloa helloa helloa but nothing came back to him but his own voice as it echoed in the hills oscar and thora were sitting on the sunny side of a rock which rose out of the foot of the mountain like a mound of black soil but was really the mouth of an extinct volcano magnus thought he knew what they were doingthey were dropping stones down the crater and listening for the sound of their descent that was why they had not heard him although he had called so loud very well he knew what he would do he would play a practical joke upon them he would take them by surprise he would creep up on the opposite side of the rock and suddenly appear before them as if he had risen out of the pit with this intention magnus made a circuit of the crater and drew up on the shady side of it he was then very close to the two who were sitting above but still they did not hear him so slipping from the saddle and throwing the reins over the ponys head he stole up softly and began to climb the rock as quietly as he could in his big boots over the rolling stones the greater difficulty was to keep himself from laughing aloud at the thought of what their faces would be like when he stood up between them like a ghost that had sprung out of the earth scrambling on hands and knees magnus had climbed half way up the rock when he heard oscar speaking and he stopped to listen but why did you consent said oscars voice thora did not answer and after a moment the voice of oscar said again why did you thora there was a low murmur of indistinguishable words and then the voice of oscar said because your father wished it but surely you have to live your own life thora however obedient a daughter should be to her father she is a separate being and the time comes when she has to fly with her own wings as we say then why did you consent magnus felt his fingers tighten their hold on the rock he was clinging to and he leaned forward to catch thoras reply but there was only the same low murmur of indistinguishable words and then oscars voice once more magnus no doubt i wouldnt say a word against magnusgod forbidbut lovemutual loveis the only basis of a true marriage and if you do not love magnusnot really and truly as you saywhy did you consent to marry him magnus felt the ground to be reeling under his knees if he had not been clinging to the rock he must have rolled to the foot of it all his soul seemed to listen but he could hear nothing except the sound of thoras voice breaking with sobs then came oscars voice again but lower and tenderer than before how hateful of me to make you cry thora i didnt intend to do that dear but have you never asked yourself what will happen if you marry magnus and then find out when it is too late that you like somebody else at that there came another note into thoras weeping a note of joy as well as sorrow and magnusthough he did not know itclambered higher up the rock what did you say thora tell me dear tell medid you say you had found out already and then at last came thoras voice in a burst of passionate tears you know i have oscar and after that there was a startled cry thora had risen and was moving toward oscar who was already on his feet and holding out his arms to her when behind him she saw magnus with a terrible faceeyes staring lips parted and breath coming and going in gusts oscar turned to see what it was that thora looked at and seeing magnus his whole body seemed to shrink in an instant and he felt like a little man is ityoureally he faltered and he smiled a sickly smile but magnus neither saw nor heard him magnus heard nothing saw nothing and knew nothing at that first moment except that he a man of awful strength and passion was standing at the mouth of a pit as deep as hell and as silent as the grave with two who had been dearer to him than any others in the world and they had deceived and betrayed him but at the next moment he saw a look in thoras face that made him remember hans the sailor for it was the same look that he had seen there the instant after he had thrown the man on his back and then a ghostly hand seemed to touch him on the shoulder and the fearful impulse passed there was silence for some moments in which nothing was heard but the quick breathing of the three and then magnus found his voicea choking utteranceand he fell on thora with loud reproaches what does this mean he said it is only six days since i parted from you and now i find you like this speak cant you speak but thora could only gasp and moan and oscar who had struggled to recover himself stepped out to defend her its not thoras fault magnus its mine if it is anybodys and if you have anything to say you must speak to me you cried magnus wheeling round on him what are you id like to know a man who betrays his own brother is that what you came home to doto make mischief and strife and break up everything in the name of god why didnt you stay where you came from magnus said oscar trying to hold himself in you must not speak to me like that you must not talk as if i had stolen thoras affections away from you because then what have you done if you havent done that what have you done because thora never loved youneverthough i am sorry to say itvery sorry damn your sorry said magnus and damn your insolence cried oscar and if you wont hear the truth in sorrow then hear it in scornthoras engagement to you is nothing but a miserable commercial bargain between her father and our father by which she has been bought and sold like a slave the blow went home magnus felt the truth of it he tried to speak and at first he could not do so at length he stammered i know nothing about that i only know that i was to marry thora and that in two days time we were to be betrothed then thora said nervously with quivering lips and voice it wasnt altogether my fault magnusyou know it was not it was all done by other people and i had nothing to say in the matter i was never askednever consulted but i asked you myself thora that was when everything had been settled and arranged magnus but if you had told me even then thoraif you had told me that you did not wish itthat you could not care for me i didnt know at that time magnus you didnt know thora i didnt know that the love i felt for you was not the right lovethat there was another kind of love altogether and that before a girl should bind herself to any one for better or worse until death parts them she ought to love him with all her heart and soul and strength and do you know that kind of love now thora asked magnus and thora faltered yes that word was like a deathknell to magnus he stared blankly before him and muttered beneath his breath my god my god and then thora broke down utterly no one spoke for some moments magnus was going through a terrible struggle he was telling himself that after all these two had something to say for themselves they had their excuse their justification they loved each other and perhaps they could not avoid doing what they had done while hehe who had thought himself the injured personwas really the one who was in the way when thoras weeping ceased magnus looked up and said in a voice that was pitifully hoarse and husky so its all over it seems and theres no help for it no one spoke and magnus said again well a mans heart does not break i suppose so i daresay i shall get over it still the others said nothing and magnus looked from oscar to thora and said quite simply but what is to be done if it is all over between thora and me what is to be done now neither of them answered him so he turned to thora and said your father was to have the contract ready by the time of our returncan you ask him to destroy it she did not reply you canti know you cantyour father would never forgive younever then he turned to oscar the governor has plans about the partnershipcan you fulfil them if i should failno is it impossible oscar gave no sign and after a moment magnus said then i must be the first to move i suppose but perhaps that is only right since i am the one who has to get out of the way dont say that magnus cried thora why not better a sour truth than a sweet lie thora thora dropped her eyes oscar turned aside they heard magnuss foot on the stones as if he were moving away but they dared not look lest they should see his face after a moment he stopped and spoke again when i was coming down the mountain i thought we might go home togetherall three togetherbut perhaps we had better not besides if i have to move first in that matter i have my work cut out for me and i must be alone to think of it what are you going to do asked oscar god knows said magnus he has got us into a knot he must get us out of it they heard his heavy boots on the sliding stones as he stepped down the rock they heard him speak cheerfully to his pony as he swung to the saddle they heard the crack of his long reins as he slashed them above the ponys head and thenas well as they could for the tears that were blinding themthey saw him bent double and flying across the plain viii early next day magnus called at government house and went up to oscars room he found oscar sitting at a desk with a pen in his hand a blank sheet of paper before him and sundry torn scraps lying about as if he had been trying in vain to write a letter the brothers greeted each other with constraint and during the greater part of their interview neither of them looked into the others face i have come to tell you said magnus sitting by the side of the desk and fixing his eyes on the carpet at his feet i have come to tell you that i see a wayi think i see a way out of our difficulty what is it asked oscar looking steadfastly at the blank sheet of paper before him it is a plan which does not involve thora at all or in any way reflect upon you therefore you need not ask me what it is i expect to try it tomorrow and if it succeeds the consequences will be minemine onlyand nobody else will be blamed or affected oscar bowed his head over the blank sheet of paper and said nothing but before i take the step i am thinking of i want to be sure it will be worth taking and have the results i expect thats why i am here nowi am here to ask you certain questions what are they said oscar they are very intimate and personal questions but i think i have a right to ask them seeing what i intend to do said magnus and then in a firmer voice and a right to have them answered also ask them said oscar i want to know first whether if i can liberate thora from her promise to me you will marry her indeed yesif she will have meyes you said yesterday you remember that lovemutual lovewas the only basis of a true marriage perhaps i forgot that in my own case but i must not forget it now so it is not sufficient that thora should love you it is necessary that you should love thorayou do love her indeed i do your attachment is a brief oneare you sure it is not a passing fancy quite sure it is a solemn thing that two human beings should bind themselves together as thora said for better or worse until death parts themyou are not afraid of that no you will always love her always said oscar you have counted the cost all the consequences i know nothing of costs and consequences magnus i only know that i love thora with all my heart and soul and that if you will liberate her and she will consent to marry me i will consecrate my whole life to make her happy magnus shifted in his seat cleared his throat and began again thora is a sweet good girl he said the best and sweetest girl in the world but she is a simple iceland maiden who has never been out of her own country she is not like you and if you take her to england she will not be like your friends there have you thought of that are you ready to make allowances for her upbringing and education will your love bear all the strain of such a marriage it was now oscars turn to move restlessly in his seat why should you ask me a question like that magnus will it repeated magnus more firmly i certainly think it will but will it said magnus still more firmly it will said oscar there was a short pause and then magnus said quietly there are two or three other questions i wish to ask of you and i ask them for your sake as much as thoras go on said oscar thora is practically her fathers only daughter now and he is old and very fond of her if he should wish her to remain in iceland after her marriage you would be willing to live here for the rest of your life if he made it a conditionyes naturally the governor has certain plans for you having spent so much on your education and you have your own aims and ambitions also but if these should clash with your love for thora if they should tempt you away from her you would be ready to give them up certainly i would you are sure of that i am sure of itthat is to sayit would be hard no doubtto abandon the aims and ambitions of ones whole lifebut if they ever clashed as you say with my love for thora ever tempted me away from hertempted me to leave her to go to england for example or to any other country or any other woman that is not possible magnus but if it were possible i would not go said oscar so that if i give thora up and she consents to marry you nothing and nobody will be allowed to disturb her happiness nothing and nobody said oscar then write that said magnus tapping the paper on the desk write it to her not to me if you are sure of all this you cannot be afraid to put it in black and white im not afraid but its of no use writing it to thora why not because when you left us yesterday she told me that though her heart was mine she had given her word to you and she would be compelled to keep it she told you that she did magnus hesitated for a moment and then said in the husky voice of yesterday write it nevertheless and let me take the letter you mean that magnus yes that you will give her back her word and speak to her for me write your letter said magnus huskily what a good fellow you are you make me feel as if i had behaved odiously and wish to heaven i had never come back from england i cannot wish that though for thoras love is everything on earth to me now and i would do anything to hold on to it but if i have done wrong to you i know of no better way of expressing my regret than by placing my dearest interests in your hands i will write the letter at once magnus i tried to write it twenty times and couldnt but now i can and i will while oscars pen flew over the blank sheet of paper magnus sat with head down digging at the pattern in the carpet a fierce fight was going on in his heart even yet for the devil seemed to be whispering in his ear what are you doing didnt you hear what he saidthat thora had decided to keep her word to you are you going to persuade her not to do so youll never get over itnever when oscar had finished his letter he gave it to magnus and said here it is i think it says all we talked about if less than a fraction of what i feel shell listen to you though i feel sure of that but if she does notif she sends me the same answer what will you do then asked magnus pausing at the door then i will take the first steamer back to england and ask you to say nothing to anybody of what has happened a bright light came into magnuss face and then slowly died away but i cannot think of that yet magnus not till i hear the result of your errand see her speak to her tell her she is not responsible for her fathers contract beg of her not to ruin her own life and mine will you i will god bless you old fellow you are the best brother a man ever had dont be too long away i shall hardly live until you return put me out of suspense as quickly as you can magnus if you only knew how awfully i love the little girl and how much her answer means to me but magnuss tortured face had disappeared behind the door at the bottom of the stairs his mother met him and she said so youve been up with oscar all the time your father and the factor were looking for you everywhere they had the lawyers with them all the morning and wanted to consult you about something its settled now i think so theres no need to trouble but goodness gracious magnus how white and worn you look that work on the mountains hasnt suited you and you must do no more of it magnus excused himself to anna and hastened away to the factors as he passed through the streets with oscars letter to thora in his side pocket and his nervous fingers clutching it the devilish voice that had tempted him before seemed to speak to him again and say destroy it didnt you hear him say that he would go away let him go nobody but yourself will know anything about the letter even thora will never know and when oscar is gone thora will fulfil her promise to you let her fulfil it if she does not love you now she will come to love you later on and if she never comes to love you she will be yours you will have her and who has a better right destroy it destroy it but his good angel seemed to answer and say whats the use of having a womans body if you cannot have her soul thats lust not love and its too late to think of it anyway the question you have to decide is simple enoughdo you love yourself better than you love thora or thora better than yourself and then the devil seemed to whisper again and say what a fools errand you are going upon if you win you lose if you lose you win if you persuade thora to preserve her own happiness you destroy your own if you do not persuade her to marry oscar she will marry you are you a man is there an ounce of hot blood in you the fight was fierce but magnus decided in favor of the girls happiness against his own and he said to himself at every step go on you want thora to be happy then carry it through it is hard but go on go on when he reached the factors his great limbs could hardly support themselves and his ashen face was covered with sweat ix the factors house was full of the sweet smell of the baking of cakes and thora and aunt margret were in the kitchen with the fronts of their gowns tucked up to their waists their sleeves turned back and rollingpins in their hands behind a table laden with soft dough and sprinkled with flour heres magnus at last said aunt margret and perhaps he can tell me how it happened that you came home without him yesterday magnus did his best to laugh it off thats a long story auntie he said a horses shoe isnt made at a blow and i want to speak to thora mind you dont keep her long then if were to be ready for all the people who are coming tomorrow theres work here today for a bakers dozen magnus went up to the little sittingroom with the barnholme clock in it and thora followed there were dark rings under her eyes and her manner was nervous and restless i am ashamed of what happened yesterday she said and i ask you to forgive and forget i cannot do either said magnus that is to say not yet and in the way you mean thoras eyes began to fill dont be too hard on me magnus im trying to make amends and it isnt very easy im not so hard on you as you are on yourself thora and im here to tell you not to do yourself an injustice thora thought for a moment and then said if you mean that you have come to say that after all i must fulfil my promise it is unnecessary because i intend to do so will that be right thora it may not be right to oscar perhaps or to myself im not thinking about oscar now and im not thinking about youim thinking about myselfwill it be right to me what more can i do magnus it wasnt altogether my fault that i gave you my word but i did give it and i am trying to keep it would it be right to marry meseeing as you said yourself you do not care for me thora dropped her head you said yesterday that before a girl should marry a man she ought to love him with all her heart and soul and strength wouldnt it be wrong to marry me while you loved somebody else like that is that what you call making amends thora i was only trying to do what was right magnus but if you think it would be wrong to marry you then i will never marry at all never what good will that be to me thora five years ten years twenty years hence what good will it be to me that because you had given me your word and could not keep it you are living a lonely life somewhere thora covered her face with her hands what sort of a poor whisp of a man do you suppose i am thora i didnt intend to insult you magnus but if i can neither marry you nor remain unmarried what am i to do you know quite well what you are to do thora thora uncovered her face her eyes were shining you mean that i must marry oscar that depends upon whether you love him the shining eyes were very bright in spite of the tears that swam in them do you love him dont ask me that magnus but i do ask you thora i have a right to ask you do you love oscar i admire and esteem him magnus but do you love him everybody loves oscar do you love him thora yes said thora softly and for some moments after that there was no sound in the room but the ticking of the clock then as he loves you and wishes to marry you it is your duty to marry him said magnus but i have given my word to you magnus i give you back your word thora the shining eyes were shedding tears of joy by this time but while love fought for oscar duty and honor struggled for magnus but i have told him it is impossible said thora he asks you again thora here is his letter said magnus he gave it to you to deliver i asked for it and you came to speak for him i came for myself as well how good you are to me magnus read your letter said magnus and with trembling hands thora opened the envelope the fight was short but fierce magnus watched every expression of thoras face if there had been one ray of love for him in her looks of gratitude and remorse he would have clung to the hope that the time would come when all would be well but love for oscar shone in her eyes broke from her lips betrayed itself in the very insistence with which she meant to marry magnus and there remained no hope for him anywhere thora looked up from her letter and said how splendid how noble thats what i do call brotherly oscar tells me that you think you can put the contract aside without involving me or reflecting upon him you are too goodtoo generoustoo forgivinghow can i thank you by giving me oscars letter said magnus what do you want with it i want to have it in my pocket when i do my work tomorrow thats only fairthat while i am doing my part i hold oscars written assurance that he intends to do his you wouldnt produce it to oscars injury many a man sharpens his axe who never uses it said magnus thora returned the letter to magnus and he put it back in his pocket now you must answer it said magnus not yet not immediately said thora immediately said magnus and taking pen and paper from a sideboard he put them before her the power of the man mastered her and she sat at the table and took up the pen but why should i write today she said why not tomorrow tomorrow is the day fixed for the betrothal and if i am to do anything then i must have everything in black and white but let me have one engagement ended before the other is begun magnus if oscar does not receive your answer within an hour he will take the first ship back to england and you will never see him again he said so yes you will break my heart magnus i dont know what to say to you write said magnus i cannot you have driven everything out of my head then write to my dictation my dear oscar my dear oscar i have received the letter you sent by magnus sent by magnus and i reciprocate all you say all you say i believe you love me very dearly and that you will never allow anything or anybody to come between us to come between us magnus has given me back my word because i do not love him must i say that magnus and because he wishes to make me happy i cannot magnus i really cannot go on thora therefore if he can satisfy my father and yours my father and yours i will marry you when and where you please because because because i love you with all my heart and soul and strength thora was crying when she came to the end of the letter sign it said magnus and she signed it address it he said and she addressed it seal it he said and she sealed it now give it to me said magnus and he took the letter off the table and put it in his breast pocket what are you going to do with it asked thora deliver it myself said magnus no no cried thora at least let me keep it for half an houra quarter of an hour i cannot trust you thora said magnus and he made for the door give it me back give it me give it me she threw her arms about him to detain him and for a moment he stood trembling in the temptation of her embrace then he put her gently aside and fled out of the house while he was hurrying through the streets the warmth of thoras soft flesh was still tingling on his neck and cheek and the devilish voice was saying in his ear what a fool you were in another moment her sweet body would have been in your strong arms and she would have been yours for ever he tried not to hear it but the voice went on she may still be yours if youre half a man keep back thoras letter and return his own to oscar why not what better does he deserve of you magnus walked fast but the voice followed him it told him how happy he had been when he thought thora loved him how he had left her for the mountains with his heart full of joy how oscar had come and everything was at an end keep it back return his own said the voice in his ear and to make sure of thoras happiness and to cure himself of all hope he took thoras letter out of his pocket and ran with it in his hand oscar was at the top of the stairs being too eager to wait in his bedroom so you have brought it she has sent me an answer give it me take it said magnus but having thoras letter in his hands at last oscar was afraid to open it is it all right he asked see for yourself said magnus and he dropped into the seat by the desk as oscar read the letter the expression of his face changed from fear to joy and from joy to rapture without looking up from the paper he cried out like a happy boy its all right she agrees god bless her shall i read you what she says yet no that wouldnt be fair to thora but its as right as can be how beautiful talk of educationnobody in the world could have put things better the darling he read the letter twice and put it in his pocket then took it out and read it again and kissed it forgetting in his selfish happiness that anybody else was there magnus sat and watched him the fight was almost over but he was nearly breaking down at last what an age you seemed to be away said oscar yet you have run hard for you are still quite breathless but there is nothing more to do now except what you promised to do tomorrow you think you can do it i think i can said magnus it will be a stiff job though to persuade two old men who dont wish to be persuaded nobody wants to see his schemes upset and his contracts broken and with all the goodwill in the world to me wait said magnus risinghis unshaven face had suddenly grown hard and ugly we have talked of you and thora and of the factor and the governor but there is somebody who has not been too much mentionedmyself dont suppose i am forgetting you though said oscar i can never do thatand neither can thoranever if i am to stand back and take the consequences there is something you owe meyou owe me your silence assuredly said oscar whatever i do or say tomorrow said magnus you must never allow it to be seen that you know my object is it a promise certainly said oscar silence is inevitable if i am to save thora from her fathers anger and i will save her from that and from every sorrow magnus walked to the door and then for the first time oscar looked at him but what a brute i amalways talking of myself said oscar following his brother to the landing when everything is satisfactorily settled what is to happen to you magnus god knows said magnus with his foot on the stair everybody has his own wounds to bandage well god bless you in any case old fellow said oscar patting magnus on the shoulder and then he returned to his room and took out thoras letter and read it over again x the betrothal was fixed for five oclock on the following afternoon aunt margret had had women in to clean the house down and everything was like a new pin the large sittingroom looking toward the town was prepared for the legal part of the ceremony with pens and ink on the round table and the smaller sittingroom divided from it by a plush curtain and overlooking the lake was laid out with a long dining table covered with cakes and cups and saucers and surrounded by highbacked chairs these rooms were standing quiet and solemn when at halfpast four aunt margret came down in her best black silk and with ringlets newly curled to have a last look round she was doing a little final dusting when the first of her guests arrived this was anna also in black silk and being already on her company manners aunt margret kissed her but wheres oscar and wheres the governor asked aunt margret stephen is coming said anna but far be it from me to say where oscar is the boy is here and there and everywhere that reminds me of something said aunt margret can you tell me how it came to pass that the young folks missed each other at thingvellir yesterday and magnus came home alone goodness knows it wouldnt be magnuss fault thats certain magnus is like my poor fatheras sure to be in his place as a millhorse on the tread but oscar is as hard to hold as a puff of wind its his nature he cant help it but it makes me anxious when i think of it margret dont be afraid for oscar anna hell come out all right and if he is restless and unsettled god is good to such weak heart he never asks more than he gives you know the factor came downstairsa tall man cleanshaven baldheaded and a little hard and angular wearing evening dress and a skullcap and carrying a long german pipe in his hand no smoking yet cried aunt margret and with a grunt and a laugh the factor laid his pipe on the mantelpiece and hows anna today he said no need to ask that though our anna is as fresh and young as ever upon my word margret it only seems like yesterday that we were doing all this for anna herself she was a different anna in those days oscar said anna not a bit of it theres a little more anna nowthats the only difference the governor came in nexta broadset man of medium height with a beard but no mustache and wearing his official uniform bright with gold braid he saluted the factor and said i have taken the liberty to ask the bishop the rector of the latin school and the sheriff to join usi trust you dont object quite right old friend said the factor the most important acts of life ought always to be done in the presence of witnesses and hows margret as busy as usual i see all days dont come on the same date we must get ready for you next you know for margret laughed the factor shell have to be quick or shell be late thenpeople dont hatch many chickens at christmas late indeed said aunt margret with a toss of her ringlets if i couldnt catch up to you folks with your pair of chicks apiece i shouldnt think it worth while to begin the men laughed and anna said well two children would be enough for me if i could only keep them but thats the worst of having boysthey marry and leave you a mother can always keep her girls until somebody elses boys come and carry them off and then she sees no more of either said aunt margret that depends on circumstances said the governorthe marriage contract for exampleeh old friend exactly said the factor you can generally keep the bull about the place if you have the cow locked up in the cowhouse the men laughed again and then the bishop and the rector arrivedthe bishop a saintly patriarch with a soft face and a white beard and the rectoras became the schoolmastersharper if not more severe i was surprised when i heard it was magnus said the rector oscar has beaten his brother in most things and i thought he would beat him in getting a wife and then thora and he are such friends too and so like each other they get on worst together who are most like each other said anna and aunt margret said stuff a dark mans a jewel in a fair womans eye and what does thora want with a fair one but where is thora asked the bishop shes dressing said aunt margret let us go and fetch her down anna and the two women went upstairs magnus ought to be here too said the governor where is he i wonder were you asking for magnus said a voice from the hall it was the sheriffa small man with a sly face wearing a goldbraided uniform like the governors hes at the warehouse isnt he or is he still at the jetty asked the factor no said the sheriff entering to tell you the truth when i passed the hotel he was sitting in the smokingroom the smokingroom of the hotel said the governor the factor laughed treating his friends in advance of the event i suppose its bad to let the sledge go ahead of the horse though no said the sheriff again to tell you the truth he was quite alone drinking asked the governor nonsense stephen magnus does not drink said the factor i hope not but im always afraid of it his grandfather on the maternal side you know ah nobody knows what is inside anothers coat said the bishop annas father had some trouble in his headmust have had even diseases are inherited said the governor but the old man drank after he buried his wife not before he married her said the rector and then aunt margret and anna returned to the room saying here she is at last bringing thora in her simple velvet costume called the kirtle with silver belt bell sleeves and white lace about the neck the governor took thora in his arms and kissed her but how pale my child he said you may well say so governor said aunt margret she has been crying since early morning crying said the factor now i never can understand why a woman must always cry when she is going to be married its such a bad compliment to her husband but i agree with thora said the governor if ever there is a time to cry or at least to feel grave and anxious it is just that moment of life when it is customary to dance and sing as if you were setting out on a triumphal procession instead of taking a leap into the dark and i agree with the governor said the bishop when i see a bride crying so bitterly at the altar that she can hardly utter the responses i generally know she is going to be a happy wife thora might wait until the wedding though said aunt margret and then oscar came dashing into the room out walkinglost count of the timeonly six minutes to dressdid it in five he said in breathless gasps hes another pale one laughed the rector has there been a frost overnight that has nipped all our rosebuds been running to get here said oscar but ive raced magnus it seems magnus has raced you in another way my boy said the rector nodding his head toward thora who was blushing and looking down whereupon the governor muttered oscar must not dream of marriage yet awhile he has his career to think about and he has not been too earnest about it hitherto well my experience in business said the factor is that when a woman marries she slackens off but when a man marries he tightens up at that the sheriff nudged the rector who whispered the factor has still another daughter rector what if he has said the factor a man cant have two sistersinlaw to one brother no but he can give his brother a sisterinlaw too said the rector and then everybody laughed that reminds me said the factor helga sent us a photograph the other day where is it thora here it is said thora taking a photograph out of a drawer oscar held out his hand for it and looked at it long and earnestly how fine ive scarcely ever seen such a splendid face quite grown up too is helga coming home soon factor not very soon said the factor and then the lawyer came in with a large portfolio of papers and laid them on the table ha ha laughed the hector a rich mans child needs a careful christening it seems youre right rector and it has taken my clerk the entire day to engross the contract but it was not that which kept me until nowit was this the rings cried the two elder women as the lawyer took a small plush box from his pocket yes you may remember that when the rings had to be ordered yesterday morning magnus could not be found anywhere so i was compelled to order them myself well i thought i gave careful instructions but the idea is abroad in the town do you know that it is oscar not magnus who is to marry thoranobody believes anything elseso what does olaf the silversmith do but write oscar on the inside of one of the rings never said oscar trying to laugh with the others yes indeed and the error was not discovered until the very last moment and then all i could do as you see was to have oscar erasedit was too late to have magnus inscribed instead where is magnus i wonder said the governor walking restlessly before the window dont be anxious about magnus stephen said anna he grows more and more like my poor father if father promised to be somewhere at a certain time he would turn up to the minute if he had to kill a couple of ponies in getting there the cathedral clock struck five at that moment and sure enough before the clang of the last stroke had died away magnus walked into the room he looked slack and almost untidy in his pea jacket and long boots and was the only person in the room who had not troubled to dress for the occasion the governors face darkened at sight of him and the factor said in a tone of vexation well let us get to work and have it overive been spoiling for a smoke this halfhour the lawyer opened his portfolio and the company gathered about the table whereupon aunt margret cried magnus do you allow of this heres oscar sitting beside thora dont disturb him said magnus this is good enough for me and he took a low seat by the side of his mother now come said the factor let the one who has the best voice start the singing it must be the lawyer then said the rector for every lawyer has a voice of silverpasses it for silver anyway and then amid the general laughter the lawyer opened the marriage contract and began to read xi the company listened intently and at the close of every clause the governor who was resting his head on his hand and his elbow on the table said good very good generous most generous when the lawyer had finished the other old people leaned back and drew long breaths of satisfaction but the governor rose and crossed to the factor and shook hands with him saying just like you old friend the factor was gratified by the reception of the document and became bright and almost humorous imitating the manner of the auctioneer he cried anybody bid higher then goinggoinggo wait said the governor hadnt we better ask the opinion of the young people themselves after all they are the persons ultimately concerned and though a cow seldom kicks when you are carrying her clover there was a general titter a nodding of many heads and muttered responses of just so just a matter of form very well thora what do you say said the factor expecting a burst of rapturous approval but thora only answered timidly i dont know hadnt you better ask magnus first certainly my dearmagnus first as a matter of course what do you say magnus any suggestion to make any little improvement how do you like the contract there was an awkward silence which astonished the older people and then came a great surprise magnus who had been sitting with his head down raised a white and firmset face and answered i do not like the contract at all factor and i cannot sign it at this there were looks of bewilderment among the older people who seemed to be uncertain if they had heard aright while thora and oscar who partly understood seemed to be struggling to catch their breath the factor was the first to recover his selfpossession and he said with a slightly supercilious accent is that so i thought i knew something of these matters but if you think you can draw up a better document magnus but then the governor interposed some trifle no doubt he said suavely magnus will explain what is the point you object to my son there was another moment of tense silence and then magnus said in a harsh voice by this contract i am required to live in iceland all my lifethats slavery and i will not submit to it but my dear magnus said anna dont you see the reason for that to all intents and purposes thora is the factors only daughterhis only childand if she goes away who is to cheer him up and make home bright for him be reasonable magnus anna hadnt we better let the young man finish said the factor he may have other objections have you yes said magnus according to this contract i am to be taken into partnership on marrying thora but only on a quarter share partnership is partnership and where there are two partners it should be half and halfi must have half the company listened in consternation and the factor began to laugh why not he said in a cynical tone everything is hay in hard weather im so hard up for a soninlaw that i shouldnt stick at a trifle old friend said the governor let us not be too hasty perhaps magnus has not made himself quite plain as plain as a pikestaff he wants an equal partnership but perhaps that is not all is there anything else yes there is sir said magnus in a rather aggressive manner by this deed when you retire i am to take over the business but i am only to have onethird share of the profits i must have twothirds indeed said the factor do you know i thought if i allowed you to come into the business that i had made and to work it with my plant and my capital onethird was generous most generous said the governor mopping his forehead but magnus is slowslow both of thought and speech he must have some explanation what do you mean magnus take your time and speak plainly i mean sir said magnus that the barter business in iceland will break up before long when the factor retiresperhaps beforehis business will be worth nothingnot even the name for that will be less than nothing a new business will have to be created and if i am to create it i must have twothirds of the profits leaving onethird for the use of the factors money the factor was losing his temper why any at all he said why not kick me out altogether no use beating a dog with a cheese when a whip is handy the company were murmuring at magnus when the governor interposed again magnus he said to say im astonished is to say nothing the factor has treated you with boundless liberality but no well is so deep that it cant be emptied and if you go any farther go any farther said the factor why shouldnt he go farther it isnt fair play between the wind and a straw but why shouldnt he beat me about a little more anything else to ask sir yes said magnus without the change of a muscle by this contract my wife is to inherit half her fathers fortune at his deathshe must inherit the whole of it good lord the exclamation seemed to come from everybody in the general chorus of condemnation which followed are you dreaming cried the governor do you forget that the factor has another daughter no sir i do not forget it said magnus but the other daughter has gone away with her mother she may never come back and after thora has spent her life by her fathers sidecheering him up and making his home bright as mother saysand perhaps nursing him in his last daysis somebody else who has done nothing to sweep off half of all he leaves behind no my wifeif i marrymust have everything the older people both strangers and members of the family broke into loud expressions of dissent while the factor looked round at them and said an eagle isnt displeased with a dead sheep is it and so mr governors son he said wheeling about on magnus these are the only terms on which you will do me the honor to marry my daughter without noticing the sneer magnus answered yes well i must say im deceived in magnus said aunt margret i didnt think he had a selfish thought in his heart i didnt think said the factor who was not laughing any longer i didnt think the son of anybody in iceland could afford to turn up his nose at a daughter of mine neilsen said the governor firmly we have been friends since we were boys and neither of us knows which will bury the otherdont let us quarrel now over the conduct of our children the company murmured approval and then the governor turned once more to magnus my sonfor you are my son though im at a loss to understand ityou are making a breach between two families by asking these utterly impossible terms dont you see they are impossible have you taken leave of your senses are you quite mad or is it true that you have been drinkingthat you are drunk good god magnus made no answer but the painful silence which followed the governors outburst was broken by a pitiful cry it came from thora she understood everything at last she knew what magnus was doing for her and the price he was going to pay for it and she wanted to cry out but could not so she dropped her head on aunt margrets shoulder and wept bitterly anna mistook thoras tears for shame and humiliation and turning to magnus she said my dear son you havent thought of things in the right way or you couldnt do what you are doing i dont like these marriage contracts myself it seems like a tempting of providence to talk about money and business just when two souls who love one another are joining themselves together and becoming one but you are making it worse magnusyou are making it a mere bargain and then think of thora if you refuse her fathers offer everybody will hear of it and the poor girl will be shamed do you want to see that magnus im sure you do not so come now for thoras sakeeven though you dont quite like the factors conditions for thoras sake magnuswill you not everybody waited for magnuss reply and even thora raised her head no said magnus in a voice like a growl and then he sat with a stolid face while the condemnation of the company fell upon him in a chorus of denunciation infamous hateful execrable damnable the mans heart must be as black as a raven oscar could bear no more he had been sitting silent with head down as if trying to hide his agitated face while turning helgas photograph over and over in his restless fingers but now he rose walked to the curtains which divided the front room from the back parted them with a trembling hand and looked out over the lake on which the sun was setting dont go away oscar cried the governor i know you are disgusted with your brothers turpitude but i want you to speak to him for all that it is hardly likely that having refused to pay attention to his mother or me he should listen to you or anybody else but try him for the honor of the family tell him that if he adheres to the attitude he has taken up he will be an object of hatred and contempt as long as he lives people will despise him and his family will be ashamed to acknowledge his name if he has no love for thora see if he has any respect for himself speak to your brother oscar for mercys sake speak to him oscars hand on the curtain shook visibly and he said with an effort while all listened without breathing and thoras parted lips quivered i cannot do that father i do not feel that i have any right no doubt magnus knows as well as we do what he is doing and has counted all the consequences everybody has to live his own life at this there was a murmur of disappointment and the governor turning away walked to the window then oscar stepped back to the table and said more firmly yet with as much emotion but if i cannot appeal to magnus there is something i can doi can offer to take magnuss place if you and the factor will consent i can accept the conditions of the contract just as they are and be only too proud to marry thora if she will accept me at first there were looks of blank amazement about the table then a general sigh of relief and everybody seemed to be saying at once good splendid the very thing yes said the voice of the governor husky with emotion it is just like oscaralways doing the great thing but in a matter which so intimately concerns the boys future welfare i cannot allow a momentary impulse of generosity it isnt a momentary impulse father since i came home from england i have learnt to love thora but she was engaged to my brother and i couldnt speak until magnus had spoken honorable most honorable said several voices and it was with difficulty that oscar could go on but nowif it is understood that magnus retires that is to say refuses to marry thora he does undoubtedly he does said the factor and if thora will take me every eye looked toward thora she hesitated for a moment then rose from her chair and timidly held out her hand oscar grasped it eagerly and there was a chorus of congratulation but we cannot allow thora either to be carried away by a momentary impulse said aunt margret who was vigorously wiping her eyes and if shes only doing this to escape from a shameful position im not auntie said thora i only consented to marry magnus because my father wished it but i love oscar and if father will agree the factors eyes were sparkling with the light of triumph and he cried across to the governor what do you say stephen well i must say its fast amblingtoo fast said the governor but if the young people are satisfied and if oscar is content to give up his career in englandhis music and his studiesand live in iceland all his life it may save a breach between our families and tide us over an ugly reef then so be it godson cried the factor slapping oscar on the back and as for england ill take care of that this was received with a shout of approval from the strangers and then the factor called to the lawyer to alter the names in the contract and get it signed without delay as for you sir he said turning to magnus and snapping his fingers in his face your ugly chickens have come home to roost you thought you could corner me but your selfishness and worldliness have done the work that everybody seems to have wanted ha ha ha he laughs best who laughs last theres nothing i like better than to dish a man who tries to dish me and ill go to bed happy tonight magnus had risen from his low seat and was standing with his head down and his hands on his hips while the storm beat over him and thinking he was still unmoved the factor burst upon him again in a tone of biting raillery but if the barter trade is going to the dogs hadnt you better cut it before the crash comes heavy is the fall you know when an old man tumbles and i might crush you coming down ill trouble you to leave my house sir without a days delay father cried thora and she stepped between them but the factor brushed her aside you get away thora if a daughter of mine had done to me what he has tried to do today she wouldnt have a roof to cover her tonight neither shall a son of minenot in this town at all events said the governor magnus stephenson stephen stephen said anna and oscar in the same quivering voice as before cried out to his father hold your tongue anna oscar be quiet youve done enough for one day magnus stephenson when you leave the factors house you will go to thingvellir and stay there and thank your stars if for the rest of your life you are allowed to earn your bread by the sweat of your brow the amended contract is ready for the signatures said the lawyer and then everybody save one turned back to the table and there was a cackle of cheerful voices when the names were all signed and witnessed the rings were exchanged and there was some joking and happy laughter alls well that ends well said the bishop that will do as a pledge between you until you come to me to be made man and wife supper is ready cried aunt margret drawing the curtains of the inner room and then seeing a photograph on the floor beneath them she said but whos been treading on poor helgas portrait thats oscar said thora he had it in his hand when he got up when the company were seated about the supper table it was seen that there was one chair too many and the governor pushed it back with an impatient hand magnus had goneno one had seen him go xii alone and forgotten a prey to the devilish voices which had tortured him in the time of his temptation angry and unsatisfied although he had carried out his purpose and triumphed as he had intended magnus was in his room at the top of the house gathering up his belongings by the light of a candle they were few and not valuablea little money two or three suits of clothes two or three pairs of riding fishing and snow boots some musical exercise books the book of job the pilgrims progress having illustrations of apollyon with horns and the precious flute with which he had beguiled those blessed evenings that now seemed to belong to another existence he had sent for two ponies to take him to the farma saddle pony and a pack ponyand two small boxes held everything when all was packed he came upon the remains of a bottle of brandy which he had kept in his bedroom as medicine and he drank the spirit and threw the bottle away during that short hour of pain and degradation he heard at intervals the various noises of the company at supper belowsometimes in single voices sometimes in climbing cries like the sounds of a geyser sometimes in peals of joyous laughterand his heart grew bitter he could plainly distinguish oscars voice among the rest at first quiet enough but afterward loud and hilarious and his very soul sickened you fool said the other voices at his ear what did you expect did you think he would be overwhelmed with sorrow he is glad hell walk over your head and over thoras head too listen to him alreadythe sweet unselfish privileged pet of everybody after the boxes had been sent downstairs magnus took a last look round and then he tried to shut out all bitter thoughts and evil passions for he believed that he was leaving that room for ever it had been his home through seven long years and some of them had been bad years but some of them had been good and the good ones filled the little place with memories of many visions the sloping roof the dormer window the deal furniture the sheeps skin on the bare floor and the sunflower pattern on the wallpaper were all ghosts of the dreams he had dreamt there some were dreams of the great things he was going to do for iceland but more were dreams of thora and remembering that both sorts were dead now and that thora belonged to oscar to save himself from further repining and to crush down the riot that was rising within he blew out the candle and that chapter of his life was at an end but the devilish voices were not yet done with him going downstairs he had to pass the door of the front room on the first landing and he went by it on tiptoe for years he had always passed that door on tiptoe for it was the door to thoras room a holy place half nursery half sanctuary as thora herself had grown to be half saint to him and half child but he was not thinking of that this time he was thinking he must get out of the house without seeing her again for she belonged to oscar now and if they were to meet and she began to thank him for giving her to oscarbut god forbid thoras door was closed but the next room stood open it was aunt margrets bedroom and magnus knew that a photograph of thora was on the chest of drawers near the door he had often envied it and now he stooped to look at it for the last time and the voices at his ear seemed to say take it its all you are going to carry away of her going down the last flight of stairs he heard the two sittingrooms buzzing like the millhouse and knew that others must have joined the party but above all other sounds he heard the sound of oscars voice clear as a flute saluting people as they came in listen to him the darling said the mocking voices by his side coming to the hall he encountered some of the women of the town in their feastday dresses and with garden flowers in their hands hardly any of them looked at him but all passed into the sittingroom where oscar waited to welcome them the hatstand in the hall had been cleared for the newcomers therefore magnus had to go to a rail under the stairs for his overcoat and ridingwhip and while he was there aunt margret opened the door of the back sittingroom to ventilate the crowded place she did not see him for she had taken off the spectacles she usually wore and he was standing in the shadow but he saw everybody in the room and thora among the rest thora was sitting by the wall and the townspeople were going up to her one after another and offering their flowers and making congratulatory speeches and she was thanking them in her soft voice and looking very happy magnus was hurt by thoras happiness he had done all he could to make her happy he had sacrificed everything but now that he looked on her happiness he was hurt by it and when oscar went and stood by her chair looking bright and proud he felt hot with anger and hatred while he pulled on his overcoat he could not help hearing what was being said within the room such an extraordinary thing thora said one people in the town actually said it was magnus you were going to marry i heard that too said another i heard it at olafs the silversmiths when we were drinking coffee such an idea said a third as if any girl would marry magnus who could get oscar and then oscars voice large expansive indulgent almost patronizing tut tut you mustnt say anything against magnus elisabet but i hear magnus insulted thora this evening and the factor has turned him out for it can it be possible i saw him in the hall as i was coming in no no not insultednot insulted exactly said oscars voice again and then magnus sick and dizzy turned away he was going out of the house with head down when the door of the front sittingroom opened and closed quickly and he found himself face to face with thora she was trying to look sad but the light of her happiness was still in her eyes and her parted lips were smiling i heard you were here she said and i couldnt help coming out to see you oscar told me yesterday i was not to speak whatever happened but it seems so terrible that you should leave us like this we made a mistake and we had to get out of it somehow said magnus i know said thora and of course i think it will be the best thing in the end you would have had no joy of me magnus and i should have been very unhappy perhaps you would said magnus but it is a great grief to me that you will have to give up all the schemes you had set your heart upon magnus i have given up more than that thora said magnus and he tried to push past her and go the light of her smile died off her face and with a wistful look in a pleading voice she said i feel as if i am losing a friend magnus and you are saying goodby to me for good not that exactly said magnus goodby magnus goodby they were standing with hands clasped in what they believed to be their last parting when the buzz of the inner room broke out upon them again and a cheery voice cried thora thora where are youoh its you magnus it was oscar and at the next moment thora had gone back the door of the sittingroom had closed behind her and magnus and his brother were together in the hall i meant to come out to you before old fellow said oscar but they stuck to me like leeches and i couldnt get away i wanted to thank you for what you did for me this evening it was too generous too brotherly and i can never be sufficiently grateful magnus did not answer so oscar went on you pledged me to silence and you were right plainly right but of course i cannot allow the error about your motive to go much farther and as soon as it is safe to do so i will set you right people shall know the truth about what you did and why you did it and they will make amends for their mistake still magnus did not speak so oscar continued its too bad though that you should suffer in the meantime and if there is anything i could do for youin a material way i meanif you are in want of but the dark fire that was rising in magnuss face frightened him and he could not finish what he wished to say i dont care a straw what people think i did it for said magnus and i dont care a damn if they never make amends you know what i did it for and thats enough for me i did it for the sake of thora i gave her up to you that you might love her and cherish her and make her happy and be a better husband to her than i could be but if you dont do it if you ever neglect her or desert her or give her up for another woman ill take her back do you hear memagnus swayed like a drunken man and laid hold of oscars armill take her back and thenthen by god ill kill you saying this he walked heavily out of the house leaving oscar with white cheeks and gibbering lips alone in the hall his ponies were waiting for him in the street ready for the journey to thingvellir the night was dark but the windows of the house were bright for the blinds had been drawn and the sashes thrown open a cackle of many voices came out of them for the company within was now large and very merry while magnus tightened the girths somebody played a guitar and as he was riding away oscar began to sing part ii impotent pieces of the game he plays upon this chequerboard of nights and days hither and thither moves and checks and slays and one by one back in the closet lays i oscar did his best to keep the fire burning in the inner sanctuarythe fire of love and dutybut oftener than he was aware it flickered and seemed to be in danger of dying out he tried to tell the truth about magnus but as frequently as he thought out a way of doing so he was confronted by the ugly question which would surely be asked can it be possible that you stood passively aside while we condemned magnus for a vice he was not guilty of and praised you for a virtue you did not possess the humiliation of speech like that would be deeper than the degradation of silence and from day to day oscar postponed the painful confession thus a month passed and he had said nothing his position would have been easier if he had been getting on better with his workif he could have felt it impossible that the factor could regret the loss of magnus then he would have said after all though naturally you didnt think so at the time everything has been for the best whereupon the factor would have said you are right godson and after that he would have told all but his work was going badly and there was no blinking the fact that he was a poor business man on first going into the factors on the footing the contract gave him he rambled from office to warehouse with aimless and shiftless uncertainty dressed with bohemian freedom and looking like a butterfly in a back alley then the factor said come come young fellow we must be getting to work choose a department and be responsible for it oscar selected the export department this brought him into relation with the farmers and some of them cheated him unmercifully concealing their inferior wool in the body of the packs he bought from them magnus would have rooted out both the bad stuff and the men who brought it and they would have gone flying before his threatening face but oscar wished to stand well with everybody and the firm suffered accordingly after a week he wished to change he thought the import department would suit him better very well said the factor mistakes are made by the young as well as the oldbuckle to at the imports my boy the imports brought him into relation with the mates of steamers and trading ships and they were quick to shuffle their responsibility for damaged freights onto oscars shoulders after another week he went back to the factor and said i dont think a department is what suits me best godfatherwhy not let me have a general supervision the factor shrugged his shoulders but replied im willing you shall be my righthand man then and ill ease off as soon as you are ready but from that moment onward oscar did nothing good bad or indifferent he was always running about like one out of breath but he came at any hour in the morning and left at any time in the evening and was always skipping off to see thora that little lady was entirely content but the factor was heard to say to aunt margret there was something in magnus after all margret and aunt margret was heard to answer many a good sword is in a bad sheath you know but one day oscar came flying to the factor in breathless haste with his mouth full of great news the member of parliament for the town was dead and the radical party were already preparing to run a candidatean outandout socialist named oddsson an enemy of the old order in both politics and trade why shouldnt i go into althing said oscar i could protect the business against these rascally revolutionaries and help to preserve the old principles let me talk to your father first said the factor the old friends agreed that the scheme was a good one not only was the man oddsson a believer in magnuss doctrine about the barter trade but he was the champion of an agitation for establishing a new constitution in iceland which would abolish the governor and set up a minister responsible to parliament alone he must be kept out in selfdefense they must fight the common enemy oscar would be a good candidate being young and bright and clever and a personal favorite but i cannot appear in the contest said the governor leave it to me said the factor and he went back and told oscar who shouted with delight and shot off to tell thora by this time thora had spent a long month in radiant happiness if she thought sometimes of magnuss position she remembered that oscar had said he would set things right and the delay counted for little because she measured existence by days no longer but by emotions and she was conscious of one emotion onlylove for oscar and therefore for everybody and everything in the world as the year was growing elderly and its withering winds made further excursions to the islands of the fiord impossible they remained at home and romped like children or played the guitar and piano at such times thora was not without certain backward thoughts of magnus for the room was the same and nothing was different except the hour of the day but there was always the difference of its being oscar he taught her some icelandic love songs and she sang them in a thin sweet treble which oscar cheered tumultuously it did not hurt her in the least that oscar never took her singing seriouslyhe did not take thora herself seriously he called her baby thora and she christened him the bad boy the moment he had left her sight she would send a letter after him like a handkerchief he had forgotten he always replied and his letters were full of affectionate banter but perhaps at the bottom of her heart she was a little disappointed with them they were not quite loverlike enough there were scarcely any of them she could not read aloud to aunt margret there was hardly one that was her very own but oscar made up for every deficiency when he arrived himself and on the day when he came with a hop skip and a jump into the sittingroom and announced that he was to be member of althing she saw him for one moment great and glorious like the top of a mountain when it has broken through the mist and the sun has flashed on to it and then she said and now the bad boy must play with mehe hasnt played me blindmans buff since yesterday thora was too happy to think of her happiness but she told herself sometimes that there was only one thing wanted to make it completethat helga should come home to share it she broached the subject to oscar but it was at a moment when he was immersed in his manifestoes and he merely said good idea splendid helga looks like a stunner send for her certainly if the factor approves and he went on with his tiresome politics she broached it next to aunt margret who was less encouraging putting her spectacled face close to thoras she shook her ringlets and said dont be a ninny twos company threes none but thora mentioned the matter to anna also and the motherly old thing was moved that would be beautiful if you could manage it thora she said and if it should lead to bringing the others together what a blessing it would be after that thora regarded herself in the light of the family peacemaker and in this character she approached her father the factor listened to her with sympathy for nature is stronger than lawyers ink and he had often told himself he had been foolish to part with his child well i dont see why she shouldnt he said she might come for the weddingor say for a yearone year at all events ill write to the lawyer in denmark by the same mail thora wrote to helga dearest helgafather is writing to the lawyer to ask him to send you back to iceland it is only for a year so i hope mamma will not object i am sure you will not when i tell you what is to happen there is to be a wedding and of course a party and great goings on dear i am to be married to oscar stephenson who has come back from england and is so handsome and so clever if you could see him as he is now you would fall in love with him instantly but he is so fond of me and i am so happy i was to have married his brother magnus but the engagement broke down and now i am very sorry for magnus and if ever you hear anything against him when you come home you are not to believe a word of it because magnus is as good as gold only i could not care for him so it was no use trying dear there are such lots of things i want to tell you but i must save them until you come we have had bad trade this summer and oscar has gone into fathers business i am weaving a web of cloth for fathers christmas suit but it does not make much progress because somebody is always interrupting and when you are about to be married there is so much to doisnt there dearest helga i have no more to write about now so give my love to mamma and mind you come before long for the wedding may be soon although nothing is fixed yet your affectionate sister thora pscome quickly i am dying to introduce you to oscar a fortnight later the factor announced that he had heard from the lawyer in denmark and helga was to come by the next steamer the laura and shes due on the first of november and thats the day of the election said oscar what a good omen said thora and she sang her iceland love songs all that evening through for she was very happy ii on the morning of the day when the laura was due there was no sign of her on the sea but that was a matter of moment only to thora who had been up early and down at the jetty before breakfast the rest of the little world in which she lived were immersed in preparations for the election and were going about like dogs on the leash before the hunt begins oscar was flying to and fro with red ribbons in his buttonhole ponies were coming and going with red ribbons in their bridles and red flags were hanging all over the town but nevertheless there was a sense of uncertainty everywhere and an atmosphere of intense excitement the day opened dull and rayless with a pale sun behind a slaty sky like a white wafer on an old parchment an hour before the polling booths opened the governor called upon the factor under pretense of his mornings walk and said im doubtful of the result neilsen and i now see that oscar was the worst possible candidate to stand for our cause everybody who has a grievance against the governor is going to vote against the governors son and everybody who has a grievance against the factor will vote against his soninlaw oh i know the people bless them said the factor master when you want anythingslave when you dont but well see stephen well see after finishing his breakfast comfortably the factor walked leisurely to his countinghouse and called for his ledger it showed that nearly half of the electors of the town were indebted to him some of them slightly others deeply and not a few beyond hope of payment without pressure or distraint he counted up their total indebtedness and it proved to be frightful but life is precious when death is at the door he thought and lighting his long german pipe he put the leatherbound book under his arm and strolled quietly across to the pollingstation as chairman of oscars committee the factor had a right to sit inside the polling booth but he merely asked to be allowed to take a chair outside the counter to which the voters would come up when they recorded their votes a low seat is often easy he said sitting with his face to the sheriff and his back to the door when the doors were opened the factor laid his ledger across his knees and took out a thick blue pencil then as each voter came up to the counter and his name was called and looked up in the register the factor was seen to turn up the voters account in his own book and hold his blue pencil over it whom do you vote for asked the sheriff oscar stephenson or jon oddsson and if the voter answered oscar stephenson the blue pencil was seen to descend in two broad strokes across the account as if cancelling it altogether but if he answered jon oddsson it was seen to score the total with a double underline as if marking it for immediate recovery the opposition had entered in hot haste but the effect was instantaneous a voter would come swaggering up to the counter call his name in a robustious voice and then while waiting for the verification of his right to vote see the factor sitting below with his own account open before him and understanding everything in a moment would begin to answer the sheriff with a faltering odd then pause tremble mumble stephenson and go stumbling out of doors silently hour after hour from the beginning of the day to the end of it the factor sat at his task never once looking up from his ledger and apparently doing nothing but checking as he had a right to do the sheriffs record of the votes aunt margret came to say that dinner was ready but he answered that he was not hungry toward three in the afternoon thora arrived in great excitement to say that the laura had been sighted outside the head but he told her to meet her sister herself and tell her that he did not expect to be home before midnight when the cathedral clock struck four the sheriff rose and ordered the shutting of the doors the short winters day had closed in by this time and while the counting was going on with its monotonous beat in the silence of the breathless room like the splashing of rain on the pavementstephenson stephenson oddsson stephensonthe factor who had lit his pipe was pacing the corridor outside like a man who walks in his orchard when the fruit is ripe when the counting was finished the sheriff told the attendants to open the window and then the deep hum of a crowd which had been cheering and singing outside with a noise like the waves breaking on a bar far off rose to a roar like that of the sea running up a stony beach at the next moment everybody was shaking hands with oscar a band was beginning to play in the street and the sheriff was stepping on to the balcony meantime thora fluttering with excitement of another sort had gone down to the jetty to meet helga as soon as the laura had steamed up the fiord and cast anchor outside the town she put off in her fathers white boat and drew up alongside it was now quite dark but lights were burning on the steamer and the dark figures of a line of passengers were silhouetted against the sky as they leaned over the rail and shouted to the friends in little boats who had come out to meet them thora was sure that helga must be there and she wanted to call to her but her heart was beating so fast that her voice would not answer at length the ladder was let down and thoras boat swayed up to it and then she climbed up the steamers side helga miss helga is below said a voice out of the darkness and though she felt a pang of disappointment that helga was not waiting she ran down the stairs to the saloon at the bottom she called helga again and the stewardess said the young lady is in her cabin which second to the left feeling conscious of increasing disappointment but still panting in her eagerness thora skipped off to the cabin and then came a shock of surprise somehow she had expected to find helga a little thing grown certainly but still smaller than herself in her dreams of their first meeting she had pictured herself stooping to kiss helga and then in a sisterlymotherly sort of way putting her arms about her waist but the young lady who came leisurely out of the cabin with her veil down and buttoning her kid gloves was much taller than thora and quite dignified and stately thora said the girl so it is youreally you said thora really me laughed helga and then it was helga who stooped to kiss thora who had to lift up her face to her thoras heart was in her mouth in both senses she looked at helga again by the dim light of the saloon lamp and felt herself small and insignificant helga was beautiful with fine features large gray eyes and rich dark complexion and thora felt herself to be plain and commonplace helga was fashionably dressed in the danish manner with the soft silk things about the neck and bosom which give charm to a charming girl and thora felt herself to be dowdy and countrified in her iceland hufa and stiff velvet cloak have you come alone asked helga quite alone said thora but hasnt father come with you or aunt margret or that wonderful oscar is there nobody but you nobody but me said thora and then though she felt crushed and small she delivered the factors message and told about the election so that was the meaning of the band we heard as we were sailing up said helga and at the first moment thora thought perhaps helga had hoped it was in honor of her own arrival but at the next she felt ashamed and foolish we might as well go then said helga and she swept up the stairs leaving thora to follow it was all so different from what thora had expectedso utterly differentthat she would have given anything to run away and cry but going ashore in the boat she sat at the helm side by side with helga and there the lights being gone and thora no longer in awe of helgas fashion and beauty she slipped her arm about her sisters waist as she had always intended to do and after that they got on better when they touched the jetty there was much shouting and scrambling in the darkness and thora was nervous and excited but helga was quiet and even amused no carriages in this benighted country yet i suppose said helga no but ive brought silvertop to take you up said thora and what is there for you oh ill walki love walking the street at the top of the jetty was thronged with the people who were waiting outside the polling place to hear the result of the election and when the girls came to the crowd which was goodnatured but boisterous they found it difficult to plow their way through until a big man stepped before them and swept the people aside like ninepins what a tremendous creature that was said helga he could have felled an ox i fancy but didnt you know him helga it was magnus stephenson said thora magnus why didnt he speak i wonder they had reached the outskirts of the crowd and were crossing in front of the polling place when the people raised a great shout for it was the moment when the sheriff stepped on to the balcony hes going to declare the poll shall we wait asked thora it might be amusing said helga as soon as there was silence the sheriff read the figures oscar had been elected by three votes to one at this there was another hurricane of cheers with cries of oscar oscar and thora said oscar will come next shall we wait and see him why not it will be good fun said helga and in the interval thora patted silvertop to keep him quiet and creeping closer to her sister squeezed her hand then oscar came bounding on to the balcony amidst a wild breaker of applause and behind him came two men bearing torches so that his figure and face were plainly visible to the crowd belowhis slight lithe form his fair hair slightly ruffled his sparkling eyes his mobile mouth and the neverfailing smile that captivated everybody it was thus that helga saw him for the first time since he became a man and her face which had worn a playful expression became grave how fine she said thora could hardly catch the words over the sibilation of the running cheers but she said he will speakshall we wait to hear him assuredly said helga and when oscar began with fellow townsmen and fellow countrymen thora felt helgas hand shiver and heard her say the same voice oscars speech was punctuated by applause at the end of every sentence and when it was finished and the speaker and the men with the torches had disappeared thora spoke to helga again but she answered at random and sat in her saddle like one in a dream somebody else came on to the balcony and had a mixed reception it must be father said thora and then the factors voice utterly indifferent to hostile interruptions was heard to say that a supper had been prepared at the hotel for the committee of the successful candidate and they were to go there at oncethe new member would follow presently with that the crowd broke up and the girls went their waythora clinging closer than ever to her sister for her heart was warm with love and pride well she said what did you think of him think of him oscar said helga she laughed uncomfortably and then stooped from the saddle and whispered only to think that a little thing like you dear should capture a man like that thora laughed also but she hardly knew whether she was pleased or hurt a sudden chill had struck her it was like the breath of the mountain snow which sometimes comes down in summer iii the gods of riot were playing so hard a game with thora that she was in a fever to introduce oscar to helga and when he did not appear by noon of the following day she sent a letter across to government house to order him to come forthwith the bad boy was too full of his silly politics while there was something far more charming and absorbing waiting for him there but an answer came back from anna to say that oscar was still asleep and after the excitement of the day before and the late hour of the previous night she was unwilling to waken him early in the afternoon anna herself came over expecting to see the firstfruits of the peacemaking and while aunt margret was below stairs preparing chocolate for the company that was expected the motherly old thing tried various artful ways of finding out from helga what her upbringing had been in denmark and particularly what religious instruction and society her mother had given her helga saw through the device in a moment and with her red lips a little awry she painted an alarming picture of theaters and concerthalls and a flat in copenhagen frequented by actors and actresses especially on sunday evenings where everybody including the ladies smoked cigarettes and drank brandy meanwhile thora watched for oscar out of the sidelight of the projecting window and as soon as she saw him swinging down the road she darted into the hall and threw herself into his arms and kissed him whereupon with his head full of his victory he said congratulations eh the sweetest ive had yet and pushed through toward the drawingroom wait wait wait somebody to show you cried thora then the poor victim of god knows what maleficent powersnot knowing what she did but laughing merrily as if a songbird had been imprisoned in her throatbegan to play the old familiar trick of children standing behind oscar on tiptoe in order to reach she put her hands over his eyes and crying forward soldier marched him blindfold into the drawingroom and up to the place where helga was waiting then removing her hands sharply she cried there and stood off to see the effect oscar found himself face to face with a girl as unlike thora as could be tall dark with hair parted at the side and hanging over the forehead dressed in a light silk blouse and silvergrey skirt and having an odor of violets about her helga can it be possible he stretched out his hand and helga took it and held it and so they stood for some moments while thora breathing rapidly watched the changing lights in their faces in oscars astonishment admiration and rapture in helgas curiosity satisfaction and delight and thoras own face tooto the pitying angels who alone were looking at itshowed expressions just as various pride joy then uneasiness and finally a little twinge of secret pain to relieve this feeling thora burst into laughter and then everybody laughed and aunt margret came into the room with the chocolate and cakes so youve brought them together again thora said aunt margret and thora swallowed a lump in her throat and answered yes then oscar and helga went over to the window and talked together with great animation thora heard snatches of their conversation as she carried round the cups it was about things of which she knew nothingdenmark copenhagen england london oxford the english theater the danish theater and above all music music music how well they get along said thora trust them for that said aunt margret toward dusk the factor returned homenot having altered his habit of work by a hairs breadth and then came half the great people of the townthe bishop the sheriff the rector of the latin school and finally the governor helga moved among them with the quiet ease of one accustomed to company within an hour she had captured all the men but the women were less sure of her the minute i set eyes on her whispered aunt margret to anna i said to myself thora is a neilsen out and out but theres more of the stranger in this one shes the living picture of what my wife was when i saw her first said the factor in a low tone to the governor who answered significantly in the same low tone then i dont wonder old friendi say i dont wonder helgas head and yours were nearer together when i laid my hand on them last said the bishop to thora take care your sister is running away from you little one isnt she said thora thora did not feel quite so happy in helgas visit as she had expected but still struggling to show her off she asked her to play something on the pianoshe had played after breakfast and it was beautiful helga played brilliantly and oscar who turned over her music applauded her boisterously and now oscar ought to play something said the governor from his earliest years he made us conceive the highest hopes that he might become a great musician he will toomy son neils at the college of music says he will said the sheriff nonsense said the factor oscar has something better to do now than to scrape catgut or blow his lungs through a steampipe still an occasional flirtation with the muses said the hector you wouldnt object to that factor i would object to flirtations of all sorts said the factor and i should think the man a fool who put himself in the way of them surprising how many men do said the governor with a wink at the rector would you believe ita certain friend of yours wrote a poem in the days of his youth never cried the rector and while the old people laughed the factor said when i was a child i behaved as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things well i so far agree with the factor that i think a man cant have his heart in two places at once said the governor what do you say thora i suppose not said thora certainly not any more than a man can love two women at the same time said the governor and then oscar began to play he played as the bird sings because the song is in the soul of it and when he had finished the company cheered him lustily and helga putting her face close to his said in a whisper and you asked me to playi who only play as i am taught and you can play like that oscar was delighted with helgas praises and suggested that they should play together they played a difficult selection full of flourishes and the company declared they had never heard anything like it wonderful wasnt it said somebody yes wasnt it said thora she was feeling utterly eclipsed and forgotten when helga wheeled round on the musicstool and said and now thora must give us something on her guitaraunt margret says she plays it beautifully indeed she doesbeautifully said aunt margret but thora begged off in alarm saying no indeed no i couldnt possibly play after playing like that so oscar and helga began again this time it was an english ballad helga played the accompaniment and oscar sang the air and there was a chorus which they gave together the company were completely carried away charming exquisite but how well their voices harmonize they might have been meant by nature to go together might they not said thora but now thora ought really to play her guitar said helga certainly thora and her guitar said oscar and let her sing one of her iceland love songs to it it was cruel it was heartbreaking it was almost as if helga were trying to humiliate her as if oscar were joining her as if they were conspiring together to expose her inferiority no no dont ask me please dont she pleaded but helga continued to ask and oscar to second her and being able to bear the strain no longer thora burst into tears and fled from the room how extraordinary said helga but oscar followed thora and coaxed and comforted her and brought her back with a smile on her face although the tears were scarcely dry in her eyes i was silly she said i dont know what came over me perhaps it was the heat said the governor and he opened one of the windows iv during the next month oscar was every day and nearly all day at the factors to the total disregard of his public work and the complete neglect of business but his visits were not always to thora who was ceasing to be baby thora either to him or to any one and becoming a serious little figure with a wistful face she never romped about the house now but sat in a corner with a ball of wool in her lap and a crochet hook in her hand while oscar and helga played the piano and talked music it was music music always music at the factors in those days early in her visit helga brought down a pile of the music of wagner and oscar was completely carried away by it other composers produced beautiful harmonies a subtle and clever combination of sweet sounds but when oscar played wagner the piano seemed to him to waken and weep to burn the flame under his fingers its glorious he would say i can never thank you enough helga its a new world a new revelation helga had heard of oscars songs from the sagas and one day she said i wonder you dont try to compose something yourself oscarsomething in the style of wagnerim sure you could then with diffidence and apologies oscar produced his prentice efforts and helga praised them enthusiastically do you know you are a born musician she said and you should never do anything except create musicnever oscar was intoxicated by her applause but he only laughed and said ah thats impossible why impossible parliamentpublic dutiesand so forth but my dear oscar you dont mean to say you are going to waste your life like that do you call it waste helga not for everybodynot for a man like magnus for examplebut for you yes said helga and then with irresistible drollery she mimicked the manners of parliament with its mr speaker permit me to rise to a point of order and will the honorable and learned member explain and all the other inanities of a legislative assembly in a little country oscar laughed until tears from more springs than one began to roll down his cheeks and then he said what an actress you would make helga but principles my dear girl principles are the soul of politics and if a man can guide his country in the higher paths he can afford to forget the plainsdont you think so thora and thora who had been feeling dizzy and faint answered in a helpless way yes oscar but i forgot to tell you that father wished to see you on business business cried helga that too then you object to business also asked oscar for youcertainly because you are not fit for it said helga and if you go into business youll be like a man who has married the wrong woman she may be an excellent thrifty soul quite suitable to somebody else but she was never meant for him theres something in that though its wonderful how you know it said oscar im about the silliest beggar at a bargain that ever breathed out of an oyster shell of course you are oscaryou must be now if magnus had gone into business he might have got something out of it but youwhat in the world do you expect to get ah now youre wrong helga i have got something out of it alreadyive got thora thora didnt you know thora was the prize i was bidding for when i took over that contract so that was itwas it said helga and then thora herself feeling sick and ill gathered up her work and stole out of the room nevertheless the seed which helga had sown had not fallen on stony ground within twentyfour hours oscar appeared with a new composition in his hands an idea came to me last night and i had to get it off he said and then he sat down to the piano and played beautiful cried helga really beautiful but this subject suggests the organwhy not set it to that and try it on the organ in the cathedral splendid idea said oscar thora knows the curator and can get the key what do you say thora if you would like to said thora and next day they carried out their scheme oscar and helga sat together in the organ loft while thora was sent down the communion steps to report the effect at a distance how did that go thora cried oscar once or twice at the beginning and thora answered very nicely i think but then the two in the organ loft forgot her altogether in the rapture of their rehearsal during the next two or three weeks oscar and helga went to the cathedral every day and sometimes thora went with them but more frequently she remained at home a sudden wave of energy seemed to lift oscar out of himself and he produced one composition after another helga applauded all of them and her praises intoxicated him like glory i can never be sufficiently grateful to you helga he said for all the good things you have poured out on me since you came back to iceland you have given my life a new joy a new splendor nonsense said helga i am nothing but a voice to awaken your genius you were born to create music and whatever happens you must never never throw away a life which has the glory of a future like that to this and such as this he always answered ah no or impossible or its past praying for but helgas words were as the very incense of the dreams which in vaguer forms he had been trying to forget since the day he engaged himself to thora why shouldnt there be another wagner an icelandic wagner a wagner with a still grander scene and still greater storiesthe sagas and eddas of this stern old land about a month after helga returned to iceland she suggested to oscar that he should write an anthem on a passage which she selected from one of the sagas it was that in which the old gods of the pagan world in anger with the family of man for permitting the establishment of christianity tore open the bowels of their fruitful valleys with earthquakes and deluged them with molten lava and how christ came through the chaos saying let there be peace great glorious a stunning subject but can i do it said oscar you can you must said helga and from that moment a continual fever burned in oscars blood until the task was done thora saw nothing of him for days except when he bounded in to run over a part of his score with helga and then away without a word to his work again when the anthem was written and he was ready to try it on the organ he said are you coming across to the cathedral today thora no perhaps you had better not well have to go over the thing again and againit might be tiresome it was the afternoon of a dull weekday in the early winter and some of the dreary noises of the workaday world followed oscar into the cathedral a vessel was unloading in the fiordhe could hear the rumble of the iron trolleys as they rolled up the paved jetty to the factors warehouse a new house was being erected on the corner of the cathedral squarehe could hear the thin clank of the masons trowel a steamer was on the stocks in the shipyard down the harborhe could hear the sharp beat of the riveters hammer but there was another atmosphere in the cathedral and oscar floated on it as on a floodthe silent sanctuary the rows of empty pews going up to the chancel the empty pulpit with its soundingboard the empty altar with the eastern subject painted above it the marble font for the baptism of future generations the marble monuments to the memory of past ones and then the listening air awakened by a whisper or a footfall and full of the breath of dead prayer and vanished praise in this atmosphere of art and religion oscar sat down at the organ with helga by his side to try his anthem for the first time the organ throbbed under his fingers the empty cathedral shook like a seacave under the boom of his waves of sound and when he came to the end of his first reading he was quivering with excitement and helga was in a fever what did i tell you she said was i not right oh if this could be heard in denmark or in england said oscar they played the piece again and again and at every fresh playing their excitement increased until it reached the point of hysteria and their voices in that silent place became as shrill as the wind on the mountain top at last they tried the words and then their emotion knew no limit the organ trembled and throbbed again and then on the top of all other sounds came the sound of helgas voice like a human cry above the thundering waves of nature sometimes weeping sometimes raging sometimes crouching sometimes springing out of the surge and finally sinking down to the soft whisper of let there be peace when the anthem was over and all was still oscar sat quiet for some moments while the unheard echo of the music seemed to roll through the silent air and then the lightningflash of joy or madness which comes to every man of genius once in his life came to him also and his heart cried out in its delirious happiness i too am a great composer in the intoxication of that moment oscars hand swung down and took helgas hand and held it and their fingers trembled together and they seemed to hear the beating of each others heart they looked at each other and his eyes were bloodshot and hers were wet helga he cried oscar she answered but at the next moment a window blew open on the staircase to the organ loft and oscar heard again the dreary noises of the workaday world withoutthe rumble of the iron trolleys the thin clank of the masons trowel and the quick beat of the riveters hammer it was like the wakening of a prisoner in his cell when the warder beats at the door and the dream of glory is gone and the prison walls close round him again oscars fingers slackened and the next moment he heard helgas rapid breathing behind him and her voice saying with a strange bitterness is that thora he started and turned where he asked down there by the communion stepsby the altar no i was mistaken its only a shadow the light is fading then with the same bitterness she said but i suppose she will be there soon and you with her oscar shuddered as if a wounded artery had been torn open and helga continued then you will go back to business and oscaroscar stephenson the musicianwill be dead he fingered the organ stops fumblingly and made no reply whereupon helga with undisguised irony began to picture the dull routine of the business life that was waiting for him after marriageits calculations of discounts its squabbles with farmers its buying and selling of pots and pans it is such a pity she said dont torture me helga he cried but is there no way out of it no no no no way at all oscar let us go he said and he had got down to the door before he remembered that he had left his hat behind him in the organ loft thora had tea ready when they got back to the factors she was kneeling before a cozy fire making toast after cutting the bread and butter and she looked up at them as they entered with a nervous questioning tearful smile poor little soul she must never knownever never thought oscar v thora knew already and the big heart in her little breast was breaking she had begun to think that what had happened to magnus when oscar came back was now happening to heroscar was falling in love with helga and she like magnus was being left alone yet she could not reconcile herself to this suspicion without a hard battle and the first skirmish of the sweet heart was to fight for the enemyoscar had made a great great sacrifice when he agreed to marry her it was not to be wondered at if he had spasms of regret sometimes she hinted as much to aunt margret in one of the long hours in which they were left together dont you think that oscar was very unselfish when he signed that contract she said unselfish i dont call it unselfishness to sign yourself into a fortune said aunt margret but he had to take up the business you know certainly he hadthe best business in iceland helga seems to think it is a little beneath him aunt margret its good enough for helgas father and he made it besides oscar had nothing else and an ugly sheep is better than no mutton oh yes he had his music auntie and helga thinks that was a good deal does she indeed people who are naked neednt go about mending other peoples clothes oscars music wouldnt have brought him a penny of profit and as for honorwhat about althing and all the other things he couldnt have got without being rich so you dont think oscar sacrificed himself very much when he signed the contract sacrificed himself perhaps the boot was on the other leg if you ask me thora was happy for days after this interview and while oscar and helga played their wagner she went about the house singing her little love ditties and thinking of the time when parliament would begin its session and oscar would throw himself into politics and become speaker and perhaps governor and it would all come of having married her but it was hard to sit for hours in the same room with people who were scarcely conscious of her presence and though thora tried to hide her pain lest oscar should feel ashamed she sometimes felt bitter about helga and wanted to burst out on her the only thing which restrained her from doing so was a sweet doubt which she cherished in the most secret chamber of her heart that perhaps she was mistaken after all and oscar did not really care for helga auntie she said dont you think its silly to be jealous depends upon circumstances thora if a wifefor examplefancies her husband is paying too much attention to another womandont you think she is silly to be jealous shes silly to show she is my precious it doesnt prevent the sting to bite the head off the serpent and if a wife shows the husband shes jealous shes just doing what the other woman wants so you think she ought to be quiet and say nothing certainly i do if the man is going to run away from her she had better let him run and if he isnt hell be the more ashamed because he thinks she doesnt know you mean that if the man is only fascinated for a time just so fascination may be good enough for a flirtation but its like bright metalit soon gets tarnished in a damp cellar you want gold for the dark places my honey that is to say auntie dear that love is the only thing for married life i should think so indeed with its crosses and disappointments and children and croup and all the rest of it and when it comes to marrying the silliest of the men know that bless them what a lot you know about the men auntie darlingi wonder you never married yourself dear thats why my precious it was easier for thora to veil her agonies with smiles after this conversation she pictured to herself the time when her love would be everything to oscar in the secret places of her soul she thought of the days when children would come and perhaps even sickness and they would be drawn closeso closetogether because the dear clouds of life hung over both of them she was not beautiful she was only a homely and humble little thing she was unworthy of oscar and there were so many things in which she was inferior but oh her love was wonderful nothing in the world was so wonderful as her love it would work miracles it would be stronger than death it would stand by oscar to the end but all the same it was hard to receive her wounds without a cry and when oscar and helga went off to the cathedral and left her at home she told herself she was too ignorant to be oscars wife and all her sweet heroic love was wasted dont you think helga is very clever aunt margret aunt margret lifted her eyes from her knitting and blinked through her spectacles clevera girl who cant darn a stocking or boil a potato but see how she can talk auntie so can the parrot my dear and the raven is seldom sparing of his voice either but surely a man wants his wife to be a companion auntieto be able to converse with him on the subjects he is interested in and to criticise his work perhaps does he perhaps he does but it would be a crazy creature of a man who would rather marry a critic than a cook for all that always after this thora had tea ready when oscar and helga returned from the cathedral and if her heart had its tremors still she tried to take care that oscar should never see a tear in her eyes but many a time when she felt herself to be like an isthmus between the two holding them together yet keeping them apart the strung bow of her will slackened and she was nearly breaking down she waited day by day for oscars heart to speak to her and when it did not speak she told herself it was because helga was so beautiful isnt helga beautiful aunt margret perhaps said aunt margret you know she is auntie you know she is the most beautiful girl in iceland maybe i domaybe i dont what an advantage beauty like helgas gives to a girlshe gets everything and everybody if a girl is only beautiful enough she has all the men at her feet they must he chiropodists then and there are not many of them in these parts no no beauty isnt everything thora and thats a mercy for some of us the color began to mount to thoras eyes and catching sight of this flag of distress aunt margret continued but fine feathers make fine birds and i know some in iceland dress would make helga look small if they were done up in her danish folderols thoras blushing face began to shine like the sunrise but whats the use beauty fills the eye but not the belly auntie margret what plain things you say do i then its best to say them plainly it isnt good to gild copper with gold my honey after this talk with aunt margret thora was more the mistress of herself than before because the dividing line between helga and herself seemed less she made up her mind that she would dress in the english manner so that oscar should not see so much difference she had moneythe dress money her father gave her it was not very much but in previous years she had given away most of it and this year she had intended to buy a scotch overcoat for hans the sailor who was losing all respect for himself and going about in cold weather with nothing over his shirt but now she would be selfish she would spend her money on herself and that was only right since it was spending it on oscar also it must be a secret a great secret it must come upon everybody as a surprise because that would be half the battle so she bought postal orders with her savings and sent to edinburgh for a costume such as she saw in the picture of a trade advertisement the costume came by a trading steamer and she was like a child in her secrecy and joy smuggling the big cardboard box upstairs to her room and answering the inquisitive questions of the factor and aunt margret with mysterious little nods and subterfuges the day was crisp and frosty and when oscar coming in the afternoon suggested a walk to the lake to try the ice for skating helga responded readily but thora said no she had something to do something importanta little surprise they should see when they came back again as soon as helga and oscar had gone and aunt margret had promised to make tea thora stole up to her room locked the door opened the box and took out the new garments that were to work the wondrous change they were beautiful they were dreams they were lovelier than anything of helgasa blue voile dress with a silk corsage and embroidered yoke the pleated skirt was like the suns rays over hecla after a shower of summer rain and the silk of the blouse was as beautiful as the ice of a glacier with the flowery bubbles of air in it thora laughed for joy and taking off her old iceland costume she threw it aside as a thing she had done withthe granny skirt the stiff treya and the starchy brjest she wondered how she could have worn them so long and even told herself what she would do with themshe would give them to a young widow who had lately lost her child by diphtheria and joined the people at the salvation shelter when she took up the new garments she had some doubt as to how they were to be put on and almost wished she had inquired of helga the accordion skirt was easy enough and its ample train made her feel tall and imposing but the blouse was a besetting trouble it fastened behind and after despairing efforts to catch the hooks and eyes she was tempted to call aunt margret but she thought no that would never do so she struggled on the room was cold but when she had finished dressing her face was flushed and heated she had put on her silver belt because it was a present from oscar and brushed her hair sideways over the forehead because that was how helga wore it then looking at herself in the glass she laughed again for she was proud and happy what would oscar say when he saw her he would say why this is helga another helga not quite so tall perhapsbut justyes really just as nicelooking and then helga would be angry and envious and perhaps go back to denmark she was walking to and fro on tiptoe glancing with sparkling eyes at her figure in the glass when she heard voices in the hall below thora cried somebody from the foot of the stairs it was oscar im coming she answered what about the great surprise presently she cried she waited until she heard a door close below and then still laughing a little but breathing rapidly feeling sure of victory yet with a fluttering at her heart she went down the stairs and sailed into the sittingroom oscar was leaning on the marble stove and helga sitting on a low seat was warming her feet at the fire they turned to thora as she entered and looked at her with wide eyes there was a moment of chilling silence and then thora breathing faster and faster said well what do you think of it helga began to laugh first in a smothered titter hut finally in an outright roar whereupon oscar who had struggled not to smile caught the contagion and joined her thoras pitiful face fell and she said with a crack in her voice but what are you laughing at oscar my dear dear child said oscar and helga who was still laughing said a little milliner it makes her look like a little milliner no no not that said oscar but its not thora thora is a sweet simple iceland maiden whose charm is her simplicity whereas this i see said thora and with her heart in her mouth she turned to go oscar stepped to the door to stop her but with the shrill cry of a hare that is wounded to death she flung out at him and passed through she went upstairs with a slow step took off her english costume put it back in the cardboard box and pushed it under the bedcrying a little and wiping her eyes she knew the truth at lastshe knew where she stood in oscars mind a simple iceland maidenthat was all he had ever seen in her it was she who had merely fascinated him and helga whom he loved when the door of the sittingroom closed on thora oscar looked at helga and said whatever has come over her dont you see said helga why nowhat is it how stupid these clever boys can he i could tell you in three words tell me thentell me thora is jealous you dont mean that helgas face flushed she looked up at oscar and a mysterious thrill went through him the great surprise had come indeed vi oscar slept badly that night for two months he had been moving in a garden of dreams where the odor of sweet flowers overpower the senses but he was awake at last and was being dragged to trial in a tribunal of his own creating in that court of conscience he was both righteous judge and guilty prisoner and through the long hours of broken sleep when he saw his life and motives as by flashes of lightning he asked and answered some terrible questions is thoras jealousy justified no yes that is to sayi may have neglected herthoughtlessly neglected her do you love helga it isnt necessary to think that i admire heri admire her beauty and her intellect but then you do not love her i love her societyi love to be with her she is bright and brilliant we have many interests in common then if you do not love helga why not cut her off rather than see thora suffer i cant i cant so you do love helga yes yes i do love her then what about thora i am sorry for thoravery sorry have you ceased to love her dont say that my feeling for thora is the same now as it has always been then you have never loved her i thought i didi sincerely thought i did so your feeling for thora was an illusion a most unfortunate illusion and i am troubled about heri shall always be troubled about her but you are betrothed to her god help me so i am what are you going to do now what am i going to do i amyes i am going to obey the commandment of nature accident and error and illusion have betrothed me to the wrong woman but must i hold to her after i have found out that i do not love her no she is sweet and loving and i have no fault to find with her but i must obey the law of my heart and who shall judge me if i do that but what about the law of the landyou have signed a contract to marry thora even so is marriage like any other worldly transaction are you bound to go on merely because you have begun can human hearts be dealt with like so much merchandise so you do not intend to marry thora i cannotit is impossiblenow that her sister has appeared before me i see too well i do not love her but she loves you that is the pity of it poor thora she thinks you are slipping away from her it is very pitifuli see how i have made her suffer what will happen if you leave her altogether her heart will breakher tender sweet child heart will break can you break thoras heart no no no better break my own then what are you going to do i must go on with the marriage i see now that i mustit is my dutythere is no help for it wait there is something you have not thought about if you go on with your contract and marry thora you must be prepared to live her life i know i know and i am not fit for it good or bad i am not fit for it but if you break your contract and do not marry thora you may live the life of helga yes yes and i am fitted for that life above everything else it thrills me it inspires me it lifts me up the one is the lower life while the other is the higher life i cannot bear to think of it you know that if you marry thora you condemn yourself for ever to the lower life and give up all hope and all thought of the higher one dont torture me dont torture me but the higher life will be a life consecrated to self whereas the lower life will be a life devoted to selfsacrificewhich is it to be that settles iti must go on with the contract whatever the consequences when oscar awoke in the morning from his restless sleep he thought he saw his way clearly there was only one solution of the hard problem of his iron destinyhe must sacrifice himself he was betrothed to thora and he must go on with the marriage he loved helga but he must tear her out of his heart he wished to be a musician and to live the higher life but he must be content with the lower life and do his duty a few irresistible pangs of regret a few tears which he could not quite keep back and then feeling a certain satisfaction with himself a certain pride in his selfsacrifice oscar went early to his work it was the autumn caravan time when the farmers come with the last of the years tallow and wool to have their accounts made up and settled the offices and warehouses were like a marketplace and there was work for everybody oscar threw himself into the days doings with astonishing energy and when the factor returned from breakfast he bantered him on his industry better late than never though said the factor and a good day in the autumn is worth two in the spring oscar spent the morning in the office helping at the accounts his part was to reconcile the farmers to their balances for many of them were dissatisfied and nearly all were in the factors debt some grumbled at the rate they received for their produce others at the price they paid for foreign goods oscars task was to persuade cajole and comfort them and finally to draft the notes of hand on the bankers with which they discharged their debts he felt mean and miserable toward noon helga sent a messenger to say that she hoped to rehearse some of the new music in the cathedral in the afternoon and to ask if oscar would go with her he answered that he could not business was pressing and he must stick to his work it cost him a pang to send back this answer but he had made his bed and he meant to lie on it he spent the afternoon in the warehouse where the produce brought by the farmers was weighed and stacked away for the winter the odor of the tallow and wool mingling with the smell of the mens clothes and the reek of their bodies made the atmosphere close and noisome and to freshen the air oscar ordered the big doors to be thrown open all at once through the clear crisp winter air outside came the sound of the organ being played in the cathedral and that was the last drop in his cup it was like a voice calling him out of the lower world he lived in to the higher one he yearned for it was like helga beckoning to him in his unblessed surroundings and through the roll of the music he could see her face for the first time oscar was feeling bitterly about thora as if he were a prisoner and she were his jailer when a man rode up to the warehouse door on a bright chestnut pony with a line of pack ponies behind him it was magnus and seeing him stand outside the counter which he had formerly stood within oscar felt some qualms of shame and called him into the scalesmans office the interview between the brothers was brief and commonplace but every simple word seemed to throb and scorch like a flame oscar asked how magnus was getting on at the farm and if he had good servants and magnus answered yes he had always been fond of farming and for servants he had only the old ones and everything was as before oscar asked if the governor had made satisfactory arrangements and magnus said he had that the farm was his own now on terms of tenancy and was to become his property at the old peoples death and how are you getting on here asked magnus i ohpretty well i think you like the work yeswellnot to say like perhaps i never expected to do that you know but im all right i think they had to pause for the din in the warehouse was louder than usualsome of the farmers were squabbling with the scalesmen and thora said magnus after a moment thora oh thora is all right too i think yes thora is all right said oscar mother tells me she looks pale pale does she i hadnt noticed it perhaps she does though the weather is getting cold there was a painful pause in their conversation and while they waited oscar could hear the organ in the cathedral breaking into the opening notes of his own anthem i hear that helga has come home said magnus oh yes helga has come home said oscar they say she is handsome handsome yes shes rather handsome in fact distinctly handsomeand musicaldecidedly musical indeed she has grown to be a very attractive girlvery there was another awkward silence in which the anthem pealed out over the jangling voices in the warehouse i suppose the wedding will be soon said magnus the wedding well to tell you the truth magnus nothing has been fixed yet not yet nothing definite i meanno precise date i dont know why but oscar looked at his brother and felt his tongue arrested magnus was calm his eyes were quiet and his voice was soft but there was something in his face which brought back a terrible memory it was the memory of the night of the betrothal the last time they talked together when magnus had said if you ever neglect or desert her or give her up for another woman ill take her backdo you hear meill take her back and then by god ill kill you oscar supped at the factors house that night he was unusually solemn and more than once during the meal aunt margret bantered him on his silence but at the end of it while lighting a cigarette he said godfather i hope youll consent to our having the wedding soon thora who had been looking pale and nervous colored up with a glad look while helga who had been flushed and excited grew white and rigid what do you call soon oscareaster asked the factor earlier much earlier say the middle of january at latest said oscar but what does thora say rising from her seat with brightening eyes and heaving bosom thora crossed over to oscar and kissed him so thats what thora says laughed the factor very well im willing the middle of january let it be then and fix the date between you helgas white face quivered so thats settled she cried and leaping up she went across to the piano and began to play with great vigor she played the wild ride of the valkyries becoming faster and louder at every bar oscar was in torture and he went home early what a mercy helga does not know he thought if she did i could not trust myself even yet and if she loves me as i love hergood god but thora was very happy going to bed that night she thought how wrong i have been about oscar how cruelly wickedly shamefully wrong vii next morning oscar thought the battle was over and his conscience had conquered but the devil was not done with him yet he had hardly settled to his work in the warehouse when a letter came from helga saying the ice is perfect on the lake this morning ant in spite of business and every other botheration you must carry out your promise to take me to skate therefore come at two oclock to the minute and you will find me waiting to go with you it was the first letter he had received from helga and it seemed to burn his fingers the scented notepaper and the free bold handwriting gave him a physical thrill which he had never felt before should he go his soul said certainly not why expose yourself to temptation especially now when you are as weak as water but his heart said you must to make any difference in your attitude toward helga would be to run the risk of betraying your secret and what about the futurecan you always run away like that his heart won and at the appointed time he was walking up to the factors helga was standing by the door at the top of the steps she was dressed in pale blue serge a short skirt exposing the long tanned boots a jersey revealing the flexible lines of her shapely figure and a white woolen cap like a chain helmet covering half her forehead and closing under her chin leaving her vivid face bare and beautiful as a young nuns in hood and bands oscar was beginning to doubt himself already and he asked where was thora im here said a cheerful voice from the hall and thora came to the door bright and happy but bareheaded and sewing a piece of moleskin cloth not ready said oscar im not going i cant skate said thora then well take a walk instead said oscar but thora would not hear of it helga had set her heart on skating and she had set her heart on something elsemaking a sleeve waistcoat for hans the sailor well if you really wish it said oscar really truly and ill have tea ready for you at five oclock well be back before that said oscar and then he and helga went swinging down the road helga in her short skirt walked with a spring like a young horse in sharp weather and oscar as he swung along by her aide sometimes touching her felt his blood tingling and every nerve tremblingly alive this frightened him a little and turning to look back he saw thora waving to them from the house and said god bless her the dear little soul and then helga glanced at him sideways and laughed the frost had filtered the air and it was crisp and quivering with currents of electricity which stimulated all their senses their voices crackled when they spoke and when helga laughed the sound was like that of dry sticks in a quick fire what are you laughing at helga i dont know she said and then they laughed together the ice of the lake was gloriousa broad mirror black as ink for there had been no snow yet the water had frozen as by first intention and through five fathoms they could see the stones and pebbles at the bottom what a pity thora didnt come said oscar isnt it said helga and again she glanced at him sideways and laughed they sat on the bank to put on their skates and while helga fumbled at her straps oscar thought i must not i will not but helga looked across at him with a smile that seemed to ask a question and at the next moment he was down on his knees in front of her with one of her skates and one of her long tanned boots in his quivering hands oscar thought helgas skating was wonderful it was divine it was devilish it intoxicated him he could not trust himself to look at it alone and seeing a number of skaters at the farther side of the lake where there was an island of lava rocks he said let us go over to the others hours passed the exercise and the air warmed his blood his tremors left him and he forgot about thora at length the sun began to set over the sea in a flood of glory and oscar said time to go home not yet said helga and they went round and round the island sometimes apart sometimes with clasped hands sometimes side by side with arms interlaced across their breasts the sun went down and both sea and land became gray and cold but still the tops of the mountains were golden tea will be waiting said oscar a little longer said helga and nothing loath oscar went round and round with her again the night came striding up from the plain behind and somebody lit a fire on the island too late for tea now said helga and once again oscar went round and round with her it seemed to him that helgas face flashed with electric flame as she swirled out of the darkness into the red glow from the fire and back again into the darkness one of the skaters started the elfsong others joined him and then it was a scene of complete enchantment the frost had laid its hand on the falls that fed the lake and they were quiet it had stroked the streams and they were still but if the voices of the waters were silent the voices of the skaters rippled and rang in the crisp night air dance by night and dance by day life and time will pass away love alone will last alway oscar was enraptured the humming of the skates the swaying of the ice the music of the singers the heat the glow the sinuous movement and above all the girl by his side so bright so beautiful so full of life and laughter carried away every sense and flesh and blood were afire then the moon rose a brilliant moon and it was reflected full and round and white in the black mirror of the ice with its streamers going off from it as if it had been a comet that had fallen to the earth and lay there at their feet look let us cut across it cried helga and away they shot in the darkness with the moons reflection receding as they followed it until they came to the limit of the lake and then the skaters and the fire and the singing were far behind them what a will o the wisp she is i could catch you quicker than i could catch her said oscar you couldnt i could do it then cried helga and off she went laughing at first but afterward silent yet breathing fast and at last panting audibly while she twisted and turned to escape from him until he came down on her at length with outstretched arms and a cry of done and then before he knew what he was doing he was clasping her to his breast and she was clinging to him lest she should fall and he was beating kiss after kiss upon her lips at the next moment consciousness came back to him like an ice wind blowing in a furnace his arms slackened away from helga and he said in a cold voice i beg your pardon helga it was wrong of me i am very sorry helga laughed a nervous broken laugh which seemed to say are you sure you are thinking of me i am betrothed to your sister and in less than two months i am to be married to her i had no right to give way to my feelings like that said oscar the nervous broken laugh came again and it said as plainly as words could speak do you know what you are saying oscar oscar trembled like a withered leaf he was like a man standing on the hot ground of the geysers where the crust was thin and cracking under his feet let us go home he said take off my skates then said helga she sat on the bank in the moonlight and while he knelt at her feet and fumbled with the straps his tongue went on with rambling sentences but every word was tearing as at a torn tendon when a man has engaged himself to a good woman he ought to be true to her it is his duty and whatever the consequences to himself he ought to do it if he has to suffer he must suffer helga and if he has to sacrifice himself a faint sound stopped him helga was crying her crying seemed to search his innermost thoughts and to say but have you any right to sacrifice me helga helga he cried but she took no notice she covered her face with her hands and her crying became deep and long and inconsolable he wished to comfort her but he dare not do so he remembered thora and magnus the factor and his father and his thoughts danced about his naked soul like demons helga helga he cried again but still helgas weeping continued if it had gone on a moment longer he must have taken her in his arms again and told her that he loved her that his love for her was above all laws all illusions all conventions it was the commandment of nature and he was compelled to obey it and they must fly from iceland and never return whatever the waste of ruined lives they had to leave behind them but helgas crying stopped suddenly and throwing back her head she said fiercely very well if you are satisfied so am i then she leapt to her feet wiped her eyes vigorously and laugheda short hard bitter laugh and after that oscar recovered control of himself let us be off she said going back by the road that skirts the lake side by side but neither touching the other and both silent oscar thought good heavens what an escape another moment and what might not have happened what a fool i was to expose myself to this temptation marriage is my only safeguard it must be soon thora and i must go away when we return helga may be back in denmark and then a scene like this will never occur again when they reached the house at last he felt like an adulterer coming home after his first offense but thora looked happy and unsuspicious i knew you couldnt tear yourselves away from your skating so i put the tea away and now supper is nearly ready she said after supper oscar said godfather i wish you would permit me to alter the arrangement of last evening you want to go back to easter eh said the factor no sir to come on to christmas said oscar and then he gave his reasons thora was looking paleeverybody thought soshe wanted a changehe would like to take her to england perhaps to france and even to italy they might stay away during the months of spring and come back for the first of summer when althing would open its session and by that time thora would be well and he himself would be ready to set to work in earnest but christmas my gracious cried aunt margret hardly time for the banns and what about thoras weddingdress but thora herself was in raptures and aunt margrets objections were borne down christmas let it be then said the factor whereupon thora gave a cry of joy and helga whose eyes had passed with a quick glance from face to face while her own grew paler and paler leapt up saying and now let us have a dance to celebrate the happy event no no no said oscar yes yes said helga and sitting down to the piano she played a dance tune with a rapid and passionate touch make him dance thora she cried with an awful brightness in her eyes thora took hold of oscar and dragged him to his feet saying laughingly why not oscar tables and chairs were pulled aside the factor went off to smoke and oscar and thora danced while helga played laughing loudly and calling to them again and again helga helga not so fast youll kill us cried thora but helga only laughed the louder and played the faster with a fierceness that seemed to consume her like a fire oscar went home that night with an aching heart but thora went to bed happy how wrong i was about dear helga also she thought and then drawing a deep breath she fell asleep viii to think yourself happy is to be happy and thora thought herself the happiest little woman in the world the weeks before her wedding were the brightest period of her hearts existence she counted the days backward from the day she was living in to the day of all days that was to come and every morning the moment she awoke she said to herself only nineteen now and then eighteen seventeen and sixteen until it became three two and one our thora is like a white mouse in a revolving cageshe cant make the world go round quickly enough said aunt margret hers was not the happiness that makes the heart afraid and she had not a moments misgiving about oscar now she never once saw him alone for more than two minutes together but that did not trouble her at all he came and went every day always in a hurry and always breathless and she gave him the benevolence of a smile and occasionally the charity of a kiss when it could be done decently behind the diningroom door but usually he had to be content to see her seated among her dressmakers and sewingmaids and that suited him better than she knew there was nothing to tarnish the white simplicity of her happiness and when oscar could come with maps and tour lists to arrange about their journey she would say why dont you talk it over with helga she knows more about traveling and then oscar would stammer a little and say well if you are willing to be guided by helgas judgment and helga herself will certainly i am so be off to my bedroom and settle everything whereupon oscar would cry no no were right enough here and then helga and hethe one trembling lest a word should betray him the other going through the bitterness of looking at happiness through anothers eyeswould discuss routes and railway journeys to the click of scissors and the buzz of the sewing machine well go up by the mont cenis eh no by the st gothard well come back by san remo and nice and monte carlo yes of coursemonte carlo my gracious it might be helga who was going on her honeymoon aunt margret would say mightnt it thora would answer and then she would laugh like a child in the holy land of her innocent heart she had only one thought about her sisterthat she had done her the wrong of suspecting her helga might know nothing about that but she knew and she could never be quite satisfied until she had made amends time and again she thought of a way to do this and at length an artful scheme occurred to her it was a daring design and asking herself when she could bring it to pass she concluded that it must be on her weddingday because she would be the queen of her own little kingdom then and nobody could deny her anything meantime it was to be her secret and helga was to hear nothing about lit and even oscar himself was not to know there was only one other streak of alloy in thoras happiness and that was her memory of magnus the brave heart did not break and magnuss despair might be dumb but the thought of his suffering was the tang of iron in the sweet wine of thoras life to complete her happiness everybody had to share it so when oscar came one day she took him into the hall and said oscar who is to be best man and oscar stammered well really to tell you the truth i hadntthat is to say why not magnus said thora magnus i thought of that but and then came the old difficultyhe had not yet set magnus right on the subject of the betrothal and until that could be done the old people would object to him but why shouldnt you do it now oscar such a splendid moment to heal every sore and let bygones be bygones yes certainly thats so said oscar but he went off with a troubled face and thora heard no more from him on the subject until the day before the wedding when he said oh by the way about the best man that splendid scheme of yours was impossible thora impossible mother tells me magnus has gone to the northlandswent away about a week ago it seems in the winter and on the eve of the wedding she thinks hell be back for that but of course we cant take risks so neilsyou remember neils finsen the sheriffs sonneils came back in the last steamer and hell be best man so thats settled what a pity said thora and then oscar who had opened the door cried helloa snowing were going to have a white wedding thora and with a nervous laugh he buttoned up his coat collar and went off without kissing her she remembered this again when she was going to bed and sitting on the great chair before the cheerful stove with the curtains drawn and all so sweet and cozy she reflected that it was the last time she was to sleep in her fathers house the three weeks were almost gone at last and so was her girlhood and now that both were nearly over they seemed to have vanished like a dream she was happy still but it would have taken very little to turn her happiness into pain it was a pity oscar had forgotten to kiss her and it was a pity magnus would not be present at the wedding toward the mirk of night she went to bed and then the snow was still falling she thought of magnus traveling over the desert and wondered why he had gone away just then perhaps it was because he could not bear to look upon their happinesshers and oscars poor magnus but the memory of magnus was whirled away in a cloud of other thoughtsthe wedding the wedding presents the weddingfeast and oscar always oscarand then the tired eyelids of her mind closed in peace and goodwill with all the world and she slept the last sleep of her maidenhood ix thora thora well i declare the girl is still sleeping on her weddingday too thora thora thora awoke with a start at the calling and knocking at her door leaping out of bed she ran to the window and parted the curtains it was broad morning the sun was shining brightly over the snow and all the world was white she opened the door the sewingmaids and dressmakers trooped into the room and from that moment onward for several hours the universe was a chaos without form and void in which all talked at once and everybody ran up against everybody else and thora ate her breakfast while walking about or being fitted on but the dress and the dressing were finished at length and aunt margret was called up to look nobody in iceland had ever seen such a bridal costumethe silk kirtle the silvergilt crown the faldur the veil and the blue plush cloak isnt she beautiful margret said the maids whereupon aunt margret whose eyes were glistening behind her spectacles said talk about helgatut then the cathedral bells began to ring and a hush fell on everybody thora went slowly downstairs and found her father looking taller than ever in a new silk hat waiting for her in the hall and silvertop standing ready in the street with a sidesaddle of red plush and gilt there were a few jests a few laughs a few furtive tears and then they started off the snow underfoot was as dry and soft as flour and it was with difficulty that the pony could be made to walk sedately from the moment they reached the cathedral it was all like a dream to thora a beautiful daydream such as she had dreamt sometimes when she thought she was dead and her happy soul was entering heaven the bridesmaids were waiting in the porchhelga looking wondrously beautiful in an english dress and two former schoolfellows in iceland costume thora who was moving as in a vision felt somebody taking off her plush cloak and then the bells stopped and the organ began at the next moment the choir was singing a hymnthe usual hymn when god the father led the first of bridesand then she was going up the aisle leaning on her fathers arm she had never seen so many faces since the day she was confirmed they seemed to move past her and they made her almost dizzy she remembered how at other weddings the congregation had watched for the bride and looked at her as if she had been a supernatural thing shes coming here she comes she herself was the bride now and the people were craning their necks to see her thora could feel their smiling faces and she knew that her own face was smiling she could hear what the people were saying as she passed them dear thora how lovely she looks im satisfied now and i dont care if i goi only wanted to see how thora looked in the kirtle and meanwhile the voices of the choir were coming down from the gallery as from the sky and floating round and round her at the top of the nave oscar was waitingso perfectly dressed so handsome so noblelookingwith a fair young man on his right hand and on his left the governor very solemn and stately with his irongrey hair and beard the hymn came to an end the organ died down and thora found herself standing by oscars side at the foot of the chancel steps with the old bishop in his pleated black gown and white ruff at the top of them there was a rustle behind her then there was silence and the bishop began to speak my children he said when long ago god the father led the first of brides to the first of men in the beautiful garden of eden he linked their hands together in love and that was the first marriage since then he has carried on the human story by the same sweet means and love is still the bond that binds man to woman and woman to man my children said the bishop againhe was speaking to her and oscaryou come here to be made man and wife and because you love one another god is willing to join your hands in holy wedlock for he blesses and sanctifies no other union whether of wealth or worldly advantage or any other interest whatsoever we know you both my children we who are gathered here have watched the flower of your affection bud and bloom and now we pray to god that you may be true to the vows you are to make today always bearing each others burdens forgiving each others faults and cherishing the human love that is a symbol of the love divine my daughter love him who is to be your husband let him find on your breast his solace for every sorrow whatever the world may do to him and whatever the world may say my son love her who is to be your wife there is nothing nobler in this imperfect existence no sight more sweet and heavenly than when a good girl leaves the father who loves her and the home where she has been happy and says to him who is to be her husband the past was beautiful but i trust the future all to you be worthy of that trust my son be strong be brave be faithful and he who knows our weaknesses having trodden the earth before us will bear you up if your feet should falter be companions to each other in the journey of this world my dear ones and if it should please god to give you children let them be bonds to bind you closer together above all love one another for that is the first commandment and may he who gave it guard and guide you through all the thorny paths of life the bishops voice became tremulous toward the end and when he finished there was some coughing and blowing of noses among the congregation oscar too was breathing heavily by thoras side and helga was trampling on her train but thora herself was as calm as a trustful child at the next moment she was kneeling by oscars side on the communion stepsjust where they had knelt as children to be confirmedand the bishop was administering the vows there was a breathless hush in the crowded cathedral during this solemn and beautiful ceremonya ceremony for ever new for ever old for ever awfulthe consecration of the man to the woman the woman to the man for better or for worse in sickness and in health till death us do part oscar was still breathing heavily but thora felt too happy to be agitated too sure to be afraid when the bishop put their hands together and laid his own hand on the top of them she felt oscars hand tremble and his pulse throb and she wanted to calm and comfort him but it was all over in a moment for they had risen to their feet and one of the assistant clergy was giving out a hymn guide thy children father guide them through the thorny paths of life the choir began it but the congregation joined in and all the voices seemed to quiver with emotion thora felt herself carried away far away but still she was holding oscars hand she thought she could hear magnuss voice among the voices behind herthe deep voice she used to hear on those evenings so long ago poor magnus but then he could have had no joy of her so it was better even for him it was something of a descent when the hymn ended and the bishop shook hands with her and the governor followed his example and the bridesmaids came up and kissed her in the presence of the whole congregation but oscar gave her his arm and as they moved down the nave the organ and choir began again o perfect love all human thought transcending lowly we kneel in prayer before thy throne she was now sure she could hear magnus and looking up at the organ loft she saw him yes he was there he was in the choir he had come back from the northlands to sing at her wedding that theirs may be the joy that knows no ending whom thou for evermore dost join in one she had only one glance at his face but she saw it plainly she had never seen it like that beforeso broken up and so soft yet so strong and brave his eyes were steadfastly fixed on his music book and he was swaying a little and singing as with all his might grant them the joy which brightens earthly sorrow grant them the peace which calms all earthly strife but magnus was whirled away from her in a moment for the people whispered as she was going past dear thora god bless our thora oscar was bowing on both sides of the aisle and the people were talking to him also how handsome he looks he looks as if he could take care of her too take care of her oscar they were back in the porch at length and somebody was putting her plush cloak over her shoulders silvertop was standing outside and hans the sailor in his new sleeve waistcoat was giving him water out of his pail oscar lifted her to the saddle and they turned their faces homeward the bells began to ring againa merry pealand then at last thoras tears began to flow how good everybody had been to her it was all for oscars sake how sweet to think they were good to her for the sake of oscar thank god for oscar x anna and aunt margret were at the door of the factors house to receive them they kissed thora and called her mrs stephenson and then took her upstairs to change when she came down again the friends invited to the wedding feast were coming in quickly taking off their snowshoes shaking hands with oscar and talking all at once the table was laid in the double sittingroom which had been the scene of the betrothal the factor sat at the head with oscar on his right just in the place where he had trodden on helgas photograph and thora on his left where magnus had sat on the low seat beside his mother while the governor faced the factor with anna and aunt margret at either side of him and the bishop the sheriff and the doctor between helga sat midway down the table with neils finsen on one side of her and the rector on the other thora was bashful but bright reddening a little with maidenly reserve when pointed remarks were made to her but filling the room with musical laughter during the meal nearly everybody raised his glass to her and at the end of it the governor rose bowed to her down the table with a stately grace and began to speak i rise said the governor to propose the health of the bride and bridegroom we are all happy in the marriage which has just been celebrated and no one can be more happy than myself it had been for many years the dearest hope of my heart that the lifelong friendship between factor neilsen and myself might be cemented in our children by a still closer bond your health old friend interrupted the factor raising his glass and the governor stopped to drink with him time was perhaps he continued when i feared lest this hope might be frustrated no no said the factor while thora dropped her head anna sighed audibly and there was silence for a moment as if the spirit of some one who was not present had passed through the room but sweet is the bliss that follows bale said the governor and thank god we are now of one mind and one family when the glasses of the company had ceased to jingle the governor went on to speak of thora she has always been like a daughter in our house and now she is our daughter indeed we have loved her all her life and today we have given her the best we had to give to any oneour son our favorite son the idol of our hopes and the pride of our hearts god bless both of them as soon as the factor had done wiping his eyes with his print handkerchief he rose with a laugh and said stem before stern when the sea gets up and im not much used to pulling backward but im with the governor in thanking god that the storm that threatened has blown over and we are sailing in smooth water as for oscar he has been my godson ever since he was anything and today he has become my son and i could not wish for a better and now said the factor as soon as he was allowed to go on a small promise kept is better than a big one forgotten and im going to keep a little promise which i made on the day of the betrothal perhaps some of you wouldnt think it but i believe in young people enjoying their youth while theyve got any i managed to miss mine somehow and its been work work work with me all my days the same with the governor its been work work work with him too and we havent had a holiday between us but we are going to have a holiday nowwere going to travel to the sunny south lands where the ground and the sea arent white like this and that the factor waved his hands toward the windows front and back yes were going to see the world in our old age the governor and i but its got to be with eyes that are better than ours are nowthe eyes of our children whats more continued the factor when the company were again quiet were not going to grudge the expense either and if oscar will look under his bottom plate hell find a little oil that will grease the wheels on the way oscar lifted his fruit plate and took up two checks and when the toast had been honored he rose to reply nobody had ever before seen him so pale so nervous or so serious i thank the governor and the factor he said for the splendid present they have given usso much more than we can possibly require on our journey i thank you all for coming to our weddingit is so pleasant to be surrounded by the people who have known us all our lives find your wife among your friends says one of our sagas i have found mine almost in my family and i trust the two branches now made one may never be divided as the result of what we have done this morning there was some applause and when oscar began again his voice faltered and broke i thank the bishop too he said for the wordsthe wise and touching wordshe spoke in marrying us i know that lovelove is the only foundation of a true marriage and ii trust my marriage is a true one i do not love my wife as much as i oughtas much as she deserves i can never do that it is impossible but i hope to love her more and more as time goes on and to fly from every temptation to love her less i know i am not worthy of the dear good girl who has given herself to me today but i will try so to live that she may never regret it often forgive the womans faults says another of our sagas but a truer word in this case would be forgive the mans and i pray god my wife may never have too much to forgive when oscar sat down the men thought his speech had been a little affected and farfetched but there was not a woman in the room who did not want to leap up and kiss him thora was openly wiping her eyes but her face was one high noon of enjoyment and in the buzz which followed the silence aunt margret called across to her mrs stephenson you had better take care of your husband or some of these young women will run away with him there were other toasts the governor the factor and finally the bridesmaids proposed by the rector in a playful speech they say a kiss isnt the same thing from all women he said and being an old bachelor i know nothing about that but the young fellow on my left the rector indicated neils finsen who has a right to consider himself the best man in iceland today has confessed to me in a whisper that he finds one of the bridesmaids so charming and beautiful that if he had been in oscars place and compelled by a narrowminded law to choose between the factors two daughters he would have cut off to some eastern country where he could have married both everybody laughed and looked at helga who had herself been laughing rather hysterically and looking at oscar all through dinner and then thora who was overflowing with happiness glanced down at her sister and remembered the great scheme she had conceived to make amends for mistrusting and suspecting her now was the moment to carry it into effectnow that she was queen in her little kingdomand half bold half shy she rose from her seat put her arms about her fathers neck and whispered something in his ear the factors face straightened for a moment then broadened again and he said but what does oscar say oscar will be sure to agree said thora and she whispered in her fathers ear again well im not going back on my word im willing but you must ask oscar then laughing and reddening thora crept up behind oscar and whispered in his ear also while looking sideways down at helga as oscar listened his face became serious and he said but you are quite sure that you wish it thora yes yes yes said thora laughing and blushing for now the eyes of the whole company were on her let us talk of it tomorrow said oscar no no now said thora but perhaps helga herself began oscar and then he stopped whereupon helga hearing her own name said with a nervous laugh what is that about helga yes what is it said several voices at once and then the factor explained thora wants to have her sister to accompany them on their tour and she is trying to persuade oscar there were some unconvincing cries of why not and splendid and then there was silence broken only by thoras voice saying please oscar please it was the last thing oscar could have expectedto have temptation thrown in his way at the moment when he was trying to escape from it to have the floodgate of passion opened afresh after he had struggled so hard to dam itand to have this done by thora herself in her blind unselfishness and innocent joy as if the powers of hell were making game of her but the company were waiting for oscars answer and not to betray himself he tried to escape by banter im not like neilsi dont want both of you he said but still the pleading coaxing voice was at his ear saying please oscar please please and when oscar continued to hesitate the rector said tut tut oscar refusing your wifes first request is a bad beginning im not refusing said oscar and if helga herself really and truly thinks she would like to go with us would you like to go helga asked the factor and then there was another moments hesitation in which helga biting her lower lip with a fierceness which betrayed the struggle in her soul looked across at oscar as if trying to read in his face what her answer was to be tell her to say yes oscar said thora yes said helga and at the next moment thora was clapping her hands in triumphant delight and making the room ring with her laughter neils finsen had sat down to the piano and the servants were clearing the table to make way for dancing when anna came up behind thora and whispered somebody outside wishes to see you thora is it perhaps yes dear said anna and thora followed her out of the room xi magnus was waiting in the hall dressed in snow stockings and a long cape overcoat rough and worn and belted about the waist his face was stamped with the deep lines which in a strong man stand for resignation and in a weak one for despair thora thought she had never seen him look so big and brawny but his voice when he spoke to her was as soft as a womans and he broke into the sunniest of smiles she closed the door of the sittingroom to shut out the sound of the piano and then came forward and held out her hand feeling little and weak in her kirtle and the bridal crown across her forehead i came to say goodby and to wish you a good voyage he said im so glad youve come said thora i heard you had gone away and i was afraid i was going to miss you ive brought you this for a wedding present said magnus taking up from the hall table a large white bears skin which thora had not noticed before what a magnificent rug said thora is it a good one said magnus it is perfectly beautiful i have never seen anything like it it must have cost you a fortune no not a great deal i bought it in the northlands then it was to get this that you went there yes in the winter toosuch a long cold journey i am strong thorai never feel the cold his sad eyes were glistening and thoras throat was thick i shall use it on the ship and in the train and everywhere she said and whenever i use it i will always think of you will you indeed i will but we are going south you know i know to england and franceperhaps to italy it will do you good thora the sun will do you good and you will see the fruit and the flowers growingit will be beautiful will it not the piano was becoming louder and there was a sound of shuffling feetthe people in the sittingroom were beginning to dance and what do you thinkhelga is going with us said thora helga didnt anna tell you is helga to go with you to italy oh yes and we are delighted to have her shes so clever and brightoscar can never be dull for a moment while helga is with us the grave face looked sideways for a moment and then he said in a still gentler voice i hope youll be happy on your journey thora im sure i shall we shall all be happy we sail by the laura tomorrow morning so mother told meive been taking your baggage aboard and seeing to your cabin and you have been doing that while we i wanted to do something for you thora but magnus you ought to have been here by rights oscar always wished it in fact he wanted you to be his best man oscar did indeed he did but you couldnt be found because you had gone on your journey over the sound of the music and the dancing the governors voice came from within mingled with the factors hearty laughter perhaps it was just as well i was away said magnus the old people have never forgiven me for what i did and if they ever came to suspect that somebody else was responsible he stopped and then thora dropped her eyes and said i was so glad you were in the cathedral it was beautiful said magnus you have no feeling against oscar now not now when i saw you kneeling together at the communion rails i thought of the day when we all knelt there and thenthen oscar was my little brother once again magnuswont youwont you kiss me he hesitated for a moment but she held her sweet face up to himpure as a saints and wet with tearsand he opened his great arms and gathered the little white figure to his breast and kissed her on the forehead under the bridal crown goodby little girl and god bless you and make you very happy but if you ever want me say come and ill come to youif its to the farthest corner of the earth thora began to cry audibly and magnus bustled about and made for the door he must be off he had a long journey before him and then silvertop is outsidei must not keep him waiting silvertop mother told me to take care of him until you returnso im taking him back to the farm let me say goodby to him said thora magnus covered her from head to foot in the bears skin and led her down the steps to the street it was dark but the stars were out and the northern lights were cleaving the sky as with the sweep of a mighty saber all was white and silent save for the deadened beat of the piano and the thud of the feet of the dancers two horses saddled and bridled stood quietly in the snow with their reins hanging over their heads and magnus mounting one of them said this is golden manesilvertops big brother thora found her own pony stroked its ears and kissed its nose and then fled back to the door out of the frosty air good brothers go well together well be home by midnight cried magnus thora watched them go a glittering shaft of the aurora lit up the three as they turned the corner of the roadmagnus riding golden mane and silvertop with an empty saddle running briskly beside him xii when thora returned to the sittingroom oscar and helga both with sparkling eyes and flushed faces were waltzing vigorously then thora herself danced with the governor the factor the hector and of course with oscar but the room grew hot and stuffy too full of excitement and after a while thora became pale and faint seeing this after aunt margret had called attention to it oscar began to say it was time to break up the young men bantered him want to get rid of us eh and helga who grew more and more hysterical protested that the evening was still young but oscar sent his bride upstairs to prepare for the journey to her husbands house let us all take her home then said one of the bridesmaids and when thora reappeared muffled up for her night walk with only eyes nose and mouth visible she was surrounded by a group of merry girls similarly bandaged and chirping over her like linnets in spring at last the final moment came when thora had to leave her fathers house for good and then aunt margret whose face had become grotesquely long and watery broke down altogether its no use she said im losing her and i dont know what theyll do with my precious now nonsense margret said the factor oscar will take care of her hed better or ill murder him said aunt margret and the idea of aunt margret murdering anybody was so amusing to the company that they broke up merrily the factors family went to the door to see them off and helga who was hot with dancing and excitement but wore no wraps stood on the top of the steps holding a lamp above her head to light them down the road it was a paraffin lamp with a glass reservoir but she paid no heed to any warning take care helga do take care said oscar but she only cried good night pleasant dreams and continued to wave the flickering lamp above her head helga for mercys sake helga shouted oscar and thora said yes dear dont let us have an accident on our weddingday the better the day the better the deed cried helga and she sent a ringing hysterical laugh after them as they disappeared in the darkness the wedding party went off in two batches oscar in the midst of the young men whose arms were round his shoulders and thora in the midst of the young women who were holding her by the waist and stopping at intervals to whisper mischievous messages in her ears the crisp snow crackled under their feet and the starry sky with its northern lights pulsed and throbbed like the hearts in their bosoms when they came to the gate of government house somebody suggested that oscar as a zealous sagaman ought to carry out the ancient custom of lifting his bride across the threshold and then to thoras delight amid a squealing chorus of laughter oscar picked her up in his arms and carried her into the house where anna who had gone on ahead smuggled her upstairs while the others went into the drawingroom to drink the last toast before parting a bright fire was burning in the bridal chamber the curtains were drawn the bed was laid open and the room looked like a white nest of eiderdown when thora with a fluttering heart stepped into it what a day it has been she said hasnt it said anna closing the door behind them well i can always say i had a wonderful weddingday cant i indeed you can a woman has only two days in her life that are her ownher very ownand her weddingday is one of them and what is the other day anna the other oh the other day is too far away for you to think about it yet but all the days between belong to somebody elseher children or her husband but how sweet how beautiful to live in your husband to give up everything to him your life yourself everything theres happiness in that isnt there anna indeed there is my dear and pain too perhaps but theres something better in this life than happiness thora and thats blessedness you know this made thora think of magnus but she heard oscar laughing in the room below and soon forgot everything else in a delicious shuddering which suddenly came over her anna helped her to undress and when the crown and the kirtle were laid aside she moved about for some moments without speaking then she said softly will you go to bed now dearest or shall i give you your dressinggown give me my dressinggown said thora faintly anna moved about on tiptoe a moment or two longer turning the lamp down and fixing the shade then she opened the door and stood for an instant on the threshold looking back at thora where she sat combing out her hair before the stove all at once her middleaged homely face became young and beautiful by the magic of a memory of her own and going softly back she kissed thora without saying a word and then crept silently out of the room left alone thora looked timidly around her and seeing things of oscars lying among her own she felt a new and still more delicious sense of happiness during the days preceding the wedding she had thought that as soon as the service in the cathedral had come to an end and she was oscars wife a mysterious change would come over her but that had not been so and all day long she had felt quite the same but now it was different and in this room she had become another beingnot herself only but oscar also it was very sweet and beautiful but it was a little frightening too and to ease her fastbeating heart she got into bed and covered up her face she could hear the company breaking up below and a little later she heard their footsteps crunching the snow under her window which fronted the road they stood there and sang a bridal song it was the song of the two roses the winter was cold and the ground was white but two roses of love still grew in the garden of god the frost could not freeze the two roses of love for they were warmed by the air of heaven the sun could not scorch the two roses of love for they were watered from the well of life two roses of love on a single stem two roses of love in two fond young hearts two roses of love and joy when the song came to an end there was some merry giggling under the window followed by shouts of good night thora happy dreams then as the company went off they started the bridal song again and in her minds eye thora could see them going back to the town arm in arm young girls and young men thora listened to the voices dying down the street and for a moment all life seemed to be set to the music of love oscar and she would be children always never growing older but rambling hand in hand through a flowery world where everybody loved them and they loved everybody and there could be no real trouble because love was all in all but just then the cathedral clock struck eleven and she remembered magnus she could see him crossing the desolate white heath under the shooting stream of the northern lightsa lonesome man riding one horse while another with an empty saddle was running by his side poor magnus but there was no help for it the voices died away in the distance and there was a moment of silence in the cozy nesta warm muffled secret kind of silence broken by nothing but the underthrob of the ceaseless sea thora closed her eyes and held her breath how happy she was she was trembling like a bird caught and held in the hand but even her fear was full of happiness at the next moment there was a noiseless footstep on the floor a sense of somebody in the room and thenoscar was leaning over her and kissing her on the lips part iii yet ah that spring should vanish with the rose that youths sweetscented manuscript should close the nightingale that in the branches sang ah whence and whither flown again who knows i the wedding being over and the wedding party gone anna went on a visit to magnus in order to bear him company during the first weeks of his first winter and to see that his house was in order the farm was thirtyodd miles from the capital not far from the scene of the sheepgathering and in the middle of the great plain of thingvelliran historic spot formerly the place of the icelandic parliament for the neglected mount of laws may still be seen there there were only two houses on the plainthe farmhouse and the parsonage with its little church beside it the farmhouse was the larger of the two and being on the line of road from the capital to the chief market of the northland it had become a resting place for travelers the innfarm had belonged to annas family for many generations and her father had been the last to hold it he was a worthy man silent and serious much like magnus in personal character but he left the place badly embarrassed having fallen into the hands of a defaulting factor after his daughter married he lost his wife and then he died suddenlypeople said of drink since then the estate had been twenty years in the hands of a steward but the governor had paid off the mortgage out of the savings of his salary and the farm was free it was an endless delight to anna to bring the place back to its former condition she began with the sleeping accommodation for sin comes with a laugh she said but goes with a cry the shepherd and his wife she put in the upper bedroom the badstofa the maids in the lower one and the farmboys in the loft each of the rooms was under its own roof and the homestead as a whole was less like a single house than a group of houses or like a gipsy encampment with its peaked tents going off in different directions the principal apartment was a large square hall with two guestrooms opening out of it magnus was to sleep in one of these guest rooms except when both were wanted for travelers and then he was to lie on a mattress stretched on the floor anna inspected the kitchen the elt house and the storehouse the skemmaexamined the winters stock of potted meat and dried and salted cod and whale and put a lock on the bur for seldom does the servantmaid starve in the larder she said finally she turned her attention to the hall which was the general living room and furnished it afresh with a settle an armchair a bornholme clock and a big german stove as a finishing stroke she hung two large photographs on the walls one of the governor the other of herself the governor was gorgeous in his goldbraided uniform but she was homely in her black hufa and on second thoughts she would have taken her own picture down but magnus said something nice about it and she allowed it to remain annas visit was a long one but as often as she prepared to go saying home was the best place for the stupid magnus answered that in that case gudrun must unpack her trunk for the governor could not be expecting her in this way she stayed at thingvellir until the snow began to be honeycombed by the thaw and the ribs of the landscape to be revealed again meantime her life at the farm was simple and primitive and every day had its own duty before it was light in the morning she rang the bell in the hall which awakened the household and sent the maids to the shippons and the boys to the beasts in their pens and when the short day had closed in she rang the bell again for supper and finally for prayers when the housefather magnus now gave out a hymn and read a lesson on sunday she went to church and met the fiftyodd people who had ridden over from the farms that bordered the plain she sat in the seat in front of the communion rail with its picture of christ in white robes among warm eastern foliage magnus sat in the choir and put up the figures on the plate that gave the numbers of the hymns he had little voice and no music but anna listened and was happy though the nights were long the household was never idle while the servants had to mend and make blankets in their own quarters magnus would weave on a loom he set up in the hall and his mother would spin or knit stockings he was full of great projects again and though his former schemes were impossible to him now he had others of equal consequence what iceland wanted was roads roads were the landmarks of civilization without roads the most productive country in the world could not prosper for what was the use of a cow that gave much milk if it kicked over the pail night after night in the pauses of the loom anna had to listen to this story and to assent to the schemes that were tied on to it yes magnus was going to be very comfortable and she could go home in content after all perhaps everything was for the best she said and if there were only a mistress in the house but magnus rattled at the loom and nothing more was heard for some moments john and gudrun are very well in their way but its thin blood that isnt thicker than water and when i go back the loom rattled still louder but a young man who couldnt be satisfied with a girl like thora isnt likely to find many to his liking and then the loom rattled louder than ever and nothing more was said that night ii at intervals during annas visit to the farm there came news of the wedding partythe letters being sent on by the weekly post from government house and from the factors the first to come was from england and it was a joint letter to everybody written by all three of the wanderers oscar began it with a playful review of their journey from the time of the departure of the laura as soon as we set foot on the ship we were told that captain zimsen had given up his own cabin to us and from that hour to this everybody has shown us boundless hospitality especially fathers old college friends the professor at oxford and the banker here in london naturally we know we owe everything to the magic of the governors name and consequently i am cultivating an extraordinary reverence for it though i doubt if i shall ever find it more beautiful than i did on the morning of our wedding at the bottom of that splendid check ha ha the mouse knows where to come back for his cheese said anna helga came next with a glowing account of the london theaters operahouses and picturegalleries the half had not been told me as the big book says and i wonder more than ever why a poor girl should be doomed to waste her life in a wilderness when she might live in a world of so many clever and beautiful people mm its poor work pouring water on a rock said anna thora came last with a rather sad little note it was all very wonderful no doubt but she was feeling just a wee bit homesick did not care so very much for operas and picturegalleries so oscar had to take helga by herself i like best to sit in the window of the hotel and look at the crowds in the square such multitudes always going and coming and hardly anybody ever speaking to anybody else thats what strikes you at first as most extraordinary it is so strange to think that the people in the streets do not even know each other by sight and that every young woman who goes by has her own family somewhereher own husband and perhaps her own childrenand that she is hurrying away to them i dont know why but it makes me feel so lonely and then i almost want to be back in my dear sweet homely old iceland magnus had to read this letter aloudfor anna was no reader of handwritingand when he came to thoras part his voice thickened and broke the next letter came from paris and helga wrote the whole of it such sights such luxury such gaiety and such dreams of dresses and then the operachopin verdi wagner greig we are at the opera every nightthat is to say oscar and i are thora not caring very much for music thoras chief pleasure is to walk in the flower market by the madeleine and watch the children playing and look as if she wished she were one of them just like our thora said anna neils is hereneils finsen you know neils has finished his course at the musical college and is connected in some way with covent garden and has come to paris on managerial business he seems to be getting along wonderfully and it makes me feel almost envious oh to get on in life to escape forever from that grey sky and all those freezing surroundings what i would give to do it nothing should stand between me and success in life if i only saw the chance of it and who knowsperhaps i may some day neils declares that my voice has improved wonderfully and i am practising constantly but to have any real opportunity in music one ought to be here or in london or dresden and it is so expensive im nearly penniless as it is and i am so shockingly dowdy that if some one does not send me the letter was to the factor and he had cut away the end of it mm mm said anna what the miss is used to the misses keeps up and then they ate their supper of smoked mutton and black bread in silence and rang the bell for prayers the third letter from the wedding party came from italy and it was written by oscar only the post that brought it had been delayed by a snowstorm and had sheltered two nights on the moss fell heath at the innfarm the cattlepens had been completely buried and magnus and the men had worked up to their waists from daylight to dark digging a way out of the snow that the beasts might be fed and watered the world will be white with you in iceland but here in italy the roses are in bud and the sky is blue and the air is balmy what a time we have had of it we came down from venice the city of silence and dream through florence the city of sunshine and rome the mother of cities to naples the city of song italy seems to set all europe to music lovely and beloved italy if only some one could do the same for iceland rugged gaunt grand old iceland but waitonly waitperhaps somebody will do it yet ah oscar oscar said anna its easier to count twelve mountains than to climb one helga is enjoying the trip tremendously out every minute of the day and making friends on every side thora does not seem so well poor child and she hardly cares to go about we are going on to the riviera next week and thence back to iceland i must of course be home for the opening of althing but helga is grudging every day it is now two oclock in the morning and we have just returned from a veglionithat is to say a masque ballthis yesterday being the last of lent flowers streamers confetti and such dresses helga looked magnificent in a pale blue chiffon of the latest model and was out of all comparison the belle of the evening poor thora did not care to go so she stayed in the hotel and went to bed early magnus and his mother also went to bed early on the night they read that letter anna rung the bell that hung from the ceiling of the hall and the servants in their skin slippers and woolen stockings trooped in for prayers the lesson was the story of the widows cruise and the hymn was meek and low meek and low i shall soon my jesus know the last letter they received from the wanderers came on the first day of spring when the thaw had set in and the water was running down the discolored snow on the mountains like tears on a wrinkled face and the sheep were beginning to lamb it was from monte carlo and was written by thora to anna herself this place is so beautiful anna yet i do not think i like it very much the houses are all splendid palaces but they dont seem so comfortable as the little homes in iceland i dare not say this to oscar lest he should think me ungrateful and certainly there is no fog or mist here and no big white waves because the sea is always blue and of course the trees are so wonderful and the blossoms so beautiful sometimes they have a carnival and then wagonloads of flowers are flung about everywhere but next day it is quite pitiful to see the lovely roses that have been trampled upon being swept up in the streets in the afternoon a band plays in a garden and you drive in a carriage round and round it at night you go to a restaurantbigger than the artisans instituteand there another band plays while you eat your dinnertwo or three hundred at once and all the ladies in low dresses after that you go to a casino where all is silent and rather dark and people sit round tables and play cards for money everybody plays cards here because everybody seems to be always taking a holiday ah but the devil never does said anna it is shocking to hear though how much is sometimes lost in a moment last night oscar pointed out a palefaced young man who had gambled away the whole of his estatelarger and more valuable than the innfarm itself they say he had not intended to play at all when he went into the room but the fever mastered him and he could not resist it ay ay we dont see the ruts when the snow covers them said anna it made me feel ill and i couldnt stay any longer but helga wished to remain so oscar put me in a carriage and i came back to the hotel and went to bed i do wish helga were not so fond of such places she is however and as a consequence oscar is compelled to go with her although he does not want to and sometimes he comes back very depressed since we came here his sleep has been much broken and his manner very restless i shall be glad when we leave this place but we have had such a wonderful time altogether and oscar has been so kind to me and i have been so happy all the same i shall be glad to be home again to see all the dear old facesyours and auntie margrets and fathers and the governors i suppose magnus does not talk of me nowdoes he how is silvertop tell magnus to rub his ears for me and kiss his rough old nose what a romp well have over the heath some day but i suppose i must not romp too much now must i it is so strange annathere are hardly any babies about this place not like italy where you see them everywhere with their poor little legs wrapped up like a mummys we are to be back for the first of summer and im counting the days already give our love to everybody and if anybody asks after me in particular say i am so well and so happy the loom in the hall lay idle on the night when magnus read this letter nobody spoke until anna lit two candles and gave one of them to magnus saying here youre tired and no wonder being up before daybreak how many lambs this morning magnus twentytwo but one of the best of them is dead thats the way of it always good night good night at the door of his bedroom magnus paused candle in hand mother well do you think she is so very happy our thora god knows my son said anna iii the snow was gone and the pale ground was green and golden with the raiment and the jewels of spring when the travelers returned to iceland rounding the head of the fiord in the early morning when the little capital was smoking for breakfast captain zimsen had fired a cannon in honor of their homecoming and everybody ran outofdoors in delight thinking the manofwar had come from copenhagen but there was greater joy still when the laura dropped her anchor and the little boats that had gone out to meet her came back with the news that the wedding party had returned half the men of the town went down to the jetty to welcome the wanderers among them the governor in his gala uniform the factor in his best scullcap smoking his best german pipe the sheriff the rector and the bishop the factors big white boat had been sent off instantly to fetch the three ashore and when it was coming back there was a good deal of curiosity as to how they would look after their long journey oscar who was standing in the bow was seen to be sunburnt and slightly olderlooking having grown a small fair mustache which was curled up at the ends it was observed by somebody that he wore the latest pattern of waistcoat and carried an italian cloak over his arm helga who was standing in the middle of the boat looked a shade more buxom and wore a new french hat she had a kodak swung over her shoulder and was looking at the people on the jetty through an ivoryframed fieldglass and thora who was sitting in the stern in the costume in which she went away with magnuss white bearskin across her knees looked a thought thinner than before but her face was bright with smiles though there were tears in her sparkling eyes when the boat came alongside the salutations were lusty and robustious such laughter such chaff such prolonged handshaking and slapping on the back after the governor and the factor had kissed thora they found their cheeks were wet but helga was as bright as the day and oscar made everybody happy he shook hands all round and hailed even the fishermen and boatmen by name he doesnt forget an old friend eh said an old fellow in bare feet then away they trooped to government house where anna was waiting in apron and hufa at the door of the porch thora cried for joy at sight of her and had to be carried off to her bedroom and when aunt margret came in her oiled ringlets and oscar would have kissed her she beat him off with a playful pat on the cheek and saying i must see what youve done with my child first ran straight upstairs helga went up also to take off her hat and the governor and the factor carried oscar into the drawingroom where the bishop the sheriff and the rector joined them maria brought in coffee and chocolate and the old men charged their pipes and plied oscar with questions the governor asked about english politics the factor about customhouse duties the bishop about the vatican and the rector about the excavations in the roman forum oscar answered all of them with a dash and emphasis that had the look of knowledge and the effect of wit and then glancing off the heavy ground of fact he went tobogganing down the slippery slopes of fiction with amusing tales of their travels and of the ridiculous things that had and had not happened to them all his stories told every time he pulled the trigger his pistol fired and the old men laughed until they cried what a boy he is he plays with every finger his high spirits affected them like sunshine after dark days like a breeze after a calm at sea like the swing of a boat after the first dip of the oar he was the same reckless irresponsible lovable prodigal as before and it was not until afterward that anybody remembered there had been a hollow ring in his hilarity a false note in his joy helga came down to the drawingroom and the men received her with a shout how plump she has grown said the governor she has certainly filled out on the trip said the factor hasnt she said oscar just what she wantedall she wanted nonsense let us talk of something serious said helga thora came next with anna and aunt margret buzzing and humming about her like bees she had changed to her old iceland dressjust for remembranceand now that she could be seen without her veil she was undoubtedly thinner and she had a pinched look about the nostrils and a feverish spot in the middle of her cheeks but her face was shining with timid smiles and she was overflowing with gratitude anna has given us such beautiful rooms oscar the big one overlooking the road and the long one behind it though i dont know what in the world we are going to do with two oh dont worry yourself about that dearwe may find a use for them by and by said anna with a knowing nod of the head and then the color flew up to thoras eyes like a flag of distress and the men began to smile anna was smiling also and making signals to the governor and chuckling to him behind her hand is it so yes indeed i asked her upstairs and its just as i expected then the governor in his turn began to chuckle and to whisper to the factor no is it a fact so anna tells me and then they chuckled together until everybody laughed at them whereupon the factor said and now oscar youve told us all about london and paris and rome but not a word about the place where they make money without working for it monte carlo havent i said oscar oh wella beautiful place in fact an absolute paradise an absolute hell if half one hears is true said the governor well yesyes thats so too said oscar i once heard of a man who made ten pounds in a single nightthink of that said the factor goodness sake cried aunt margret but whats the good of having a chest full of gold if the devil keeps the key said the governor then helga who was sitting on the pianostool began to play softly and oscar swung round to her ah addio napoli we must sing you some of the neapolitan songs father this was received with a chorus of approval and for the next halfhour helga played and oscar sang the gay ditties with which naples fills the air of italy with song and when at one moment the factor would have come back to the man who made ten pounds in a single night helga struck up the tarantella and oscar danced it at length the governor said everything has a stopping place except time its late and thora is looking tired so im going to turn out everybody who doesnt live here quite right too said aunt margret and im going to carry helga off to her own quarters i will take helga home said oscar and with further handshaking and wellwishing the party began to break up after all i suppose you are glad to be back thora said the bishop very very glad replied thora ha ha it isnt easy to hobble a homesick pony laughed the rector and you helga im not glad at all rector who could be glad to leave all that loveliness for a wilderness like this that chilled everybody for a moment and thinking to come to helgas relief oscar said theres something in what helga says certainly then you also oscar no rector nothat is to saywell im glad to be back and i shall be glad to go away again and then everybody was as happy as before iv next day oscar and helga spent many hours in a round of return visits while thora who was still tired stayed at home and received some of her old schoolfellows one of them who had been the beauty of her day had married a farmer fifteen miles away and borne him three children it was all work work work with her now and the oncebright girl was a slave ah thora how lucky you were not to marry magnus she said do you think so said thora why yes thora and then everybody says oscar is going to be such a distinguished man it was the spring caravan time and magnus himself who had brought his wool to the factors came late in the afternoon thora thought he looked brawnier and bigger than ever and she could not help seeing that his hands were coarser and his nails chopped off square but his voice was as soft as it used to be and he was shy and even nervous the light was low when he came into the drawingroom and looking closely at her face he asked three times over if she was well until she laughed as she gave him the same answer again and again then he laughed too and after that they got on better and exchanged all the newses silvertop was in good condition he had got his summer coat and looked splendid in fact he had been too well fed and was getting a little over himself and would have to be taken down a peg or two before thora rode him again ah well she wouldnt want him just yetnot just yetand magnus had better keep the rascal at the farm a little longer but what a time youve been away said magnus havent we said thora five months nearly six six months come tuesday week said magnus at that they both became confused and thora began to show some photographs taken by helga on the journey how beautiful how wonderful said magnus but i wonder your ship wasnt floating on the pumps as they say before you got back to harborit must have cost a good deal of money to see all those places it must said thora traveling is so expensiveespecially when there is more than one to pay for and then there was helga said magnus yes indeed there was helga but the check which father and the governor gave to oscar seems to have been sufficient for all still i can not understand how he made it pay for everything no it isnt easy to understand that is it venice rome monte carlo how you must have enjoyed your journey oscar didevery day of it and you thora im not a good traveleri soon tire of sightseeing and if it hadnt been for helga so you are not sorry you took helga with you thora faltered a little and then said helga was able to go sightseeing with oscar when i had to stay in the hotel but were you not lonely while they were away perhapssometimesjust a littlebeing so much alone and among so many strange faces magnus who seemed to be absorbed in the photographs said almost unconsciously poor little thing then the flag of distress ran up to thoras eyes and she answered hurriedly oh it was my own fault oscar always wanted to stay with me and if it hadnt been for helga but a little catch came into her throat and she had to stop whereupon magnus said and i hoped you were so happy but then anna brought in the lamp and the lights relieved the tension yet being able to see the photographs plainly magnus laid them down and thora put them away he left early having a long ride before him and anna followed him to the door is thora quite well he asked in a whisper as well as can be expected under the circumstances said anna and is oscar kind to her kind oscar kind why should you ask that magnus she looks so pale so depressed oh thats often the way with young wives in her condition havent you noticed anythinganything particular our thora will be a mother before long and is that all thats the matter with her said magnus v the summer session of parliament was to begin almost immediately and oscar plunged straightway into preparations for his campaign he was to move a resolution proposing that the acts of althing should henceforward be promulgated on the last day of the session as in the old times from the ancient mount of laws at thingvellir it was to be his maiden speech and much depended upon it before he wrote it he went over to the factors to discuss with helga its scheme and argument after he had written it he went over to the factors again to read it to helga and obtain the benefit of her suggestions and when he had committed it to memory he went over to the factors a third time to rehearse it before helga it was helga first and last all day and every day until the day of the opening sitting helga is a great politician but you care nothing about politics do you thora and thora would swallow the lump in her throat and answer no thora and helga were both present when oscar took his seat they occupied the governors anteroom that opened off the parliamentary chamber the galleries were crowded with spectators and there was much curiosity when oscar rose to speak thora felt a little faint at the first sound of his voice and she would have fled away if she could have done so but helga held her to her chair hush for goodness sake be quiet she whispered youll make him still more nervous the speech was a great success it was an appeal for the preservation of the old orderfor all that made iceland what it wasthe land of saga and song even the party of progress who thought much of its moonshine were carried away by the fervor and enthusiasm the poetry and passion of the young speaker when oscar finished there were vollies of applause the people in the galleries clapped their hands and helga stood up and waved her handkerchief but thora covered her face and cried into her gloves the resolution was passed unanimously and oscar was made chairman of a committee to carry out the necessary preparations this work occupied all his spare time during the six weeks of the parliamentary session it took him to the factors every day for helga was full of schemes for the great ceremonial being in parliament every morning and at the factors every afternoon oscar was nearly always from home and thora saw little of him every night he returned with a mouthful of apologies and a torrent of explanations they had been searching the sagas for the exact course taken by the procession in the old days or they had been selecting flags to hang over the rocks or they had been composing a hymn to celebrate the occasionoscar had improvised one in a moment and helga had written it down and how has my little baby been going on all day long lonely what a shame im sorryvery very sorry he would say and then thora would answer dont think of me oscar you have your work to do and i only wish i could help you like helga but in the long hours of loneliness when her head was on her hands and her feet were in the fender the poor little soul would sink and the tender heart grow bitter only anna would be with her then comforting and consoling her and pretending to be blind to what every eye could see anna she said at length when magnus was here he asked me such a strange question what was that thora he asked if i wasnt sorry that helga had gone with us on our journey and are you sometimesperhaps it is foolishbut sometimes i think i am i know i think i know and it isnt foolish of you at all dear oscar is doing wrong i must speak to himi must speak to him severely it isnt oscars fault helga is so selfish yes she takes after somebody else in that way thora she was always taking oscar away from me when we were on our journey but your journey is over now and he must mend his manners ah no that part of our journey isnt over yet anna sometimes i think it has only begun you dont mean to say that helga is trying to helga has no pity when she once gets hold of anybody she will never give him up you think she is trying to get hold of oscar i think she has got hold of him you mustnt say that about your husband thora oh i dont blame oscar helga is so beautiful so clever she has every advantage over me now thats just where you are wrong there is one point in which our little thora has an advantage over helga and every other woman in the world you mean with oscar yes with oscaryou are going to be the mother of his child will that make any difference any difference i should think it will indeed my poor mother used to say when people are married its the children who keep the pot boiling you mean that when my baby is born oscar will come back to me certainly i do and that he will never go away from me any more never oscar has always loved childrenwait till he has a child of his own and see well you are his motheryou know him best trust me thora it isnt a good well if water has to be carried to it but when the child is born oscar will begin all over again you think that really you think oscar will love me again for my babys sake any man must if he has a good heartand oscars heart is good whatever his head may be indeedindeed it is he must love the mother for the sake of the child and the child for the sake of the mother how sweet how beautiful thoras own eyes were now like the eyes of a childso full of wonder and love she fell to counting the weeks that must pass before the fulness of her time nine weekshardly nineeightthink motheronly eight how i wish it were even less i used to look forward to that time with anxiety and dread but there is nothing to be afraid of if so much good can come out of a little painnothing reallynow is there vi in this sweet hope thora comforted herself for four weeks and then something happened which disturbed all her calculations it was the eve of the proclamation and the committee of which oscar was the chief decided to visit thingvellir in order to complete their preparations for the ceremony on this errand helga was to go with them and having so many things to attend to they were to sleep one night at the innfarm and return the following day when oscar announced this program a sudden change came over thoras patient and submissive spirit then i must go too she said you you thora said oscar why what can you be thinking of thirtythree miles awayin that desolate regionwithout a doctor or a nurseand so near your time too impossible quite impossible then helga mustnt go either but helga is so useful so necessary i dont care if i can not go with you then helga shall not do so either my dear thora this is so unlike you but as you please i shall be ashamed to tell helga and explain to the committee but still if you wish it no no you must not cry you must not disturb yourself my little woman must keep herself very quiet while i am awayvery very quiet two hours after oscar had gone helga came to government house thora was alone and the sisters faced each other for some instants without speaking at length helga said well i trust you are satisfied now that you have shown your foolish jealousy and made us the talk of the town i trust you are satisfied oscar said i was to keep myself quiet helga and you know i ought to do so oh you can excite yourself enough it seems when you wish to express your paltry feelings because i have sympathized with oscar and tried to help and inspire him you who have never sympathized with him and can never help him because you cannot understand him and he is beyond youyou must come with your paltry spite helga you have never been kind to menever since you came home a year agobut now you are cruel am i perhaps i am and perhaps ive gone through enough to make me so you speak as if your disappointment of this morning in not going with oscar were a great and grievous matter but you dont seem to remember how often i have been disappointed in the same way oh i dare say you think you are much to be pitied i dont say im to be pitied helga because i know it was my own fault at the beginning but i do say ive never known a moments peace since you came home from denmark i persuaded father to send for you because you were my sister and i wished you to share my happiness but you have never shown me any sisterly feelingnever on the contrary you found me happy and you have made me miserable you have done your best to render life intolerable to me i thought you said you were not to excite yourself thora it is you that are exciting me helga because you are always inflicting the sharpest tortures upon me and hurting me where you know i can bear it least from the first you tried to take oscar away from meyou know you did you tried to do it before our marriage and you have tried to do it ever since you were not even ashamed to try during our honeymoon and you are trying now because you have lost all sense of loyalty or justice or remorse or even shame oh yes said helga you think you have been a great martyr but would it surprise you to hear that somebody else has gone through a still greater martyrdom you accuse me of having inflicted tortures upon youwhat of the tortures you have inflicted upon me i helga yes you you speak as if i were the sort of woman who draws a man into her net who tears him away from the wife he loves and drags him down to his death you would have been nearer right if you had thought of me as another kind of woman altogetherone who is herself the suffererwho is shut out and cut off and must remain unmated because the man who loves her is married to somebody else helga oh i should have had mercy on your condition but you would not let me and now if you wish to hear the truth i will tell you and what is the truth helga the truth is that oscar does not love you at allperhaps he has never loved you helga how dare you the falseness of what you say is on the face of it if oscar has never loved me why am i his wife what advantage had he to gain by choosing me instead of you what compulsion was put upon him if he did not love me why did he marry me he married you out of pityfrom a mistaken sense of dutybecause he had contracted to marry you and thought it honorable to go on with his bargain but he loved somebody else and so he sacrificed both of them its false helga its false and its only your vanity that makes you say so oh you must not suppose that i am saying this without a certainty i had it from himself himself he himself from his own mouth on the very eve of your marriage on the eve of his marriage to me he told you he told me that he loved me and since then if he has not said it in words he has said it in other ways again and again he loves me still no no no it is not true he will always love me it is not true it is not true and he loves you no more than a man loves his dog or his horse or the man of the bible days loved the handmaiden of his wife helga for shame are you without conscience or truth that you can lie to me like that if oscar had never loved me do you think i should not have found it out long ago and if he loved you do you think i should not know iti who am bearing his child oh you neednt taunt me with that thora yes yours are the lips that kiss him but it isnt the lips that matter it is the love behind the lips and that love is mine and every time he kisses you the kiss is meant for me you lie helga you lie and the child too it is not your child because the love that gave it life was my love you lie you lie what do i care if you are the bondwoman who bears his child the child will be my child and when he is born he will have my face no it is not possible it is it isyou know it is thora gasped for breath then an extraordinary change came over her that made her almost unrecognizable the patient and gentle woman seemed suddenly possessed by a demon something strange and horrible seemed in an instant to enter into her soul the homicidal impulse which takes hold of wild animals appeared to assail and conquer her one moment she stood facing her sister convulsed and livid and then in a voice that was hoarse with rage and shame she said very well if that is so and if my child is not my own if it has been conceived in the love of another woman and i am only the bondwoman who bears it thenthenthenit shall never be born or if it is born iii will kill it with that she burst into a peal of laughter and fell on to the floor the noise brought anna into the room panting what have you done to her what have you said thora thora i will kill the child i will kill it i will kill it the wild shrieking laughter continued and increased until the governor came running from his room he listened for a moment to the mad cries and then said let us lift her up and carry her to bed helga go for the doctor and for margret neilsen tell them to come quickly shes in labortheres no time to lose vii all night thora tossed about in a strong delirium which expressed itself in the one wild homicidal cry aunt margret came and found anna in the sickroom the factor followed and sat for hours with the governor in his bureau below the doctor doctor olesen never left thoras side he did not conceal the gravity of her condition the delirium was due to premature labor such homicidal mania was not unknown in the cases of young mothers it generally originated in some startling event perhaps a great loss or a great shock or a grievous disappointment doctor olesen questioned anna but she knew nothing to account for thoras seizure he asked helga but she said little helga was obviously in a state of terror her face was deathly pale and her lips quivered she could not be got to leave the house when the factor returned home at ten oclock being powerless to do anything he could not tear helga away it was observed by all three attendants on the invalid that helga did not ask to be admitted to thoras room a sensible girl thought the doctor she knows better than ask me thought anna but helga seemed anxious to help in any menial way no matter what when there was nothing else to do helga sat in the drawingroom still wearing her cloak and hat and listening in fear to the mad cries from the chamber overhead in the long dark hours she was a prey to the most agonizing thoughts she was feeling like one who had committed a murder and asking herself what would happen if thora died beyond the physical agony of hearing those wild cries from the chamber overhead beyond the pangs of a troubled conscience and beyond the pain of the sisterly love and pity which overcame her and surprised her in these dark hours helga suffered from one overmastering terrorthe terror of what oscar would say to her when he came back he had been sent for there would be no need to tell him anything oscar arrived at midnight covered with dust and sweat somebody opened the hall door to him he did not stop to look who it wasbut pushing through the house came first upon helga in the drawingroom for a moment they stood face to face like guilty things she was trembling from head to foot he was breathing heavily how is she now he asked no better she answered he heard the cries from the room above is that she yes oh god he muttered and began to load himself with reproaches i should have taken her with me when she asked me why didnt i i ought to have known what would happen helga had expected that he would fly out at her and she could have borne any insult but this she could not bear its all my fault he said i have been a foola weak selfish fool oh thora my sweet innocent longsuffering thora forgive me forgive me helga could not endure the house any longer she felt like a criminal and wanted to escape leaving oscar with his head on his arms over the cushions of the couch she slipped out and went home through the dark and silent streets alone finding helga gone oscar crept up to the door of thoras room but he was not permitted to enter where the mere breath of excitement might quench the glimmer of life within his mother came out to him in the large room at the back and found him with his face down on the table she had intended to rate him soundly the moment she set eyes on him but the sight of his distress silenced her reproaches and she fell to comforting him instead no no said anna you couldnt have taken her with you things are bad enough as they are but think how much worse they would have been if all this had happened there then i should have stayed at home said oscar i should have given up everything thora couldnt have wished you to do that my son none of us had a right to expect it but you dont know everything mother i have behaved shamefully to thora i thought i was doing right by her but i was doing wrong dreadfully wrong the poor girl has suffered terribly and this is the result as the first streaks of dawn began to fret the sky above the glaciers of the eastern fells the delirium abated and there came a period of conscious pain anna ran in to oscar to tell him of the change and then downstairs on a similar errand to where the governor lay in his shirtsleeves on the sofa in his bureau shes herself at last thank the lord and the doctor says shes going along as well as can be expected two hours later when the sun rose on the little town and the fiord and the fells were crimson with his glory the angel of peace came down to the house of pain hearing a babe in her arms with a smile and an outstretched hand the doctor entered oscars room and said i am happy to congratulate you a girla beautiful child but thora she is weak but quite at ease and as well as can be expected under the circumstances thank god and now go to bed yourself oscar and sleep if you can until this time tomorrow i willi will thank you doctor thank you a thousand times meanwhile anna was in the bureau telling the glad news to the governor and then running about the house to find some one to carry it to the factor ill go mother said a voice from the kitchen goodness is that you magnus when did you come about eleven oclock last night then you were here before oscar golden mane gallops fast mother and what have you been doing in the kitchen carrying the wood and boiling the water for margret neilsen then you must go to bed nowyoull be sleepy not ii can lie awake six nights you know when the lambs are coming well a lamb has come tonight magnus said anna god bless it and the little mother as well said magnus viii thora slept until midday under the combined effects of exhaustion and a sleeping draught and when she awoke the evil spirit which had possessed her had gone and she was her own sweet simple self once more but the struggle had been a terrible one and if the better part of her soul had conquered the frail body which had been its battlefield was a waste of weakness she was pale and thin and her blue eyes were large and liquid before opening them she heard from the back room which had been transformed into a nursery the sweetest most thrilling sound that ever comes to a womans ears a sound which sums up into its joys all the ecstasy that a human soul can know a sound which no woman in the world has ever heard but oncethe first cry of her firstborn thora opened her eyes and saw anna knitting by her side is that baby she asked ah i thought you were awake said anna yes thora that is baby margret neilsen is bathing her bring her to me tell aunt margret to bring her immediately by and by dear by and by no now if she doesnt bring baby this instant ill get up and go to her hush you are to be very quiet and not to excite yourself and as for getting up the doctor says if you stir out of bed within a week goodness knows what will happen yes i know i am very naughty and you must forgive me but ive not seen baby yetnot really seen herand if you will bring her to me i shall be so good i shall not excite myself at allnot at all you will see how quiet i shall be well if you promise me faithfully promise me said anna wait sit down again mother sit here by the window i have something to ask you first does shedoes baby resemble anybody resemble anybody i should think she does indeed i have never in all my life seen a child so like its mother like me oh bring her bring her i cant wait a moment longer anna went into the nursery and told aunt margret that thora was awake and calling impatiently for the child but shell want to take her said aunt margret trust her for that if shes a mother said anna but will it be safe is she quite herself again well chance her said anna aunt margret gathered up the baby in its long clothes and with its feedingbottle at her breast and carried it into thoras room and stooping by the bed she said there look at that now give her to me give her to me cried thora stretching out two trembling white arms carefully then carefully said aunt margret there was no need to fear thora gathered her child to her breast with the free and daring but gentle touch that comes to mothers of every species my baby my baby she whispered and her pale face overflowed with joy yes she is like me i can see it myself but why doesnt she open her eyes is she asleep that can not be because she is still sucking coocoo isnt she beautiful how foolish of me to say that and yet its true coo my baby my bootiful bootiful baby through all this broken jargonthe divine foolishness of motherhoodthe two older women stood by trying to cackle and laugh behind their black silk aprons but finding it hard to keep back their tears has oscar seen her yet not yet said anna but he has come back hasnt he didnt you tell me he had come back yes but he was quite worn out with watching and i sent him off to bed poor boy and magnus has come too but i couldnt get him to go to bed and he still is working away in the kitchen what a deal of trouble i am to everybody trouble we dont call that trouble youve got a baby for it havent you said thora and she looked down at the treasure at her breast as if she had brought them the wealth of the world all at once she cried oh oh look look aunt margret who was at the other side of the room almost fainted at thoras sudden cry what has happened she gasped baby has opened her eyes said thora aunt margret dropped to a chair to breathe theyre blue like mine oscars are brown and helgashers are grey but perhaps babys eyes will change their color do childrens eyes change their color anna sometimes they do said anna blue eyes sometimes become brown never grey not that i know of said anna im so glad baby is like me said thora and she gazed down at the child with looks of wonder and love then her delicious selfishness took another turn and she said mother do you not think oscar has slept long enough now doctor olesen said he was to sleep until tomorrow replied anna but couldnt you wake him up for a momentjust for a moment to come and see us as we are nowbaby and mewould it do him much harm no but it would do you a great deal you would overexcite yourself and then my gracious i should get into trouble oh no i shall be quite calmi promise you i shall be calm and oscar can come in his dressinggown and then go back to sleep do call himdoplease doanna aunt margretmother they could not resist the pleading voice and anna went off to oscars room oscar was awake how is she now he asked still a little weak but getting stronger every hour said anna and the child shes got it in bed with her and wishes you to come and see them ill come at once dear thora she is happy at last i have never seen anybody so happy and nobody ever deserved happiness more just now when i left her she had the eyes of a child but she is still on the brink of life and death it wouldnt need much to make her take flight from this world therefore watch over your words oscar and dont say anything that will agitate her oscar promised and then followed his mother into thoras bedroom at the threshold he heard the soft boooocoocoo of motherly endearment and then saw the shining pale face on the pillow with the tiny red one below it my poor thora he said kissing her forehead you are not suffering now are you a little pale perhaps and a little thin but better are you not look she whispered uncovering the child and having no thoughts to waste on lesser matters who is she like oscar like do you ask me who shes like thora why shes likeridiculously like you kiss me oscar put your arms around both of us dearest that wayso but at the next moment the baby was crying and the older women were protesting loudly come away you great clumsy creature said aunt margret no no cried thora it wasnt oscar he never hurts anybody it was i auntie but auntie making no terms with such heroics took the child out of bed and proceeded to rock it face downward across her knee when the baby had been hushed to sleep they fell to the discussion of its name oscar was for thora but thora herself said no that was her own name the name oscar knew her by and therefore she could not share it even with her child then what do you say to elin said oscar beautiful anna aunt margret listen say it again oscar elin isnt it lovely as oscar says it so they decided straightway that elin it should be and next came the question of the godparents thora was for magnus poor magnus and oscar assented but when oscar in his turn nominated helga the sunshine died off thoras face whereupon anna gave him a quick glance and began to make a noise then magnus for godfather and aunt margret for godmother said oscar and so it was agreed and let us have the baptism today said thora today cried anna why thora a child is never baptised on the day of its birth except when it is going to die it was now aunt margrets turn to make a noise and this she did by wakening baby in rising suddenly and protesting that oscar ought to be turned out of the room and thora left to rest yes yes thats true said oscar and kissing thora again he followed aunt margret and the baby into the nursery when they were gone and the door had closed on them anna leaned over the bed and whispered there didnt i know what oclock it was striking hasnt oscar come back to you when he kissed you didnt you feel that all his heart was yours yes it is true said thora but will it last think you certainly it will last last night he was reproaching himself with all sorts of things and today he is like a man who is beginning over again a new life you think so anna you really think so indeed i do depend upon it hell not lose sight of that baby for five minutes in the day and hell never look at her but hell think of you how happy i am i have never been so happy beforenever never she took a deep breath and closed her shining eyes to ease the beating of her heart there was a moments silence and then in another voice she said mother yes dear last nightwhen i was so illdidnt i say hush thats all over well not speak of it any more all the same if i could die nownow when i am so happyand baby too and then anna sank into a chair trembling from head to foot ix anna was right about oscar and the babyhe could not willingly allow it to be out of his sight for any five minutes of the day or night when it was to be bathed he felt it necessary to superintend the operation and when it was fed he was compelled to keep watch and ward he had a thousand fears of accidents that might happen to it and became dizzy when it lay naked on the edge of aunt margrets lap if it cried while he was in the diningroom he rushed upstairs and if anything fell on the floor above he turned pale and trembled sleeping in the room next to the nursery he kept his door open at night and if the baby was fretful he walked aunt margret to and fro being afraid to carry the child himself as if she had taken too much laudanum two days passed in this way and he was never once outofdoors thora overheard him in the adjoining room coaxing and scolding aunt margret and talking or laughing to the child and her heart overflowed with happiness but will it last she asked herself meantime helga sitting at home shut out from these joys was feeling herself neglected on the third day oscar had a message from her saying she wished to see him on an important matter and asking him to come round immediately he could not resist it the little scented envelope drew him like a magnet going out for a walk to think of what he should do every step took him in the direction of the factors within half an hour he found himself in the little sittingroom overlooking the lake and helga was standing before him with head down more meek and modest but also more beautiful and irresistible than ever before i have a confession to make to you she said and if you are angry with me i must bear it she had been the cause of poor thoras sudden illness stung by the disappointment of some days ago she had gone across to government house to reproach her sister with the humiliation she had put upon her perhaps she had said too much and more than was true and she was sorry and ashamed she could wish to ask thoras forgiveness and if oscar would do it for her with pleasure helga said oscar but alls well that ends well and why should we say more on this subject there is another that i wished to speak of said helga and then came the real burden of her message poor thoras delirium had been homicidal she had threatened to take the life of her unborn child what a frightful thing it would be if out of her weakness and hallucination she should attempt to carry out her threat but thats all over now helga said oscar since her baby came thora had been as gentle as a lamb and running over with tenderness and love so i thought until this morning said helga but father tells me that your mother sees signs of dementia still good heavens cried oscar everybody appears to have heard of it except you i thought it was wrong to keep you in the dark and so ive told you thanks helga it is good of you and if poor thora is still suffering in that way there cant be a doubt of it oscar she told your mother she wished she could die and baby with her she must be watchedthe child too there must be nurses night and day is that enough oscar you know how cunning people are when they are suffering from dementia and then a child is such a frail thingits life might be snuffed out in an instant you mean that baby should be removed it might be safestfor a time at least it might come herei should take the greatest care of it but it neednt change its nurseaunt margret must come home soon in any case it must be done helga it would be too awful if anything happened to the child i should go mad and then think of thora it would be ten thousand times more terrible for her poor thora it will break her heart said oscar it seems as if i am doomed to bring grief and pain and death to her we must be cruel only to be kind oscar but dont act on my advice only and for mercys sake dont say i suggested anything ask somebody else i will ask the governor the governor at the mention of that name they paused and looked at each other in silence as if a ghost had passed between them any news from monte cari mean copenhagen asked helga nothing yet but i am in daily fear of something happening whatever happens i shall never forget that you did that for me oscar she held out her hand to him and he took it kept it for a moment then kissed it passionately and fled from the house later the same day a family conference was held at government house to consider what ought to be done the governor and the factor were there as well as oscar and anna aunt margret came down last having left one of the maids in charge of the child magnus is in the nursery too she said he came up with wood for the stove and thora heard his voice so now they are talking through the open door doctor olesen had been called into consultation and he gave a guarded opinion such forms of homicidal mania were due to weakness and were usually transient since the night of the confinement he had seen no signs of it himself but if anna had seen them he would not take the responsibility of opposing the step that was suggested anna rocked herself and moaned and said that after all she could not be certain she might have mistaken what had fallen from thora perhaps the poor child had been thinking of something quite different aunt margret was now of the same mind but much more emphatic i dont believe a word of it she said and im sorry i ever doubted her thora is a neilsen and she wouldnt hurt a hair of the childs head this is no time to indulge sentimental feelings said the governor if thora is suffering from dementia however transient we must protect her from the dangers of her weakness i agree stephen said the factor im sorryim sorry for my daughterbut i agree i agree that is our dutyour plain duty continued the governor first to the child who is the offspringat present the only probable offspringof two families and next to the poor young mother herself than whom no one would have more right to reproach us if we failed to do it and a disaster occurred no one stephen no one said the factor it seems so cruel so dreadfully cruel said anna but its all for thoras own good mother said oscar i know oscar i know yet its cruel for all that but i should like to know whos going to do it said aunt margret im not i tell you flat then anna must do it herself said the governor no no dont ask me said anna why not who so proper to do such an act of mercy and love and oscar toooscar himself if need be must carry the child over to the factors oscars lips whitened and quivered and his heart clutched at his ribs it was decided that the child should be taken from the mother that night as soon as she was asleep and the house was quiet but she goes to sleep with the child at her breast and always awakes when it wants the bottle said anna ill give her a draughtshell sleep until morning said the doctor oh dear me oh dear me i shall feel like a thief said anna or like a murderer said aunt margret x meantime magnus in the nursery was looking down at the little face in the cot sometimes blinking at the light sometimes digging its little fist into its face sometimes gripping with its tiny soft hand his own coarse finger through the open door to the adjoining room there came the voice that he knew so well a little weaker a little thinner but more joyous and silvery than before is that you magnus yes thora have you seen my little elin im looking at her now thora isnt she beautiful isnt she a darling shes like a little angel thora a joyous thrill came from the other room and then the silvery voice began again shes awake isnt she cant i hear her laughing she laughs already the little rogue do you know you are to be her godfather magnus i am yes oscar agreed to it immediately and the baptism is to take place soon it will be the happiest moment of my life thora oh shell give you lots of trouble shes going to be such a little mischief cant you see her growing up magnus i see her just like her mother when she was a child thora another joyous trill came through the open door and then the silvery voice once more shell be going to stay with you at the farm some day and then shell pull up all the flowers in your garden she shall do whatever she likes thora but there are chasms and caves and rifts in the earth there arent there ill keep watch on her thora if she should slip anywhere ill keep watch on her all her life thora the joyous trill came again but with a slightly different note then magnus yes thora why dont you marry and have a little elin of your own you know i oh no and then a gruff laugh and something about a poor farmer dont say that magnus then the silvery voice that came to him through the open door became serious and sweetly patronizing hoping he would be happy and prosperous at thingvellir it wasnt a great life certainly not a distinguished career like oscarsthat is to say what oscar was to beand it wanted hard work early and late yet still but magnus youve been here three days havent you how have you been able to spare them ill make up for them when i get home thora but anna says you havent been to bed since you came and now the proclamation is near and youll be kept busy at the inn with that im strong thorafearfully strong said magnus thora lay back in her bed and with a blush there was none to see said magnus i thinki really think you would do anything in the world for me a gruff laugh came back to her half smothered as in a mans beard and then a choking voice said i believe i would thora and if i wanted youor baby wanted youi think you would follow us to the ends of the earth only say come and ill come thora there was a moments silence and then a merry laugh came rippling out to him and he felt hot to the roots of the hair but of course that can not happen magnus we have oscar so we can never need you no you can never need me thora at that moment anna and aunt margret came back heated and nervous after the conference and bundled magnus out of the room then while baby was being bathed for bed behind closed doors to the customary chorus of screams anna combed out thoras hair for the night and thora talked of magnus people think him heavy and stupid but hell startle them some day she said is it to be plaited as usual asked anna just as usual but how your hands tremble tonight mother thats nursing you know poor magnus he hasnt a selfish thought in his heart any girl might love him and perhaps if i had never known oscar doctor olesen says you are to take a powder tonight child it will make you sleep until morning its you that should take the powderyou and aunt margret ah if i could take it for you i would dear said anna but here it istake it quickly or i may thora drank from the glass anna gave her and said there its gone now bring me baby aunt margret came with the child hushing it to sleep and put it gently down into the mothers arms the darling she needs no sleeping draught my precious precious pet but i declareaunt margrets hands are trembling too ive worn you out both of you nonsense go to sleep im going to put down the light said aunt margret and she lowered the lamp and put it to stand on a table behind the bedcurtains how good you are to me everybody is good to me came in a fainter voice from the shadow of the bed that is because everybody loves you thora said anna in a husky murmur you must always believe that whatever happens how sweet it is to be loved if i could only think that it would last the baby became fretful and thora began to sing it to sleep sleep baby sleep angels bright thy slumbers keep sleep baby sleep her drowsy voice ran a line and stopped then ran another line and stopped again and then the faint voice said how sweet it would be to fall asleep like this some daybaby and iand awake in heaven hush i should be sorry for oscar but still the faint voice lisped the soft breathing lengthened the blue eyelids closed the pale lips parted the white arms slackened and then the two children mother and babe lay together in the lap of sleep there was silence for some minutes wherein the two older women who sat in the gloom like guilty things heard nothing but the ticking of a clock then aunt margret crept over to where anna sat with her head covered by her black silk apron and whispered oscar is waiting at the door if it has to be done at all let it be done now anna uncovered her face and saw oscar on the threshold in his cloak and hat she rose on trembling limbs and felt her way to the bedside there she stood listening for a moment to thoras measured breathing then she drew the mothers white arms apart and lifted the baby out of them aunt margret wrapped a shawl about the sleeping child and oscar covered it with his cloak the night is warm she will take no harm he faltered at the next moment he had gone and aunt margret had followed him then anna tottered into the outer room and sank into a chair and covered her head again oh god forgive me god forgive me god forgive me she said xi the sun was shining into the bedroom when thora awoke with a slight flush on her pale cheeks and a look of happiness in her eyes and saw anna rocking herself sadly by the bedside where is baby asked thora presently dear presently said anna where is she lie quiet thora you shall hear everything by and by but tell me where is my little elin anna promise me not to excite yourself thora and i will tell you all about her thora raised herself on her elbow and said with quickcoming breath you dont mean that you have taken her away there now you are exciting yourself already thora have you stolen my child away from me cried thora oh dear oh dear what things you are saying thora thora thought a moment and then she said i am sorry i said that anna it was very very wrong of me i know you wouldnt hurt me for worlds but why dont you tell me where my little girl is shes in the nursery isnt she you took her away from me in the night and now shes asleep in her cotisnt that so or perhaps aunt margret has taken her down to the door there isnt that shethat child crying in the homefield or was it somebody elses baby in the road speak anna you are only teasing me i know but im so weak so foolish and my heart is beating like a drum anna continued to rock herself and to moan oh dear oh dear thora watched her for a moment with eyes that filled with fear and then called in a shrill voice aunt margret aunt margret aunt margret aunt margret has gone thora said anna gone and my babyhas she gone too anna only rocked herself and moaned oh dear oh dear thora struggled to raise herself in bed but her cheeks whitened and her eyes rolled and with a loud scream she fell back fainting the maids came running into the bedroom and opened thoras clinched hands while anna bathed her forehead what have i done oh those doctors little they know of a mothers feelings it will kill her in any case my poor child my poor child come then come then thora recovered consciousness after a moment and looked about her with dazed eyes oscar she said i want to see oscar and so you shall dear said anna and she sent one of the maids across to the factors to fetch him instantly oscar came upstairs four steps at a stride and entered the room like a rush of wind my poor thora he said with panting breath and he leaned over the bed to kiss her thoras eyes which had been dry and hard now melted and grew wet oscar she said your mother has sent our little elin awaystolen her from me in the nightand i am so weak and faint i can not get up to follow her ah no dear not mother said oscar lie quiet and i will explain fetch her back to me oscar i love my baby i can not live without her i know you love her thora and i promise you that you shall have her back in due time no no dear now not just yet thora but i give you my word for it that baby is safe they are taking every care of her what right have they to take care of my baby cried thora i must have her back i will have her back in thoras flashing eyes which changed the character of her countenance and in her voice which was husky with rage and hatred there was something of the fierce animal which has been robbed of its young oscar shuddered at sight of the convulsed and livid face but he answered quietly thora if you give way to feelings like those you will make yourself ill again and then baby will never come back to you if you will only listen i will tell you everything you were very bad before baby came and doctor feared you might even do some harm to her therefore to save you from pain and shame i took her away from you for a little whileonly for a little whileuntil you were better and more sure of yourself thora then a great silence fell on thoras bewailing and she said in a husky whisper so it was you oscar wellyes dear it was ibut what i did was for your own goodyours and our little elins and if you will only wait only be patient your baby shall be brought back to you and we shall be happy thoras wet eyes dried of themselves but it was a glassy and smileless light that came into them where is my baby now she asked not far away in fact only at your fathers aunt margret wrapped her in a shawl and i took her across myself then you gave my child to helga said thora wellyes i gave her to helga but aunt margret is there now and besides i intend to go over myself off and on all day long so you are not to worry or be anxious about anythingnot about any single thing you understand everything now dear do you not yes i understand everything now said thora the glassy smileless eyes continued to look up at him but he mistook the light that shone in them thats a dear good girl he said everybody will be delighted to hear you are so reasonable and resigned because everybody thought you would be inconsolableeverybody except helga helga helga said you would be yourself within an hour and she was right helga knew you better than any of us yes helga knew me better than any of you said thora then he sat on the end of the bed and chatted gaily on many subjects while anna crying for joy of the change in thoras spirits called for her breakfast and coaxed her to swallow some of it he talked of his workof the work he was going to do when he began which would be soon very soon now then of his ambitions in parliament and finally of the proclamation it was fixed for the day after tomorrow everybody was going to it and the town would be empty as for himself he had made up his mind to stay at home with thora but seeing that the celebration at thingvellir had been his idea and that he had taken such a prominent part in it people were saying that it would be a thousand pities if he could not be present then theres the hymn you know said oscar ive been rehearsing the choir and they are very shaky but if i thought the organist could hold them together i shouldnt go in any case what does helga say asked thora helga oh helga helga says i must go replied oscar so do i said thora you do really what a sweet unselfish soul it is to be sure said oscar and kissing thora on the forehead he ran back to see elin the glassy smileless eyes on the pillow followed him out of the room but their light was the light of despair xii going out of government house oscar came upon magnus who was standing at the foot of the staircase ridingwhip in hand and with golden mane at the door of the porch by the dark cloud on magnuss face oscar could see that his brother was in a sullen and rebellious mood and to avoid further hostilities he saluted him and tried to run on wait said magnus another time said oscar now said magnus and laying his big hand on oscars arm he drew him back into the hall oscar flushed up at the indignity and said sharply well what is it oscar said magnus i heard what passed in the bedroom then you were listening i was you are not ashamed to say you were listening on the stairson your hands and knees perhapsto my conversation with my wife i would have listened on my belly if need be said magnus and his face darkened more and more may i ask why you listened said oscar because i could not do otherwise how so i had given my word to be here when wanted to my wife yes you will excuse my saying magnus that it would be much better if you attended to your own business this is my own business oscar you must give the child back to thora really magnus you are taking a most unwarrantable liberty if you were not my brother shah give the mother her child good lord man said oscar breathing hard as if he had been running do you really think that i am going to allow an outsider even if he is my brother to dictate to me what i shall do with my family difficulties and to travel all the way from thingvellir to conduct my domestic affairs what right have you to mix yourself in my businessthe business of my wife and me the cloud that contracted magnuss face grew darker every moment and he said you ask me what right i do i loved thora neilsen you think it necessary to tell me that said oscar to remind me that she threw you up for me thats a lie oscar stephenson strong said oscar with a laugh but he was trembling visibly i gave her up when i could have kept her to her word i decided in favor of the girls happiness against my own i gave her up to you that you might make her happy those were the terms on which i gave her up to you and what is the result what is the result i ask you you have allowed another woman to take her place another woman said oscar is that the way you talk of her own sisterof helga sister or not she has tortured thora by every art her selfish soul could think of said magnus thats what she has done and you have helped her and the treasure i valued more than my life you have flung away oscar made a cry of protest but magnus bore him down with a torrent of words such as never came from his silent lips before do you think i dont know what kind of life you led that poor unhappy child while you were awayyou and the girl together and now that her baby comes and her husband returns to her as he must if he is a man you let her sisters scheming heart rob her of her only happiness again oscar with his whitening lips did his best to laugh magnus he said it is impossible to be angry with you apparently you do not know that it was with the consent of the family and by the advice of the doctor that the child was taken from its mother bah do you think i dont know who suggested it do you think that i dont see her object do you think i dont hear her pitiful pleasthe same as if i had listened to them the little innocent is in danger of its life it must come to hershe must take charge of it why to bring you back to her feetto attach you to her at any cost and you like a fool fall into her plansbecause you want tobecause you dont know yourself or your wife or the woman that isnt worthy to tie her shoes oscar winced under magnuss words for they cut him to the bone oscar said magnus again you will give the child back to the motherit will be best i promise you i have my own opinion of what is best said oscar bridling and if i think that for the time being mother and child are best apart oscar stephenson interrupted magnus you will give the child back to the mother and if i refuse by what right will you command me said oscar by the right i acquired when i gave thora up to you replied magnus and by the right i acquired when she became my wife i will do with her child as i think proper said oscar at that magnus lost all control of himself is she a dog that you can take her whelps he cried the law gives me the right to dispose of her offspring as i think proper said oscar then damn the law cried magnus and if you are deaf to my entreaties ii will go on said oscar it will not be the first time that you have threatened to break the law you are breaking that poor girls heart yet you talk to me about breaking the law but ill do more than that if you will not give the child to its mother i will take it by force and give it back to her myself and if any man tries to prevent me no matter who he is or what he is by god ill break his teeth down his throat flinging down his ridingwhip magnus had taken a step forward and lifted his clinched fist into oscars quivering face when a cry came from the head of the staircase magnus oscar magnus magnus it was anna she ran down and put herself between the two menthe slight lithe figure and fair head of oscar and the burly form and swarthy face of magnus both panting hard and livid with rage and hate my sons my sons for shame for shame she cried every word could be heard in the bedroom and thora is crying her eyes out magnus dropped his arm and fell aside a pace or two rebuked and ashamed but oscar stood with an unflinching front where his mother had found him magnusoscar continued anna if you both love the poor girl who is lying helpless upstairs isnt that a reason why you should be friends and not enemies and then think of me my sons i am your mother surely the sons of one mother can live at peace i nursed you both when you were little ones and if there should be strife between you now and blows and perhaps bloodshed it would kill mei could never survive it then she turned toward magnus and said as well as she could for the tears that choked her magnus you mustnt be angry with oscar he is your younger brother remember you and he slept in the same bed when you were children and when he was a boy you used to carry him on your back and fight all his battles magnus groaned and turned again until he stood sideways to his mother and thinking he was not to be moved she faced about to oscar oscar she said you must make peace with magnus you must if only for thoras sake remember you have got her oscar and if it is true that magnus gave her up to you although he loved her himself think of the sacrifice he must have made for both of you perhaps he loves her still and has condemned himself to lifelong loneliness because he has lost her and perhaps he weeps his heart out for her the long nights through love that suffers like that has a great excuse oscar doesnt it give him a right to look to thoras happiness and if he thinks she is suffering for want of her little elin oscars throat was hurting him and in a husky voice he said she shall have the child back mother if the doctor says it is safe she shall have the child back immediately there said anna thats fairnothing could be fairer than that magnus come now you must shake hands with oscar she put her hand on magnuss arm but he did not move magnus she said your mothers love may be all that is left to you now but it will last long my son you need not give it up to any one and no one can take it away after all a mothers love is best it will cling to you and comfort you whatever you do and whatever the world may do to you magnus you must make friends with your brotherfor your mothers sake magnus magnus turned about and saw oscar before him with broken face and outstretched hand then his own hand swung out drew back swung out again and at the next moment the big burly fellow had flung his arms about oscars neck and was sobbing over him like a child two minutes later magnus was on his way home cracking his long whip over golden manes flying head and whooping and galloping like a madman part iv for some we loved the loveliest and the best that from his vintage rolling time hath prest have drunk their cup a round or two before and one by one crept silently to rest i the day of the proclamation of the laws was to be kept as a general holiday a hundred pack horses carrying tents and provisions had left the little capital for thingvellir the day before the danish manofwar anchored in the fiord had lent half its flags and the order of good templars had sent all their insignia it was to be a great and gorgeous spectacle before daybreak the town was astir and elderly people on slow ponies were setting out on their journey everybody was on horseback for the way was long and iceland had few roads and no coaches soon after dawn the governor started off in his cocked hat and with his inverness belted over the bright gold of his official uniform factor neilsen rode beside him and the bishop the chief justice and most of the thingmen followed in his train the idea of reviving a great ceremony of ancient days and clasping hands with the mighty dead over a gulf of a thousand years had taken hold of everybodys imagination oscar stephenson who had been the first to think of it was among the last to go he had been round to the factors house to see the child and to fetch helga the sun was reddening the sky over the eastern hills when they mounted their fleet young ponies it was a quiet morning with the promise of a radiant day helga wore her woolen helmet and a fur cape over a white jersey oscar was in riding dress with his new italian cloak hung loose from his shoulders their way out of the town lay past the end of government house under the windows of thoras bedroom and oscar stopped and called up to it helloa helloa cried oscar is it worth while to waken her said helga but the window opened and annas face appeared at it its oscar she said facing back into the room goodby thora well be back this evening there was an indistinct murmur from within and then anna said thora says goodby and you are not to hurry home on her account oscar laughed and answered well see well see and then the riders put their heels to their ponies and bounded away helga was in high spirits but the clouds hung on oscar and he tried in vain to banish them all goes well doesnt it asked helga god knows said oscar shes quiet certainly and apparently resigned yet her eyes are so dry her lips so pale and her cheeks so white and thin but what else can you expect four days after her confinement said helga true but ive never seen her quite like this before it is almost as if a wall of ice had frozen about her soul you took my advice didnt you i did and what did the governor say he said magnuss interference was an impertinence and he wouldnt hear of it for a moment so things are to remain as they are as they are said oscar and what about magnus himself asked helga magnus is at the farm but if he should come back while everybody is away he can not come back todayhis guests will keep him busy but if he should in spite of everything in that case said oscar dropping his voice and turning his head the sheriff has orders to deal with him by this time they had come to the tail of the train which had started before them and the dust and the noise of the clattering caravan were too much for helga let us go round by the hot springs and come out ahead of them she said and they went cantering down a lane to the left where vapor floated over a flowing stream half an hour later they returned to the main road forded a river and toited up a hill beyond it the cavalcade was now far behind them and the little wooden capital was a long way off with its feet in the grey fiord and the white encircling arms of the snowcovered hills stretching out to the brightening line of the sea and sky there said helga drawing rein and looking at oscar with a sparkle in her eyes poor little thora i was sorry to leave her but i dare say everything will be well said oscar sure to be said helga is that a steamer out thereout by the head asked oscar undoubtedly it is a steamer replied helga the laura is a day lateshe was due to arrive yesterday then its the laura to a certainty the sun had now risen but oscar shivered as with cold i must be a miserable coward helga for the sight of a mailship frightens me he said but helga only laughed and held up a warning hand well not talk of that today oscarnot today at all events look she cried pointing to the line of moving forms on the brown streak of road that ran through the plain of black lava look at your tribe down yonder dont you feel like mahomet going back to mecca or like jacob going up to the mount of gilead with his flocks and his herds and and his wives said oscar yes and his wives laughed helga and then both laughed together they put heels to their ponies again and helga sang to herself as they swung along what a fool i am thought oscar why should i meet misfortune before it comes and why should i trouble so much about thora isnt helga as greatly to be pitied in the wretched tangle of our fate hers is the knot that can never be untied yet how happy she looks why shouldnt i be happy helga said oscar when they slowed down again you wouldnt like to have lived in those old days i suppose certainly i should said helga what and share your husband with another woman thats nothing women do the same in these days you know and then they laughed again though with a dubious gaiety and broke into a canter once more im a brute thought oscar and badly as i have injured thora the wrong i have done to helga is still more terrible for her there is no outlook no prospect no future she must go back to denmark and i must go on with my duty but why shouldnt we have one day of happiness first one day of delight before the dream is over they drew up at a river that ran by the road to water their ponies and to take off their cloaks and pack them behind their saddles for the sun was now bright and the air was warm theres one curious point about the patriarchs said oscar and whats that asked helga clearly they thought it possible for a man to love more than one woman and cant he said helga i ask you said oscarcant a man love more than one woman why not arent we all told to love one another laughed helga and then oscar lifted her in his arms and swung her back to her saddle and they started on their journey afresh their road lay through a bleak and barren country past red hills of volcanic sand and jagged mouths of extinct volcanoes over a deep dale of lava rocks rutted with paths and scored with fissures but brightened by a farmstead here and there with its little greenroofed elt house smoking for breakfast and its hummocked homefield gleaming like a gem in a wilderness of waste at the last of these farms they stopped to rest their ponies and to refresh themselves being now halfway to thingvellir with the caravan far behind them an untidy man in his shirtsleeves took possession of their ponies and a slatternly housewife in a soiled apron brought them milk and skyr she was still young but already she had three children one of them was whimpering at her breast another was dragging at her skirts and the third was bellowing for her from the floor above she belonged to the capital and had once been considered a beauty but she was seven years married and it was six since she had seen the town there said oscar when they returned to the road thats the patriarchal life if you please then im done with it said helga ugh to think of being buried in a place like that year in year out with three children and only one man it might do for thora but give me life life life and the man who gives you that may have you body and soul perhaps said oscar body and soul laughed helga for the next hour their course lay across an almost trackless heath bare as a desert and flat as an inland sea the mountains that bounded it were stark and cold and far awayon the one side steep with running screes and on the other side clouded with steaming vapor which rose out of the glistening snow not a house was to be seen on any side not a tree or a bush or a flower or a plant and hardly a blade of grass but only a broad stretch of silver moss leaden and dull like the mold on a dead mans face no birds sang in that solitude but sometimes the wimbrel sent its long love cry across the waste sometimes the wild swan sped far overhead and uttered its eerie ululation and sometimes the raven perched on a stone and croaked out its melancholy note a line of beacons broken and old each with a projecting stone like an amputated arm showed the course of the road going on and on like soldiers in single file tramping back after a lost battle midway on the heath there was a house of rest for travelers overtaken by the storms of wintera little hut half cubicle and half stable with nothing but a plank bed and a truss of hay gracious heavens what a place to be lost in in a snowstorm said helga but what a country for saga and song said oscar and if some one could set it to music grim as its glaciers and fierce as its fires it would take the world by storm do it oscar do it and ill love you cried helga as we are commanded to love one another asked oscar perhaps laughed helga and when he swung her to the saddle again her hand slipped from his shoulder and his lips touched her cheek after that they both sang as they cantered along for the clouds that had hung over oscar had gone by this time and if the ground was grey the sky was blue and their blood was red and warm but suddenly a new scene opened at their feeta deep plain with a shining blue lake in the midst of it splashed with islands like spots on an eagles egg and fenced by soft green fells it was a dream in a desolate land a cistern of sunshine encircled by countless peaks which stood round it clothed in white like a surpliced choir that were singing their hymns to god the black lava was there as elsewhere and the valley was blistered with mounds and wrinkled with ruts and scored with fissures but the bloodroot grew in the clefts of the jagged rocks and the blueberry hung over the face of the gaping chasms and it was almost as if an angel had passed over the surface torn by earthquakes and brushed it with the bloom of his wings this was thingvellir the place of the proclamation the thingplace of the northlands the scene of a hundred sagas the subject of a thousand songs oscar and helga were now near the end of their journey and they watched for the townspeople to overtake them half an hour later the caravan came up in a cloud of dust all noisy but goodnatured and ravenous for breakfast there were some shouts at the pioneers and certain dubious compliments but oscar did not hear and helga did not heed they took their places behind the governor and went down to the lawplain in his train the way to it was through a wide chasm whose parallel walls stood up on either side of the steep causeway like the ruined street of some prehistoric city but thrice grander and more awesome than any work of the hand of man because straight from the loins of nature and rent from the womb of the earth there were great openings as of arches empty spaces as of windows broken peaks as of pediments and curious stones as of carvings all shaken from their foundations and toppling as if to fall while over them from beetling side to side hung the gay flags of the danish manofwar and through them came the bright shafts of the morning sun halfway down the gorge there was a mound like a platform the lawmount explained oscar to helga and at the foot of it there was a pool whose clear green depths looked cold and chill in the palm of the cliffs that darkened it thats the drowning pool said oscar when a woman was unfaithful to her husband they hurled her from the rocks into the water and what did they do with the unfaithful men laughed helga from the edge of the pool a frothy river fell with a thunderous clamor over a precipice to the valley below where it forked into many fingers and ran off to the margin of the lake beyond these rivulets there was the rutted plain now dotted over with tents but having only two houses within sightthe little wooden parsonage with its tiny church built of stone and shingles and the innfarm of magnus stephenson magnus himself stood waiting there washed and dressed after working the whole night through with his man john vidalin to prepare for his expected guests and when oscar rode up a little excited and confused he received him with the cheerful face of one who had made his peace with his brother and meant to keep it hows thora today asked magnus as he loosened the girths of oscars saddle and oscar answered nervously betterthat is to saywell perhaps not so very well today magnus her child has been given back to her said magnus not yet said oscar to tell you the truth the governor and then he faltered out the sequel to his broken promise magnuss face darkened and he said so the doctor has not been consulted at all no in the teeth of the governors orders it was plainly impossible and thora is still at government house and her child is still at the factors that is so magnus looked from oscar to helga who now stood beside him and his face darkened more and more john vidalin he cried in a thick voice over his shoulder to a man behind him saddle my horsei am going to reykjavik but magnus said the servantman with all this work to do today and all this money coming saddle it quick cried magnus like a man who was choking magnus said oscar for your own sake i think it only right to tell you but magnus cut him short by turning on his heel let him go said helga and before the people in the tents and the innfarm had settled down to breakfast magnus was riding back to town ii meantime thora at home was in the throes of a great temptation she had heard the peacemaking between magnus and her husband and had said to herself oscar will go to see dr olesen at once and the dear doctor will say certainly the little mother is quite well enough now to take care of her babygive the child back to her immediately then oscar would come rushing upstairs and her room would be the same as if a window had blown open and he would cry hiphiphurrah doctor says baby may come back and then anna would take him by the shoulders and turn him out and everybody would laugh but oscar was long in coming and when he came he said nothing about the doctor he only talked about their little elin and said he had just returned from seeing her she was so rosy and well and she was beginning to notice if you held out your finger she looked at it as if it were the bough of a great tree and then held it tight as if her little body hung by it i couldnt tear myself away from her thora he said its wonderful what a lot of pleasure you can get out of a baby it was strange that oscar did not see that he was hurting her every minute but she only thought i know what it ishe is going to take me by surprise he doesnt want to tell me that baby is coming until she comes he will bring her back as he took her away in the night while i am asleep and when i awake in the morning she will be there in this sweet hope thora closed her eyes early that evening before the red glow of the sunset had quite gone from the walls of her room saying a little prayer for oscar and another little prayer for elin that she might be as lovely as ever when she saw her in the morning and then she fell asleep when she awoke next day she listened for the babys breathing and thinking she heard it she stretched out a gentle hand to the place where the child should lie and then with a smile she opened her eyes but her baby was not there and the sun in the room died out when the doctor came to see her that morning he looked grave and anxious im afraid my little patient is worrying overmuch he said the head is hot and there is some fever she must lie quiet perfectly quiet for the next few days or i wont answer for what may happen only this not a word about baby and even when the doctor took anna into the nursery to give the usual instructions thora listened intently but there was not a syllable about the child the governor came next with the odor of snuff on his goldlaced coat and he stroked thoras arm as it lay on the counterpane and said she was not to worry about anything my dear little daughter must get better as fast as ever she can he said she must eat more and if she wants anything she must ask for it and she shall have it whatever it is she tried to say that all she wanted was her little baby and if they would give her that she would soon be well but her throat was hurting and she could not speak her own father came last smelling of breakfast and strong tobacco and he rallied her in a loud voice tut tut this will never do well have to send you away again with helga to look after you and look here young lady youve got to get better soon and come and carry away that baby shes turning our house upside down nobody over there can see the sun for that little mite and aunt margret and auntie helga havent a thought for anybody else by this time the conviction had forced itself upon thoras mind that the family had agreed that the child was not to be returned to her and that helga was responsible for this cruel resolution then a fierce passion took possession of her such as she had never known before she hated her sister with a terrible hatred helga who had first robbed her of her husband had now robbed her of her child and throwing dust in her peoples eyes had used her weakness as an excuse and a blind but she would defeat her she would defeat everybody she would get back her child whatever the consequences and not all the powers of earth or heaven or hell should take it away from her again the intensity of her feeling if it could have been realized by those about her would have made her sweet and gentle soul unrecognizable she was like a feline animal robbed of its young and going out to recover it all the other passions and emotions that had ever possessed herlove of her husband affection for anna and aunt margret and her father and the governor pity for magnus and tenderness toward all living thingswere burnt up by the one consuming desirethe desire for her child it made her terrible it made her cruel it made her cunning thora determined to steal back her own child the following daythe day of the proclamationwould give her an opportunity of doing so nearly everybody would then be at thingvellir therefore her path would be more clear only anna would stay at home to attend to herself and aunt margret to attend to the child her one feverish anxiety was that oscar should not stay behind as well for if oscar were to remain helga would remain also and then her scheme would come to naught thora lay awake the whole night through before daybreak she heard the people shouting in the darkness at dawn she heard the departure of the governor and when oscar called up at her window she knew that helga was with him for she heard the hoofs of two horses when everybody had gone she lay back on her pillow with a sigh of immense relief how soon will they be back mother she asked not much before midnight im afraid but you must not fret after anybody my child for everything shall be done for you said anna then the transparent young soul in the fierce fire of its temptation began to lay plans for deceiving anna and for getting her out of the way at one moment she said havent you any errands to do this morning dearin the town i meanbeing left alone you know and even the servants gone errands bless your dear heart its like sunday in town today and not a shop open anywhere said anna at another moment thora said mother if you wish to go down into the kitchen to cook you neednt think of me the cooking is all done dear said anna maria did it yesterday and ive nothing to do now but warm up the dishes on the nursery stove so i neednt leave you for a minute you see thora was beginning to be restless in her perplexity but presently she thought i know ill tell her to lie down after dinner and then ill get up and dress and go that suggested thoughts about her clothes which had been taken off on the night of her attack and packed away somewhere there would be drawers to open and search and that would take time and make noises so she said mother dear dont you think my clothes must be getting damp lying so long unused damp in five days and the middle of summer too cried anna still it would be nice to see them airingit would make me think of getting up you know then you shall sweetheart certainly you shall said anna and with the playfulness of one who indulges a child the good soul took thoras clothes out of a wardrobe held them up to her one by one and then hung them on the chairs in front of the stove in the nursery clucking and crowing of the day when thora would put them on and go downstairs with wraps and scarves and oscar helping her thora watched intently and then said i havent seen my cloak yet mother your cloak your outdoor cloak bless me what a heart she has to be sure but no no well all be dancing with delight if you need that for the next three weeks thora the hours lagged cruelly before dinner and after it the suns line on the wall was long in leaving the bed but at last three oclock struck on the bornholme clock below stairs and then thora said mother im sure you are very tiredi wish you would go to your room and rest and leave my honey alone not i said anna but i want to rest myself and i cant rest unless you are resting if you really think youll sleep better im sure i shall said thora wellseeing you slept so little last night said anna and thora began to yawn and sigh ill leave both doors open then and see thoraill put this little handbell on the table and if you awake and want mei sleep like a cat you know the least noise wakens me good night mother said thora in a drowsy tone and anna smiling and nodding to herself over thoras error stole on tiptoe out of the room thora listened for the last footfall in the corridor and then raised herself in bed she was alone at last and the time had come to defeat the conspiracy of love and kindness prompted by jealousy and envy that had robbed her of her child her child her child she must get back her child whatever it might cost her she dropped to the floor and in doing so she brushed the handbell off the table it fell to the carpet with a deadened clang and for a moment she held her breath and listened but there was no sound from annas room so she clutched at the bedclothes and stood erect then the walls went round and she knew for the first time how weak she was but her heart was strong if her limbs were feeble and she found her way to the nursery where her clothes still hung over the backs of chairs it was a weary task to put them on but her purpose never flagged at last she was dressed and looking at herself in the glass her eyes were red her lips were pale and her cheeks were sucked in and white nobody would know her who met her in the street yet still if she could find her cloak the bornholme clock chimed half past three and thora began to steal down the corridor she had to go by annas bedroom and the door was standing open annas shawl lay on a chair within and she snatched it up and wrapped it over her shoulders and her head then she went downstairs her limbs trembled under her but not from fear and if anybody had tried to stop her now she would have fought like a fiend my child is mine she thought what right have they to keep her from me the next moment she was in the street iii the bornholme clock struck four anna awoke and hearing no sound from thoras room she went back to the nursery and busied herself noiselessly at the stove presently the lace curtains in the bedroom were rustled by the wind from an open window and anna cried through the door lie quiet thoraim making tea and then she began to sing to herself in the voice of her youth a few minutes later she said that sleep must have made me stupidive actually put in the hot water before the tealeaves soon afterwards she sailed into thoras room with the tea tray in both hands and a smile on her face saying here it is but youll thank your stars when maria comes back in the morning she was setting down the tray on the round table by the bedside where the handbell should have been when her eyes fell on the empty bed her breath jumped in her throat and she turned her head slowly over her shoulder calling thora there was no answer the room was empty anna remembered the clothes which she had laid out on the chairs in the nursery they were gone thora thora she cried in an agitated whisper then the smile came back to her face i know she thought thora has dressed herself and gone down to the drawingroom just to show me what she can do at that thought the smile was chased away by a mighty frown but ill give it her she thought and downstairs she went with a determined step and banged the drawingroom door back saying really thora it is very naughty but the protest died in her throat for thora was not there then her heart shook like a leaf stiffened by hoar frost and she ran through the house from room to room crying in a voice shrill with fear and thickened by sobs thora where are you thora honey dont hide yourself from me thora thora at that moment golden mane came tolting up to the green and magnus entered the house hearing his mothers voice he ran upstairs and came face to face with anna in the corridor what has happened he asked thoras lost said anna lost she coaxed me to lie down this afternoon and while i was asleep she got up and dressed herself and she is gone let us be sure first said magnus and the slow fellow shot through the house like a torpedo while anna sat on the chair by the door of her own room and wrung her hands and reproached herself oh dear oh dear what have i done how can i ever forgive myself the poor child was not herselfshe didnt know what she was doing magnus returned with a slow step saying be quiet mother cant you see what has happened thora has gone to the child the child the factors god grant you may be right magnus but she hasnt mentioned the baby for two days nevertheless said magnus her poor heart has been torn to pieces by this accursed scheme of separating her from her child and she has gone to join it let us go and see said anna but oh dear what a thing to do and she so ill and weak it will kill her oh why did i leave her for an instant what will oscar say if oscars wise he will say nothing said magnus and if anything happens and he has any conscience hell damn himself to the last day of his life dont say that magnus said anna if there was anything wrong we were all to blame for it it wasnt oscars fault certainly it was oscars fault said magnus it was oscars fault that he allowed helga to twist him round her finger and make you all her miserable slaves where is my shawl i laid it down somewhere and now i can not find it but let us go and dont be hard on your mother magnus she was trying to do her best its not you im blaming mother said magnus but if he added and his words came through his clinched teeth if there were a law in this infernal land to punish people like oscar as sure as i live i should be the first to use it they were going out of the house when three men came up to the doorthe sheriff and two strangers good evening mrs anna said the sheriff these gentlemen are officials from copenhagen just arrived by the laura they wish to see the governor on an important matter and i thought perhaps you could tell them when he will be back from thingvellir i cant sayi dont knowi am in a great hurry said anna this young man said the sheriff to the strangers is the elder son of the governor and if you would like to speak to him we should answered the men is it so very important my son is going out with me cant the matter wait until tomorrow said anna go on ahead motherill follow you presently said magnus and while anna hurried away he led the strangers into the governors office one of the two men took a paper from an inner breast pocket and said naturally you know your fathers handwriting i do said magnus and of course you are familiar with his signature i am will you be good enough to say if this is your fathers signature said the man opening his paper and handing it to magnus it was a note of hand in favor of oscar stephenson for an advance of one hundred thousand crowns signed in the name of the governor and witnessed by the factor the world reeled round magnus for he saw in a moment what the paper meant it was almost as if his prayer to punish oscar had been answered on the instant the paper rustled in his hand and for some seconds he did not speak then he lifted his face and said you ask me if this is my fathers signature dont you think it would be more proper to ask my father himself no doubtcertainlyyou are right said the stranger but to protect your fathernot to say yourself perhaps perhaps said magnus and he handed the paper back magnus said the sheriff i was told to watch you if you came to town today but it seems to me that somebody else in your family needs watching a good deal more will you not give us your assistance magnus shuddered in the toils of his temptation a voice within cried speak denounce him nows your time his lower lip quivered his eyelids trembled and he answered in a hoarse voice the governor will not be back until midnightlet me come to you tomorrow morning good said the sheriff whereupon magnus showed them out of the house and then fled away to the factors that big fellow will speak when he wants to said one of the strangers as the three men walked down the street and when he doesnt the devil himself wont make him do so iv of two ways to the factors thora had taken the shortest and most frequented yet she had gone through the streets unobserved coming near the house she had passed the sheriff and the two strangers but they were immersed in their conversation and did not see her as she stumbled by them with her head covered up in annas shawl twice she had stopped to take breath and once she had steadied herself by a lamppost for she was dizzy and her ankles ached the little distance which had hitherto seemed so short was now a great journey but it came to an end at length and she approached her fathers house from the front she had intended to creep up softly enter by stealth listen until she learned where the child was kept watch until aunt margret left the little one alone for a moment and then steal into the room and take it with this purpose she ascended the stone steps to the front entrance and gently turned the handle but as soon as she had given the door a noiseless push there was the loud ringing of a bell which had not been there before at the next moment there was a sound of slippered feet coming hurriedly downstairs and before her dizzy brain could tell what to do aunt margret was peering into her face mercy me is it you cried aunt margret and she looked as if she were ready to drop with a crushing sense of failure thora stood silent and her heart fluttered like a captured bird good lord how did you get here alone and what on earth was anna doing to let you come said aunt margret then with a convulsive little burst thora said anna knew nothing about it aunt margretshe was asleepi came to see baby and then she broke down utterly leaned against the doorpost and cried like a child the kind soul with the sharp tongue could bear no more and so you shall dear certainly you shall my pretty poppet she said with infinite compassion as sure as my name is margret neilsen you shall she said again with stern determination they have left me here as a watchdog with an order that nobody is to come near the child but that was meant for somebody elsesomebody who was going to steal itso they saidthough what a grown man can want with a suckling infant it baffles my stupid old head to see but what a silly i am to keep you at the door come upstairs my precious go before me thora dear thats rightbut not so quickyou shall see your baby soon enough and thora darling if i havent exactly tried to take it back to you it wasnt because i didnt love you and feel for you and suffer with you my poor child but because your father and helga and even oscarno the other way thorababy is in the front bedroom is she well said thora breathing quickly as she reached the landing shes as well as well and so rosy and bonnylook said aunt margret pushing ahead of thora and opening the bedroom door but having climbed the stairs so much too rapidly thora paused at the threshold of the room and held her left hand hard against her side wait i cant go in yet she said not just yet aunt margret is she asleep yes shes fast asleep bless her is that her breathing no thats the cat yes it is the baby but come my own come said aunt margret and then holding her breath the young mother entered the room the child was sleeping in a cradle with a hood covered with light blue lace and its little head streaked with yellow hair lay red against the white pillow a cat purred on the floor in a warm shaft from the setting sun and all was sweet and peaceful my baby my baby cried thora and she sank down on her knees by the cot and stretched her arms over it like a bird covering its nest with her sheltering wings the child was awakened by the soft gale of its mothers breath on its sleeping face and it began to cry whereupon thora gathered it in her arms and lifted it out of the cot and nursed it lovingly holding its little plunging hand in her own hand so thin and white and delicate its her bottle she wants thora said aunt margret and here it is ready and waitingi keep it warm on the top of the stove let me give it her let me give it her cried thora do you think you can my pretty but of course you can my goodness its wonderfulwhen a person is a mother she can do anything with a baby an angel seems to whisper do that and she does it and its just right for the child the little creature was now sucking vigorously with its tiny face toward the mothers breast and its plump red hand on her pallid cheek but its you that wants milk my child said aunt margret yes and some spirits too and you shall have both in a minute lay your poor head against this pillow my precious and wait while i get the decanter the child was now dropping off to sleep and thora looked lovingly down at it and said god bless my motherless baby motherless indeed who says shes motherless she has too many mothers it seems to me said aunt margret the tit slipped from the childs slackening lips and thora leaned down and kissed away the drops that trickled from the little mouth i wish i could die she said i wish i could die now aunt margret and aunt margret who was snuffling audibly said die indeed just drink off this drop of brandy and water and dont talk such nonsense thora drank the brandy and straightway her weakness left her and with the return of her strength the secret purpose which had brought her to the house revived i must be quick she thought anna will follow me the innocent selfishness of her starved and injured motherhood knew no conscience and she set herself to consider how she could get rid of aunt margret and so carry away the child that was a perplexing problem and she sat long to think it out but accident solved it at last goodness me aunt margret was saying how lovely you look sitting there with the child but what a fit some people would have if they could drop in and see you they cant thank goodness theyre thirty miles away and before they get back youll be gone and nobody a penny the wiser when the cats away the mice will play but mercy me what a storm there would be if they ever came to know that i had let you touch the little angel i dont know which is the worst on that subjectyour father or oscar or helga i think helga is the worst if you ask me youre a neilsen thora but helgashes a sheep from another sheepfold shes so cute and she has such ways with her it was helga who put those bells on the door and when i heard you coming in i thought its that sheriff again but you could have knocked me down with a feathergood gracious aunt margret who was looking out of the window suddenly threw up her hands what is it said thora it isnoyes its anna and the sheriff and two officers are coming behind her theyre coming for me cried thora they want to tear me away from my baby go down and stop them aunt margret say im not heresay im gonesay anything hush dear dont excite yourself leave margret neilsen to manage this little matter ill take anna and the sheriff into the back parlor and tell them something then youll slip out by the front and get back home and nobody will know yes yes that will do said thora youll be as quiet as a mouse and ill make lots of noises yes yes yes there was the clang of a bell from below and aunt margret whispered there they are now put baby back in the cot my own and cover her up with the blanket not yet let me kiss her again just for the last time said thora an agitated voice came from the bottom of the stairs margret margret neilsen i must gobe quick whispered aunt margret and scuttling downstairs she cried im coming and then there was a rumble of confused voices followed by the closing of a door thora was alone once more and the feverish strength of outraged motherhood possessed her like a madness theyve come to take my child again she thought in a moment she had slipped off her slippers snatched up the blanket and wrapped it about the sleeping infant crept down the stairs in stocking feet and out of the house by a back passage v meantime a little tragicomedy was being acted in the back parlor anna was white and trembling while aunt margret was looking wondrous wise and subtle thora gasped anna have you seen anything of thora have i seen anything of thora you must be dreaming anna dear then she has gone and i was right after all said anna can it be possible said aunt margret magnus would have it that she had gone to see the baby but she has gone farther than that poor child and we shall never see her again what a pity said aunt margret and then anna flew out at her margret neilsen dont you understand what i am saying the poor child was demented and she stole out while i was asleep and goodness knows what she has done with herself hush hold your tongue anna and come into this room and ill tell you something magnus was right after all then she has been here shes here nowshes upstairs this very minute oh thank the lord dont speak or the poor thing will hear you and dont be angry with her either and if you brought the sheriff to take her back i brought the sheriff what are you saying you crazy woman then cant we let her stay a little longer it isnt every day she has the chance she can stay all night for me margret that is impossiblethe factor is so frightened and then theres the governor thats true said anna but she can safely stay an hour more with her child cant she said aunt margret just one hour more said anna poor thing she was to steal out while we were talking but well go up and surprise her and when you see her with the little mite at her breast looking down at it and kissing it with such a pitiful smile the dear it will fill your heart brimful but for goodness sake wipe your eyes and blow your nose anna and do for mercys sake look more cheerful quietly now quietly or shell think the sheriff is behind us with that the two old things snuffling as if they had colds in the head but struggling to smile and seem happy went creeping up to the bedroom by that time the room was empty and thora was gone the women looked at each other for an instant and then aunt margret ran to the cradle the child was gone too at that moment the bell of the front door rang again aunt margret cried there she is and the two women raced downstairs to see it was magnus coming in thora has been here but she has gonegone this very minute cried anna and she has taken the child along with her cried aunt margret without a word magnus turned about and leapt back to the street there he met the sheriff and told him what had happened at the next minute the two women were running hither and thither and the two men were gone different ways half an hour afterward they met at the factors house again thora and the child had not been found they had disappeared as utterly as if a lava stream had swallowed them the women were sitting side by side with blanched faces and startled eyes twisting their handkerchiefs into knots the doctor was quite right after all said anna they were all right though we thought them so hard and cruel the poor thing wanted to dieshe told me so herself she told me tooshe told me this very day said aunt margret is there no house in town she was accustomed to go to asked the sheriff none said anna and aunt margret said thora was not like thatshe would never drink coffee or talk scandal with any one let us try again said magnus to the sheriff the sun had set over the fiord and the black rocks of the plain were dying out in the dusky haze of evening when the two men returned to the factors for the second time their search had been fruitless and magnuss face was white and haggard anna and aunt margret sat in the parlor window stricken with grief but finding a certain satisfaction in their affliction from the melancholy glances of groups of other women who had gathered in the street i knew it would be useless said anna shes gone poor dearim afraid shes gone to heaven poor darling and taken the little innocent infant along with her said aunt margret has anybody thought of going back to government house asked the sheriff i went there first said magnus and to the lake i went there next and the jetty i went to the jetty also but i dont believe thora has destroyed herself said magnus then she has died of exhaustion by this time and its all the same in any case said anna shes in her stocking feet toosee said aunt margret showing the slippers which thora had left upstairs and falling to kissing and weeping over them theres one chance leftshe may have tried to follow her husband said magnus so far and without a horse said the sheriff its the last hopeim going to follow it up said magnus mother he added you had better go back home i canti darentand if anything happens ill never be able to go into the poor girls room again said anna outside in the fading light magnus stood for a moment wiping the flanks of golden mane and patting his drooping neck i suppose there isnt another horse left in the town said the sheriff but youll kill your splendid pony then hell die well said magnus magnus the sheriff continued i intend to search every house in reykjavik and if i succeed tonight ill expect you to help us in the morning if you dont succeed ill help you said magnus with a hoarse laugh and at the next moment he was lost in the darkness vi thora had done the most natural and therefore the most unexpected thing only thinking of getting back to her bed in government house and of carrying the child along with her she had taken the simplest means toward doing so in order to escape the sheriff she had left her fathers house by the back and to avoid observation from people in the frequented thoroughfare she had taken the longer and quieter of the two roads home this road led her past the lake but she had no desire to destroy herself often before she had longed for death from the depths of her heart but love for her child conquered all such feelings now the way was very long but she did not know that she was tired the roads were rough but she did not feel that they were cutting her feet she was going fast but she did not realize that she was breathless she had only one fearthe fear of being overtaken only one dreadthe dread of the child being torn away from her clinging to the little one with feverish arms she hastened along weeping to herself laughing to herself full of a wild joy that had no remorse no qualms of any kind and neither looked before nor after it was motherhoodthe most divine the most devilish the most tender the most terrible the most sweet the most sublime the most savage of all the passions of the heart reaching home at last she found the house silent but every room wide open as if lately ringing with the noise of hurrying feet creeping upstairs with her precious burden she got safely back to her room and instantly locked the door behind her she laughed as she did so thinking how anna and aunt margret would follow her and find themselves defeated then she undressed and got back into bed and for one long heavenly hour she gave herself up to the delight of having her childto hold it to nurse it to fondle it to kiss it and to devour it with all her senses the little creature had slept during its journey through the town but now it awoke and lay quiet by its mothers side while she ran her hungry hands over its tiny body and put its clinched fists and its feet one by one into her mouth after a while the child tired and began to cry whereupon thora remembered for the first time that she had left its feedingbottle behind her she tried to hush it but it would not be hushed and then a sudden thought a blind impulse of maternity came to her and she put the little one to her breast the child clung to it and was quiet and the milk which had never come until now instantly began to flow it was the crowning miracle of that joyous hour a physical rapture such as thora had never known before after that a more tender spirit stole over her and she looked lovingly down at the child in her bosom and kissed it again and again and said god bless my baby then in a voice so weak and silvery that it was like a voice descending from the sky she began to sing the child to sleep sleep baby sleep angela bright thy slumbers keep sleep baby sleep the child slept and even while she sang thora became aware of alternate waves of heat and cold going over her a vague broken delirious consciousness came and went and people seemed to be entering and leaving the room first it was helga then it was oscar and finally it was magnus helga was taking the child out of the bed and oscar was helping her and she was trying to cry out and could not when magnus appeared in the doorway at one moment she thought she was dead and people were talking around her they were all strangers chiefly women whom she had seen going into the salvation shelter shes gone poor girl said some one and somebody else said so much the betterthe poor things troubles are over they say she tried to make away with herself said one and what wonder said another there was no place left for her in this world nobody can say she didnt love her husband said a voice at her feet that was the pityhe loved her sister said a voice above her perhaps that was why she thought of taking her lifeto leave him freeperhaps to make him happy well she did wrong by magnus but we all know who killed her and then everybody said in chorus hell get his reward hell get his reward and she was sorry for oscar at another moment she thought she was a blessed saint in paradise with lilies and roses around her head but there was a thorn in her heart for all that and even among the joys of heaven she had a dull pain there was no ease for because she could not help thinking about her baby so she asked the dear god to let her go down to earth to see her little elin and he suffered her to come and she came oscar and helga were together now in a country that was sweet with smiling gardens and a house that was full of gilded furniture but she could not see her elin anywhere until at length she found her in an upper room neglected and lonely then the burning tears ran down her face and she sat by her child and comforted her and elin was not afraid stay with me a little longer said the child and she stayed with her and sang to her and no one heard but little elin sleep baby sleep angels bright thy slumbers keep sleep baby sleep when she came to herself again it was dark in the bedroom yet she was still singing the baby began to cry and she wished to comfort it but she found she could not speak its little body felt cold against her breast and she wanted to cover it up in the blanket but her arms were heavy and she could not lift them there was a moment of agonized consciousness but the good father sealed the senses of his suffering child again she thought a majestic figure entered the room clothed all in white and lifted the baby out of her bosom saying suffer little children to come unto me she knew quite well who it was but when she looked a second time the figure had the face of magnus then it seemed to her that it was she herself and not the baby that had been lifted up yet she felt no fear at all nor any pain nor any heartache at that moment the women who had stood about the bed came back and they began to sing safe in the arms of jesusjust as she had heard them singing it when she listened at the door of the shelter she smiled and drew a deep sigh a sweet long breath of joy and rapture and then the darkness lifted andit was day vii that day had been a prolonged triumph for oscar the festival of the proclamation began with service in the parish church and though the governor and the thingmen only had been able to pack into the little place the churchyard outside and the homefield of the parsonage had been thronged after the service there was a procession from the church door to the ancient place of proclamation and oscar had ordered and marshaled every one first the town band then the governor and his executive in their goldbraided uniforms the bishop in his robes the thingmen in their scarfs the clergy in their black cassocks and white ruffs and finally a vast following of the people it was a gorgeous spectacle such as no man could remember to have seen on that spot before the proclamation itself was an imposing ceremony sitting on the lawmount as on a natural platform of lava rock with his face to the east and the cross of dannebrog on his breast the governor read out one by one the titles and descriptions of the acts which had been passed by parliament and after each of them he lifted his head and cried to the people on the plains below is it yea or nay and then the people led by oscar shouted yea when the reading was finished the governor cried long live the king whereupon oscar led the cheering three times three and when the band struck up the national hymn he started the words of the chorus but the last feature of the function was the best and that was the singing of the hymn composed by oscar himself it was a hymn to iceland the cradle of the vikings the scene of the sagas the parent of parliaments the mother of the mighty northlands standing under the brant face of the lawmount with his choir of one hundred and fifty on the sloping ground in front oscar conducted with great vigor his prelude pleased the people but when he rose to the height of his argument and struck the patriotic note his love for the stern old northland isafold my isafold great land of frost and fire his hearers were carried away and some of them shouted and wept after the hymn was over the thingmen crowded about oscar to congratulate him and some of the countrypeople fell upon his neck the governor too sitting above was the object of many congratulations but this is genius said one an inspiration said another our oscar will be a great musician some day said a third and the old man took the tributes quietly almost silently but with the shining face of a father proud of his favorite son when the ceremonies ended only one name was on everybodys lips and that was the name of oscar stephenson and hundreds hummed the strains of isafold my isafold as they trooped off to dinner oscar and helga dined together at the innfarm in a corner of the hall which was thronged with guests but they were both too much excited to remain in mixed company and after dinner they escaped to the margin of the lake and to the solitary parts of the plain there they gathered blueberries and partly to restrain their excitement and partly to nourish it they talked of nothing but the wild flowers when the sun began to sink they returned by way of the parsonage where the governor with the factor the bishop and certain other officials had taken their dinner apart the little guest room was dense with smoke like the mouth of a geyser and the faces that came and went in it were discussing the merits and defects of the old order and the new both governor and factor were for the old as exemplified by the days ceremony and oscars hymn but others held that changing times brought changing needs and that iceland would be the better for a new constitution with free trade and modern methods theyll go on till midnight and never get home tonight whispered helga as she slipped out with oscar on returning to the farm they found people striking tents and leading horses from the crowded horsefold to prepare for the return journey im afraid im too tired to go back tonight said helga then staystay by all means said oscar and you asked helga i must go home in any casetheres thora said oscar your mother will look after her said helga but oscar shook his head and ordered gudrun the housekeeper to make one of the two guestrooms ready for helga at that moment some young townspeople were clearing the floor for a dance and they called on oscar and helga to lead off with a waltz they did so with great delight and when the waltz was finished they joined the round dance which followed it and then they danced a second and a third waltz until they were flushed and hot and had to go out to cool by this time it was dark and the people who meant to encamp for the night had lighted fires at the mouths of their tents and were beguiling the hours with various pleasures one of these was fortunetelling an old woman not thought to be overwise was going from tent to tent making random shots amid shrieks of laughter and what do you see here said helga holding out her hand ah this is a good hand said the witch you are going to be a great lady and eat mutton and beef every day and drink golden wine and ginger and what do you see in this asked oscar this oh dear oh dear said the witch whats amiss mother cold water runs between my skin and my flesh is it as bad as that old lady dont ask medont ask me you have a brother havent you and if i have what about him bewarebeware said the witch and oscar and helga turned away laughing the moon rose and they wandered into the great chasm and walked among the shadows of the toppling stones until they came under a huge stone called stoker which stands like a mighty gravestone over a deep pit that is like a tomb there they sat with the white moon above and the red camp fires below them and then the boiling bubbling geyser of excitement in their breasts could be kept down no longer you have had a great success today oscar said helga so have you helga so have you for without your presence to prompt and inspire me i should have done nothing i am happy if i have helped you oscar but you must go on now and never look backnever you are right helga you are rightto stop would be a sinan unpardonable sinalmost like a sin against the holy ghost exactly like it oscar for if any one has a gift he gets it from god and to bury it like the man in the parable there would be no fear of that if i could have you beside me always helga and cant you oscar a fragrance seemed to envelop him he felt helgas breath upon his face it made him tremble all over would to god i could but it is impossible you will return to denmark not i indeed i am not without my own ambitious also i must go back to england to france to germany to italy and so must you oscaryou must if you are to be true to your talents and to yourself and to the great future i know it helga i feel it and if i could write even one song that would stir the souls of millions it would be better than making a fortune or passing an act of parliament but when a man has given hostages to fortune and they are dragging him downwith silken threads perhapsbut still down down down he was speaking out of a dry and husky throat but she answered softly and sweetly are things so absolutely irretrievable oscar absolutely helga absolutely and henceforth and all my life long i must learn to go without your comradeship and what must i do the compulsion of passion was driving him on but he was struggling to hold back helga he cried do you know what is the deadliest thing in life it is love the painters paint love as a harmless little cupid with a handkerchief about his eyes and a tiny bow and arrow in his hands but love is a great blind blundering monster with a twoedged sword dealing destruction on every side his words were as nothing but his quivering voice sang like music in helgas ears and she said is it love or man that does that oscarman with the false sense of right and wrong his foolish ideals of honor god knows perhaps if i could have thought so a year ago before i added injury to injury and brought unhappiness on othersbut nownow a sensation of triumph came to her and she said isnt it cowardly to talk like that oscar i am a coward helga he answered trembling from head to foot to you i can speak the truthi am a coward a moral coward and i can not face the certainty but if said helga excitedly getting closer you had some one beside you who had the courage of life the defiance of life helga cried oscar breathing heavilythe earth seemed to be slipping under him like an avalanche some one who would go on helping you and ask nothing but your comradeship helga helga he was gasping as for breath in the intoxication of his emotion nothing but to work with you and to conquer the world with you helga helga helga oscar there was a breathless cry from both and then an almost inaudible whisper i shall not go back tonight helga when they came to themselves again they were returningmore flushed and excited than beforeout of the white moonlight into the yellow mist of the smoking lamp that hung over the dancers in the hall the young townspeople received them with a shout and called on them to join the dance they were dancing it was called weaving the cloth and the figures were intended to represent the spinning and carding the weaving stretching hammering and rolling of the thick icelandic vadmal the dancers crossed and recrossed twisted each other about beat each other breast against breast and finally rolled each other round and round the music was going fast and the dancers were singing loud and laughing louder when there came from outside the sudden barking of dogs followed by the clatter of the hoofs of a galloping horse immediately afterward there was the rattle of the metal end of a ridingwhip against a windowpane and a voice crying god be with you the newcomer did not wait for the customary answer to his salutation but pushed the door open and entered hurriedly it was magnus dusty and dirty with a white face and wild eyes at that moment oscar and helga blushing and smiling were in the middle of the floor locked in each others arms performing the last figure of the dance and it was thus that magnus came face to face with them is she here he cried she thora she is losti thought she might have found a horse and followed you then the shuffling feet stopped and the fiddles tailed off into silence as magnus in broken sentences told the story of thoras flight to the factors her disappearance with the child and the vain search that had been made for her but surely she would go back to government house eventually said oscar the poor girl would go the long way round to escape observation and home by way of the lake did nobody think of that and stay in the house to see magnus looked like a man whose eyes dulled by groping in a dark tunnel had been stunned by sudden light before the others had recovered themselves he had turned about and was gone at the next moment oscar was tramping to and fro on the floor with his clinched fists to his forehead moaning my god my god helga was combing her hair and putting on her wraps viii john the servant at the farm was sent over to the parsonage to tell the governor and the factor he found the gentlemen settling themselves for the night having talked so long that they had decided to remain until morning but the news of thoras disappearance altered everything we must go back immediately said the governor bring the horses round instantly said the factor less than half an hour afterward a silent and gloomy company were going homethe governor the factor oscar helga and a various following of the sympathetic and the inquisitive the two old friends were morose and illtempered and for the first time in fifty years disposed to nag and quarrel the governor blamed aunt margret the factor blamed anna the governor blamed helga the factor blamed oscar the governor blamed the factor and the factor blamed the governor in the half light of uncertainty and suspense their friendship fell before fear and blood was thicker than water it was a miserable homegoing to oscar the explanation of thoras movements with which he had surprised magnus soon ceased to satisfy himself and he thought of a hundred fatal consequences helga tried to comfort him with various plausible arguments he had acted for the bestthe best for thora the best for the child the best for himself the best for everybodyand if accident had intervened or the dreadful freaks of dementia had followed he was not responsible and could not be blamed but oscars worst sufferings were from a secret purgatory which helgas pleadings did not touch for the cruelest part of his remorse concerned helga herself the journey was long and tiresome and every step had its own peculiar misery during the first hour the moon was shininga brilliant moon that bathed everything in lovelinessand oscar remembered the scene in the chasm and reflected that in the very hour of his delirious happiness thora perhaps was lying dead then the moon died out and darkness fella murky darkness blacker than the lavaand as oscar pushed and plunged along over the stumbles of his pony the thought came to him that if thora were dead perhaps it was the best that could have happened to herthe best under the circumstancessaving her from the bitterness of a future which must surely come when helga and he struggle as they might would have to break the bonds that bound them and then in that dark and treacherous hour with no face to look into his face he felt an immense relief remembering that if thora was gone the consequences of his lifes error were at an end and he was free but the dawn camea bleared rainy dawn with scarfs of vapor stretching across the sun like a cataract over a bloodshot eyeand oscars remorse was doubled by the wounds he had inflicted upon his conscience in the darkness and he dare not look at helga as she rode muffled up and silent by his side they were crossing the moss fell heath by this time and everything around was dark and drear a solitary raven kept them cheerless company for a while flying from beacon to beacon and uttering its husky cry oscar remembered the scenes of yesterday when the sky was blue and their blood was warm and then the thought came to himlike the shooting of the bolt on a man buried in a tombthat if he was not to be henceforward the most miserable of men he must pray with all his soul and strength that when they reached the end of their journey thora should be alive on reaching the more inhabited districts oscar allowed the governor and the factor to forge on ahead and helga to wait for him in the road while he glanced off to the farmhouses and shouted up at the bedroom windows but the result was always the samethora had not been seen and magnus had been there before him when they came to the top of the hill from which they had looked back on reykjavik and on the danish mailsteamer entering the fiord the little capital floated in the mist of morning like a city in a woolly sea and the laura lay anchored outside of it but the apprehensions of yesterday were consumed by the fears of today and oscar thought of one thing alone they met farmers trotting out of the town on their little caravans of ponies yet oscar did not question them lest he should hear the news he dare not listen to and coming at length to the long street of the little capital he did not raise his face to the eyes that peered at him through the curtains of upper windows lest they should reveal the truth he dared not learn the fear of disaster had by this time swallowed up any flicker of hope in oscar and when coming up to government house he found a crowd of people standing in front of it he knew too well that all was over from that moment onward fact after fact led up to the fatal certainty the window of thoras bedroomthe window at which oscar had shouted his adieus the day beforestood open and a ladder had been raised against it by the gate to the green a horse lay dead on the gravelit was magnuss horse his magnificent golden manecovered with dust and sweat as it fell under its rider at the last step of his fearful journey in the middle of the hall anna and aunt margret stood with the governor and the factor sobbing out their pitiful explanations afraid to return to the empty house which had been the scene of a painful memory anna had sat the night through with margret at the factors waiting hour after hour for the reports of the sheriff and his constables nothing had been heard of thora but in the early morning magnus had returned and found the door of her room locked on the inside then he had run for them and they had called to thora but received no answer though sometimes they heard the baby crying and now magnus having failed to force the door had gone for a ladder and he intended to climb into the room from the outside oscar was conscious of no more until he found himself knocking at thoras door and calling in his agony thora thora thora there was a heavy staggering step inside the room the lock was thrust back and the door thrown open thora cried oscar again but it was magnus who stood before himmagnus with a face white and set and full of anger and hatred you were right he said pointing to the bed there she is with godand you thora lay high on the pillow with her eyes open and her parted lips smiling as if she had just awakened from a beautiful dream she was dead but her baby was alive and it was rolling its little round head and digging its red hand into her cold white breast with a low choking cry oscar fell to his knees at the bedside and buried his face in the bedclothes magnus left the room the others entered it and aunt margret lifted the living child out of the mothers breast over the fathers kneeling form ix during the few days before the funeral the government house felt motionless and empty like a room when the clock has stopped in it behind the drawn blinds everybody talked in whispers as if the dead were asleep and must not be wakened the stillness of the house centered in the room where thora lay and that was white and fresh with the odor of clean linen and wild flowers in the deadened sunshine as it filtered through the yellow blinds there was a halo about the waxen face on the bed and it seemed to diffuse solemnity on all around it anna never allowed herself to be long away from this chamber her fear of the room had gone now that death had entered it early and late in daylight and dark she went to and fro in the silent place walking softly and seeming to count the hours during which her dear girl would be above ground the governor did nothing from the day of thoras death until the day of her burial dressed always in his official uniform he sat in his bureau but received no one he wrote no letters and read no books and seldom spoke at his meals for hours together he would sit with folded arms looking fixedly at the pattern on the carpet a shadow had fallen on hima shadow of shameand in the sealed chamber of his proud soul he was struggling to reconcile his conduct to himself and finding it difficult to do so the factor went on with his work as usual for in the decalogue of his duty there was no maxim that forbade business but sometimes as he turned the leaves of his ledger he looked long and saw nothing and once as he counted up the figures in his bankbook the thought smote him with the force of a blow on the brain that perhaps nature was beginning to strike a balance with him against the sum of his successors and that the cruel bereavement which had just befallen him was the first stroke of the nemesis which was to follow in the wake of his wealth aunt margret and helga were always at home the one busy with the baby which had been taken back to the factors and the other with the black which had to be ordered for everybody little was known of magnus except that he was still in town that he had been seen with the sheriff and two strangers that in spite of the trouble which had overtaken his family he was spending most of his time in the dark smokingroom of the hotel and that he was said to be drinking heavily but the grief of oscar touched and satisfied everybody he had eaten little and had never been known to sleep sometimes he was seen to be sitting apart and weeping silently sometimes he was moving from room to room as if every spot on which his eye could rest was charged with the memory of happy days that were dead sometimes he was heard in the white room in which thora laythe room in which she had been so merry and so sad so wild with delirium and so happy with her babyand there he was sobbing out his wild regrets in muffled cries of forgive me forgive me once in the middle of the night he was heard at the harmonium in the room below the death chamber playing softly a pitiful lament which awakened his father and mother and brought the salt tears to their eyes the desolate soul in these ghastly hours was prostrating itself in the dust death strikes sternly and oscar in his penitence was accusing himself of every crime he had killed thoranot her body only but her heart that faithful heart which had loved him so deeply so tenderly so passionately in this consciencestricken condition he looked back on the path of his life with thora and every step as he now saw it seemed to be thick set with the stubble of sin and rank with the weeds of selfdeception when he returned from england he had taken thora from magnus although he did not love her it was true he had thought he loved her but the brotherly thing would have been to stand back in silence and if he had only done so time itself would have undeceived him that was the first of his offenses and the next was no less hideous when being betrothed to thora he awoke to the certainty that his heart was with helga he had gone on with his bargain and led the girl who loved him into a loveless marriage it was true he thought he was doing his duty but behind duty was fear fear of the world and fear of magnus while the courageous thing the manly thing even the merciful thing would have been to stop at the church door if need be and face the facts and take the consequences but having cheated thora of her love and lied to her at the altar he had crowned the sum of his sins by exposing himself to the temptation of infidelity it was true that thora herself in her innocent affection had paved the way to this temptation true too that his marriage had been an imperfect partnership but all the same his course had been clear and he should have cut himself off from helga at once and for ever that he had not done so that he had paltered with temptation was the last cause of this terrible calamity thora had died because her heart was dead and he himself had killed it thus the desolate soul of the unhappy man laid down its faults at the feet of god hiding nothing palliating nothing and seeing everything in naked light if to be sorry for having sinned is to be innocent oscar had ceased to be guilty in his pitiful but useless sorrow in the dizzy hours of pain and shame when the wheel of life goes rapidly oscar asked himself how it had come to pass that thora was dead and something whispered helga and again and yet again something whispered helga but his heart would not listen to that excuse helga had not been to blame he alone had been at fault he had sacrificed thora to his ambitious dreamshis dreams of greatness of glory helga had been merely the symbol of those dreams and thora was dead because he had tried to become a great musician but the past was past and when oscar asked himself what punishment he could impose upon himself for the future he heard but one answer if his ambitions had been the cause of his sin to bury them would be the true expression of his repentance he would bury them he would bury his genius and the expectation of becoming a composer in the grave of the sweet girl he had destroyed and go through the rest of his life in the drudgery of the nearest duty eating the bread of affliction in obscurity and remorse when oscar first attempted to carry out this resolution it was in a scene of such tragic beauty that no one who witnessed it could ever afterward wipe it out of mind the family had gathered for that last office of love which makes perhaps the saddest moment of human experiencesadder than the moment of turning away from the newly covered grave sadder even that the moment of returning to the void and empty homethe moment when the coffinlid is closed down and the beloved face disappears for ever the death chamber was the same that in a better time had been the bridal chamber but the air which had tingled with all exquisite thoughts of life was now heavy with the hush of death it was nighttime and the same lamp burned under the same shade while a giltedged prayerbook lay in a circle of lighted candles on the little table that stood by the bed besides the members of the family only two persons were presentone of the sewingmaids who had made the weddingdress for the cathedral and had just put the last stitch to the garment intended for a darker house and a joiner in his shirtsleeves one by one the family approached the bed to take their last look at the burden that lay on itthe governor with a solemn tread as if he had been approaching the presence of a king the factor with rigid strides and a bewildered stare and helga with a nervous step and a furtive glance as if duty had called her and she wished herself away but anna and aunt margret moved about the body without dread or ceremony laying flowers on the bosom and smoothing the soft hair that was dressed down the cheek as if the dear dead belonged to them by right of nature and they would give it up to no one until earth herself the mother of us all should claim it for her own the man in the shirtsleeves had stepped forward to finish his task when the governor held up his hand wait where is oscar he asked and then maria the old housemaid who had been weeping noiselessly outside the door was sent to fetch him while maria was away aunt margret went up to thora and whispered over her my precious precious pet you never changed to your stupid old auntie did younot even when she kept your dear baby away from you and your sweet heart was broken dont think she didnt love you for all that my precious she loved you every minute my own and now that she has got your baby she intends to keep it she will keep it as long as she lives so dont you ever be troubled about that thora aunt margret is going to be a mother to your little girl and nobody in the world shall ever touch a hair of your darlings head it was at this moment that oscar entered the room with old maria creeping up behind him his pale cheeks and sunken eyes testified to the strength of his remorse but his step was firm and his whole figure showed intense vitality of will he carried a bundle of papers in one hand and they were loose and irregular as if they had been snatched up hurriedly at the moment he was called in the utter absorption of his mood he seemed to be unconscious of anybody or anything in the room except one thingthe thing that lay upon the bedand walking up to it he looked down at the white face and spoke to it as if the deadand the dead alonecould hear thora he said in a calm voice these are the only copies of my compositions and i wish you to take them with you they were written in hours when your faithful heart was suffering through my faultwhen i neglected you and deserted you for the sake of my foolish visions of art and greatness that was the real cause of your death thora and in punishment of myself for sacrificing your sweet life to my selfish dreams i wish to bury the fruits of them in your grave take them then and let them lie with you and fade with you and be forgotten i will never write another note of music as long as i live and from this hour onward my ambitions are at an end saying this he put the papers beside the body of thora and wrapped them in the long plaits of her beautiful hair oscar oscar cried helga in breathless horror the others listened and looked on hardly realizing what oscar had resigned but helga realized it and she was trying to warn him against the lifelong sacrifice but he did not seem to hear her and at such a moment further remonstrance was impossible my sweet girl said oscar stretching both arms over the bed forgive me for all my failures of duty oh what i would give to forget them now but i cant i cant you are gone and i can never make amends thinking to put an end to a scene which was touching everybody too deeply the governor signed to the man in the shirtsleeves but when the man stepped forward oscars grief broke out afresh and in the vehemence of his sorrow his tongue lost all control of itself not yet he cried oh god thora my wife my sweet young wife let me look at her face again how bright and happy it used to be and now it is leaving me like this forgive me my angel say you forgive me before you go i can not live without your forgiveness i wronged you and sinned against you but you were good and your childlike heart was from god the desolate cry rang through the room and each of those who heard the revelation of the naked soul read it by the light of his own helga trembled and turned to the window the governor and the factor dropped their heads but aunt margret cried openly in innocent sympathy and anna touched oscars arm and tried to comfort him after a moment oscar became more calm and even signed to the man himself and when all was over he walked firmly and courageously out of the room x on the day of the funeral oscar was weak and ill and more fit for his bed than for a journey to the cemetery but no one could prevail on him not to go the morning was dull and drear with black clouds from the mountains and some sprinklings of rain and when the dread hour struck and oscar came down among the mourners his face looked ghastly in the void and heavy air the bell in the cathedral tower began to toll the solemn burden was borne slowly down the stairs and then oscars white face became yet more white and he would have fallen but for his fathers arm which held him up the body was first rested on the green outside the door and while the mourners grouped themselves round in a wide halfcircle to sing a parting hymn oscar stood bareheaded in the drizzling rain which had begun to fall john the servant stood at the gate holding silvertop thoras pony which he had brought from the farm to carry her on her last journey and the sight of this horse seemed to be more than oscar could bear the coffin was laid crosswise on the panniers and the procession began to form it passed through deep lines of the townspeople oscar walking first after the body alone bareheaded and conscious of nothing but his grief the bell was still tolling and a sabbath quiet had fallen over the town the cathedral was crowded with the same faces that had looked on at thoras wedding when she came down from the altar in her bloom and beauty happy and smiling on her husbands arm and now that she was being carried up to it while the organ played the funeral march and oscar walked with drooping head behind the people nearest the aisle said he was weeping audibly the coffin in its pall was set down on the steps to the communion railthe spot where thora had knelt as a young girl to be confirmed and as a bride to be marriedand then the bishop who had been waiting to receive it delivered a consolatory address they should not ask themselves why this sweet and lovely life had been so ruthlessly cut off the ways of providence were inscrutable but god was in heaven and the judge of all the earth did right neither should the family who were there to mourn take blame to themselves for what had occurred for if it had pleased the almighty to lay his hand on the afflicted brain of their dear departed sister he knew best why he did so and to what end it was done rather let them kneel in gratitude to god that in his mercy he had not suffered her to lift her hand against herself and so rob them of the blessed hope of eternal life to the young husband who is here plunged in sorrow said the bishop what can we say but that all our hearts go out to him it seems only yesterday that he stood on this spot to make his vows before heaven and before men to love and cherish the dear girl who has been so suddenly taken away if she had lived he would have kept his promises and though she is gone he will preserve the spirit of them still the pure and innocent soul who linked her life with his life will be an abiding memory a perpetual inspiration against sin and when the first pangs of grief are over a constant solace and a lasting joy if it was possible for oscar to look more wan and weak than when he went into the cathedral he did so when he came out of it the rain was now falling heavily but when the procession was formed again for the last stage of the journey he walked bareheaded as before the factor who was behind oscar with helga quivering on his arm begged him to put on his hat but he refused and when the governor who came next with anna passed up an umbrella he shook his head and sent it back the bell tolled again the little town sat quiet and the townspeople who wept floods of tears for thora wept for oscar even more when the procession reached the cemetery the rain was coming down in torrents and even the priest put an overcoat over his cassock but oscar stood uncovered by the open grave during the short prayerdust to dusthe suffered visibly and during the long hymn that is always sung at an icelandic funeral while the grave is being filled in the hollow thuds of the falling earth seemed to beat upon his twitching face when all was at an end he could not be drawn away until his father took him by the arm and said in a firm voice come then with a stronger step he walked with a remnant of the broken procession across the little cemeterythe hummocked homefield of the deadthrough the gate to the roadwhere hans the watercarrier in the sleeveless waistcoat thora had made for him was giving water to her horsepast the factors housewhere aunt margret watched at a window with the baby in her armsand thus back to his empty home at the foot of the stairs he excused himself when the mourners went in to their meal and he was seen no more that day the dinner was a cheerless thing being served in the room that had witnessed the homecoming and so chilled with memories of that happier event silently or in whispers the mourners bade their adieus and crept away one by one leaving the few remaining members of the two families with wide spaces between them at the table like gaps in a toothless skull the governor and the factor had not spoken since their return from the proclamation and the interval of silence had made the rift between the two old friends grow wide ah well yawned the factor its all over i suppose then he turned to the governor and asked sharply where is magnus ive seen nothing of him today the governor did not answer and anna dropped her head and then helga who was the only other person present said quietly somebody saw him at the hotelhe did right not to come to the funeralthey say he was not quite sober just like him said the factor a yell is all you hear of a wolf and but for his last drinking bout perhaps nothing of this would have happened the governors proud face quivered but he did not speak and soon afterward the factor and helga went away xi early next morning before the household was astir the governor was in his bureau ready to begin on the arrears of business when somebody knocked at the door it was magnus white and worn but sober and serious as a judge may i speak to you sir said magnus wellperhaps for a momentcome in said the governor it occurred to the governor as magnus entered the bureau that he had come for money to help him with the farm and he said immediately if you have come for financial assistance toward stock and seed and what not i ought to tell you at once magnus that i have nothing to give you i have already spent as much on the farm as i am justified in spendingmore perhaps than i ought to have spent on the inheritance of one of my sons in justice to the claims of the other oneand if it is moneyready money i do not come to ask for money said magnus but i come to speak about it he added and then he sat on a low seat and twisted his felt hat between his knees while the governor leaned back in his deskchair and fingered a pen i wish to ask said magnus whether you drew about six months ago a bill on the bank of denmark for one hundred thousand crowns the governor uttered a contemptuous snort and said certainly not i have never drawn a bill in my life and never shall do so why do you ask because a bill for that amount is in town at this moment said magnus then it is a forgeryan impudent forgeryand the forger must be found and promptly punished the governor had risen in his chair when he looked at magnuss drooping head and a thought occurred to him but are you sure of what you say is this story true he asked i have seen the paper myself replied magnus and it is signed in my name it is signed in your name sir and witnessed in the name of the factor that too said the governor while a painful smile came into his face and pray whom is this extraordinary document drawn in favor of magnus did not reply immediatelyhe continued to twist his hat between his knees that may help us to find the motive and therefore the forgerwho is it oscar stephenson said magnus oscar your brother yes sirand the money was paid to him in paris what cried the governor crossing the floor you tell me that oscaryour brother oscarhas committed a forgery oh thats what you meandont deny ityou mean that my son is a forger magnus made no answer and after a moment the painful smile about the governors face broke into a more painful laugh but why do i trouble myself with such a trumpery story i see how it is magnusstrong drink is a strong tongueyou have been drinking i have been drinking siri was ill and i couldnt help itbut im sober now and what i tell you is gods truth magnus rose as he said this and father and son stood face to facethe little governor in his uniform with flushed cheeks and pigeonbreast distended and magnus big black clumsy unkempt and with lines of suffering in his face and this document you tell me is at present in iceland it is sirtwo officers of the law brought it here from copenhagen officers of the law you say the bank found reasons to suspect the signatures so they sent across to verify them you have talked with these men yourself no doubt the sheriff brought them to see me said magnus the sheriff too the sheriff of all men he is to bring the two men here tomorrow morning so he is to bring them here tomorrow morning the governor though heated and agitated laughed once more and said with a sneer of course in the interests of the family you felt it necessary to examine the signatures they showed you i did said magnus simply and without consulting me to denounce the forger magnus made no reply and even to hintonly to hintthat perhaps you could point to the forger still magnus made no answer and dropping his cynical tone the governor burst out in choking anger out on you man out on you i thought you were drunk or suffering from the delusions of drink but you are worseyou are sweltering in hatredand it is an unnatural hatred toothe hatred of your own flesh and blood magnus flinched as if a lash had cut him through the skin you are jealous of your brotheralways have been always will bebecause he is clever and successful and amiable and because everybody loves himyou are as jealous of your brother as cain was of abel and this is your way of destroying him magnus stood with drooping head while the governors lash fell over him arent you ashamed to stand before your father and parade the whole diabolical catalogue of your unnatural passions you allow yourself to consort with my enemies with oscars enemies with your own enemies if you had the sense to see it while they try to bring him down at the highest moment of his success the governor was walking to and fro and lashing himself into a fury at the deepest moment of his distress too just when the poor boy is unmanned by the loss of his wifethe dear girl he loved and you insulted but i dont believe one word of this cockandbull story that accursed document is nothing but a trick to dishonor my son and to discredit me at the very time when a pack of rascals who call themselves reformers are trying to abolish the governorship let them do it if they can but while i am governor here im master in this house and mr sheriff shall be suspended and those men sent back to copenhagen hadnt you better speak to oscar first sir said magnus certainly i shall and if i find as i expectas i am surethat your story is a pack of falsehoodslet me never see your face again without a word of defense or explanation magnus left the room and a few minutes afterward oscar at the call of the governor entered it oscars face was as pale as yesterday but with a different pallor a different expressionan expression not of grief and regret but of fear and shame oscar said the governor i am sorry to trouble you about business so soon after your great sorrow but an ugly story is being told about you in town and as every lie has its tail it is only right that you should hear of this one immediately so that it may be quashed without delay oscars lower lip trembledhe felt the blow before it fell magnusyour brother magnusi am aware he has not been on brotherly terms with youyour mother has told me something about thatand let me say i do not sympathize with his protests and pretensionsi think them nothing but an excuse for his own selfishnessmagnus has just been here and he tells me that a note of hand drawn in your favor for no less a sum than one hundred thousand crowns has been forged in my name i do not believe the story and i do not want you to discuss it i only ask you to contradict itto contradict it flatlyor to leave me to deal with the real offender as i think best oscar standing by the governors desk remained for a moment quite still then in a voice so low that it hardly seemed to come from him he said i can not contradict it father what magnus has told you is true true you say it is true father and son stood facing each other for some moments without a word more being spoken then in hot words broken by breathless pauses the governor poured out question after question to which oscar made no answer you received that sum and signed for it in your fathers namein the name of your fatherinlaw also one hundred thousand crowns what has become of the money it is lost said oscar lost it was to pay the debts i had already contracted was that at monte carlo yes there was another long silence in which oscar stood with quivering lips and the governor with contracted brows but this documenthow did it come about i ask myself that question over and over again father and i fail to find an answer i can not understand myselfi try and i can not were you mad sometimes i think i wasi must have been did somebody tempt youput the idea into your headsomebody perhaps who helped you to lose and promised to help you to repay if so who was it i do not wish to accuse anybody fatheri suppose i have no right to do so right dont talk to me about rights think about your dutiesand the first of your duties is to me not to the person whoever it may be who has helped to destroy you you have pledged my credit and my honor but i dont want to think you altogether bad and if anybody suggested this devilish device to pay your debts i ought to be told who it was was it helga at the mention of that name oscars drooping head drooped lower still the governor saw this and then he understood everything lord god forgive us he said in a breathless whisper then magnus was right after all and the death of the poor child we buried yesterday was perhaps a part of the diabolical harvest we are reaping today you neednt wince siri see its true without that oscar did not attempt to excuse himself and after some moments of silence the governor spoke again you have deceived and disappointed me oscar i thought i had one son who was an intelligent man and a gentleman not a forger and a fool but it is of no use to prolong a painful interview you may go oscar staggered out of the room and the governor sank into his chair xii the proud man was abased for the first time in his life he was degraded in his own eyes his own son had committed a vulgar crime and exposed himself to a vulgar punishment in the first pain of surprise and humiliation he saw himself covering up the whole wretched episode but he was too proud to be proud and at the next moment he began to count with his conscience thus far he had tried to do what was right in iceland and he would do what was right to the end whatever it might cost him oscar had offended against the law and he must bear its righteous punishment it might be eight years imprisonment with the ruin of all his prospects the waste of all his talents and the wreck of all his happiness but he must go through with it to the last hour the last penalty the last pang so felt the governor as judge and if as the father he felt differently it was only with a different intensity his favorite sonthe son whom he had indulged and pampered in the pastfor whom he had planned and prepared so many things in the futurehad committed a crime against his country and against himself relying upon his fathers love and pride to save him from the painful consequences no matter what sacrifice it might cost him in hardearned money or in money still to earn no matter how much it might put him at the mercy of a scheming crew who were striving to pull him from his place it was selfish it was heartless it was shameful it was infamous and it deserved a double punishment feeling more bitterly against his son than he had ever felt before against any human creature the governor passed the day in torment and he was sitting alone in his room late at night with no light but the sleepy glow from the open stove when the door opened noiselessly and anna entered she looked as if she had been crying although her eyes were dry and the governor reproached himself that in all his sorry summary of the consequences of his sons crime he had never once thought of his sons mother but neither did she think of herself and now sitting by the stove and stirring it she began to talk of oscar he has fallen asleep at last she said and his troubles are over for a little while anyway he went up to his old bedroom tonight stephen the one he slept in when he was a boywhen magnus and he were boys together i sat with him until he dropped off and he held my hand all the time just as he used to do after he had been naughty and you had sent him to bed without his supper he looks quite like himself now poor boy and if you could see him lying there on the pillow you would think the old days had come back when you used to go up with the candle to look at him and wipe the tears from his little face while he lay asleep and stroke his curly hair ah dear how easily he could throw off his troubles in those old days stephen next morning you would hear him romping about overhead and singing like a lark a shallow nature anna said the governor a shallow nature on which nothing makes a serious impressionalways has been always will be oh but this will stephen this will make a deep impression and if the poor boy could only have another chance he would turn over a new leaf and set to work in good earnest and realize all your expectations and then thinkonly think father what a dreadful thing it would be if one brother were to drag the other into the dockdreadful for us i mean we should lose both our children for oscar would be lost to us one way and we should never be able to look on magnus again our children have always been at war anna ever since their earliest infancy dont say that stephen when they were little they loved each other dearly it was not until they grew up that they were different and then others came between themone other anyway andwho knowsperhaps she has been the cause of all this trouble has oscar said so asked the governor he will say nothing against anybody replied anna that was always the way with oscar but if somebody tempted him and he was weak and if our poor boy must go to prison while she there is a weakness that is wickedness anna and must bear its pains and penalties yes i know said anna i remember you said the same words long ago when the sailor lad killed his sweetheart in a fit of drunken passion the mother was a widow and she came to ask me to plead with you for her son he was a good boy she said and if it had not been for the drink he would never have hurt any one you spared his life you know and he was sent to prison and dear me how the poor woman kissed me and wept on my face for joy but she came to think that for her part it might have been better if her boy had died instead of being locked up for ever she could never forget it and when her eldest daughter was married and her house was full of people and everybody was happy she suddenly remembered and ran upstairs to cry and then on wintry nights when the wind was moaning over the sea and she was putting the little boys to bed she always thought of their brother lying alone in the big brown house up the road and round the corner it wouldnt have been so bad if he had been sent away she thought and she was only a poor widow who washed at the hot springs the night wind was moaning over the sea at that moment and the governor who had been walking to and fro struggling to be righteous and severe was feeling a pain in his parched throat he stood for some moments by the window with his hands interlaced behind him looking out through the dark pane on the flying moon and then with an obvious inward effort he said anna if i acknowledge this signature we shall have nothing leftnothing but my salary even my salary is threatened and if it goes we shall be without anything in the world why should we think of that stephen said anna we had nothing when we married and yet we were very happy it is true we were young then and now we are old but if poverty comes again we shall know better how to bear it and if we have nothing else we will have each otherand our boys tooboth our boyswherever they may be by that timeand neither of them will love us the less because we have given up everythingeverything we had in the worldthat they might still be honored and respected the clock struck twelve in the tower of the cathedral with a reverberant ring that passed over the sleepy town and the governor stopped in his restless perambulation it is late mother he said in a husky voice let us go to bed xiii next morning the governor was in his bureau again he was now firm and composed and waiting calmly for the officers from copenhagen they came early headed by the sheriff and bore themselves largely like men who were conscious that they were about to administer a painful shock after the formal introductions the sheriff leaned above the governors desk and said suavely almost condescendingly these gentlemen have been anxious to show every consideration they came on an urgent matteri may say a most urgent matterbut they have waited five days rather than break in upon you at a time of domestic tribulation i am busy this morning mr sheriff said the governor be so good as to waste no more time than is necessary the sheriff gasped and fell back from the desk whereupon the strangers stepped up to it and one of them opening a large envelope said in a tone of indulgent courtesy we have a document here your excellency which claims to be drawn by your authority will you be good enough to see if this is your excellencys signature the governor fixed his eyeglasses leisurely and glancing hastily almost casually at the paper put before him replied promptly it is the strangers looked at each other in silence before they spoke again in that case we presume your excellency will be prepared to honor it certainly said the governor then your excellency will be aware that the bill is already overdue and that two applications have been made for payment the governor flinched at that question but recovering himself in a moment he said shortly the bill shall be met immediately how soon your excellencya week a fortnight three days said the governor goodmorning gentlemen and without more ceremony he took up his pen and began to write a letter the sheriff who was perspiring visibly by this time had edged round to the door and after a short silence in which nothing was heard but the scratching of the governors quill the strangers bowed to his stooping forehead and backed themselves out of the room the governors letter was to the factor asking him to come immediately he came looking sullen and suspicious with the air of one who knew something already of the business for which he had been summoned old friend said the governor we have known each other for fifty years and i have never yet asked you to do me a favor but i am going to ask you now hm said the factor with a cold smile it is not for my own needs i ask it but for one who is nearer to me than myself we who are fathers know what that means and we also know that a favor done once to our children is done twice to ourselves hm hm said the factor with the same cold smile it is a private matterstrictly privatebut to you old friend i can reveal the secretyour godson has got himself into trouble and then excusing and extenuating nothing the governor told the story of oscars downfall and the factor listened with the impatience of one who had heard the sorry tale before he signed my name also you say said the factor that too unhappily answered the governor but you were merely made witness to the deed and i am responsible for the money what are you going to do about it asked the factor in a hard tone pay it and give the lad another chance in life replied the governor and thats why i sent for you this morning i can find fifty thousand crowns and i want you to lend me the other fifty thousand not fifty thousand cents said the factor not fiftyto shield a criminal and to cheat the law the governors face whitened but he answered quietly dont speak so fast old friend remember that the offense against the law is only an offense against myself and if i choose to forgive it the law can have nothing to say what about the offense against me said the factor remember too continued the governor that if oscar has made free with your name he has certain claims upon your pursethere is the marriage contract the marriage contract was made for thora and thora is dead said the factor there is the child said the governor i hold the child now and i am prepared to provide for it in the future said the factor but i will have nothing more to do with a man who has forged my name and if any further claim is madeon my business or estate or what noti will protest against it and publish my reasons for doing so oscar neilsen said the governor there is something i have not told you something i did not intend to tell you but i must tell it to you now i have reason to believeto be confidentthat for the trouble in which oscar finds himself helga is partly responsible can you prove that stephen magnusson said the factor if i can not prove it replied the governor it is because my sonwhatever his faults and folliesis still a gentleman and if you do not know it by this time it is because your daughter is not a lady speak for your own stephen magnusson and leave mine to me said the factor therefore continued the governor when i pay this moneyand i shall pay ityou will have the satisfaction to know that though i am a poor man and you are a rich one i am discharging your debt as well as mine with that red and angry the governor walked to the door and opened it the factor looked at him in blank amazement and for one swift instant his better nature conquered his greed and he saw what a pitiful thing it was that after fifty years of friendship they should quarrel thus about their children but one sword draws another from its sheath and he snapped his fingers contemptuously and strode out of the room then the governor sent for the manager of the bank of iceland manager he said i wish you to arrange a loan of one hundred thousand crowns on the security of my farm at thingvellir the farm is hardly worth so much siri say it is hardly worth so much said the manager but in your case there can be little difficultynone whatever if you are willing to pay the higher interesti say none whatever if you are willing to pay the higher interest i agree said the governor and let the deed be drawn without delay xiv having gone through the material part of his preparations the governor had now a spiritual and more trying ordeal before him and he went out into the homefield to think over it leaving the town behind he walked with hands as usual interlaced behind him as far as to the margin of the fiord it was a beautiful morning the light was wonderful a silvery light that made the light of other days seem dull and leaden full of innumerable sparkles like the stars that are sown in snow the waters of the fiord were heaving slowly under a quivering haze and on the sea outsidewide vast stretching far awaya number of fishingboats with their white sails bellied to a breeze that could not be felt on shore were going on and on as if sailing into the sky the mailsteamer was lying at anchor in the bay getting up steam for her voyage back to england and a flock of lighters painted white were floating about her black hull like seafowl at the foot of a lava rock the gulls were calling high up in the air and from the sheltered side of a little island the last of the years eiderduck were coaxing or driving their young ones into the sea to prepare them for their flight to faroff lands it was a cruelly beautiful morning one of those radiant days when nature in her indifference to man and his sufferings seems to conjure up every joyous sound and sight that can trouble the bitterest waters of memorywhen the very sunshine seems to break ones heart at length the proud man who was walking through the hummocked homefield with head bent low by the sorrow of a wrecked and shattered hope saw plainly what he had to do in love no less than anger in justice no less than duty he had to cast off forever his favorite son the pride of his heart and the hope of his life as soon as he returned to the house he sent upstairs for oscar after some moments oscar came down slowly looking more ill and weak than ever and stood by the stove with drooping head like a prisoner about to receive his sentence the governor glanced up at his son from over the rims of his eyeglasses and at first his heart failed him but after a moment he steeled himself to his task and began to speak in a steady voice i have sent for you to tell you he said that for your mothers sakei prefer to put it soi have acknowledged that signature and am preparing to pay the money you have wasted to do so i am compelled to mortgage every pennyworth of property we possess so that apart from my official salary i shall soon have nothing worse than that i have had to eat up your brothers inheritance in order to purchase your liberty and whether i had a right to do so god alone can say oscar shivered as from cold the governor saw this waited a moment and then went on the condition on which i make this sacrifice is that you leave iceland immediately you will sail by the laura which goes back this evening and as your honor is my honor i will give it out that your health is broken after the death of your wife and that you have gone away to recruit the governor paused a second time and when he spoke again his voice was thick and hoarse i shall not expect you to come back sooni shall not expect you to come back at all inasmuch as you have done your bestor worstto wreck my happiness i will ask you to consider that henceforth our lives are to run in different courses and that for my own part i wish to see you no more the governors voice was now husky and indistinct but still he struggled on you will look to yourself for your livelihood in the future but thatwith your talents little as you have made of them hithertoshould not be difficult whatever happens here i shall never expect you to do anything for me or for your mother but if fortune should favor you and you are able to repay your brother your conscience may be the easier andthough i do not pity him for his heart was hardthe earth on my grave the lighter the governor paused for the last time cleared his throat and then said in a firmer tone only one word more i thought perhaps your fatherinlaw might have done something for you but apart from a promise to provide for the child he will do nothing therefore as i have reason to fear that his daughter helga was at the root of the trouble which has so nearly wrecked us all and perhaps a first cause of the death of our dear thora i will ask you to promise mefor your own sake more than mineto hold no further intercourse with him or hisdo you promise there was silence for some moments and then a muffled sob came as from the stove itself i promise after that there was silence again for a perceptible period and then a voicea strange voice that was like a cry said that is all and nowgoodby andand god help you choking with emotion and blind with tears oscar turned about to acknowledge the justice of his punishmentto say that he deserved everythingeverything and morea hundredfold morebut he found himself alone his father had fled from the room xv when magnus heard of what his father had done his wrath knew no measure on the day when he found thora dead in her bed he had said to himself oscar has done this and he must be made to suffer but there was no legal way to punish a man who had tortured his wife to death by every refinement of hypocrisy and pretense and it was at the height of his anger that the offense against his fathers property had come to him with its diabolical temptation use me it whispered the damnable spirit of the world understands me better and after a struggle in which the devils seemed to fight for his soul he yielded he thought he knew the price he would have to pay and that was the reason he did not join his family at the funeral everybody would loathe him for giving up his brother to the punishment he deserved his own mother would turn from him and after his father being confronted by poverty had allowed the law to take its course he would hate and despise the son who had saved him from beggary but no matter when he stood up in court and said this is oscar stephensons handwriting for he is a forger and a thief and a thrill of horror ran through the crowded room and every eye turned on him with contempt he would say to his secret heart he killed her and he had to suffer and there was no other way than this yet that was not what had happened his father had saved oscar from the just punishment of his infamous offense and how had he saved him by making himmagnuspay the price of oscars riotous living abroad thus the vengeance which he had vowed upon his brother had recoiled upon himself and while his rightful inheritance was wiped out while the farm on which he had built his last hopes was embarrassed beyond the possibility of redemption and he was ruined for the rest of his life the man for whom and by whom he was ruinedruined in his affections as well as his fortuneswas to be allowed to steal away amid a croaking chorus of sympathy and pity under the cloak of broken health and a broken heart what a devils world it was in which infamy could masquerade as honor and hypocrisy as grief when magnus thought in this way his eyesight grew dull and his hearing dense and he felt a cold pain at the back of his neck then he began to use again the only remedy he had recourse to when his head was badhe began to drink but sitting in the darkest corner of the smokingroom of the hotel every word he heardevery conversation that filtered through the smoke and noise and his deadened sensesseemed to stimulate the idea which had taken possession of himit was the devils own world and god had nothing whatever to do with it at one moment a student ran into the room and shouted above the laughter and singing of his fellowstudents boys what do you think oscar stephenson is sailing by the laura tonight and thereupon a babel of voices cried really never you dont say so true enoughsmashed up for good and going abroad for an indefinite period not a bit of it oscar isnt the sort to be broken up like that six months abroad and hell be home again as bright and fresh as ever so he will thought magnus but his heart was fierce and bitter at another moment the chairman of the town board came in panting and cried news gentlemen news oscar stephenson has resigned his seat in parliament impossible listen and the little fat man read out of his rasping asthmatical throat from a sheet smelling of damp paper and printers ink a letter from oscar to his constituents broken in health and happinesscompelled to go abroadimpossible to fix date of returnconsequently forced to tender resignationdeeply grieved and disappointedbut set the duties too high to ask his constituents to wait etcthat means hes not coming back but good heavens does he know what hes giving up why theres nothing thats not within the mans reachabsolutely nothing i wonder the governor has allowed him to do it and then magnus laughed out loud in the fierce bitterness of his heart after that the voices were lower for a little while and when magnus heard them again somebody was saying but a man can love a woman too much altogether breaking your life to pieces because youve lost your wife isnt brave it isnt manly perhaps not but its human said somebody else and if oscar stephenson is smashed up by the death of thora neilsen hes in the right of it i say so do i cried magnus and laughing wildly he dropped his head over his arms on the table what a devils own world it was to be sure there was some whispering and then two louder voices poor fellow so unlike his brother going it fast they say his father was pretty hard on him though not harder than he deserved poor devil the poison in the soul of magnus was fermenting every moment hearing the contemptuous pity with which he was contrasted with his brotherhis brother who had wrought all the evilhis temples beat furiously and one wild thought expelled all other thoughts from his brain if there was no law to punish oscar if his father had conspired to help oscar to escape and if the hypocritical community agreed to cover up his fault one thing at least remainedbefore oscar left iceland he must meet with him then if this was the devils own world let the devil look after his elect magnuss mind was weltering in this thought as in a boiling sulphur pit when the captain of the laura came into the smokingroom with the agent of the steamship company and seating themselves near to him began to converse apart then he will have to put up with a bed in the hold for all the berths are gone said the captain but why cant he wait for the next steamer ill tell you why whispered the agent because the factors daughter is to sail by the vesta and there seem to be reasons why they should not meet so thats it is it but their fathers are fools not to know that theyll meet on the other side if they want to overhearing this conversation magnus lifted his head from his arms drank a large tumbler of brandy and water to the last drop and walked heavily out of the house he had not been conscious of the passing of time but the darkness was now closing in porters were hurrying with luggage toward the pier and the first of the lauras three bells was ringing magnus was like a man who could not see or hear properly more than once he collided with people on the parapet and being big and strong he brushed them out of the way some of them cursed him but he did not stop his clouded faculties were conscious of one idea onlythat he must go to government house and meet oscar face to face before he sailed reaching his former home he found the door open as usual on an autumn evening and nobody in porch or hall avoiding his fathers door he walked upstairs and turned mechanically toward the apartments which had lately been occupied by oscar but that was a part of the house sacred to his memory of thora and even in this hour of passion and pain something whispered to his tortured conscience and he turned away a moment later he was in oscars bedroom on the upper floor the furniture was in disorder the carpet was awry and articles of apparel were scattered about as if somebody had been packing trunks but the trunks were gone and there was nobody in the room magnus was about to go when his eyes were arrested by papers on a desk among sheets of music and scraps from newspapers there were the remains of a letter doubled up and torn across magnus knew the handwritingit was helgasand without any compunction he put the pieces together and read the letter oscaras soon as i heard that the governor had spoken to you on the fatal subject i confessed everything to my father and took my own share of the transaction of course he was furious and now he vows that i must go back immediately to my mother in copenhagen that does not trouble me seeing that you are leaving iceland but i must see you before you go in spite of all you say and notwithstanding any promise you may have given to anybody it is impossible that we can part like this it would be too selfish and too cowardly not to give me the chance of seeing you for the last time your steamer sails at nine oclockcome to me at halfpast eight if you do not come i may even follow you to londoni will do so if magnus read no more but ramming the pieces into his pocket he plunged down the stairs and out into the street if anybody could have seen him at that moment his appearance must have seemed terrible for his eyes were bloodshot and the veins on his forehead were swollen and dark it was now night and the second bell was ringing in the bay he was lunging along in the direction of the factors when somebody crossed in front of him in the thoroughfare it was oscar himself and he was going in another direction magnus was like a man whose reason is clogged but he saw everything in the light of his own making his brother was returning from the pier after taking his baggage aboard and he had come ashore on a last errand magnus knew what errand that wasit was to see helga and they were going to meet where they could be unobserved the moon had risen by this time and magnus could keep his brother in view while he followed like a hound behind him he saw nothing else and was not even conscious of what streets they passed through save that they were going toward the upper part of the town near to the lake and down the road that runs beside it he tried to walk softly and to make no noise but sometimes a hard laugh broke from his dry throat and once or twice a great sob came behind it he was thinking of thora and telling himself what he would say when oscar met helga and he came face to face with them he would say i loved your wifeim not ashamed to say soi loved her and gave her up to you and you promised to cherish her but you neglected her and allowed her child to be stolen away i would have given my hearts blood to make her happy but you made her miserable and now she is dead and you are here with this woman who helped to torture her you are a perjurer and a forger and a scoundrel and you may take thatand thatand thatand carry the mark of my hand on your face when you go where this wanton means to follow you he was now outside the town but he could not see or hear or think like a christian man and was merely ranging along the road like a beast then all at once in the still air and the silence of all around him he heard the voice of some one who was saying in low quivering pleading tones my darling my darling magnus knew whose voice it was he thought he also knew what sight he should see a moment later it would be oscar and helga locked in each others arms as they had been when he saw them last in the dance at the farmflushed hot and excited with his fists clinched and his teeth set hard he plunged through a gate that was like the gate to a garden and then ran forward a few paces but he drew up suddenly as if an unseen hand had seized his arm he saw where he was and his breath seemed to leave himhe was in the cemetery and some twenty yards farther down the path his brother oscar was kneeling by the side of a grave and sobbing as if his heart would break magnus stumbled back to the road sobered ashamed and broken into utter helplessness it might be the devils own world but god was in it also xvi when the last of the lauras three bells were ringing magnus stood alone on the little wooden jetty going down to the bay the whistle screamed in the steampipe the anchorchain rattled in the hawseholes and the steamer turned her head to the sea then a rowboat came back from the vessels side bringing an elderly lady who was trying to hide her tearstained face from the gaze of the boatmen and even the eyes of the night behind the folds of a little lace shawl which she wore over her hufa it was anna and as magnus helped her ashore she said give me your arm and take me homeim not feeling well tonight magnus but before they had gone many paces she stopped and looked back lovingly at the ship that was now steaming down the fiord and said in a pitiful voice he is gone and i have lost him my poor boy my poor oscar i had him for six and twenty years and to think it should come to this she walked a few more paces and then looked back again and said i have never seen anybody so deeply affected oh mother mother he cried at lastjust like a child i could have fancied the years had rolled back and he was still a boyfeeling ill and helpless and wanting to lie in his mothers lap again she walked a few steps and looked back as before there was nobody to see him offnobody at all the story must have leaked out somewhere and of all the people he used to call his friends there was not one to say farewell my poor boy my poor oscar he did wrongvery wrongbut god knows how he is suffering we think we punish people when we put them in prison but what punishment is like the pain of an awakened conscience and oscar is leaving everything behind himeverything and everybodyand going away in disgrace once more she walked a few steps and then she said in the voice of a crying child i shall never see him again i pretended i should but i know quite well i shall not some day you will come back i said and make amends and wipe out everything and he said yes and yes but we both knew well it wasnt true when the bell rang and i had to come away he said mother youve been the best mother a man ever had and i knew it was the last word i shall ever hear from him after that she could not speak for some minutes and then she said as if trying to comfort herself perhaps god will give my boy another chance where he is going to if so i think he will do better but if not she could not finish what she intended to saythat gods mercy was more terrible than the vengeance of man and he who renounced it would surely be destroyed they walked on in silence until they came to the gate of government house and then anna took her last look at the dark ship that was dying away to an indistinguishable mass in the shades of night and the mists of her blinding tears and said in a brave voice we must be very good to each other in future magnus you are the only son left to me now and if you have to suffer for the sin of somebody else you must let me help you to bear it i will always do so as long as i live magnus and when i am gone from you god will not forget goodnight magnus and god bless you magnus stood for some time where his mother had left him for the breakers of passion were still surging in his throat then he returned to the jetty and dropped the remains of helgas letter into the sea and they went out with the ebbing tide part v indeed indeed repentance oft before i sworebut was i sober when i swore and then and then came spring and roseinhand my threadbare penitence apieces tore i above all other cities of the world london is the home of the outcast the refuge of the disgraced and rejected the asylum of the moral leper the grave of the moral suicide she offers him obscurity and a kind of cleansing if he will cast himself into the rolling billows of her six millions of people and she keeps her word but exacts her penalties her penalties are homelessness friendlessness and loneliness but above all loneliness there is no loneliness like that of london the loneliness of an open boat on an open sea in an impenetrable fog or the loneliness of a trackless heath in a blinding snowstorm is not so desolating to the human soul as the loneliness of londons crowded thoroughfares with their lines of unknown faces filing on and on within a year oscar stephenson knew the loneliness of london to its last pang its utmost bitterness when he parted from his mother on the deck of the laura she slipped a purse into his pocket just as she used to do when he was a boy going to college or going away for his holiday the purse contained gold and notes to the value of fifty pounds and this with the little he had of his own was the whole sum of his fortune and all he had to face the future with he was not so young as to think it inexhaustible or so sanguine as to expect the world to fall at the feet of a fallen man so he tried to be frugal and to spend his substance prudently he spent his first night in london at the hotel in trafalgar square at which he had stayed with thora and helga on their way to italy but besides being too expensive for his present means the place was too full of tragic memories and next day he removed to a house in one of the first of the side streets going down to the river from the strand his lodging was a single room on an upper floor having a stuffy odor of carpets and curtains and a prospect of the neighboring roofs with various causeways of red chimneypots in this apartment oscar stephenson had his first experience of the loneliness of london he lived there six months without seeing any face belonging to the house except the face of his landlady and without knowing more about his fellowlodgers than that his neighbor in the adjoining room never returned home at night until after the great clock at westminster had struck twelve and that he whistled onward christian soldiers in varying degrees of alcoholic uncertainty while he put himself to bed before the end of those six months oscar was in debt to his landlady he had no regular employment and no prospect except the imminent one of being homeless and penniless by what stages of quick descent he came down to this condition it would be a needless task to tell his story is that of the great army of the disgraced and the castaway who fly to london as to a sanctuary and are allowed to live only by lying at its doors he had struggled and failed he was young and active but nobody needed him in some places his want of references was a difficulty in others his superior education was a cause of suspicion he was too good for one post and not good enough for another in a world full of work there was no work for him to do the slow agony of those first six months kept alive the shame and misery of his breakdown and nearly sapped his moral courage as day followed day and the feeling of uselessness deepened he felt like a boy a friendless abandoned boy he had done wrong and he was ready to bear his punishment but the great irresistible unanswerable world was using him cruelly it would not make peace with him on any terms it was leaving him without hope or counsel or encouragement or consolationit was leaving him alone this sense of being of no account of being nothing and nobody in the world with the terror of sinking out of sight some day and nobody knowing or caring was harder to bear than poverty or even shame itself when the clouds looked blackest he swallowed the last remnant of his pride and appealed to the few friends of his father in england who had been so good to him in the careless days of his college life and so boundlessly hospitable in the happy time of his honeymoon he appealed to the professor at oxford making a clean breast of his misdoings and no concealment of his sufferings and asking for influence and assistance in obtaining a sublibrarianship or such other employment as might provide him with bread and butter and the answer that came back was prompt and courteous but as cold as the breath of an iceberg he appealed to the banker in london asking for a junior clerkship or a position as messenger or even porter and the reply he received was as smooth as a dogs tongue and as useless for help and healing and then he knew by bitter knowledge that the kindness which had been shown to him in the better time was kindness to his fathers son and that he had wasted that heritage and was his fathers son no more meantime he spent his days and a great part of his nights also in the streets there he was like a piece of helpless driftwood in the roaring current of life always going on yet never going anywhere always floating along yet never making headway the ceaseless stream in the busy thoroughfares tormented him terribly but the emptiness of the obscurer streets tortured him still more and the blankness of sunday morning in the strand afflicted him most keenly of all for it was full of memories of sunday morning in iceland with its atmosphere of peace and rest and the sound of church bells when he was at his lowest depths of hopelessness he sent his first letter home dearest mother he wrote sitting in his stuffy back room overlooking the rooftops you would naturally have expected to hear from me before this and i certainly should have written earlier only that i have been waiting for a long quiet hour in which i could tell you all the news everything that has happened to me since we parted on the steamer and i saw your dear face disappearing in the boat that hour seems never to come so i must snatch a few moments without any more delay to say that all is well and everything goes swimmingly the dear old soul why should i make her miserable he thought you will easily understand that in a great city like london especially when one is beginning again and one has so much to do and so many people to see there is not an hour left for oneself and hardly a moment to write a letter but this does not prevent my thinking of you at all events and i do so every day and always thats true at least he told himself and he went on boldly with his affectionate fictions i know that my dear little mamma will want to know first the condition of my creature comforts and i hasten to tell her that these are as right as can be this is a large and handsome house just off the tide of greatest traffic where splendid horse wagons called omnibuses and upholstered sleighs on wheels called hansoms roll about in countless numbers day and night making a roar like that of the ellida river where it falls into the fiord but my bedroom in which i am writing this letter is quiet and cozy and homelike and my landlady is a good little creature who visits me daily and is always most kind and motherly as he went on his pen flowed freely and his handwriting became big and reckless i am making new and influential acquaintances every day and seeing in the flesh the faces we are all familiar with in prints walking in the park yesterday i passed the queen who is one of our own princesses you know so i felt myself entitled to bow to her and she bowed back with the sweetest courtesy i see the prime minister frequently for he lives in a house that is only down the street and round the corner and the homes and offices of nearly all the ministers of state are within a stones throw of this place in fact one way or another i am certainly coming in touch with the leading men in england and when i open my window at night i can see the light that burns in the clocktower above the houses of parliament so you see that i am finding life wonderfully interesting in this mighty maelstrom of human activity and if i do not write as often as i ought my anxious little mamma is not to imagine there is anything amiss with me but merely to tell herself that no news is good news and that i am immersed in many occupations perhaps if i have a lonely hour occasionallythe pen trembled in his fingers and the handwriting became loose and shakyit is when i think about home and wonder what is happening there and what people are saying about me now i suppose i have no right to complain whatever it may be but sometimes when i am coming back to my lodging on a starry night after a tiring day and i look up to the milky way and think that is the road to my country the thought goes to my heart like a stab that when i left it last my fathers door was closed against me and i saw nothing of magnus at the end how are they both and how are you and how are the factor and aunt margret and howoh how is our dear little elin my sweet sweet child what i would give to see her again has she grown is she still as much like her poor mother does she notice she will begin to babble and talk by and by will they bring her up to know nothing about her father or perhaps to think ill of him if i return to iceland some day and i shall to take up the broken threads of my life again and find that the mind of my own child has been poisoned against me i dont know what will happen i believe i shall go back instantly and wipe myself out for ever but i will not think of that even as a remote possibility and meantime i am working day and night to build up a new career and as you see i am getting on splendidly so goodby dearest and god bless you and god bless everybody at home for we shall all be good friends yetoscar psis helga still in iceland or has the factor carried out his threat of sending her back to denmark i suppose i ought not to think of her having given that promise to the governor yet i can not help doing so and i can not help asking ii it was the time when a young english composer was creating some sensation by writing an opera on the subject of king olaf the theme was one which oscar had often proposed to himself and raised his fancy and emulation upon in the delirious days when he had hoped to become a musician and the dazzling dreams of glory were not yet so dead that he could restrain himself from rambling up to covent garden on the night of the first performance he knew he was penniless and he was conscious that his clothes were shabby and his shoes in a woful condition as he lounged by the arches and watched the audience assemble the carriages were rolling up and discharging their occupantsthe queen and her ladies the prime minister and finally the kingand he was turning away feeling more miserable and destitute than ever when a hand touched him on the shoulder and a familiar voice at his side said cheerily helloa can it be possible it was neils pinsen his former schoolfellow and companion fresh and bright in evening dress under a handsome furlined overcoat heard you were in london but didnt know where to find you want to see you immediately old fellow where do you stay as soon as he had got rid of a stifling sensation in the throat oscar answered him and then finsen said should i call upon you there or would you prefer to come here to me i will come to you said oscar good when shall it be will tomorrow at twelve be convenient any time will be convenient to me happy man twelve tomorrow in my office then glad to have found you at last thought you might have looked me up and wondered what on earth had become of you goodby busy tonight and enough work for a regiment by the way if you would like to see the performancecant promise you a seat but if you would care to stand at the back of the balconyyou would come this wayjohnson take this gentleman in front and give him anything you have left byby before oscar had quite recovered his breath he was sitting in the halflight at the back of the upper circle feeling miserably humiliated and ashamed yet tingling with a strange excitement he never quite knew what happened thereafter he forgot that his money was all gone that he had not eaten since morning that his trousers were frayed at the bottom and his shoes down at the heels he only felt that out of the sordid conditions of the past six months he had suddenly emerged into an atmosphere that was as the vivid breath of his soul when the conductor enteredit was the young composer himselfoscar craned forward to catch a glimpse of the man who was on the eve of snatching the triumph which but for the hard buffetings of fate might perhaps have been his own and when the opera began he listened with every faculty it was good it was human it was modern its harmony was exquisite its orchestration sure its form showed mastery of the mystery of music and yet it lacked something what did it lack it lacked the lifeblood of the stern old northland the englishman could not give it that for the root of the matter was not in him but he could have done so for his blood was the blood of the vikings the blood of flosi and snorri and eric and olaf and all the mighty men of old oscar did not hear his fellowlodger go to bed that night with his lunging step on the stairs and his drunken whistling of onward christian soldiers and next morning when his landlady came up to speak to him according to her wont he was hardly conscious of what she said except that it was some protest some threat and that he did not feel it worth while to soften and sweeten her with such promises as he had made before the intoxication of last night was still upon him when he set out to keep his appointment music was calling to him again calling him like a siren out of his friendlessness and loneliness his humiliation and obscurity his poverty and shame out of the pitiless cruelty of crowded thoroughfares and the grimy sordidness of obscure streets into the glory of success and fame come in old fellow cried the familiar voice of yesterday and oscar found himself in finsens office let me see said finsen removing a pair of pincenez how long have you been in london six monthsnearly seven said oscar and what have you been doing nothing lucky chap nothing at all yes there is one thing ive been doingive been doing it rather industriously whats that starving finsen laughed loud but oscar laughed louderhe had not yet broken his fast we all go through it at some time said finsen and its best to get it over at the beginning so i congratulate you old fellow and now to business im managing heremanaging for a syndicate under four eyes as we say in iceland i intend to give a series of concerts and im looking out for fresh material you compose used to do said oscar i understand said finsen your life has been off the tracks lately and youll not write much more thats worth anything until you get back into the groove but i know what you used to do and thats good enough for me i heard some of your songs from the sagas you remember and i dont mind saying that as the work of a man who was nearly selftaught in the matter of harmony i thought them wonderful but helga tells mehelga neilsen i mean i hear from her occasionally oscar flinched as if a lash had cut him helga tells me continued finsen that you did some things in iceland last year that beat your saga songs to little bits and if you think we can try them here theyre gone said oscar i know said finsen ive heard what has become of them but perhaps you have copies not a copy said oscar or perhaps you can remember some of them not one even so the case is not quite hopeless you are a person of some influence in iceland used to be said oscar well i presume to think i ammy father is sheriff and likely to be something betterso if you care to give your consent we may recover the things still a mist arose between oscars eyes and finsens face you surely do not mean certainly i do if the things are half as good as helga says theyre worth all the trouble anyhow im willing to gamble on her judgment to give you something to go on with and when the stuff comes to devote a morning to trying it with the orchestra and ask you to conduct the rehearsal finsens figure was floating in the mist that was between it and oscars eyes you wish me to authorize you to exhume why not its not an unheard of proceeding and if ever there was a moment that justified it its now if compositions that might give pleasure to the world and make pots of money are lying buried in a grave ill starve first said oscar rising from his seat my dear chap said finsen putting back his pincenez you tell me youre doing that already but heres your chance of doing it no more and if ill starve to death first said oscar turning to the door nonsense old fellow if the things were doing any good where they are i could respect your feelings but theyre not they are merely rotting away and they will soon disappear altogether what your object was in burying them you know besti confess i thought it very quixoticbut whatever it was it has served its purpose and now there they lieworks of genius as im willing to believethat might possibly make your name and begin to make your fortune while you ill die in a ditch rather than touch them said oscar and without a word of farewell he flung out of the room no words could describe the agony he endured during the remaining hours of that day the intoxication of the night before was gone by this time and he suffered the pains of the spirit that has buoyed itself up on a bankrupt hope if he had ever had any uncertainty about the meaning of the blind impulse of remorse which had prompted him to bury his compositions in his wifes grave he had none now it was gods own punishment to shut up the only channel to fame and success nay to livelihood itself as by the door of a tomb hour after hour he walked the streets feeling that escape from the way of life he had been living was now utterly hopeless he would go down and down day by day little by little until he was submerged beneath the flood or became but for the mercy of god a vagabond and a castaway it was long before he could bring himself to go back to his lodging and when he did so he found that the street door would not open to the key he carried in his pocket he rang the bell and a little maidofallwork came up as from her bedroom below stairs with curl papers in her hair and some loose clothes about her body why did you bolt the door my child he said didnt you know that i had not come home yes sir but mistress told me to tell you as how your room has been let and you can have your trunks when you pay what you owes her do you mean that i am to be turned out it aint my fault sir and im very sorry oscar and the girl stood looking vacantly at each other for a moment and then he turned away and walked up the street with a new sensationthe blank desolating sensation of not having a roof over his head no one knows what it means to be one night homeless in a great city except those who have gone through it it is not so much the poverty of privation that is hard to bear as the sense of utter worthlessness of being less to the world than its dogs for they are cared for or its horses for they are housed his money was gone and he had no luggage in his hands to make shift to find another lodging with so he walked on and on up lower regent street and across piccadilly through noisy throngs of peopleyoung women smoking cigarettes young men laughing and singing and a bedraggled girl being lugged along by a policemanon and on until he came to a wide and quiet thoroughfare where a line of broughams waited outside a house that was brilliantly lighted up and there he paused in his aimless perambulation to listen to the music that was coming through the open windows he had been asking himself for the hundredth time how it had come to pass that he so lately the pampered son of his fatherwho was the governor of his people and their upright judgewas tramping the streets of london without a penny in his pocket or a roof to cover him when the door opened and an elderly gentleman came out bareheaded to escort some ladies to their carriage then his stunned faculties awoke and he saw where he was standing he was outside the house of his fathers friend the banker the deep remembrance came back to him of the time so near yet so far away when he himself with thora and helga had been honored guests in that house and lest the banker should see him the wayfarer he then was skulking there at that untimely hour he turned about and walked quickly away nothing that had happened on that evil night had wounded his feelings so acutely or made him feel so surely that rescue from his accursed condition there could be none was it to be a part of his punishment that even when his senses slept he was to be constantly brought up against himself and reminded of the days that were dead if so life would be unendurable and existence an everlasting hell did nature never forget did god never forgive half an hour afterward he was walking along the embankment past the crouching and sleeping forms of the sordid things whom the city casts out on to the rivers bank by night and looking wildly at the waters of the thames glistening and glimmering under the electric light he asked himself why he should not end it all and have done with further torture what was the thought that restrained him was it the thought of his dead wife whose memory was to be a safeguard against sin and a perpetual inspiration no by the inscrutable will of fate it was the thought of the one being whose love had wrecked himit was the thought of helga in spite of the pledge he had given to the governor he could not help thinking of her no day had been so dark but he had thought of her on going to bed at night and on awakening in the morning she was gone they might never meet again their love was a page of his life which he had crossed out and turned down for ever yet her eyes were in his eyes and her smile was the only sunshine that shone upon his face the thought of thora was a sweet and sacred thing which he had wrapped up and laid by in the lavender of memory but the thought of helga was warm and alive and always with him it was with him now and it saved his soul from despair and his body from death iii before oscars letter reached iceland many changes had taken place there the estrangement of the governor and the factor had developed into open antagonism everybody knew of it and the enemies of each had been playing upon his hatred of the other the factor was the first to suffer the downfall of the barter trade which magnus predicted had already come to pass and the factors business had tumbled to pieces like an unbound faggot there is always a good reason to kill a fat ox and while people said the factor gives the farmers what he likes for his wool and charges them what he pleases for foreign produce the true ground of the attack upon his business had been his intimidation of the town at the time of oscars election oddsson the defeated candidate of that day never rested until he had established a company on the cash principle even then the factor would have borne down all opposition for the factor was rich while the farmers were poor but oddsson had secured an ally in the most powerful person as the smith uses the tongs to spare his fingers so oddsson had used the governor to save his company the governor knew full well that oddsson was his enemy and that if his party got the upper hand they would upset the old order but he could not resist the temptation to join him when he was trying to destroy the factor by his help the preferential tariff with denmark was broken down and the iceland markets were opened to english produce and that was the deathblow to the barter business for three months the factor kept his doors open by selling at less than cost price and buying at more than market value but the end was sure it was whispered at the bank that he was parting with his securities in stocks and shares and his estate in land and loose property and that sooner or later he would come down with a crash nobody pitied him and at the bottom of his tortured heart one man rejoiced but the smiter has often short joy of his stroke and when oddsson and his party having done with trade turned their attention to constitutional subjects the factor though he hated them joined their agitation the winter had been severe there had been many deaths among the older members of parliament and as often as a byelection had occurred the factor had thrown the weight of his remaining influence and the force of his diminishing fortunes into the scale of reform by the end of the spring it had become certain that the next session of althing would witness the passing of a bill for the reconstruction of the constitution and the abolition of the governorship thus each of the two men who had stood shoulder to shoulder for fifty years destroyed himself in destroying the other and the prophecy of long ago was fulfilled that if the governor and the factor ever ceased to be friends they would become the bitterest of enemies meantime anna had tried to make peace and failed when the quarrel was young and chiefly about the children she had attempted a tone of sympathetic protest come come stephen pardon is the best punishmentyou must make peace with the factor he might have saved my son by the lifting of his hand and he would not do soi shall never make peace with him said the governor oscar neilsen said anna meeting the factor in the street when are you coming to see stephen if you stay away much longer the housedog will fly at you the housedog flew at me when i was there last annai shall never trust him again said the factor when the quarrel grew old and ugly and personal to the men themselves anna thought of another means of reconciliation the child was the last remaining link between the governor and the factorit should bring them together again god has always a use for these little angels she said aunt margret joined in the conspiracy and the two old things concocted many schemesall simple and transparent but womanly and goodto get the men into the same room they never succeeded but a thousand beams of sunshine shone out of the babys cradle and little by little the ice that had frozen about the mens souls was seen to melt when the child was shortened it was taken over to government house and wheeled in its perambulator into the governors bureau isnt she a beauty stephen said anna and aunt margret said the precious pet couldnt possibly be more like her father if she were not so wonderfully like her mother too the governor looked down at the little face without saying a word and when the child blinked up at him with the eyes of thora and the smile of oscar he went upstairs to his bedroom and anna heard him lock the door when the child cut her first tooth and everybody according to custom ought to have given her a toothfee the factor coming home at night found no presents on the nursery table but the little one was propped up under the blue lace of her hooded cradle and making the air hideous with the divine discord of a babys silvermounted rattle thats stephens present and it must have cost him a fortune said aunt margret whereupon the factor weary as he was walked out into the road where he could hear nothing but the cold lapping of the lake yet love of the little one was not bringing the two men togetherit was thrusting them still farther apart that man is scheming to get hold of the child thought the factor he and his have robbed me of my daughters and now theyre trying to rob me of my granddaughter also shes my sons child thought the governor and my sons child is my childwhy did i allow that man to have her no use woman said aunt margret its late to withdraw the sword when it is thrust to the heart but then came oscars letter and annas hopes went up with a bound she was like a child herself in her joy over it her happiness was too great to permit her to see holes in its picture of prosperity oscar was well he was getting on splendidly and he sent his love to everybody she read the letter first to the governor and after he had heard it he walked out into the homefield where the eiderducks were building their nests afresh on the edge of the fiord and the fishingsmacks were coming back to harbor then she took it over to the factors rolled it up in the babys hand like another rattle and left it with aunt margret to be shown to her brother but that day had been a bad day with the factor and when oscars letter came back to anna it was torn across the middle and enclosed in an empty envelope anna was nearly brokenhearted at the treatment of her treasure for no girl of sixteen had ever so loved her first loveletter and she had intended to show it to everybodyto the bishop the rector the sheriff and above all to magnus magnus had been coming and going at intervals throughout the winter it had been a hard one for him as for others and he had begun to realize what it would be when his father was gone and he had to bear the burden of the monstrous mortgage but harder to bear than any winter had been the sight of his mothers sufferings during oscars silence any news yet he would ask and anna would say no and no with countless explanations and excuses so it was through the dark days and his feeling against oscar grew hard as the ground he trod upon but when the snow had gone and he went up with the spring caravan there was anna with a face like the rising sun and by that he knew that a letter must have come at last sure enough in less than a minute out it came from the bosom of her embroidered treya torn across as the factor had left it and she was calling on him to write an answer to her dictation this is what he wrote my dear son your letter arrived safely by the last steamer and made up by its welcome news for the long time we had to wait for it it is so good to hear that you are well and prosperous and enjoying your life in the great english city many a time i feared it might be otherwise but now i have your letter and i am happy and contented i am proud that my son is rising into such high and good company and though your father speaks little i am sure that he feels the same he always said that you would do great things some day and it is not the way of gods goodness to disappoint such expectations where they are built on a good foundation and now i have to tell you that your father is well in bodily health though a little oppressed by worldly anxieties but i tell him our home in this life is always on a steep mountain and if we trust in god there is no reason to be afraid as for myself i am as well as can be expected at my age though my left ear troubles sometimes and my eyes are not what they used to be for knitting and small print but i must not allow myself to complain for perhaps it is a part of gods mercy to us old people that our senses should die by degrees so that when they come to die altogether we may not be taken unawares magnus is writing this letter and he is strong and hearty the snow was deep at the farm this year and he lost six of his best beasts but his lambs came beautifully and now they are on the mountains and his ewes are milking well and the homefield is closed for the hay i have to tell you that the one you ask about has gone back to her mother at copenhagen and that there are those who can not be very sorry sometimes to silence the evil tongues that speak ill of you here i am tempted to blame her for all that has happened but who am i to judge any one and the worst i wish for her is that she may soon become a godfearing girl margret neilsen is just as she always was a twisted bough with plenty of sap in it and the factor would be well enough but for a bad hip he too like your father is much oppressed by worldly cares and taking it ill that they should fall so fast upon him in the evening of his days and now i have to tell you of your little elin that she is as well as can be and she has cut two front teeth and her hair is curling over her forehead she is the best child that ever was born and when she smiles she is so like somebody that it nearly breaks my heart to look at her margret is as good to the darling as if she were her own mother and your father and the factor can hardly see the sun for her as for me it fills my heart brimful to think how god in his goodness has sent us old folks this little angel after our late troubles for she is like the spring after a hard winter when the snow and ice have stayed so long that we think surely we shall never see the grass or hear the rivers again and then all at once there are the green fields and the shining streams and all the gladness of the flowers and now though you are getting on so well you must not be angry with your mother for sending you a little present maria has been all day in the kitchen packing your college box and goodness knows what things she may have put in it but i am knitting you a pair of stockings out of old maggies brown wool and i hope you will not be ashamed to wear them for they will keep your feet warm in the cold weather when the english socks must be so thin and cottony then i remember how fond you used to be of our smoked mutton so i am telling maria to put in some of that too and a few rolls of rullapilsa i dare not let the governor know i am sending the muttonhe would think it foolish and unnecessaryand of course with so many good things to eat and drink i do not expect you to offer it to your english friends but perhaps you can hide it in a cupboard somewhere and take a slice when you are quite alone and now i must conclude for magnus is coming to the end of his paper it makes me happy to think your bedroom is comfortable and i wish i could thank your landlady for being so kind and motherly i may never see her in this world but we shall meet in heaven some day and then i will thank her and now my dear son in the midst of your great prosperity do not forget that all good things come from god and remember to put your trust in him to his care i commit you for he knows all our wants and all our troubles and all our secrets and his eye ever watches and his heart never sleeps your affectionate mother anna iv when oscar received his mothers letter he was living in a slum in westminster it was called short street and it was a typical example of the mean streets which nearly always and in all countries lie near to a great minster like seawrack at the foot of a rock short street was a culdesac whereof one end was a ginpalace and the other an archway to the railway depot of a suburban necropolis late at night the inhabitants were kept from sleep by the quarreling of tipsy men who had been turned out of the publichouse and early in the morning they were awakened by the rumbling of the hearses that rattled the corpses over the cobbles of the street oscars home in short street was at number one a grimy house with a soiled card in the fanlight above the door saying lodgings for single men besides himself there were four lodgers three of them being porters at the funeral depot and the fourth head barman at the publichouse the barman had the parlor floor and he generally brought home a number of noisy companions at closing time to play cards and drink beer oscars bedroom in this house was not so much a room as a stifling closet of miserable aspect in which the refuse furniture seemed to make an effort to range itself in ordera threadbare carpet an iron bedstead without foot or head a painted washstand a brokenlipped water ewer two or three rickety chairs a table that was safest when it rested against the wall a few pictures of racehorses on the remains of a dirty wallpaper and a lookingglass blotched by damp like a sheet of ice spotted and scabbed by thaw his landlady lived in the basement and was never seen except on monday mornings when she went round for her lodgers rent some two or three hours before the collector called for her own the only person whom oscar saw constantly was the landladys servant jenny a typical cockney girl of the humblest class untidy and unclean but as bright as a london street sparrow and with a big soft heart in her vulgar little breast jenny had conceived a certain affection for oscar based on no grounds more personal than that he did not shout at her down the pairs of stairs or take liberties or use bad language and that he always raised his hat when he passed her in the street the only effect of this sentimental attitude on jennys part was that she always dressed in her clean print on the days when oscar happened to be at home to tea and it was on one of these afternoons that she came knocking at the door of his bankrupt garret and said letter for you sir it was so long since oscar had received a letter of any kind that he leaped up with a kind of fear and on taking the envelope out of jennys hand and seeing it was addressed in magnuss writing and had been sent on from his former lodging he turned pale and trembled is it bad news sir said jenny i wouldnt a brought it up on no account if id knowed no no leave me jenny said oscar and when the girl had gone and he had opened the letter with nervous fingers he read it with eyes that were wet with tears while his cheeks were flushed with shame when he came to the end his heart was beating wildly and he was asking himself if it would not be the brave and manly thing to write at once and say that all this story of his prosperity was a miserable fiction that he had never been otherwise than wretched that he was living in a common way among common companions doing common work which he dare not think of and that no words could express the secret agony of his soul at having sunk so low but deep as was the degradation of that bitter hour it was not so deep as that of the following morning when jenny came lugging his college box upstairs and chattering gaily as if she had brought him a fortune the railway man said as ow it was as eavy as lead so i give im twopence for isselfi ope i did right sir quite right jenny heres the money you can go now can i elp ye to unpack it sir there aint no sort o box as i cant unpack my what a long way it must a come it came from iceland jenny fancy that now pat looney the lorry man e come from there and the neighbors says its a pity e dont go back they never says that about you though hes so perlite they says oscar allowed the girl to open the box and empty it of its contents and as she did so she chirped away like the street sparrow that she was while he sat with the mist of his boyish associations floating up to him from the happy past well i never she cried sitting back on her heels as she knelt before the box polonies and sausages and pickled tongues and hams why you wont ave to buy nothin to eat for months isnt that lucky now just when youre out too is it a present yes it is a present jenny they must think somethin of ye as sends ye a present like this said jenny and then after a moment in a fluttering voice is it a laidy sir its my mother said oscar your mother said jenny in a tone of relief well thats what i do call a motherbeing good to anybody like this she has been good to me all my life jenny and all my life ive treated her badly jenny looked at him strangely as if something surprised and pained her you have sir shamefully jenny yet she has forgiven me again and again jenny was silent for a moment and then she said mothers is like that isnt they now theres jim cobb the shandry man e knocks is mother about somethin cruel but she never aves im up for it never mothers is proper good is your mother good to you jenny me im an orfling said jenny and then lowering her voice to a tone of confidence she added i dont mind tellin you but i am i always tells the other lodgers as my mother was one o them girls as ye see at the aquarium at nights covered with silks and diamonds and was she a look of dejection crossed jennys face i dont see as she could ave been because they say at the orflinage as i was born in holloway when my mother was doin time by this time the contents of the box were ranged on the table and chairs and jenny was sitting back on her heels again to look at them there theyre as pretty as a am and beef shop and i do believe as thats what your mother meant em for too jim cobb e wanted me to set one up with im but not me not as i ave any objections to the am and beef business and if anybody else thought of starting it jennys hint was interrupted by the sound of a vehicle stopping suddenly outside the house now i bet ye i know who that is she said with a wink its that blessed jim cobb again hes always awantin me to go for a ride in is shandry but going to the window she cried goodness its a handswim cab and theres a laidy agettin out of it a lady you cant see er nowshes on the steps there she is cried jenny as a rattat came to the street door and me not ad time to comb my air yet with an indefinable feeling of mingled fear and hope which there was yet no cause for oscar stood on the landing and listened while jenny ran down the stairs when the street door was opened he heard his own name in a voice that sent the blood to his head and made him reel with dizziness a moment later jenny came back with a face that looked white even under the smudges that soiled it and she said in the same fluttering voice as before i thought as much its you shes askin for ive took er into the barmans parlore wont be ome till tea oscar went downstairs slowly but when he got to the bottom his breath was coming and going in gusts and his heart was beating against his breast as with the blows of a hammer the parlor door stood ajar and a perfume he knew was coming out to him after a moment he pushed the door open and then she whom he expected to see was standing before him she herself more radiantly beautiful than ever with something soft and white about her neck and a face shining with smiles how much he lived in that moment no one could say a hundred emotions coursed through his soul like the flash of flamejoy delight pain shame the rapture of seeing her the humiliation of being found in such a common place the degradation of being illclad and obviously poor but above all lovethe uncontrollable love that leads men on to happiness and victory or to ruin and death his face broke up tears burst from his eyes and holding out both hands he cried helga my god helga v helga appeared to be not less excited than oscar himself she was genuinely moved to see how the joy he had in meeting her affected him and when he had kissed both her hands she kissed one of his and tears which she could not keep back came to her eyes also there was a shiny leathercovered sofa in the room and they sat on it side by side and hand in hand i have never never been so glad he said and i am glad too she said let me look at you again oscar a little paler and perhaps a little thinner but otherwise not changed in the least yet you have changed a great deal helga grown older have i grown lovelier and more beautiful than ever at that she leaned her face toward him and he kissed her and for some moments they could not restrain their fondness helga was the first to recover selfpossession and now let us talk seriously she said but oscar was still quivering with excitement and having brushed away his tears he laughed hysterically how long have you been in london he asked a montha month tomorrow she replied and to think that i have never known it until now but how did you come to leave copenhagen thats just what i am trying to tell you my father for some unknown reason elected to reduce my mothers income by half so something had to be done then i remembered neils finsen and the wonderful things he used to say about my voice finsen repeated oscar in a graver tone so i wrote to him and he answered that if i would come to london he would have experts to hear me and then they would see what could be done well well well i came and the experts heard me and they concluded that my voice was quite unusualthe most promising soprano they had found for years and now now im at the royal academy of music and by and by i am to go to paris for two years three years perhaps four to study under marchesi or bonby and to attend an acting class and finally i am to be taken to monte carlo or nice in representations of faust and someo as a first step toward taking london by storm as marguerite or juliettethere and finsen is doing all this for you well yes so to speak i suppose i must say that is he to pay your expenses i really dont know who is to pay them but ive signed a contract to come out under his management and to refund everything when i am fairly launched and now about yourself oscar about me its nearly a year since i saw you last what have you been doing oscar made a clumsy laugh oh im like the lilies of the fieldi toil not neither do i spin but his forced gaiety broke down badly and he said more soberly dont ask me what ive been doing helga helgas eyes wandered around the room for a moment and then she said i know neils told me something about it and he wished me to say before she could finish oscar had risen to his feet if you come from finsen i know what your errand is and i would rather die no no no said helga clinging to his nervous hand sit down its not that at all listen he sat and the sweetness of her look banished all his fears theyre giving what they call promenade concerts at covent garden and a few days ago there was some difference with the leader of the orchestra it seemed desirable to make a change and the question was who the new leader ought to be naturally i thought of you of me why not didnt i see what you could do with those hundred and fifty numskulls at thingvellir but covent garden my dear oscar ive seen every leader they have here and while they are all your superiors in knowledge and experience theres not one of them with a tittle of your magnetism and genius so i said neils if you want the finest leader that london has ever seen let me go and fetch him but you cant know helgayou cant imagineif you had the least idea of what ive gone through to livemerely to live helga looked around the room again and she said cant i see havent i got eyes but if you were to tell me that nobody has had any use for you in the meanest work that is ever done by the commonest men i should still say what i said to finsen oscars throat was hurting him the thought of helgas faith and championship broke down his selfcontrol he never allowed himself to think there could be any selfish ground for it what do you wish me to do helga he asked to meet me in finsens office at eleven oclock tomorrow morning but i vowed i could never set foot in the place again you didnt know then that i should ask you and i do ask you oscar he remembered the promise he had given to his father he reflected on the danger of reopening a page of his life which he had crossed out and turned down as for ever he thought of finsen and his interest in helga and the hold he would have of her through her hopes and ambitions and his will was like a broken withe for the controlling destiny of his life was leading him on you will be there will you not she whispered and oscar answered yes she leaned her face forward again and again he kissed her and then she rose to go where are you staying he asked and she told him it was in a fashionable apartmenthouse on the edge of the green park does finsen live there also well yes he lives in the same building and you must live there too i shall want to see you constantly there are a thousand things i want you to do for me but now i must be off he could not let her go and they renewed their caresses it will seem like a dream when you are gone he said i shall hardly be able to believe you have been here or that you will ever come back again dont say that i told you in iceland that i should come to you if you didnt come to me and ive kept my word havent i my dear dear helga it wasnt quite good of you to go away without giving me an opportunity of seeing you again i know i know you had a certain duty to me you know after what had passed hush dear hush but im willing to believe it was the fault of other people dont let us speak of it helga said oscar and his arms which had been about her in a close embrace slackened away and fell it was easier to part with her after that but before he opened the door he kissed her again and when he helped her into the hansom he put her fingers to his lips he stood bareheaded on the pavement oblivious to all surroundings until the cab had rounded the corner of the public house and helga had waved to him through the glass then he became aware that the sight in that sordid slum of so lovely a girl so beautifully dressed and with a hansom waiting for her had brought the neighbors to their doors and that the women were thumbing their apronstrings and grinning to each other across the rails when he reentered the house jenny passed him in the lobby with a stealthy and guilty air which seemed to say that her poor tortured little soul had not resisted the temptation to listen and to watch he returned to the parlor for a moment and the perfume of helgas presence was still to be felt there over the odor of dead ale and tobacco never had he envied the barman before but at that moment he would have given all he possessed to keep this room for the rest of the day that he might sit on the sofa where helga had sat and lay his hand on the table where her hand had rested and kiss the carpet where her feet had trod he was like a man moving in a dream and when he went back to his own apartment he was not conscious of his squalid surroundings the dirty wallpaper the threadbare carpet and the blotched lookingglass humiliated and compromised him no longer his body was still in his bankrupt garret but his soul was far away it was in another worlda world that was bright with helgas eyes as its sun and stars for he was going over again the time he had spent with her every word of it every tone every look every gesture this lasted the whole of the day and when darkness fell a curtain seemed to have fallen on the life he had been living during the past twelve months the mire and slime of vulgar associations the degradation of common companionship the sense of loneliness of friendlessness of being nothing and nobody the deep remembrance of being homeless and hopeless and helpless and uselessall this had gone that passage of his life was over now and never never never would its pain and shame come back to him again he had passed through it because he had sinned but if he had sinned he had suffered and god himself had seen that he had suffered enough his eyes were wet when he lay down on his soiled pillow but he fell asleep in a blissful condition and in the first dream of the night he was back with helga once in the dark hours he awoke and heard the deadened hum of the barman and his friends at their cards and ale and again he awoke in the dawn and then he heard the hearse of the necropolis thundering up short street and rumbling under the archway at the top of it at eleven oclock that morning he went to covent garden and again and again at eleven the following mornings he went there on the tenth morning he called to jenny who had grown shy of him and was leaving his breakfast on a tray outside his door and said jenny i wish you to tell your mistress that i shall be leaving this lodging in another week then jennys white and wistful face broke down utterly and with a crack in her voice and the ghost of a smothered sob in it she said i knowed as it ud come to this the minit i set eyes on er i said as shed take ye away from mean she as vi the governor never knew that oscar had broken faith with him when the time came for the next session of althing a bill for the reform of the constitution reenacting the abolition of the governorship and the appointment of a minister was passed by a large majority but an act involving a constitutional change had to be voted by two parliaments and therefore a dissolution of althing became necessary the time of dissolution was at the discretion of the governor and he might have delayed it until the fever for reform had passed instead of doing so he decided to dissolve immediately thus feeding the agitation and precipitating his own fate many things befall the man whose day is done and the measure of the governors errors was not yet full when the time came to select the candidates it was found that the constituency for which oscar had satthe capitalwas once more without its man and to everybodys astonishment the governor himself in order to secure a voice in the popular assembly determined to stand for it this unusual step on the governors part created great excitement but the fever increased tenfold when it was announced that the factor intended to oppose him never had popular feeling run so high as on the night when the governor and the factor had to confront each other on the same hustings the better people stayed away being sorry and ashamed that these two friends of fifty years should claw each other face to face like eagles but the baser sort were reveling in the prospect of that spectacle and the artisans institute was crowded you learn a lot when your servants quarrel they told each other and they were not to be disappointed the sheriff was in the chair and it was clear from the beginning that his lifelong rivalry of the governor did not prompt him to restrain either candidate from making a fool of himself bad luck is a quick voter and the governor played into the sheriffs hands without suspicion and without delay the once silent and dignified man had lost all reticence and selfcontrol and when his time came to speak he flung innuendoes on every side if you hate a man all his deeds are hateful and coming at length to the factors business life the governor said never is selfishness satisfied my friends will you commit the care of your public purse to one who in order to grasp all is losing all and hurling himself into bankruptcy and want this thrust was received with ironical cheers and counter cheers not unmixed with derisive laughter and when the factors turn came he said with a humorous leer over a face that was white as death a blunt knife should seek the joints and not hack at the solid bone but if it comes to asking conundrums ill ask one also will you commit the care of your public purse to one whose son was banished from the country because he was a forger and a thief this charge against oscar often whispered but never before publicly uttered fell on the reeking crowd with the effect of a thunderbolt and before the audience had recovered from its astonishment the governor was on his feet again against all rule and order saying in a loud voice and will you commit the charge of your public morality to a man who in his youth contracted an alliance with an abandoned woman and only married his mistress after his first daughter had been born a bastard this was the climax of sensation the chewing and spitting crowd were silent save for the sound of their audible breathing which was like the hissing inwash of an ebbing wave the factor was pallid and speechless as if the governors cruel word had struck all sensibility as well as sneering out of his face while the governor faced him with bloodshot eyes and blazing cheeks and lips that quivered convulsively thus the two men stood for a long moment with scarcely a yards space between them and then a big man was seen to be parting the people at the back of the platform and coming forward with great strides it was magnus and he was making for his father as if to take him forcibly away but before the governor had seen him or could be conscious of his presence another hand an unseen hand had been laid upon his shoulder with a blow on the brain that was like a stroke from heaven the governor had realized that in returning the insult of the factor in his mad wrath and blind passion he had outraged the memory of thora and that thora was in her grave and he had loved her better than any human soul that was not of his own flesh and blood then the noisome place in its ghastly silence spun round him and with a low whine like that of a poisoned dog he fell heavily to the floor magnus took him up and carried him homehe had a stroke of paralysis there was only one nomination for the capital the factor was returned unopposed and when the writs came back from the country it was found that the reform party had a larger majority than before the governor made a slow recovery but he was moving about by the time that althing was next in session and when the constitutional question came up again he hobbled down to parliament house on two sticks in spite of all remonstrance and took a seat in his little room overlooking the legislative chamber the debate was short and not exciting and no one looked toward the alcove in which the governor sat in his faded uniform a doddering shadow of his old authority but many cruel sallies of clumsy wit were aimed in that direction the governor grew more and more indignant and at length he rose frothing at the lips to protest against unmerited insult and was put down by the speaker who had formerly been his own private secretary the act was passed by acclamation there was much cheering with the usual nine hurrahs after god save the king and then the fallen man was carried home in the middle of the night he had a second seizure and he never left his room again but as soon as he had recovered his speech he occupied his time dictating petitions to the king praying him not to give his sanction to an act that was designed to degrade his servant after a few weeks magnus came to persuade his father and mother to leave government house and make their home at the farm its of no use to resist parliament sir he said the new minister will be appointed presently and why should you wait until he turns you out come to thingvellirim strong i can work for all of us but his father flew at him in a fury how dare you make such a proposition he said and how dare you show your face in this house dont you know that you have been the cause of everything if it had not been for what you did at the beginning none of this mischief would have happened as for the new minister if he comes here to turn me out tell him to bring my coffin with himdo you hear metell him to bring my coffin the idea that magnus was really to blame for all that had occurred being the first cause and origin of the trouble grew upon the governor day by day so that oscar seemed to be without fault and even came to be regarded as a martyr he called upon anna to read oscars letter to him again and when he had heard it a second time he was so seized by the idea that the prime minister of england was a friend of his sons that he had himself propped up in bed in order that he might write to oscar with his own hand calling on him to defeat his fathers enemies you have great influence now oscar and you must save your father from the machinations of these malicious scoundrels of whom the worst and most devilish is the factor that was what he thought he was writing but his poor brain was far gone by this time and the paper he scribbled on over the counterpane was merely covered with unintelligible curves and strokes which anna could not send on to oscar when it seemed certain that the intensity of the governors wrath would kill him and that he would die with nothing in his heart but hatred of the factor anna and aunt margret put their heads together and thought of a way to soften his feelings and sweeten his end it centered in the child as before a little child shall lead them they said they took little elin to the governors bedroom and left her to play on the floor she had grown to be the sweetest thing with an angels face a little beam of spring sunshine that ran about the room and talked but the only effect of her presence was to make the sick man stretch his arms to a safe near the head of his bed and take out a roll of papers nobody knew what the papers were except that they were old and that they crinkled in his stiff fingers he kept them under his pillow at all times save when his bed was being made and then he smuggled them into the breast of his nightshirt when the women talked of elin and all her pretty ways and sweet mysteries of childish makebelieve the governor talked of oscar although his memory was confused about recent events it was wondrously clear about distant ones and he had countless stories of oscar as a child some of them were humorous and he would laugh at them as well as he could with his distorted face but all were meant to show that oscar was not like other children and when he had come to an end he would say my son is a great man now as i always said he would be and when he gets my letter youll see what he will do meantime the act had been sent over to denmark and the sheriff had been called across to copenhagen there was only one thing that this could mean and in the absence of telegraphic communication the little capital sat waiting for the return of the steamer that was to bring the sheriff back she was due on a sunday night and the bellringers of the cathedral stood ready to ring a peal in honor of the new minister the governor heard that the laura was expected and he conceived the idea that oscar was coming with her to bring the kings veto and to scatter his fathers enemies he was very ill that day and doctor olesen had said he might not last until morning but he would have nobody to nurse him and magnus who had come at his mothers call but dared not show his face to his father sat on the stairs outside the door aunt margret was coming and going during the whole of the day and toward evening the factor himself was seen tramping to and fro outside the house looking up at intervals at the governors windows with a face in which the madness of love and fear was fighting with the greater madness of pride and wrath at length anna went out to him and said oscar neilsen come into the house to see your old friend not till he asks menot till he asks me said the factor whereupon anna went indoors again and whispered over the bed of the dying man stephen the factor is outside and he only wants to be asked to come in he must come in on his knees then said the governor and that was the end of everything the steamer did not arrive that night and the bellringers went to bed but at daybreak when the fishingboats in the bay were breaking through a veil of mist and the sunlight was glistening on the mountaintops the bells began to ring merrily for the laura was sailing up the fiord with flags floating from stem to stern magnus heard the bells and then a shuffling movement in his fathers bedroom a little later he heard the hurrahs of people cheering in the streets and then a smothered echo of the same sound at the other side of his fathers door hurrah hurrah cried the people outside hura hura huraa echoed the voice within at the next moment the house shook as with a heavy fall and magnus burst into his fathers bedroom his father lay in his nightshirt on the floor he was dead but his face was smiling and in his withered hands were the crinkled papers on which oscar in his boyhood had scribbled his childish compositions later the same day magnus wrote to oscar this is to tell you that our father died this morning i think he died happy but the mail did not leave until the end of the week and under magnuss message anna wrote for herself he loved you to the last and we hav berrid him next to our dere thora vii when oscar received the news of his fathers death he was near the close of what he had believed to be the happiest period of his life his success as a leader of orchestra had been substantial and immediate and when the concerts at covent garden came to an end he had been offered engagements in other quarters there didnt i know what i was talking about helga said but this is nothing to the reputation you will make when you consent to appear as a composer ah that is past praying for oscar answered with a shake of the head but all the same he was pleased and happy on leaving his dismal lodgings in short street he took rooms in the same house with helga and finsen at the corner of piccadilly and the green park there the three friends lived the innocent lives of children observing few of the restrictions which society imposes on the manners and conduct of men and women helgas sittingroom was the general rendezvous and the men used it with the utmost freedom oscar in particular was nearly always to be found there except in the mornings when helga was at the academy and in the evenings when he was himself at the theater no hour was too early and hardly any hour too late for oscar to call on helga he ate with her played with her sang with her read with her and helped her with her lessons mozart cherubini ouseley macfarren parry and again mozarttheir work was all play and their play was all music helga was more than satisfied that oscar should be always with her always assisting her always praising and encouraging and inspiring her and he on his part was entirely happy to devote himself to her service to think for a moment that this was all she wished for all she wanted with him was more than his heart was capable of on their off days and nights they went to other concerts and operahouses attended the english cathedral services and the masses at catholic oratories heard the old masterpieces over and over again became familiar with nearly every new opera oratorio symphony and voluntary and studied the methods of most of the great singers and players who appeared in london it was one long feast of music eaten at the table of love they had their social pleasures too and kept open house on sundays sometimes they supped or dined at restaurants with their new friends who were chiefly finsens friends and then brought their hosts back to helgas rooms for cards and conversation until one two or three oclock in the morning it was a reckless irresponsible unconventional life a little like the life oscar had lived at college a little like the life helga had lived with her mother at copenhagen and more than a little dangerous though they never thought of that oscar found only one cause for uneasiness and that concerned finsen a certain pride which he felt at first in finsens interest in the girl he loved the girl who loved him soon gave place to jealousy he was jealous of finsens hold over helga his control of her career his power over her destiny little by little this became a gnawing anxiety until at length every pleasant word helga exchanged with finsen and every smile she gave him seemed to go to oscars heart like a stab he spoke to her on the subject and she only laughed at him for his folly her endearing words and caresses dissipated his uneasiness for a time but it always came back sometimes it seemed to him that finsen presumed on his position as the one who was finding the ways and means and that finsens friends interpreted this attitude according to the morality of the atmosphere they lived in at length to ease the secret gnawing at his heart oscar proposed that they should marry why not there was no longer any impediment and there would be an end of damaging misconceptions remembering the past he thought helga would have received his proposal with delight but times had changed since they were together in iceland and a cheerless smile hung about her lips as she shook her head she showed him how fatal marriage at this stage would be to a girl in her positionfatal to her aims her ambitions her standing with the public and above all with the men to whom she had to look for favorsuntil he felt almost as much ashamed as if he had proposed a guilty thing but why should you be jealous she said approaching him to embrace him if he is so there may certainly be some cause she put her arms about his neck and added business is business you know and i may have to do things in the future which neither of us could wishunless she whispered laying her head on his breast my bad boy will at length consent to be true to himself and to his genius and promise to write the great works i know he can write and let me sing them all over the world then she cried with passion while her eyes shone and her arms clutched his neck then he will see what i can do to this and such as this oscar answered no no or its impossible or dont let us talk of it but helgas endearing words and caresses again and again repeated were like the water from sunny streams which trickles between the snow and the frozen rock and brings down the avalanche at last the days passedthey kept no count of themsix months a year a year and a half and at length the time approached when helga according to the program which had been mapped out for her was to leave the academy of music and begin her lessons in paris the prospect of an early separation was a constant nightmare to oscar who was striving in vain to devise schemes to prevent it when that secret play of fate which men call chance helped out by the blind strivings of human passion brought him unexpectedly to the end he aimed at one day finsen came dashing into helgas sittingroom with his mouth full of news the syndicate which held the theater and casino in one of the principal towns of the riviera had applied to him to recommend a leader of orchestra who should be capable of controlling a season of opera he had recommended oscar his recommendation had been accepted and it had been left to him to conclude terms with the companys servant and to despatch him without delay if a desire to separate oscar from helga had been a part of finsens plan his hopes were instantly frustrated for helga herself cried splendid but if oscar is to control the opera season why cant i go also he can put me into small parts under an assumed name in that distant place where i can never be recognized and that will be better practise for the stage than all the actingclasses in christendom admirable idea shouted oscar and finsennot halfconvincedwas compelled to agree it was while oscars heart rode high on this last freak of fortune while he was preparing for his flight to the riviera and while helga was writing to paris to postpone her lessons that the letter came from iceland and fell on him like a thunderbolt the sight of a blackedged envelope addressed in magnuss handwriting sent the blood rushing to his head it was long before he could gather courage to open it feeling numb and faint he put the letter in his pocket and went out into the park to breathe and to think he had not written to his mother since the early days in his first lodging being afraid to write from short street from dread of disclosing his poverty or from piccadilly from fear of saying anything about helga as a consequence he had heard nothing from home since annas letter the only news that had reached him had come through finsen by way of his father and concerned public matters chieflythe fall of the barter trade the passing of the new act and the progress of the elections some one belonging to him was deadwho could it be for no other reason than that little elin was the youngest and frailest he concluded that it must be the child his poor motherless darling he reproached himself with having thought so little of her amid the appeals of an absorbing passion yet he had thought of her he had thought he would go back for her some day as it was his right and duty to do and so make amends to thora in the care and love he would bestow on her child but perhaps that atonement was impossible now and his sweet child was with her mother in heaven oscar thought that of all disasters that could befall him at home the death of his child would be the worst but when at length he opened his letter and found that it was his father who was gone from him his grief was greater still his dear father who had loved him better perhaps than any one else in the world and whom he had rewarded the worst he remembered the forgery and felt choked with shame he thought of the promise to break with helga and felt crushed by remorse his father who had pampered him and cherished such high hopes for him that should never be realized never justified now was dead far away in iceland and had loved him to the last sitting on a bench under a tree he was trying to read again as well as he could for the fading light and the blinding mist in his eyes the written sob of his mothers misspelled postscript when a parkkeeper touched him on the shoulder to say the gates were closing and then the dull hum of londons burrowing mazes fell on his ear again helga had expected him in her room that afternoon to make the last arrangements for their journey but the sun set the evening closed the night fell and he did not come next morning he walked in with drooping head and a dejected step and she saw that something had occurred you have had bad news oscarwhat is it my father is dead he answered and after that they sat for some moments without speaking then helga recovered herselfher brain had been going like a flywheeland she said scarcely above her breath well what do you intend to do i intend to go hack said oscar back to iceland yesto my mother and my child he lifted his eyes and looked at her and at the sight of her face so full of pain and disappointment the blood rushed from his heart and he said helga why shouldnt you go with me why shouldnt we marry and go back together i know it is a good deal to ask dear but we should be everything to each other and i should make up to you for any sacrifice by my devotion and love what matter if we have to forget our cherished dreams and aspirations life is the fulfilment of duty and our duty is at homemine is at all eventsand if you will share it if you will go back with me he stopped suddenly and dropped his head on his hands and his elbows on his knees with every word he uttered the impossibility and folly of what he proposed forced itself upon him and the blood that had flamed up to his head fell back to the depths of his heart helga sat a moment without speaking then she said in a steady voice im sorry very sorry but its impossible if i had nothing and nobody else to think about i should have to think of neils he has spent money upon me and i have given him a contract therefore i cant run away from him like that oscar drew deep gasping breaths and answered then i must go alone it will be hard terribly hard but i must go there is the mortgagei must take up that burden now that my father is gonei can not let anybody else be borne down by it and then there is the childive not done too much for her hitherto and it is my duty my sacred duty the child is all right oscar aunt margret is taking care of her nothing you could do for the little mite would be half as good as is being done for her already as for the mortgage you can bear that burden just as well in england as in iceland betterfar better youll earn more money hereten times a hundred times more and then think of the difficulty of beginning over again under the old conditions everybody must know everything by this time they doi know they do she rose and standing over him she stroked his hairthe uncombed curls of his fair hairand said softly no no dear you can never go back to iceland until you go back rich and famous and you may i say you may and then i too perhaps but he covered his ears with his hands for what helga was saying sounded like mockery meantime you can not think of leaving meespecially now when i want your help so badlyand when everything depends upon itmy work and my future she dropped to her knees by his side and put her arms around his neck say you will not leave me dearest say you will not she loaded him with caresses she addressed him by every endearing name she conquered him he felt that the impulse to go back to icelandthe impulse of dutywas overcome by the rapture of love and that he must stay where helga was whatever happened i belong to you body and soul helgado as you like with me he said and you will go to the riviera yes if he had known what he was saying he would rather have called upon the river to carry him to its lowest depths and count him in the deathroll of its damned but none of us can foresee the future we must all bow before the unknown viii the engagement on the riviera was completely successful and oscar covered himself with honor but when the opera season came to an end he declined all offers to come back finsen was there under cover of professional and fraternal interest he had made frequent visits to oscar and helga during the course of the season and at the close of it he was staying at the same hotel oscar was nervous fretful and unhappy the secret gnawing anxiety which had oppressed him in london had returned with redoubled force helgas love of the gaiety and grandeur of the life of the riviera was only too evident and finsen set himself to feed it he fed it by every art and resource of a full purse and an open hand races regattas fetes flowershe gave her everything that was being enjoyed by other women living in abundance oscar protested but she laughed at his protests or tried to coax him out of his jealousy her caresses and endearments were beginning to fail of their old effect in spite of himself he was beginning to feel a certain contempt for her and at some moments even a sort of hatred which tore his heart to pieces for his own part oscar hated the life of the riviera what nature had done for the place was good but what man had done was bad the soft air the blue sky the deep blue sea the smiling gardens the flowers the oleanders the orange groves the scent of the resin and then the still nights and the nightingalecould anything be more enchanting yet this paradise of nature this godblest corner of the earth was degraded by every gross desire that was at war with beauty and art and genius and the everlasting laws of life but oscars hatred of the riviera was due to a cause more personal than his moral revolta poignant memory of the past in the casino which stood in the middle of the gardens beyond the brilliant hall and the noisy orchestra there was an inner room guarded by keeneyed doorkeepers and watched by spies where men and women sat about a greentopped table in a dusky and clammy silence and at the end of that room in the darkest part of it there was an alcove almost covered by palms where two persons could sit unseen helga and he had once sat there and she had pleaded with him to do something that his soul shrank from and he had done it why not she had said he will never hear of it and it will only be a matter of form my luck must change it must and then we will pay back this money and everything will be wiped out do oscar for me please from fear of reviving this memory oscar had avoided the casino during his present visit that was easy enough to do while the opera season lasted but when it was over and his work no longer wanted him it was hard to see helga go off with finsen night after night and to wander round the casino like an uneasy spirit that could find no rest while they were inside of it the jealousy that was rankling in his breast could not bear that ordeal long and when helga said what nonsense you neednt playwhy should you he followed her into the gamblinghouse he saw the usual sights there and found the usual company gathered about the tablesall middleclass whatever their rank and stationthe middleclass financier the middleclass millionaire the middleclass baron the middleclass peer the middleclass duchess smoking her cigarettes and then the prostitute in her feathers and the blackleg in his diamonds as well as reputable men and virtuous women for the gamblinghouse knows no distinctions of means or morality or intellect and is the high court of the devils democracy on the night of oscars first visit helga played and lost and seeing the strained look in her face his very soul felt sick and he walked out into the gardens on the second night she lost again and he saw her borrow from finsen who stood behind her on the third night it was finsen who played and he won largely and then helga who sat by his side seemed to be intoxicated by excitement and delight next day she showed him a costly jewel which finsen had bought for her out of his winnings for luck she said and when oscar protested against the present she said but why shouldnt i take it every penny he spends on me makes me more necessary to him for the future come dear dont be jealous didnt i tell you that i should have to do things that neither of us could wish at this and such as this oscars sense of shame was choking him his feeling for helga was now in a perpetual alternation between love and hate he loved her he hated her he despised her he was proud of her and this red riot in his blood was driving him to despair at one moment he thought her nature was utterly selfish and that she would sacrifice anything and anybody to gain her ends at the next moment he believed she loved him with an unselfish love but that her disposition was such that she had to struggle between her love for him and her love for luxury and success and therefore she was as much an object for pity as himself sometimes when he walked in the gardens of the casino he remembered how thora had suffered as he was suffering now and then while the nightingale sang unseen above his head and the peace of the night soothed his soul he told himself he was rightly punished as he had done so he was being done by and now the manly thing was to leave helga and go away and then if she loved him she would suffer too and that would be his best revenge but at other times when he saw helga wearing the bracelets and brooches which finsen had given her he felt that flight was impossible that he must fight this man with his own weapons and subdue this woman on her own terms yet how was he to do it when he asked himself that question one answer and one only came back to him with every breath he drew in that atmosphere of gamblers the old delusive mocking answerhe must do it by means of play but while he had money enough for his own needs he had none for the gamblingtable and it was not at first that he saw a way to the means with which to begin suddenly an idea came to himhe would make the man himself find the meansand without waiting to consider this without pausing to count the cost with his pulses throbbing painfully and his heart leaping with a devilish joy he hurried into the casino and drew finsen aside to the alcove covered by palms and said in a false and tremulous voice old friend do you remember the first time i called on you at covent garden when you said you were starvingperfectly you offered me something if i would sell you some compositions of mine that are buried in iceland and you said you would die in a ditch first would you still be disposed to take your chance with them why not my father is minister nowthere ought to be no difficulty and you would be prepared to pay me the money at once certainlyas soon as you are ready to sign the necessary authorization im ready to sign it now said oscar in the same tremulous voice within ten minutes everything was settled and oscar was pocketing the notes that were being paid on finsens account from the treasury of the casino his hands were trembling his lips quivering and his face was white so youre caught by the fever at last old fellow laughed finsen and what you wouldnt do before to feed your stomach you are doing now to feed your luck just so to feed my luck said oscar that night oscar played carefully and won the following night he played more freely and won again on the third night he took the bank and won once more he took the bank on the fourth fifth sixth and many succeeding nights with the same result such a rapid and unbroken run of luck had scarcely ever been seen the manager of the casino a plausible person with a rubicund face congratulated oscar the house had rarely had a banker so popular as well as so fortunate and it rejoiced in his success meantime oscar was never for a moment his own man he seemed to be laboring under a wild intoxication of soul in a fortnight he had become rich but he had no love for money for himself and he heaped it upon helga there were presents to outshine finsens excursions in steam launches and in automobiles and even some social entertainments the winsome and remarkablelooking young leader of the opera with his handsome if reckless sisterinlaw became objects of attention they gave one or two dinners in the restaurant of the casino where the rich of all nations ate their food in the glitter of a thousand diamonds and to the music of an orchestra in red coats and black silk stockings then the change camethe inevitable change one night it became evident that the tide of oscars luck had turned he did not flinchhe doubled his risk and played on the ebb set in with frightful rapidity and every night he increased his stakes and lost his money with a smile at the end of a week helga who had been transported with rapture became pallid with alarm your luck is leaving youhadnt you better stop she said but he would not listen he touched bottom at last sitting in his usual seat he called for fresh counters and said with a laugh life or deaththis is my last do you mean that said helga and he nodded and laughed again finsen had been punting silently at the other side of the table and now helga went over to him and stood behind his chair it was only the straw that told how the wind was blowing but oscar saw it and his twitching face grew red the inscrutable gods of chance seemed to hover over the table a greater risk than that of money depended on the issue of the nest coup and both men knew it when the cards had been cut oscar served them slowly very slowly and when he came to the last card his trembling fingers seemed loath to turn it he turned it at last with a rapid movement and at the same moment he rose from his seat and laughed he had lost and the clammy silence was broken are you going asked helga in a listless tone with wandering eyes certainly and you not yetneils is winning splendidly then in a moment as in the twinkling of an eye his monthlong intoxication of soul left him and he saw where he was and what he had done he had taken money from finsen to permit the grave of his wife to be opened and he had gambled with that money and lost it when he saw things in this way he could scarcely stand upright but with an effort he walked out of the gamblingroom down the corridor where the spies were watching past the restaurant where the sluggards were smoking through the hall where the band was playing and out into the garden there he looked for a dark place and sat on a bench under a tree the night was clear and quiet the stars were out and the sea was singing in the distance but he could hear nothing except an owl that was hooting somewhere in the eaves oh for the snows of his own country to cool his hot forehead oh for the storms of iceland to silence the babel in his brain when he thought of his conduct he hated himself and when he remembered his temptation he hated helga also the one hatred counteracted the other or he would have destroyed himself he must live if only to subdue helga to bring her to his feet and then to cast her off forever how was he to do this there was one way but it was closed to himclosed by the vow he had made when he stood by the open coffin of his wife and in punishment of himself for having neglected her and sinned against her he had sworn before god to bury his ambitions in her grave and never write another line of music as long as he lived if he could only wipe out that vow if he could only begin again if he could only say to himself some day oscar stephenson is dead but that could never be and oscar stephenson must go on to the end trailing the slag of his burnedout life behind him deciding to return to england immediately he walked back to the hotel and asked for his bill when it was given to him he found that the money remaining in his purse was hardly sufficient to discharge his debt and pay the expense of his journey without a moments thought he sat down and wrote to helga dear helgai want to go back to london by the midnight train and i find i am a little short for my railway ticket send me a hundred francs by the messenger who brings you this letter and for mercys sake do not keep him too long waitingi can not live in this place another night oscar he had lavished so many presents upon her that he never dreamt she could refuse him but this was the answer that came back dearest oscarhow unlucky ive just this very minute lost my last sou and you dont like me to borrow from finsen but you bad boy you can not be in earnest about going off at midnight its impossible your devoted helga oscar had nothing that he could turn into money except his watch and that was his fathers gift and all he had to remember him by but after a sharp struggle he called for the manager and parted with his keepsake when his bill was paid and his luggage ready the clock across the gardens was striking eleven he had still an hour to spare and bitterly as he felt toward helga he could not go away without saying goodby to her so he walked for that purpose by the shore road to the side door of the casino it was there that his fate encountered him ix as he was going into the casino he met the manager who greeted him effusively ah mr stephenson they told me you were going awayim glad to see it isnt true it is quite true sir said oscar why should you the season isnt at an end yet but my money is said oscar whereupon the manager laughed put his arm through oscars and walked back with him toward the baccaratroom whispering mr stephenson i told you the house liked to see you take the hank the game is good when you are in the chair now there are a few gentlemen here tonight who would play high if they had the proper inducement dont go mr stephenson but im pennilessdont you understand mepenniless come this way they were in the baccaratroom by this time and the manager was drawing oscar toward the alcove i must ask you to excuse me i have a lady to speak to and my train to catch said oscar listen for a moment said the manager and then with a glance toward the company who stood absorbed and silent under the bright light in the middle of the room he added in a low voice mr stephenson i suggest that you return to the table and take the bank when you call for counters they will be provided if you lose your first coup the loss will be the loss of the house and if you win the gain will be your own oscar laughed and chopping the air impatiently with a pair of gloves which he carried in his hand he said do you run this house on philanthropic lines then hush at your second coup you will call for fresh cards as you have a right to do and when you receive them youyou will win you understand me you will win the impatient chopping ceased and oscar stood looking steadfastly at the mans eyes at your next coup and your next you will call for cards as before and at the end of your fourth coup you will rise from the table and then then you will divide your earnings with the house and be richer than you have ever been in your life oscar had listened first with astonishment then with indignation and finally with ungovernable wrath how dare you what do you take me for he said in a loud choking voice and lifting his hand he smote the man with his gloves across his ruddy and smiling face the unexpectedness of the attack compelled the manager to utter a startled cry and in a moment the people from the table were crowding round asking what is it whats happened but the manager recovered himself in an instant and said its nothing the gentleman misunderstood something i was saying to him i beg of you to resume the play helga had come up with the rest and when the others had returned to the table she drew oscar into the alcove and said tell me what occurred he told her and still trembling with unsatisfied anger he added this is what i have come down to helgathat a man can think it safe to make a proposal to me like that can you wonder that i want to get out of this placethis atmosphere of cheats and cheating and yet people talk of the honor of the gamblinghouse they might as well talk of the morality of hell helga was sitting with her head down and her fingerswhich sparkled with some of oscars presentsinterlaced upon her knee you might have spared me one of these helga he said touching her rings we could have replaced it some day whereas ive had to part with the watch my father gave me and i can never replace that i didnt want you to go oscar thats why i didnt send you the hundred francsi didnt want you to go away without me do you mean that helga really mean it you do then come with me now i came to say goodby but how can i leave you behind in a place like this it will destroy you as it has destroyed others it will sap away your health and spirit and talent and charm and everything a woman wants to keep helga he said rising to his feet i am nearly distracted by what has occurred tonight but i know what i am saying if you will throw in your lot with mewith me onlyi will devote my whole life to your welfare and do everything you wish if there is anything you want me to do for you i will do it do you understand me helga yes oscar then let us go back to londonto our own world our own work helga i should like todearly like to then why not if i throw in my lot with youwith you onlyi must break with finsenand im in finsens debt i know oh i know if i could only repay him somehow but i have nothing you have your jewels helga they are not enough and besides how could i part with a present of yours oscar but if there were any other way of getting money helga what are you thinking of i am thinking that if this is an atmosphere of cheats and cheating perhaps you have been cheated also helga his voice was tremulous with protest would it be so very wrong to do to them as they have done to you oscar helga helga his tremulous voice was breaking into gasps of helplessness i suppose it would but how happy i should be if we could go back together and live for each other and our art and have nothing and nobody else to think about oscar was standing by her side and quivering like a frightened horse there were some moments of silence in which nothing could be heard but the call of the croupier in the middle of the room then a waiter went noiselessly by the mouth of the alcove carrying an empty tray to his own quarters and by a sudden impulse in a thick croupy voice oscar called to him garcon my compliments to the manager say i am sorry for what occurred just now and if he is still of the same mind i will take the bank a few minutes later oscar who had thrown off his overcoat and hat was taking the bankers chair at the baccarattable the people seated about it welcomed him with nods and smiles and when he called for counters and received a huge pile of ivory ones a baldheaded man with a sinister face said i congratulate you sir it isnt everybody who can revive his credit as quickly as that what does it mean whispered finsen to helga whereupon helga whispered back dont ask me yet and then she walked up to oscar and stood close behind his chair there were a few strange faces about the table including an english lord and an american financier the manager of the casino stood watching from the back stakes were high for the first coup and the bank lost it im afraid the luck is still against you sir said the baldheaded man ill try again said oscar fresh cards please the stakes were higher for the second coup and the bank won it thats better said the baldheaded man another pack of cards please said oscar when the money was on the table for the third coup it was seen to be double what it had been for the second the bank won once more but this is like your old luck sir said the baldheaded man another pack cried oscar and he swept all his winnings into the bank the money for the fourth coup was four times what it had been for the third the bank won again and then oscar rose from the table but arent you going to give us our revenge sir asked the american this is mine said oscar as he left the chair helgas face was quivering with excitement and delight there were tears in her eyes as she congratulated oscar and she looked as if she were going to kiss him if you will step this way mr stephenson the managers suave voice was saying when all at once a commotion broke out behind croupier said a voice with a nasal accent i will trouble you to examine them cards whereupon the manager swung round with an aggrieved expression surely sir you do not mean to say to imply i can only say ill trouble the croupier to examine them last three packs of cards in the confusion that followed finsen came up to helga who was now trembling by oscars side and said you had better let me take you out of this oscar saw helga hesitate then take one step away from him and stop but when somebody in the throng about the table cried excitedly the bank ought to be impounded he saw her drop her head and follow finsen out of the room come this way mr stephenson whispered the manager and while most of the company were still crowding about the croupier he halfled halfpushed oscar through a small door to a private corridor and a moment afterward there was a roar from the other side of it stay here leave everything to me ill do the best i can said the manager and then oscar found himself alone in a small room quite dark and silent save for the glimmering of lamps in the garden and the deadened rumble of the tumult he had left behind how long he stayed there he never knew it seemed like an hour but it could hardly have been more than a few minutes the tumult grew louder then there was the report of a pistolshot and then the noises frayed off to silence unable to restrain himself any longer and delirious with a wild desire to face the consequences of his conduct whatever they might be oscar was opening the door of his room when the manager returned to it bringing his hat overcoat and gloves ive done the best i could for you said the manager panting and gasping i have told them you have shot yourself and your friends have supported that explanation you must get away at once you must catch the midnight train to paris youve only four minutes but youll do it if you run here is a secondclass ticket to london good night and remember said the man as oscar was passing through a private door to the garden rememberoscar stephenson is dead x oscar was just able to control his faculties long enough to reach the railwaystation find the train and search out an empty secondclass compartment and then he collapsed utterly he was like a beast that has been smitten in the shambles and is shattered in every sense and nerve looking up at the lamp in the roof and seeing smoke floating above it he thought at first the carriage must be afire but looking again the smoke was gone and then he knew his sight had suffered and he supposed he must be going blind there was a roaring noise in his ears and he thought it was the roaring of the train but when the train stopped the noise continued and then he knew that his hearing was injured and he supposed he must be going deaf two officials came into the carriage to examine the tickets but though he saw their lips moving he could not hear what they said or rightly grasp what they wanted until they were turning to go and then the noise in his head slid off for a moment and he heard one of them say to the other drunk poor devil this lasted through the dark hours of the night and when the morning dawned his experiences were yet more terrible at the first gleam of light his stunned soul awoke and with a sharp pain like the afterpain of a bullet wound he realized where he was and what he was doing he was flying from the consequences of perhaps the most base and infamous conduct a man could be capable ofconduct the more base and infamous because there was no law to punish it low as he had sunk hitherto he had never sunk so low as this this was as low as man could go and live in the face of other men and the eye of the light and he had descended to this depth he oscar stephenson son of the governor of his country when he thought of his father he thanked god that death had taken him before this disgrace befell every artery in his body seemed to bleed every tendon to be torn when the sun rose on him in his ghastly solitude it seemed to sere his very brain and he pulled the blind down to shut it out then the women passengers began to move about the corridor of the train and he thought of helga although it seemed so long ago as almost to belong to another existence he could still see her frightened face as she sidled away from him last night and left him standing alone at that hideous moment when it seemed certain that he must pay the penalty of the offense to which she had tempted him he despised her for her cowardice he loathed her for her treachery he hated her for herself and he told himself that never again as long as he lived should love of helga hold dominion over him at one moment he found himself cursing her at the next he found himself weeping could it be helga whom he was thinking of like this helga who had been so much to him during so many years who had come so very close to him nearer than his father nearer than his mother nearerheaven forgive himthan his wife or child helga who had been with him early and late a soft voice always at his ear a sweet presence always at his heart a spirit a support an inspiration helga whom he had loved and should always love let her do what she would with him let him do what he would with her god pity him god help him yet his tenderness and tears were stronger than his hatred and rage and he resolved that for her perfidy and selfishness helga should be punished and that he should punish her there was no longer any need to ask himself how this was to be done the words that had rumbled in his ears like the roll of a muffled drum when he ran from the gardens of the casino were rumbling in his ears still oscar stephenson is dead at first he could not be sure that the manager had really spoken them so exactly did they echo the wish that had been bubbling within his own breast but oscar stephenson was dead indeed and the words that might have crushed him with shame moved him more than a trumpet if oscar stephenson was dead then the vow he had made in thoras deathchamber was dead also that vow had been intended to punish himself for his infidelity and for all his failures of love and duty by denying himself the gratification of his greatest pride the realization of his highest hopes but what pride could be gratified and what hopes realized to oscar stephenson if his name was wiped out his identity lost and he was dead to all the world except himself the feverish soul in its hour of suffering found the reasoning sufficient and oscar thought he saw as in a glass everything that he had to do he had to take another name to bury himself in london and to set to work on the only task he was fit for he had to write an opera as he was now free to do since oscar stephenson was dead and he was living in the name of another man the scene was to be in his own country among the lonesome grandeur of its untrodden glaciers and the stark sublimity of its burnedout plains and the story was to be from one of the fiery sagas of the same stern old land and when after many days many months perhaps years eating the bread of poverty in loneliness and obscurity he had finished his task and had sent it out like a dove from the ark men were to know that a new voice had come among them and the name of iceland was to be on the lips of the world then when people asked each other who was he that in the darkness of years of labor had learned all the art and mystery of music he would give no sign because his lips would be sealed but there would be one who would read his secret it would be helga and she would come back to him in shame if not remorse and throw herself at his feet and cry i did wrong forgive me and take me back to your heart and then he would answer and say you came between me and my sweet young wife you persuaded me to the act that broke her heart and killed her you tempted me to the crime that ruined my father and to the offense that destroyed myself and then you left me to bear my punishment alone therefore i have wiped you out of my life i have cut you off as i would cut off a rotten limb that threatened to drag the whole body down to death i love youyes i can never cease to love youthat is the punishment i shall always bearbut there can be nothing more between uswe part now foreveryour course lies that way mine this farewell as the train rolled along he found a delirious joy in this prospect which began and ended with the idea that oscar stephenson was dead in the light of that thought he looked back on the past of his life and many things that had been hard to understand became plain again and again he had tried to stop on his downward course and he could not do so before he could rise out of the degradation of his past life he had had to drink his cup to the dregs to go down to the depths to be covered by darkness and the shadow of death but at last oscar stephenson was dead thank god thank god how strange that at the moment when helga was tempting him to the infamous act which if it had succeeded would have made him her slave and the slave of sin forever she was leading him by one of deaths terrific strides to life and liberty how mysterious and how mighty aye and how cynical also were the powers of destiny whose supernatural wings hovered over the lives of men and women and moved their little motives of love and hate and revenge and selfishness like pawns on the chessboard of fate it was in this mood he reached paris and having some three hours to wait before his train started for calais he walked through the streets until he came to the center of the city and then sat outside a cafe to eat a roll of bread and drink a cup of coffee it was six oclock and the newsvendors were crying the evening papers he bought one to beguile the time of waiting and had not yet opened it when he saw his own name standing out from the front page as if it had been printed in a different ink for some moments thereafter a mist seemed to float between the newspaper and his eyes but he read the paragraph at last it was a telegram from nice headed suicide in a casino giving a mangled version of the events of last night clearly inspired by the manager to protect himself and his house and closing with the words the deceased who was from iceland is understood to be a son of the late muchrespected governorgeneral of that country xi the paper slipped from oscars fingers and his transport of rapture passed he told himself that this report would go far that it would reach iceland that his mother would hear of it and that his child would be told that she was fatherless little elin was too young to feel grief but could he allow his mother to believe that he was dead and to weep for him as for one who was lost to her forever that would be too cruel it would be impossible he would write to his mother immediately he would write privately saying he was still alive and that part of the report was untrue but then came the chilling thought that though he might dispose of the fiction of his death he could not get rid of the fact of his offense and that when his mother pictured him as one who was flying from the consequences of his conduct skulking in a slum and hiding his face from the faces of his friends there would be something in the shame of that end more bitter than death itself and even his own mother would wish that he had died he had not thought of this before and in the confusion and pain of it he got up from the table at the cafe and began to walk the streets again after a while he found himself ascending the steps of the madeline hardly knowing what he was doing except that he was trying to pass the time by following a stream of people into the building it was the hour of benediction the most beautiful the most tender the most moving of all the offices of the catholic church the congregation were chiefly women and among ladies in silks whose carriages stood outside were some flowersellers from the flowermarket round the corner for there is only one caste in the commune of the cross one poor woman who took a chair and knelt close beside oscar had the sad and stormbeaten face that the cross draws to it in every church in the country for its empire is the empire of the oppressed and bereaved and brokenhearted somebodys mother thought oscar as she crossed herself and sighed but when she raised her weary eyes to the figure of the worldmother above the altar her sad face softened and smiled and it was almost as if an angel had come down and whispered to her then as the sweet music swelled through the great church the hard lump rose to oscars throat and thinking of his own mother so far away he told himself that if she believed he was really dead the angel of death would comfort her his faults would be forgiven his errors would be forgotten and the dust of death would cover all his transgressions she would be happier in his death than she had ever been in his life and though it was a sore thing to think of that the pain would be his not hers and her poor heart would be at ease he thought of magnus too how his hatred would be appeased when he heard that his brother was dead and all the flames of his rage extinguished then he thought of his enemies at home how they would cease to revile him and how he would pass out of shame reproach and contempt into the charity of silence and the peace of forgetfulness finally he thought of his little elin his sweet motherless daughter how she would hear no more hard words spoken of her father but would grow up to think of him merely as one who had died early oh blessed and merciful death which can make those who hate us hate us less and those who love us love us more it was bitter to comfort himself with the thought that he was deaddead in disgrace and in a foreign country with no mothers tears falling on his face and no child weeping by his side that tragic consolation of the dying but just at that moment the music ceased the bell tinkled at the altar and raising his eyes as the priest elevated the host the awe deepened about him and he told himself that it was not he who was dead at all but only his sin and misery and that he might rise if he would out of the shadow of death into another and better life then almost before he knew it the thought had become a prayer and he found himself praying that he might be permitted to begin again to put the past behind him and to think of the lost days of his life hitherto as seed that was not dead though he had trampled it into the clay out of the heart came the only songs that went to the heart and out of his shame and suffering in that future he had foreshadowed for himself the voice might come that would speak to other souls as stained with sin as his yet who was he to speak to any one only a prodigal in a far country who had wasted his substance in riotous living and having come to himself at last now that no man would give to him was turning his eyes homeward and crying father i have sinned against heaven and before thee and am no more worthy to be called thy son the service came to an end and the people rose to go as oscar rose too he told himself that in actual fact he would go back home some day a little longer only a little longer and he would return to iceland his father would be gone yes his poor father would be gone but his mother would be there and he would make amends to her for everything she had suffered for his sake and wipe all tears from her eyes his child would be there also and he would claim her as he had always intended to do and though she might not even know his face she would hear the voice of nature calling her and she would come to him and he would be a father to her guiding and protecting her and she would be a daughter to him cheering and comforting him and her love would be his solace for all the pains of life a little longer only a little longer when he came out of the great church he felt himself lifted into a purer air where he was no longer a fugitive from the vengeance of his fellowmen but a pardoned soul born again in a blessed resurrection and when he had settled in the train for calais he set himself to consider what other name he should be known by in that new existence which he had just begun it had to be a name that would sufficiently conceal his own yet one that would be characteristic of his country and after much beating of the wings of memory he decided on christian christiansson as a name which not only answered to the conditions but possessed an added nobleness of meaning and associations that would forever forbid the lowering of the flag of his purpose but after he had concluded that christian christiansson was to be his name in the future it cost him a pang to think that oscar stephenson was to be his name no longer stephen had been his fathers name and his poor father had expected him to carry it on from strength to strength and from glory to glory oscar had been the name his mother had known him by and it came back to him now in the tones of her voice with the happiest memories of his boyhood he could hear it in thoras voice also in the tremulous happiness of her bridal chamber in the tender joy of her motherhood and in the pleading accents of her despair it was like burying something of himself to bury his name but oscar stephenson was dead and that name could be his no more it was early morning when he reached london and returning to it after six months absence he felt like one who had been dead and was alive again as the empty streets echoed to his footsteps his spirits rose and he looked to the future without fear though he was coming back friendless and nearly penniless he saw himself as he would be some daychristian christiansson the composer rich respected honored perhaps and perhaps beloved it might be months it might be years but god willing it should come a little longer only a little longer he had at first intended to look for a lodging where he would be quite unknown but in his present elevation of feeling it seemed unnecessary to do so and he determined to return to his old home in short street when he came to westminster bridge he stopped for a moment to look down at the houseless wretches who were still asleep on the benches of the embankment and to remember the night when he had been one of them and to think of the other night that was soon to come when the firstfruits of his new life would be in his hands he could see it all as in a glass that revealed the future the curtain would be down on the new opera and there would be a great demonstration in the crowded operahouse again and again the singers would be recalled and then there would be loud cries for the composer the cries would rise to a deafening clamor and the whole audience from the royal box to the topmost gallery would be calling for the unknown man who had breathed his suffering soul into an old saga and made the dry bones live but the unknown would not appear he would not be there where would he be he would be down herehere under the night sky weeping for joy and gratitude emptying his pockets among these homeless outcasts in memory of the night when he too was homeless and an outcast and vowing never again to forget the friendless and the fallen or to be hard on the sinner and the prodigal he could see it happening as plainly as if it had already come to pass it should come to pass a little longer only a little longer when he reached short street the hearse of the necropolis had just turned the corner and was rattling up the archway nearly all the windowblinds of number one were still down but as he hesitated at the foot of the front steps the door opened and a young woman in curl papers came out with a mop and pail she stared at him as if he had been a stranger but he knew her instantly dont you remember me jenny he said at the sound of his voice jennys face assumed a look of bewilderment this was followed by a smile of recognition well i never mr steevison is it you sir yer so changed i wouldnt a knowed ye an when ye spoke ye might a knocked me down with a feather can i have lodgings here again jenny certingly ye can sir an yeve come in the nick o time too we buried

in them days and never a wanted nothinkbut go inside sir and ill get ye some brekfist the kittle is just on the boil an yell have a cup o tea an a rasher afore ye can say jack robison jenny went scurrying down the stairs like an old slipper and oscar stepped into the barmans parlor and sat on the shiny leathercovered sofa he remembered that he had sat there before he remembered who had sat with him he remembered all that had happened since and then for one brief moment his visions of the future failed him his hopes and intentions sank away everything was blotted out except the sweet and bitter memory of the woman he had loved and lost and he broke down utterly xii it takes a long time for the truth to travel from a distance but a lie flies on the wings of the wind the report of oscars death in a gamblinghouse on the riviera reached iceland by the next steamer three days before the steamers arrival magnus and his mother were sitting in front of their farm at thingvellir anna was spinning and magnus was making rope by a twister turned by a small boy a dozen yards away for it was just after the woolplucking and a little before the hayharvest the sun was setting behind the crags of the almanagja the blueberry ling was reddening over the green waters of the chasm and there was no sound in the evening air save the plash of the axe waterfall the lowing of kine and the cry of curlew then over the hum of the wheel and the wiswis of the twister came the dull thud of horses feet on that hollow ground and anna stopped to listen that must be the post coming she said and magnus answered perhaps without turning to look at the road which was still empty as far as to the top of the cleft where it opened on to the plain i wonder if there will be a letter from oscar why should you wonder mother has he answered your letter of three years ago has he had the decency and humanity to reply to the news of his fathers death no still i can not give up hoping he must know by this time how you are placed with the farm and perhaps he is only waiting until he can send you some assistance magnus made no reply but the wiswis of the rope was louder its true he doesnt know everything he doesnt know that his father left nothing behind him but the debt to the bank and that the bank has been so hard mother if you go on talking like that i shall never get this rope finished i dont want anybody to help me to pay my way and the bank shall have its money every christmas if hard work can make it youll work yourself to deaththats what youll do magnus you sent asher away in the winter although he was so good at feeding the beasts when the snow was on the ground and now that the hay has to be cut and the lambs killed youre discharging jon vidalin well have to thin down somewhere and the sooner we begin the betterits too late to spare when you see the bottom of the mealbarrel you know thats what you call thinning downsending everybody away who can help you with the farm and keeping a houseful of women who are of no use for anything why which of them is of no use mother gudrun for one she only milks the cows in the morning and the ewes in the evening and i could do both myself and save her keep and wages nonsense mother youre not young enough now to get up at four oclock winter and summer and i wont hear of it for a moment then theres mariashes old enough for anything and whats the use of her marias been in the family since before i was born and we cant turn her away now because shes old and rheumatic and heres eric said anna dropping her voice and glancing at the boy who was turning the twister eric poor little chap hes lost his father and he only gets a lamb for his wages anyway its to be a sheep this year remember and then theres his food but if its an orphanage you want to keep or a home for invalids helloa heres the post and whos this he has got with him the rector the rector and two strangers cried magnus as a canvascovered wagon drawn by four ponies rumbled over the bridge above the waterfall and galloped up to the innfarm welcome rector said anna thanks anna these are friends from america traveling to see the country we should like to sleep here tonight and go on to geyser in the morning with pleasure maria gudrun jon vidalin cried anna and while the strangers were being taken to the guestroom and the horses to the stable the rector went indoors with anna and magnus and they sat and talked around the hall table you look hale in spite of everything anna and you too rector ah yes old wood burns slow but i sometimes wonder if its well to live long better go to bed early than sit up too late i say any new trouble in town lately the factor is down at last poor fellow you mean that hes bankrupt and about to be sold upbusiness office everything poor margret neilsen what about the child asked magnus i think he would part with it now to tell you the truth he is feeling bitterly about oscar just at present a dove doesnt come out of a ravens egg he said yesterday he said that so the new minister saysbut then it was the minister who made him bankrupt but i thought they were such friends and when poor stephen was petitioning the king then you havent heard what happened about thora thora said magnus poor thoras grave i mean it makes the blood run between my skin and my flesh to think about it tell us said anna and then the rector told them how the minister acting under instructions received from abroad had ordered thoras grave to be opened and certain musical compositions which had been buried in it to be taken out how this had been done and the papers despatched to england how the factor had heard of it and being furious had threatened an action against the minister and finally how the minister to cut the ground under the factors feet had caused the bank to make him a bankrupt during the progress of the rectors story magnus sat without saying a word but every moment his cheeks grew whiter and his eyes glared and his lips quivered meantime anna covered her face and said it must have been neils who did that i never liked the boyhe was always too much like his fatherand now that he is it wasnt neils anna it was oscar oscar said magnus and his hands clutched the corners of the table oh dear oh dear i couldnt have believed it of oscar but who knows how he may have been tempted perhaps he was poor yes perhaps after all he was in want and they offered him money there are such ups and downs in these foreign countriesperhaps he was starving in the streets of london he wasnt in london at all anna he was at monte carlo or nice or somewhere then you mean he only wanted the money tothe same as before when hei wont believe it be quiet mother said magnus with the hoarse croak of a raven and then turning to the rector who did itthe work itself i mean hans the sailorthey could get nobody else it seems hans the sailor repeated magnus in the same hoarse croak and while the table creaked under the clutch of his great hands his face grew hard and ugly during the remainder of that day magnus went about without speaking to any one and next morning after the strangers had started on their journey he saddled silvertop and rode off toward reykjavik anna saw him go and calling to jon vidalin she said take the fastest horse and ride to town by the low road and find hans the sailor tell him to fly before magnus comes and never to come back again xiii when magnus returned to the farm three days afterward he was like another man his face was no longer hard and ugly it was as soft as a tender womans and he was smiling down at something that looked like a huge bundle which he carried on the saddle in front of him anna saw him crossing the bridge and she ran out to meet him goodness me she cried is it the child yes it is the child mother said magnus and out of a mountain of rugs and shawls came little elin now in her fifth year and she was dropped into annas arms the darling what a great girl she has grown so she has come to see her granma yes granma said the child and here are her clothesall of them said magnus swinging a satchel off his shoulders then she has come for good and she is going to live with her granma and uncle magnus and silvertop and the sheeps and the doggies said the little one so she shall bless her jon vidalin see to the masters pony eric where are you ah thats a good boycarry the satchel into the house maria did you ever see anything so bonny but magnus how ever did the factor come to part with her he wouldnt at first for all his worries and the hard things he had been saying and when he came to it at last he wanted me to promise that if margret neilsen died before himself he should have the child back again you didnt agree to that magnus i said the girl should choose for herself if she was old enough and at last he consented but what about margret neilsen that was harder still i promised her mother i should keep her as long as i lived she said ah poor thing she didnt know what was to happen i wouldnt part with her to anybody in the world hut anna she said i always said margret neilsen was as good as gold and i wouldnt part with her now she said only anna is in such trouble trouble give the child to maria and come into the house mother the sunshine died off annas face she saw what was coming here take her in and give her some barley cake and syrup and for goodness sake woman dont sniffle as if you had a cold what is it magnus am i the only one who doesnt know tell me plainlyis he in disgrace again have courage mother said magnus she looked at him and understood everything wait she said and she went down on her knees in the hall and prayed for some moments after that she got up pale but calm and said now tell me everythingi am ready magnus told her what he had heard and all that had happened how he had gone to town with murder in his heart intending to punish hans the sailor how some one had warned him and hans had taken refuge in a schooner that was to sail for norway how he had hired a boat to follow the man when the mail steamer dropped anchor in the bay and somebody shouted from the deck that oscar was dead and it was the same as if a hand from heaven had stopped him dead did he say dead in france he said and he threw down a danish newspaper here it is mother but god knows if i should read you the report in it read it said anna he read itit was the same which had appeared in parisand she listened without drawing breath then he died in a gaminghouseby his own hand tooand to save himself from further disgrace magnus did not attempt to speak and presently annas tears began to flow after a few moments she wept bitterly and prayed aloud now for oscar that god would forgive him now for elin that god would protect the little orphan finally for herself that god would have pity upon her and let her die magnus went over to the dresser for a bowl dipped it in the watercrock and gave her a drink and after that she seemed better my poor oscar she said he wasted his life poor boy such a precious life too such talents there wasnt anything he couldnt master everybody said what great things he would do some day and to think it should come to this i never expected to thank god that his father was dead but i do now oh god i thank thee but what am i saying after a few minutes more she began to blame herself for everything that had happened i didnt bring him up properly i could never be strict with children and he was always so sweet and even when he was naughty he was so loving everybody loved that child yes it was my fault and god ought to punish me almighty father be merciful to my poor boy and if i was to blame mother mother said magnus and she stopped in her selfreproaches waiting for a loving word to comfort and support her but magnus said no more a few minutes later all she had suffered at oscars hands was wiped out of her mind and the wayward sinner had become a saint he never changed to me never and even when he grew to be a man he always kissed me going to bed just as he used to do when he was a boy he was so good to his mother both my sons have been good to me no mother ever had such good sons mother said magnus and again she waited but magnus did not speak at length she checked her tears and began to comfort herself with the thought that if oscar had taken his own life it must have been in madness therefore god would not hold him accountable and if he died in disgrace perhaps it was only because he wanted to come back rich so that he could pay the mortgage and make us all happy i used to think of that and pray for it so often but now if he could only come back poori shouldnt care how pooras poor as the prodigal in the parable mother cried magnus i cant hear you talk like thisi cant and i wont oscar is dead but he treated you shamefully dont say that magnus but i do say it i say you were the best mother to him a son ever had and the only return he made to you for your care and lovingkindness was to neglect you and forget you dont say it my son i will say it mother and ill say too that oscar lived in disgrace and died in disgrace and now that he is gone i am not going to pretend that i wish he could come back again magnus magnus i dont wish it if he came back poor what right would he have to bring his poverty here and if he came back rich what reason to expect that his money would make amends to us for the evil days we have had through him i dont believe in the return of the prodigal mother and i dont believe in the parable either that may be the way in the other world but it isnt the way in this one and it shouldnt bei say it shouldnt be oh dear oh dear as for oscar i tried to forgive himyou know i didbut there are some crimes that seem to be past forgiveness and when i think of this last one against thora im not sorry he never came backi shouldnt have been able to keep my hands off him i was thinking of him when i was following hans and if he had returned with the ship that brought the news of his death it would have been god help both him and me but my son your brother is only just dead and it is your duty to forgive him whatever he did he died to me long ago motherbefore he went away from icelandand now that he is dead indeed i thank god he can never come back again well the lord knows best what he is doing said anna and then her tears came again whereupon magnus seeing what he had done walked over to her and kissed her he had never done that in the whole course of his life before so her tears flowed faster than ever and then he went out of the house muttering to himself ah well my god my god that night when the bell in the hall rang for prayers and little elin sat in her grandmothers lap and the farmservants trooped in with the awesome looks of persons who knew what shadow hung over the little house among the lonely hills magnus in his quality of family priest took up the bible and hymnbook at the place where anna opened for him the chapter was from second samuel and it ended with the verse and the king was much moved and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept and as he went thus he said o my son absalom my son my son absalom would god i had died for thee o absalom my son my son the hymn was meek and low meek and low i shall soon my jesus know when the singing ended the farmservants went out one by one each saying to magnus god give you a good night and magnus answered as well as he could for the emotion that mastered him and you and you xiv in the house of sorrow god closes the hearts of little children so that they may not break little elin had been bright and happy the whole evening through she was a merry little sprite whose laughterlike the rippling of a sunny streamset everybody else laughing old maria was at a loss to say which of her parents she resembled most when the child laughed maria said theres a deal of the father in the little one and when she listened and looked up sideways maria thought there was a deal of the mother too anna put her to bed and while she was being undressed her little tongue went like a shuttle existence had gone rapidly since she arrived and she was full of stories how she had gone to the chasm with maria to pluck blueberries and two big black ravens sitting on a crag had looked down at her and croaked how she had gone to the cowhouse with eric to see the cows milked and gudrun to her infinite glee had squirted some of the milk at her and above all how all alone she had found a pet lamb and it was brown because it had lost its mother and lived in the elthouse because its father had run away from it and how it put its cold nose against her face and said bah and its name was maggie maggie shall come

life to taste the stars are setting and the caravan draws to the dawn of nothingoh make haste i the danish mailsteamer laura outward bound on her midwinter trip from copenhagen to leith and from leith to iceland carried two saloon passengers only one of these a comfortable elderly person of ample proportions dressed in the warmest icelandic vadmal was an iceland merchant returning from edinburgh with a hundred tons of british produce this was jon oddsson formerly radical champion in politics and now conservative leader in trade the other passenger was a tall spare man apparently about fifty years of age with large and luminous but weary eyes long pale cheeks deeply scored with lines of thought and a pointed beard that was beginning to be tinged with grey this was christian christiansson now ten years older than when he returned from the riviera to london and so changed in every feature by the strange characters which work and sorrow inscribe on a mans face with the stern hand of time that few or none would have recognized him in the interval christian christiansson had carried out his plans and realized his expectations buried in the depths of london as a man dying on shipboard is buried in the vast grave of the sea he had lived long as one who was dead but his hour had struck at last for five years he had been one of the most popular of living composers his operas founded on the sagas of his own country had made iceland familiar to people everywhere his works had been represented in every capital his tunes had been played in every street and it was almost as if he had breathed over europe and set the air to song meantime he had been faithful to the pledge he had made with himself his name was a household word but it was no more than a name and his identity had never been revealed no temptation had prevailed with him to disclose it and the few who knew his secret had found it to their interest to maintain the mystery and now he was returning to his own country rich and famousrich as the man who strikes ore from the rock and finds it pouring down on him in an avalanche of gold but famous only as the hidden folk are famous the good fairies who leave food and drink at the doors of poor men and then steal away before they awake in the dawn how changed the old world was when he emerged at length into the light of open day the telegram he sent from london asking for a berth to be reserved for him had almost paralyzed the captain with excitement and delight it was the same old captain zimsen who in former days had given him the best room when he was in favor and the worst when he was in disgrace the moment he set foot on the ship lying in dock at leith the timeserving old salt had been therehat in handto lead him to his private cabin do me the honor to occupy my stateroom sir and if there is anything you could wishany little dainty for the table you are very good very obliging dont mention it sir it is a pleasure a privilege to do anything in my power for the most distinguished icelander of modern times do they know you are coming mr christiansson not yet captain what a pity what a reception they would have given you but they will they will if the world was changed the man was changed also the buoyancy of youth was gone and over the old captivating gaiety of manner and expression a sad gravity had fallen as if a lilactree still bright with blossom had been borne down by snow but after two days at sea his spirits rose and he felt like a slave who had been emancipated like a prisoner set free it was fifteen years since he had left his own country but he was returning to it at last as he had always hoped and intended to do he had left it in disgrace he was going back to it in honor he had left it in poverty he was going back to it with wealth he was going back as the prodigal yet not like the prodigal emptyhanded and ashamed but able to make amends and to wipe the tears from all eyes would it be wrong to permit himself to be known if the people of iceland more observant than this old captain identified in christian christiansson the oscar stephenson who was thought to be dead would it be false to the pledge he had made with himself to submit to their recognition fifteen years he had lived in obscuritywas it not enough for penance and pardon were not the doors of his dungeon even yet broken open could he not believe that he was delivered from the body of the death he had lived in he had lived he had diedmight he not live again ii during the ten years in which he had been as a dead man all channels of communication had been closed to him and except for information casually gathered he had little or no knowledge of what had occurred in iceland and now finding himself for the first time face to face with men who had been in constant touch with his people he had a hundred questions which he yearned to ask is my mother alive is she well and my little daughterhas god been good to me and let her live or is all my labor wasted but he was afraid to learn the truth too suddenly so he waited and watched and listened for answers to the questions he dared not ask meantime he tried to amuse himself with the curiosity of the captain and his fellowpassengers who were clearly at a loss to know who he was where he was born and what family of the christianssons he came from it was a perilous pleasure a dizzy joy to listen to the names of his family and to hear himself discussed and sometimes in mortal shame of the subterfuges to which his disguise condemned him he could hardly resist an impulse to blurt out the truth of his identity and sometimes he had to leap up from his place in the smokingroom and fly youve not been home very lately mr christiansson said the captain who was smoking his long pipe after midday dinner while the ship swung along in open sea not very lately captain said christiansson youll see changes then said the merchant no doubt no doubt the new constitution has worked wonders for iceland sir worked wonders has it the barter trade has gone the cash business is established everywhere and as for the fishing its another industry sir another industry is it judge for yourself sir instead of the old open boats we have sixty smacks manned by twenty men apiece and going as far as six days out and home again then the people were right after all who used to say the old trade was doomed and the water was to be the wealth of iceland they were that sir said the merchant inflating his chest and pulling down his waistcoat everybody has benefited by the change and i shouldnt be surprised if you find your own people better off than when you left themthat is to say if they are still alive if theyre still alive said christian christiansson dropping both voice and eyes by the way were you at home in governor stephens time mr christiansson asked the captain well yes captain yes i was at home then said christian christiansson with a momentary faltering in his voice in that case you must have seen the beginning of the end the old governor tried to resist the change and lived with a sword over his head all his latter days poor devil a wise old man though wasnt he said christian christianssonhe could scarcely trust himself to speak wise said the merchant with a curl of the lip no man is wise who will not be warned and he had warning enough but it was his sons who settled him christian christiansson looked up with a start ah yes of course his sons he had two sons i remember what became of them one of them is living at thingvellir still living still is he if you call it livingup to his ears in debt in debt you say always has been always will be as for the other oneolaf ericwhat was his name now was it oscar said christian christiansson with a catch in his throat oscar it waswhat a memory you must have sir oscar stephenson he used to think he could do a little in your line sir but he was here today and there tomorrow and he never did anything in his life except put an end to it you would hear what happenedit all came out in the newspapers died abroad didnt he shot himself in a gambling hell sir the young rascal said the captain taking his pipe out of his mouth to laugh i took it out of him though the last time he crossed from iceland i made him sleep in the hold serve him right the scoundrel said the merchant a scoundrel was he he used to beat his poor young wife black and blue sir beat his wife you say she died of his illusage anyway he killed his father too the night he went away he broke open the governors safe and carried off everything broke open the governors safe thats sothe old man died a pauper died a pauper left nothing behind him so it comes to the same thing every stick in the house had to be sold to the new minister but is this true true enough sir everything came out at the general election the governor and the old factor were rival candidates and they told us the family secrets and is this all they say at home of oscar stephenson all not a tenth of it then his very name must be hated in iceland hated execrated sir not that anybody cares about the old governor he is dead and gone with the rotten system he tried to support but as for his son nobody can say bad enough about him so that if he had lived and come back alive he would have been hounded out of the country sir just so just so said christian christiansson and rising with a startling gesture he stumbled back to his stateroom the merchant looked after him uneasily who the deuce can he be i wonder i wonder said the captain pulling at his extinguished pipe it was impossible the odium attaching to the name of oscar stephenson made it impossible that christian christiansson could ever reveal his identity he had thought that the dust of death might cover his transgressions but rumor and report had kept them alive and magnified them even the effort of his family to conceal the truth about his offenses had given birth to falsehood and fostered slander the people of iceland must never know that christian christiansson was oscar stephenson if they suspected he must use means to deepen his disguise if they questioned he must deny what else had he expected in thinking he could ever allow himself to be known in his true name and character what secret craving of pride and vanity had he been cherishing unawares his errand to iceland was one of penance and atonementat the bottom of his heart he had been looking to it as the top and hightide of his career the flush and crown of his success as the hour of triumph when he was to justify the friends who had loved him and to put to rout the enemies who had hated him and to come off with flying colors at the last if so he was rightly punished oscar stephenson was dead and nothing and nobody could bring him to life again iii christian christiansson became more reserved as the vessel approached its destination every mile of the voyage was full of memories and the sweetest were the bitterest the happiest were the hardest to bear he was standing in the bow when he caught his first glimpse of iceland glimmering white and blue like a sheeted ghost in the distance where its glaciers rose out of the sea and then thinking of the enchanted hopes of the days when he had first seen it so and how many of them now were dead under ashes he would have broken down badly but for the captain who came up behind him and said in his cheery croak there it is sir theres your country thats the place youve made them all hear about christian christiansson returned to his cabin immediately and he was not seen on deck again until the following morning when the laura was steaming up the fiord and then the merchant in his shoregoing hat and overcoat began to point out the sights to him as to a stranger theres the old town sir bigger ill be bound than when you saw it last thats the new shipyard on the right and thats the leper hospital on the left this is engey the island with the eider duckfamous place for young folks courting sir thats the old cathedral in the middle and thats government house to the left of it theyre nearly hidden by the new warehouses nowi built them myself sir the laura cast anchor under the town amid a fleet of smacks and coalhulks and remembering how he had stood there last christian christianssons emotion would have mastered him again but for the bustle that was going on aroundthe orders of the captain from the bridge the shouts of the sailors who were lowering the ladder and the cries of the men who had come out in small boats and were clambering up to the deck christian christiansson knew most of the boatmen though some were old who had been middleaged and some were middleaged who had been young and some were bearded who had been boys but none of them recognized christian christiansson as they tipped their hats to him and pushed past to the officers of the ship good morning mate good morning captain what passengers this time only one besides jon oddsson but hes a host in himselfchristian christiansson what the great christian christiansson in less than three minutes half the small boats were scurrying away to carry the news to the town while the owners of the other half were scrambling for christianssons luggage to have the honor of taking it ashore easy on my lads shouted the captain mr christiansson will go with me in the ships boat and dont you forget it it was a full halfhour before this could come to pass for christian christiansson had first to drink the captains health and the ships luck in the chartroom when at length they were going ashore with portmanteaus piled up in the bow of the boat and the captain chattering in the stern it was almost more than christian christiansson could do to control himself under the memory of the dark night on which he went the other way with no one to see him off except his mother who sat by his side and held his hand as if she could never part with it when the boat drew up alongside the jetty was packed with people and as christian christiansson stepped ashore with the air of a man trying to escape from observation but conscious of being under the full fire of it a little fat fussy person with asthmatical breathingchristiansson knew him instantlybowed deeply and began to read something from a sheet of foolscap paper it was an effusive address drawn up hastily by the chairman of the town board in the name of the inhabitants beginning illustrious fellowcountryman and going on to hail christiansson as one who had revived the ancient spirit and glory of a thousand years ago agitated and ashamed hardly daring to speak lest the sound of his voice should betray him christian christiansson replied with a few commonplaces and then amid a whispered chorus of modest the modesty of greatness sir he tried to push his way toward the hotel he had not made many paces before he was confronted by a young man in the uniform hat and cloak of a government secretary who parted the crowd and said in the breathless gasps of one who had been running the ministers compliments sir and will you do him the honor to become his guest at government house christian christiansson tried to excuse himself but every eye was on him and seeing that he could not escape without the danger of exposing himself to suspicion he yielded and allowed himself to be led away the little journey to government house was like the progress to a calvary every step was sown with memoriesmemories of the pleasures the passions the darling joys the sorrows and the tragedies of the pastbut while they seemed to strike up at him out of the very stones of the street he had to nod and smile as the secretary walking by his side rattled along with explanations and descriptions of the places they passed on their way this is our principal thoroughfare mr christiansson that is our chief hotel and this is our national bank the large building flying the iceland falcon is our parliament hall that is our old cathedral sir and thisthis is government house suffocated with shame choking with a sense of duplicity and trembling with the fear of detection christian christiansson continued to say yes and is that so until he reached the porch of his old home and then remembering how and when he had passed out of it lastalone at night disgraced and with his fathers door closed against himit was almost as much as he could do to restrain an impulse to turn about and fly but just at that moment his fathers door opened quickly and there on the threshold another man in the uniform of the governor stood waiting with outstretched hand to welcome him the palpitation of christian christianssons heart was almost choking him what wild harlequinade of real life was this that he who had been so nearly flung out of iceland should be received back to it with open arms what mad game of blindmans buff were the powers of destiny playing with him it was not for nothing that he had taken the name of christian christiansson what invisible wings of fate had been over him when he did so and were they plumed to honor or to dishonor to reward or to punishment to joy or to sorrow to life or to death iv the sheriff made minister was the same man still he received christian christiansson with suavest politeness but without a trace of recognition welcome he said welcome to iceland my wife is in the drawingroomshe will be delighted to see you we may go this waythis way through my bureaudo me the honor to follow me dont knock against the stovestrangers do sometimes a ramshackle old house sir for which my predecessor was responsibleim building a better in another part of the town youve not yet dined how fortunate in these high latitudes we keep up primitive customs mr christiansson we dine in the middle of the day and you are just in the nick of time i was holding a meeting of my executive when the news of your arrival reached me and i took the liberty to invite one or two of my colleagues this is the drawingroomhave the goodness to step inside muttering monosyllables only in reply to the ministers explanations christian christiansson followed him through the house that was as familiar as the palm of his hand until he came face to face with his hostess and the friends who had been invited to meet him the hostess was an acquaintance of his schooldays grown middleaged and matronly and the friends were the rector of the latin school looking elderly and irongrey and the bishop looking white and old they received him with the utmost cordiality but like the minister without a sign of recognition christian christiansson bowed but scarcely spoke he was no longer in fear of discovery for now he knew that unless he wished it otherwise he could pass through iceland unknown but standing there in the old home with the traces of his boyhood about him his heart swelled and his throat thickened and it was as much as he could do to control himself after a moment a servant announced dinner and the minister led the way to the diningroom it was the same old room with the same furniture and hardly altered in any particular but it was full of ghosts in the eyes of him who entered it again in one rapid glance christian christiansson took in everythingthe chair his father used to sit in his mothers place magnuss and thoras and remembering that all these were gone that everything connected with his own people had faded away that the old house was inhabited by others now and nothing remained except himself and he had neither part nor lot in it the palpitation of his heart nearly choked him again and he sat at the table like a guilty thing but if christian christiansson was silent the minister talked incessantly you will find that iceland knows all about you mr christianssonall about you speaking for myself i may say that in addition to the ordinary channels of intelligence i have some private sources of information my sonyou know my son i think christian christiansson bowed my son has kept me constantly informed so you will find me abreast of all your movements certainly i take it amiss that he did not warn me of your comingbut perhaps he didnt know he didnt i thought as much not that he would have told me if you had wished it concealed neils is discretion itself sirdiscretion itself for instance i could never persuade him to tell me who you were i tempted himi confess i tempted him but no business is business father he would say and i was forced to be content iceland is honored that you show yourself first in your own country sir said the rector indeed it is rector and mr christiansson will find that his fame is no empty bubble here there isnt a student who doesnt sing your songs sir said the rector nor a girl of fourteen in a farmhouse who doesnt play your music said the ministers wife wonderful said the minister himself its perfectly wonderful but i always say the musician is the international artist other artiststhe poets for examplerequire their translators but the musician needs no gobetween he uses the one universal language and when he speaks the whole world may hear what a gift what a thing it must be to be among the great composers perhaps it has its penalties though what does the poet say they learn in suffering what they teach in song what a thought that is i wonder if its true i wonder if every great song every great symphony every great opera is born of the sufferingthe actual real life suffering and perhaps in some cases the sin and sorrowof the man who created it what should you say mr christiansson god knows said christiansson and after that there was silence for a moment poor stephen said the bishop suddenly and then everybody raised his face from the table i was thinking said the bishop that if sin and sorrow added to the gift of genius go to the making of great music somebody was born in this very house who should have left immortal works behind him christian christiansson had looked up with the rest and now the minister leaned across to him and said in an undertone a sad story sira son of my predecessor who made shipwreck of his life poor fellow you mean oscar stephenson yes indeed but can it be possible that you knew him we talked of him on the steamer ah of course certainly and then he was a kind of humble confrere of yours and conducted at covent garden what a tragedy what a scandal when the dreadful news came from nice everybody here felt ashamed such a wellknown iceland name and the son of a former governor it was almost as if iceland had been dishonored in the eyes of the world sir so different so entirely different from the effects the glorious effects of your own magnificent achievements christian christiansson was quivering from heart to eyelids but the same mysterious impulse that compels the lamb to confront the dog forced him to go on his mother is alive isnt she he said anna yes shes alivethats nearly all you can say about her christian christianssons voice deepened and shook is she sick he asked sick in fortune at all events when the old governor died she went to live with her other son at thingvellir and he is in trouble again poor creature in debt isnt he yes he is in debt to the bank for the interest and principal of some money which his father borrowed on mortgage to keep his brother out of prison and what is the bank going to do with him sell him up immediately christian christiansson sank into silent reverie again and when the conversation at the table had taken another turn he said unexpectedly he left a child behind him didnt he who sir oh oscar stephenson he dida girl shes living too isnt she she is sirthat is to say for all i know to the contrary rector oscars little daughter is still alive is she not alive and well and hearty said the rector christian christianssons eyes brightened visibly thats good news at all events he said the altered tone startled everybody and nobody spoke for a little while then the minister said it is really very good of you to take an interest in the family of your poor dead confrere and if id had the least idea you wished to hear more about them it would have been so easyi might have invited the banker ill see him tomorrow said christian christiansson and then breaking through his reserve he talked for the next halfhour on other subjects he talked well and the company were delighted for there was no one to know that his vivacity was nervousness and his laughter something like shame when the dinner was at an end the bishop who had fixed his eyes constantly on christian christiansson rose and held out his hand to him it has been a great happiness to have seen you mr christiansson he said and i trust we may meet again i know nothing of music sir but i rejoice to see that the noble musician is only another name for the noble man and i pray god to bless you body and soul christian christiansson could not trust himself to reply for the bishops praise added a new bitterness to his remorse so he stooped over the old mans hand and kissed it the bishop was pleased and touched how charming he is how perfectly charming he said as he put on his overcoat in the porch he reminds me of some one ive met somewhere me too said the rector those beautiful manners that captivating smile and that voice that goes through and through you does he resembleor is it only because we have been talking at table you mean poor young yes ah me said the bishop as he opened the door what brave things he might have done if heaven had willed it he might have been another christian christiansson by this time said the rector poor stephen said the bishop poor anna said the rector and the two old friends went heavily down the path meantime the man they were talking of though they did not know it was going through an agony of selfreproach the duplicity of winning his way to the love and esteem of his people under the cover of a false name was suffocating him it was necessary it was inevitable it was a part of the conduct that was forced upon him by the errand that had brought him home but if they who welcomed him in the ignorance of their enthusiasm could know who he was how their hearts would turn from him how their sympathy would change to loathing and their admiration to contempt the evening was one of prolonged suffering to christian christiansson for everything that happened in that house every trivial object that met his eye seemed charged with the power to torture him as soon as he could he excused himself and asked to be shown to his room they showed him to the bedroom that had been occupied by thora that was the last drop in his cup he felt like a man who had stumbled into a hidden grave and he wanted to say give me any room in the house except this but he dared not speak lest his slightest word should betray him when the door was closed he flung himself in the armchair before the stove and then one after one as by flashes of lightning he saw over again the scenes of his life with which that room was associated he thought of his wedding night when with a fluttering heart he came on tiptoe into the cosy nest of his bridal chamber and heard thoras tremulous breathing behind the curtains of the bed he thought of the joyous morning when her pale face shone like sunshine and the air of the room was full of auroral radiance because a child was born to them he thought of the dark day when he found her lying dead and of the heavy hour when he took his last look at her and buried his compositions in her coffin oh miserable mummery oh broken and senseless vow yet not senseless either save to his own violated intention for now he knew why he had taken the name of christian christiansson in the blind spasm of his accusing conscience he had thought it was merely in order to deny himself the fame which his works were to win for him but the inscrutable and ironical powers of destiny had sterner purposes than that it was in order that being dead as oscar stephenson he should yet return to iceland in order that he should see the accumulated consequences of his conduct in order that he should follow as if with bare feet on the hot ground of a geyser the footsteps and the funeral of his youth in order that the living might torture him with gratitude and the dead with memories in order that gods right hand of justice should fall on him as it had never fallen before and everything he had done should be paid for this was why he had taken the name and won the fame of christian christiansson and the martyrdom of his new life was beginning v as soon as the bank opened in the morning christian christiansson called on the manager and was received with extravagant politeness i must take the liberty to introduce myself he began quite unnecessary said the banker with a bow all the worldi say all the world sir has been introduced to you you would receive a letter from my banker in london we didit came with the mail that was brought by the laura i think it asks you to honor my signature up to two hundred thousand crowns that is the amount sirtwo hundred thousand and if you wish to draw any of it immediately i do said christian christiansson and taking a large pocketbook from his breastpocket he drew out a chequebook and took up a pen mr palsson he saidthe banker started at the mention of his name then bowed and smiledi was much touched by a case of distress which the minister spoke of at dinner yesterday and i could wish to be of some assistance you are very generous mr christiansson and if i can be of the slightest use to youi say if i can be of the slightest use sir pray be good enough to command me it was the case of the family of the late governori understand that they are in debt to the bank and that the bank is in the act of distraining unhappily true sir but the bank has been very indulgenti say the bank has been very indulgentit was impossible to hold back longer i think that the debt is for interest on a mortgage on the innfarm at thingvellir and that the money was borrowed by the father of the present owner that is so sir but the interest is long in arrears and the mortgagei say the mortgage itself sir is the reverse of a good security mr palsson said christian christiansson if i were to pay you the interest out of my own pocket would that stop the proceedings the bankers breath seemed to be arrested you are very good sir he said after a moment but the interest is large you can hardly be prepared for the amount of it what is the amount of it asked christian christiansson eight thousand crowns at least siri say at least eight thousand and in any case i should be unable to receive it things have gone too far the deed of execution has been served the advertisements of the auction have been published and the whole matter is now in the hands of the sheriff when is the auction to take place let me see said the banker consulting a newspaper this is the last day of the year the auction is advertised for tomorrow sir did you say tomorrow said christian christiansson rising suddenly tomorrow at nine in the morning sir christian christiansson resumed his seat and sat for some moments nibbling the top of the pen then he said mr palsson i have been many years abroad but i seem to remember that when landed property has to be sold by the law in iceland three auctions are necessarytwo at the office of the sheriff and the third on the estate itself that is so sir but unfortunately this is the thirdthe two others have taken place already so the innfarm must go to the hammer in any case it must go to the hammer in any case you think there is no help for it i am sure siri say i am sure there is no help for it ah wellif it must be it must be said christian christiansson and then as by an afterthought dipping the pen in the ink the interest is eight thousand crowns you say at least eight thousand sir with legal and other expenses probably teni say probably ten and the principal is the principal is one hundred thousand sir poor souls poor souls said christian christiansson he began to write his cheque but the banker went on talking i am sorry for the mother siri say i am sorry for the mother she belongs to a generation which is rapidly passing away but there are still many in the town who remember her a good motherly soul sirit is a pity misfortune should fall so fast on her in the evening of her days blotting paper thank you i am sorry for the son tooi am very sorry for the son an ishmael siralways was and always will bebut he seems to have had a terrible time of it to tell the truth the farm was frightfully overmortgaged at the beginning and if he had thrown it up fifteen years ago it might have been better for himself and the bank and everybody apparently he wished to hold on to it for the sake of the family and to give the poor wretch his due he has made a splendid fight for iti say he has made a splendid fight for it christian christiansson had written his cheque and was tearing it out of the chequebook then as you say sir the mortgage was not made by himself and everybody knows the conditions under which the first debt was contracted ah if that scapegrace brother could only be here today when a man does wrong he seems to think the consequences of his crime will end with his own action but they are like snowballs rolling in the snowi say they are like two hundred thousand crowns sir christian christiansson had handed his cheque to the banker and the banker fixing his eyeglasses was reading the amount of it do you really mean that you wish to draw the whole sum at once mr christiansson if you please said christian christiansson the banker began to laugh certainly we have no highwaymen in iceland siri say we have no highwaymenbut unless the money is wanted for immediate purposes it is wanted for immediate purposes mr palsson in that case of coursecertainlymay i ask you to wait a little it took halfanhour to find the money for christian christianssons cheque and when it came it was in three banknotes of fifty thousand each signed specially by the minister and fifty other notes of a thousand christiansson put the whole of them in his pocketbook and they filled it to its utmost capacity ive given you a great deal of trouble mr palsson it has been a pleasure siri say it has been a pleasure i only regret that i was unable to help you in that other matter if you had come to me two days ago i should have sent a messenger to the sheriff and perhaps he who is the sheriff in that case mr palsson the sheriff of ames sir he lives at borg how far is that from thingvellir only some thirty to forty miles sir about as far as from here to there about the same sir but in this country of no roads and no railways that is sometimes a long days journey just so good day and thank you mr palsson good day to you mr christiansson said the banker and looking after him he thought what does he want with two hundred thousand crowns at once i wonder and whyi say why did he wish to pay the interest for magnus stephenson thank god ive come in time thought christian christiansson and going out of the bank he told himself with a thrill of hope and joy that the inscrutable powers of destiny which seemed to have made him the plaything of chance and error could not be wholly evil if they had brought him back to iceland at the moment of his peoples greatest peril that he might succor and save them at their utmost need vi the morning was heavy and cheerless dark woolly clouds were rolling over the mountains a cold wind was coming up from the east and the voice of the north sea was loud and shrill we shall have snow before the years out sir said one of a group of fishermen who were stamping their feet and beating their arms at the bottom of the bank steps no time to lose thought christian christiansson i must send for horses immediately and start off without delay but before going to thingvellir there was something to do in reykjavik and that was the most important thing of allby some excuse or subterfuge he had to see his child as a first step toward claiming and recovering her she had been ten years at the farm but he thought she was still at the factors and he bent his steps in that direction of the factor himself he knew no more than he had been able to glean at breakfast without betraying a particular interestthat he was still alive that enough had been saved out of the wreck of his fortunes to enable him to keep his house and that he lived the life of a misanthrope blaming the whole world for his misfortunes and all the trouble of his days christian christiansson might have walked to the factors blindfold but the house itself when he came in front of it seemed strangely unfamiliar the once bright little villa looked like a witless man who has lost his place in the world and all hope and all respect for himself the white paint of the walls was cracked and dirty the windows were smeared with the salt which is borne on the breath of the sea the garden was wild and the cobbled path was overgrown with grass it was hardly like a house a young girl might live in but after he had rung the bell he listened for a light step in the hall the door was opened by a withered old woman in white ringlets with her gown tucked up in front it was aunt margret but the little old maid once so pert and dainty had the neglected and frightened look of a cat in an empty house left behind and forgotten her face was the first he had yet seen of the faces of his own people and so hard did he find it to play his part that he had mentioned her name before he was aware of it and she had started perceptibly as if at the sound of a familiar voice is your brother at home margret neilsen he asked he is always at home she answered but he never receives anybody now who shall i say wishes to see him say that christian christiansson would like to speak to him aunt margret who was not wearing her spectacles seemed to listen for a moment as to a voice that came to her from afar and then she asked him into the house as he passed through the hall he listened in his turn for the silvery voice he wished to hear but he heard nothing save the sound of his own footsteps for the house echoed like a vault the sense of change made him forget for a moment the object of his visit and when he stepped into the sittingroom and found the familiar room so different from what he remembered it so bare so bleak so stamped with the seal of poverty with its scrap of worn carpet on the floor and its two broken firebricks in the cold stove he felt as if the ironical powers that controlled his fate had brought him there not to see his child but only to torture him after a moment the factor came in with the old fire in his eyes and the old spirit in his step but wearing a threadbare skullcap over a threadbare suit that had once been black and looking like a grey rock in a green place when the sun has gone from it leaving it grim and hoary i heard of your arrival mr christiansson he said and i suppose i ought to thank you for your call but i am an old man who has lived past his day and i cant think why you wished to see me christian christiansson had his subterfuge ready coming from london he said i thought i might be able to tell you something of your daughter helga you know my daughter helga i used to know her but our ways have parted and we have met only once in ten years nevertheless i know all about her and can tell you what has happened what has happened sir she has become a great singer a singer has she a great operasinger then shes rich i suppose in the way of being so perhaps but famous at all events and a favorite all over europe the factor was silent for a moment leaning on his stick then he said well that will suit her mother i daresay as for me i dont think it matters its ten years since helga neilsen left iceland and ive never seen the scribe of a line from her since if shes rich im poor and she doesnt care anything about it what i call a daughter is one who remembers her father when he is old and past work and the world has got its heel on him i had a daughter like that once but they killed her between themthey killed her between them i say the old mans voice was breaking and thinking to comfort him christian christiansson said hardly knowing what he was saying i heard of your trouble mr neilsen when did you hear of it helga couldnt have told you she had too much to do with her sisters death to talk of it did you perhapsin those days you speak ofdid you know my daughters husband yes said christian christiansson for in that heartquelling moment there seemed to be no escape from it then you knew a scoundrel sir said the factor christian christiansson dared not flinch though the factors lash had cut him to the bone with a throttled utterance he tried to plead for charity oscar stephenson never ceased to reproach himself for his share in thoras death or to mourn its a pretty way to mourn for one daughter to corrupt another said the factor corrupt what else was it he hadnt been a year in london before he persuaded helga to follow him mr neilsen i have no right to speak for the man we are talking of but helga is your daughter and if it is any comfort to you i tell you that you are wrongi know you are wrong how do you knowhe lived in the same house didnt he nevertheless ii believe in my heart that whatever his failures of duty to your daughter thora while she was alive when she was dead he reverenced her memory too much to was it reverencing her memory to sell the right to violate her grave and then waste the money at the gamingtables the perspiration was breaking out on christian christianssons forehead and he had forgotten the object of his errand when the door opened and he looked up in the expectation of seeing elin it was only aunt margret again but now washed and oiled and wearing her spectacles christian christiansson placed a chair for the childless woman and began to talk about the child the man we are speaking of had his faults god knows but if you had heard him talk about you sir and your sister and his daughterespecially his little daughter he talked about his daughter did he constantlyhe seemed to be always thinking of her he never did anything else then he left me to bring her up and never sent a penny toward her support he was poor himself perhapsindeed i know he was poor then what about the letters he wrote to his mother bragging of his business and the fine friends he was making christian christiansson dropped his head and when my own business was broken up did he offer to relieve me of my burden that was afterward oscaryou are confusing the dates said aunt margret hold your tongue margret neilseni know what im saying no sir when the ingrate at government house made me a bankrupt and i didnt know if i should have a roof to cover me it was the fathers brother who had to take the child off my hands magnus magnus stephenson and he had his mother to provide for already then elin is at thingvellir and magnus has been bringing her up all these years how good of him and now he is a broken man himself poor fellow serve him right if he is said the factor ive no pity for him eitherhe was the beginning of all the trouble but when a brave man who has borne other peoples burdens a brave fool you mean sir fortune comes to every man once sir and it came to him but he wouldnt have it look at this room sir you may not believe it but i used to have four assistants eating and drinking with me here and magnus stephenson was one of them he had good ideas in those days and if he had stayed with me we should have kept out the free traders and he would have been the first man in the west of iceland by this time i gave him every chance too i was willing to make him my partner and marry him to my daughter thora but no grasp all lose all he insulted my girl and turned up his nose at my contract and now hes down but hes not done yet what gets wet on a fool gets dry on a knave and magnus stephenson will be worse than a bankrupt before weve heard the end of him mr neilsen said christian christiansson who was breathing heavily you are wrong again and you ought to know it who says i am wrong sir and what am i wrong in you are wrong in thinking that when magnus stephenson refused to marry your daughter thora he did so from selfishness if it wasnt selfishness sir what was it it was unselfishnesssublime unselfishness so thora had found that she loved his brother oscar and to make her happy magnus was willing to give her up to him but the contract was made and you had built all your hopes on it so to save your daughter from your displeasure he allowed it to appear that he refused her although he loved her dearly and his heart was breaking the factor rose to his feet with a wild lustre in his eyes but is this true he said it is gods truth sir who did you have it from from one who should have told you himself fifteen years ago but dared not the factor turned rigidly to his sister margret neilsen do you hear what he is saying aunt margret who was breathing audibly merely bowed her head i dont know what to say to you sir if what you tell me is true ive been hating the wrong man for half a lifetime and yet people talk of providence god veils his face from us factor we are only his little children he has his own plans and purposes good lord sir said the factor in a husky croak what purpose can there be in blinding a man for fifteen years and letting him break up all his friendships he was walking to and fro to calm his nerves under the shock as of a moral earthquake if i have been wrong about magnus i may have been wrong about oscar also i got frightened when he signed my name so i helped to send him out of iceland and now he is dead christian christianssons head was downhis throat was surging his father is dead too we quarrelled about our children and now it seems it all began with a blunder he was my friend for fifty years and ive never had another theres no such thing as making an old friend in your old age sir and when your friends are gone the world gets lonely perhaps i was hard on oscar too he was my godson i liked the boy in spite of everything and he always came to see the old man the minute he set foot in iceland christian christiansson wanted to throw off all disguise and cry and im here again godfather but he could not and dared not speak he rose to go and the factor took him to the door ill come again before i leave the country he said at the last moment and then perhaps ill have something to say to you when the factor returned to the sittingroom looking like the same grey rock but with clouds enveloping it aunt margret who had scarcely moved said in the frightened voice of one who has seen a ghost do you know who that was what do you mean that was oscar stephenson margret neilson you are mad oscar stephenson is dead then he came to life again that is oscar stephenson as sure as im a living woman vii christian christiansson left the factors house glowing with excitement oh for the hour when he could lay aside the armor of duplicity when he could say to his own people i am oscar stephenson let the world think me christian christiansson but at least you must know me for who i am it was necessary and inevitable that he should reveal himself to his own family how else could he carry out the plan he had formed of buying the farm at the auction tomorrow morning and giving it back to his brother and how except by right of blood by right of parentage could he claim the child and take her away with him when he returned to england in this mood he went back to government house and announced his intention of going on to thingvellir thingvellir said the minister its only natural sir that you should wish to see our great historic meetingplace the scene of so many of our sagas but why go there today it isnt every day the old town is alive but this is the last of the year you know and before midnight we shall have many interesting ceremonies why not stay until tomorrow and then i shall be happy to go with you i have a particular reason for wishing to go today said christian christiansson thats a pity and our townspeople will be wofully disappointed to tell you the truth ive done nothing all morning but receive deputations asking me to offer you a public banquet every class of the community is excited and the students are talking of a torchlight procession that settles it mr finsen i must go now in any case you are too modest mr christiansson but perhaps you dont know the way and then look at the cloudsa snowstorm is coming i know every inch of the way and the snowstorm if it is not too heavy will only add to my pleasure if it is not too heavy believe me theres nothing in the world more miserable than being caught in a blinding snowstorm on the moss fell heath but if you must you must sir and if you have a particular reason for going it is not for me to keep you back it is late mr finsen and the days are shorti must get off immediately ill send for ponies without delay sir youll want twoone for yourself the other for your ponyboy youll be back in a few days i trust so youll leave your baggage behind you the ponyboy with the ponies came round at noon and by that time the report of christianssons departure having passed through the town a number of the townspeople had gathered at the gate to see him off among them were palsson the banker oddsson the merchant zimsen the captain jonsson the chairman of the town board and most surprising of all the factor there was a tingling atmosphere of unsatisfied curiosity in the little crowd for rumor of the two hundred thousand crowns had passed from lip to lip and people were asking who the stranger was who his father had been and what he could want with so much money when christian christiansson in his long blue ulster and closefitting fur cap came out of the house and parted from his host and hostess at the porch he seemed to be in high spirits for he saluted everybody at the gate and mentioned most of the company by name this intensified the curiosity and amid a running fire of chaff and laughter the bolder ones began to probe with questions youll put up at the innfarm tonight mr christiansson no doubt mr jonsson no doubt but theres to be an auction there in the morning you knowi say theres to be an auction in the morning so youll be turned out tomorrow unless said the captain with a wink in his weather eye unless mr christiansson buys up the old place and turns farmer and innkeeper and why not captain zimsen why not hard work early and late sir well no man ever won the day by snoring christian christiansson had swung to the saddle when the factor came up to him with his rheumy eyes shining and said dont be surprised if i follow you to thingvellir life is short and before i die i have something to say to magnus stephenson we talked of him on the ship sir didnt wehim and his rascally young brother said the merchant we did said christian christiansson and then at the last moment the ponyboy being mounted and everything ready a spirit of recklessness came over him and he added but you made one mistake mr oddsson and what was that mr christiansson you said oscar stephenson had never done anything in his life except putting an end to it but he did one thing once i remember he stood for parliament when i was at home and gave a dreadful drubbing to the dunderhead who opposed him goodbye when he was gone it was the same is if a spell had been broken something in his last word something in his laugh and something in the lifting of his cap as he cantered up the road had struck a vague consciousness of his identity into the gossips at the gate for a moment they stared into each others face in blank bewilderment and then the merchant said who the deuce can he be then shall i tell you who my sister says he is said the factor who oscar stephenson himself it fell in their midst like a thunderbolt well that would explain somethingi say that would explain something said the banker and he told the story of magnus stephensons interest within halfanhour the word had gone through the town with the rush and rattle of the holme wind christian christiansson was oscar stephenson almost in as many words he had said so himself and there could not be a doubt about it that night at the artisans institute there were a hundred stories of oscar stephenson some of them were good and they were told with tears but some were bad yet they were received with peals of laughter in the smokingroom of the hotel the students sang oscars songs until the lamps went out and then they bellowed them through the darkness in a dozen different keys while the windows rattled with the vibration of their lusty voices meantime a group of sedater citizens had taken their surmise to the minister and he had said with his shy smile we cannot uncover his nakedness you know but we can go on with the arrangements for the banquet and so tempt him to reveal himself they went on with them immediately the banquet was to be at the templars hall the night after the strangers return to reykjavik the minister was to propose christian christiansson icelands favorite son and heir then the students were to sing oscar stephensons patriotic hymn isafold my isafold great land of frost and fire and after the guest had spoken the cathedral choir were to give christian christianssons stirring anthem who shall ascend into the hill of the lord who shall rise up in his holy place even he who has clean hands and a pure heart and hath not lifted up his mind with vanity everything else was forgotten the odium attaching for ten years to oscar stephensons name was gone the dishonor which death itself could not kill had disappeared before the blinding light of genius the glittering shrine of success viii meantime the man himself was on his way to thingvellir the clouds might be low but his heart was high the sea might break on the black beach with a monotonous moan but his whole being sang a song of hope a wild activity of thoughts imagination feelings and impulses possessed him and for the first time since he returned to iceland he was entirely happy god had permitted him to come in time to save his people from being made houseless and homeless he had sinned and he had suffered but the sacred duty of atonement was not to be denied him the innfarm which had been mortgaged to save him from the grip of the law was to be given back unburdened to his brother two hundred thousand crowns were in his breast pocket and they were to buy the old place at the auction tomorrow morning as he cantered up the road that led out of the town his soul careered like a leaf in autumn under a bottom wind of hope and joy he saw himself arriving at the farm in the dusk of the evening and meeting his mother and magnus and his daughter elin he heard himself saying mother dont you know me i am oscar and i have come back to make amends and next day when the auction would be over the sheriff gone and everybody crying for happiness he saw himself taking elin between his kneeselin with the eyes of thora yet with his own face looking at him as in a glassand saying you are to come with me now my dearest and if you have gone short of anything as a child i will make it up to you as a woman the ponyboy caught the contagion of his high spirits and as they cantered along he sang snatches of the elfsong dance by night and dance by day life and time will pass away love alone will last alway he was a tall lad of eighteen who must have resembled his mother for he had the pink and white face of a girl they had passed the hot springs and the ellida river and risen to the heights of the first hill on their journey before the sunshine of the boys spirits began to be overcast then as they rested their ponies and tightened the girths he said in a frightened whisper do you hear it sir hear what said christian christiansson the peak said the boy pointing to a rock of rugged outline that stood on the topmost line of the mountain to their right with a dark cloud that was like a great monster of the air poised above it what about it my boy the storm and the peak are friends sir for they always talk together before the wind comes down when people hear them talking they tremble because they know the storm is coming let us get on then said christian christiansson in halfanhour they had come to the bleak and barren country of the red hill the red lake and the deep tarn with its dark waters and gloomy shore and by that time the great cloud which had been poised above the peak was broken into many parts and each part seemed to be fighting the others in the sky for there were volleys of sound like thunder hadnt we better stop at the farm at middale sir said the boy but christian christiansson thought of his mother of magnus of elin and of the auction tomorrow morning and he determined to push on they were on the edge of the moss fell heath when the snow began to fall it fell at first in big flakes like dead butterflies for there was yet no wind on the ground although the clouds were still scurrying across the sky and the noise overhead was deafening christian christiansson remembered what the minister had said that of all the miseries of life the worst was to be caught in a snowstorm on this desolate moor and for one moment he asked himself if he ought not to go back to middale and wait there until the storm had passed but at the next instant he told himself that the devilish powers which had dogged his steps since he landed in iceland were trying to keep him back from the good work he meant to do so he must go on in any case youre not afraid my lad not to say afraid faltered the boy let us gallop then the heath itself when they came to it was a white wilderness within the embracement of black rocks and mountains they were only able to find the road by following the beacons which were like whiteheaded sentinels in single file with their backs to the storm going on and on over the wide waste the sense of desolation was appalling and a voice seemed to say go back while there is time to do so but again christian christiansson thought of his mother of magnus of elin and of the auction tomorrow morning and he urged his horse through the deepening snow they had not gone much farther when the wind came down and hurled itself in their faces the snowflakes were pelted and slung at them like splinters of flint it seemed as if every flake would cut through their skin then the cold became intense ice gathered over their eyes and at every other minute they had to stop to break it away finally the darkness descended upon them the deadly implacable darkness of the wind and snow a wild torrent of whirling snowflakes swept over the moor and concealed them from each other it became so dark that they could only see a few yards on either side and they had to cry out at intervals in order to keep together they were now in the mighty grip of the storm and could no longer think of going back the wind hissed and howled and wept the snow pelted and cut there was no shelter of rock or tree or bush on any side there was nothing about or above them but the wide wilderness and the thickening darkness christian christiansson was sorry for the boy but thus far his own spirits had risen with every fresh phase of the tempest he had a sense of fighting a fierce duel with the elements at the other end of his journey were his mother and magnus and elin and if he could reach them before morning he would be able to succor and save them it was a race as for life for the lives of his nearest and dearest against the wild wantonness of elemental powers nature herself with more than her usual heartlessness toward man was at devilish war with his effort to save his people but he would conquer her let it snow or blow or hail or thunder he would reach home in time for the auction the ponies were the first to fail the one that christian christiansson rode was a strong mare of mature age but the boys was a young one newly broken and it seemed to be suffocating in the snow and the wind after a time it turned its head from the storm and refused to go forward and then the boy had to alight and walk in front of it and tug it along by the bridle in a little while it stopped altogether and slid down on its side and could with difficulty be raised to its feet again hes only four and this is his first journey said the boy in a whimpering tone as he laid the lash on the ponys back then the boy himself began to give in he wore bag gloves with two thumbs but no fingers and in tugging at the bridle he lost one of them as a consequence his bare hand got frostbitten and was soon quite powerless in walking before the horse his clothes had frozen stiff and he was hardly able to put one foot before the other his voice became weaker and his speech more broken and when his companion called back to him he could scarcely send forward his reply at last in a faint voice he cried come and fetch me siri have no strength left a little later he became delirious talked of his mother and tried to strip off his clothes as if he were going to bed christian christiansson experienced deep anguish of mind at the thought of the sufferings he had inflicted upon the lad but he lifted him to the saddle with his back to the horses head and comforted him as well as he could in his awful situation courage my boy courage the house of rest cannot be far off well shelter there the storm will pass a vision of the little house of basaltic rocks which he had entered with helga had been floating through his mind like a dream of the calenture how long it took him to get there and with what desperate exertions he never knew but walking in front of the young pony and leading the mare beside him he reached the little house at last as soon as they were under cover the boy dropped to his knees and with a gibbering accent as if speaking through halffrozen lips he began to repeat the greed i believe in god the father almighty he thought he was saying his prayers the house of rest was badly provided but it had hay for the horses and they began to munch it immediately there was no lamp and when the door was shut to keep out the driving snow the place was in pitch darkness after a while the air became warm with the breath of the ponies and the mens clothes melted this made them very cold and they had to beat their arms under their armpits to keep their bodies from shivering and their teeth from chattering then the atmosphere grew hot for the ponies began to sweat and the boy stripped off his outer garments and lay down with the young horse boy and horse side by side as if they had been human companions christian christiansson threw himself upon the wooden platform prepared for travelers and listened to the storm outside the wind was howling and hissing around the corners of the house and he had the sense of the snow becoming deeper and deeper about it if the storm continued the little place might be buried before long and then it would be difficult or impossible to cut a way out his heart fell low he began to feel appalled by the awfulness of his position the devilish elements were beating him he was only half way on his journey and if he could not make the rest of it before morning his mother and magnus and little elin would be homeless yet the storm showed no sign of abating the ponies were spent the boy was done and it seemed impossible to go on suddenly a new thought came to him and he raised himself and cried my boy my boy do you know the road from borg to thingvellir yes sir said the boys drowsy voice in the darkness what sort of road is it awful sir worse than this ten times worseover the hengel mountain and past the boiling pits sir thank god said christian christiansson and he lay down again with content telling himself that the same storm that was keeping him back must keep back the sheriff and therefore there could be no auction tomorrow morning the storm still hissed and howled and wept in the wild wilderness outside but the tempest had now lost its terrors the boy and the young pony had fallen asleep and were breathing heavily the mare was munching the last of the hay and christian christiansson with his heart at ease and a sense of safety had settled himself for the night and was dropping off into unconsciousness when there came a thud on the roof of the little house he started up and listened and again he heard the thudthud over his head the mare also heard the strange sounds and ceasing to eat she came across to him as if in fear and laid her head upon his legs it was not at first that he realized that the sounds were human footsteps and that somebody was walking on the roof but as soon as he did so he cried out to know who was there and a voice that was like a voice out of a grave answered let me in he removed the saddles with which he had barricaded the door and opened it there was then another doorway of the snow that had fallen since he entered but in a little while he had cut it away with the spade that hung on the wall for that purpose at the next moment a man crossed the thresholda man and a horse ix oh god what a night said the stranger he seemed to be scared and awestricken by the uproar he had come out of when christian christiansson had closed and barricaded the door afresh the darkness seemed denser than ever have you any matches he asked noyesthat is to say im afraid theyre damp said the stranger he struck one and it spluttered out take care then a boy is lying asleep on the floor bring your horse this way thanks how lucky i heard you i had lost the road and was wondering what hollow ground i was walking on when you shouted from below it nearly frightened my life out it was a young voice the stranger was clearly a young man probably a young farmer they talked together in the darkness neither being able to see the others face who are you my lad asked christian christiansson i am eric arnasson i come from thingvellir who are you sir i am a traveler and im on my way there going to the sale i suppose yes then i have just come from the house you are bound for are you a farmservant at the innfarm used to be but the hands are all gone now i was the last to leave sir where are gudrun and jon vidalin farming korastead these ten years sir and asher he has gone too we thinned down fast when the master got into trouble i was with him from the time i was a little chap but he paid me off this afternoon wheres old maria dead long ago is there nobody left then nobody but the master and his old mother and his young daughter daughter well everybody calls her so but shes only his niece is there nobody else in the house tonight not a soul that i know of and they will not be there another night i suppose but the sale can not take place tomorrow my lad the sheriff will never be able to get there today he has to come from borg and the road over the mountain is even wilder than this the sheriff is there now sir now i left him in the kitchen when i came away making a list of the house property and he was to sleep at the parsonage christian christianssons hair seemed to rise from his head there was no escape from the terrible journey he must go on in spite of the storm his limbs felt like lead and when he tried to move them he could only do so with a tremendous effort but he shook off his torpor and began to saddle his mare what do you think is the time my lad i dont know my watch has stopped and then i have no light either it must be seven oclock at least but youre not thinking of going on tonight sir i must youll never get to thingvellir sir it was bad enough for me with my back to the storm but it will be ten times worse for you with your face to it youll be lost your friends will see no more of you good night take the boy back to reykjavik in the morning out on the snowfield again christian christiansson was conscious of nothing but a headlong impulse to go on the saddle was damp and he had a sensation of riding in cold water the snow was deeper than before and sometimes his horse stumbled up to its girths the darkness was now the darkness of night and it was with difficulty that he could follow the line of the beacons the wind hurled itself against his body the snow slung itself against his face but still he strained along for a new and inspiring thought had come to him the almighty was fighting on his side in his fierce war with the elements the devilish powers of nature had been trying to keep him back from saving his people and when he reached the house of rest they had lulled him into a false repose but god had sent the farmservant to warn him that his dear ones were still in danger and that if he stayed there until morning he would arrive at his journeys end too late thinking so his heart grew strong for he felt himself in the immediate presence of him who was greater than the greatest tempest but after some two hours had passed the sacred fire of this theory began to fail him he was growing faint and the beatings of his heart were suffocating he was also losing his way in the deepening snow and when his mare stumbled into the drifts he was scarcely strong enough to drag her out of them then before he was aware of it the voices of nature were speaking to him again why did you leave the house of rest the sheriff may be at the farm but no buyers can get there tonight and without people to bid there can be no auction just as this thought came to him he saw a red speck gleaming through the darkness and he turned his horses head in the direction of the light it proved to be in the window of a farmhouse and finding the door he shouted and presently a man came out to him ive lost my way he cried over the wailing of the wind tell me please what place this is this is korastead the man cried back and then a woman came into the hallway and stood behind him the man was jon vidalin and the woman was gudrun but neither of them knew him where were you going sir said jon to the auction at thingvellir you are not so far out of your road then bear to the right until you cross the river and then follow the stones until you come to the chasm christian christiansson hesitated im tired having ridden from reykjavik and it doesnt seem much good going farther nobody else will be fool enough to travel in weather like this and without people to bid there can be no auction so if you can give me shelter and a shakedown you are welcome to the shelter sir but if you want the place you had better go on and get there why so because its a sheriffs sale and hell sell in any case how can he sell if theres nobody to buy hell bid for somebody himself sir and we all know who that is who somebody at government house who has wanted the farm these fifteen years so you think the sheriff will hold the auction tomorrow morning whether anybody is there or not sure to sir the fewer there are to bid the better hell be pleased and the bigger the ministers bargain i must go on then i suppose said christian christiansson come in and melt yourself first said jon the wind is going downit will be quiet presently a few minutes later christian christiansson was drinking hot coffee in the elthouse while jon and gudrun talked of the family at the innfarm we were servants with the family for ten years so we know them well sir said jon poor old anna said gudrun she would be welcome to anything i have but with the boys growing up we havent a bed to spare in the badstofa theres an adopted daughter isnt there there is sir and anybody would be glad to have her for a helper but the master wont hear of letting her go elin shall be servant to nobody he says it isnt magnus stephensons fault if misfortune has overtaken him said jon he has the strength of samson and has done the work of six men how does he bear his troubles badly said gudrun he never goes to church now or reads the prayers at home either yes said jon he has lost his religion poor fellow and when a man loses that he loses everything you know people are afraid of him said gudrun he looks like a man with no luck and he is always beating his arms about him and driving away the good spirits that walk by a mans side and what do people say is the cause of the change in him the bank and bad times said jon and a bad brother said gudrun his brother is dead and the old mistress has made a saint of him but she darent mention his name before magnus or he gets up and goes out of the house does he hate him so much then there was a time when i believe in my heart he would have killed him said jon christian christiansson started up and prepared to go on to thingvellir although his halffrozen limbs would scarcely cross the saddle or his swollen fingers hold the reins again his heart had fallen low and the hope with which he had begun his journeythe hope of a joyful reunion at the end of itwas now gone the intensity of magnuss feeling made it impossible that he should reveal himself to his people if he rode up to the door and said i am oscar the report of my death was false and i have come back rich and prosperous what would magnus say he would say your father is dead your wife is in her grave your mother and your child have gone through poverty and perhaps want and all the consequence of your transgressionsdo you think that your miserable money will make amends and then his brother would fling him back into the road not tonight could he make himself knownnot tonight at all events perhaps tomorrow when the sale would be over and the sheriff gone and he had smoothed the way and made sure of his welcome but now he must go to the inn like any other traveler who had come there to be present at the auction and to bid for the estate seeing his course clear in this way his heart rose again and he pushed on with a better will the storm had subsided and when he came to the sudden mouth of the almanagja the wind dropped altogether and it was almost as if some vast volcano in the sky had poured its lava over the earth in snow the chasm itself was full of memoriesmemories of the day of his triumph the day of his disgracebut icicles hung from where the flags of the nations had floated and drifts of snow like mighty mushrooms were lying in the holes where the tents had been he remembered the witch who had said beware of your brother and he thought of the white face that had broken in upon the dancing in the breathless calm the sky came out and it spanned the brant walls like a majestical roof studded with stars but he stumbled in the darkness on to the frozen surface of the drowning pool and almost rode up to the spot where he had sat with helga at the bridge that crossed the frozen waterfall he caught his first sight of the lighted windows of the innfarm and then his heart seemed to stand still his mother his brother and his little daughter were there and he had been ten years preparing to join them but now that he was so near he could hardly bring himself to go on would his mother recognize himshe who had read his features first and known him from the cradle up he was afraid she would and then in the tumult of his tossing heart he was afraid she would not nobody in iceland had known him hitherto and now he was aware that he was leas like himself than ever for seeing his face in a glass as he came out of korastead he saw that his lips were swollen and his eyes bloodshot with the heavy labor of that awful day he had crunched through the broken ice of the river below the bridge and reached the silent snow of the pathway to the farm when the door opened and two men came out of the house the sheriff and the pastor he thought he drew rein and they did not hear him but when they had taken the path to the parsonage the dogs inside began to bark the palpitation of his heart was almost choking him and it would have taken little to make him turn about and fly how long he stood therewhether five minutes or tenhe never rightly knew a hundred thoughts more wild than the whirling snow were tossing within his brain but thinking at length that almighty god who had brought him through the perils of that fearful daydefeating the designs of the devil and of the elements and driving him before his mighty will as before a greater hurricanecould not have led him there at last to any end save a good one he urged his horse to the foot of the steps and raised his whip to the window x magnus stephenson had indeed lost his religion for fifteen years he had believed with all the strength of his soul that everybody in this life was treated according to his deserts that if you did right you were rewarded sooner or later and if you did wrong you were punished but experience of the world had little by little and year by year inflicted upon his profound faith in the rule of conscience the most inexplicable contradictions the man who lived a good life was not being rewarded and the man who lived an evil one was not being punished what then was there left to believe that there was no god in the universe at all or that if there were a god he did nothing magnus stephenson had tried to do what was right he had taken up the burdens which others laid down and he had struggled on with a strong heart for fifteen years he had labored like a slave and though his arrears of debt constantly accumulated he had never allowed himself to believe that the end was coming on the mortgage was monstrous the interest was exorbitant and the bank would come to see that more than he got out of the land and stock it was impossible for man to make but the deed of execution had been served on him at length the advertisements of the sale had been published and the two preliminary auctions had been held then as if in a moment the mans religion had disappeared and his soul had sent up that sublime if blasphemous cry which since the beginning of the world has borne to heaven the lamentation and protest of humanity against the misery of man i have obeyed your laws i have lived a good life i have assisted the poor and helped the oppressed i have shared my bread with the orphan and protected the widowwhat have you done for me in the grim silence which follows that ghastly question it is more than a mans religion that disappears and magnus stephensons belief in right and wrong his faith in justice in conscience and in virtue had gone down together leaving nothing but the fierce convulsions of his animal nature from the moment the sheriff arrived to make the inventory he had done little but sit in the hall and drink he sat there all day long with his coarse snowstockings over his boots his sullen face to the stove his hands deep in his trouser pockets his broad forehead heavily wrinkled under the rough stubble of his irongrey hair his massive jaw resting on his breast and his mighty loins making the chair creak as he moved and turned at intervals during the day his mother tried to comfort him dont be too downhearted magnus said anna the stars shine when it is dark you know isnt it dark enough yet said magnus and he laughed bitterly and drank again at intervals elin came to him also she was a tall girl now nearly sixteen years of age with a whisper of womanhood in her face and form but coming in her short blue skirt and buckled shoes she would slide into a seat on magnuss knee and slipping one arm about his neck put the other hand on his hot forehead and try to soothe him in her motherly little way but there there that will do go to your grandmother im tired he would say early in the day he had been tormented by thoughts of the travelers who might come from a distance to stay overnight in order to be present at the auction and in his minds eye he saw the innfarm full of them with their indifferent talk and heartless laughter and himself in his impotent rage itching with a desire to fling them into the road but when the storm broke his fears on that head were appeased and while the wind and snow wailed and wept about the house he sat for hours alone in a gloomy and tragic pence besides the sheriff the only person who visited the house that day was the pastor and he came as late as ten at night to take the sheriff back to lodge with him by that time all that was left of the broken household had gathered in the hall where magnus still sat before the stove while the sheriff with anna and elin stood by the dresser making an end of the inventory ugh what a night said the pastor stamping the snow off his stockings youre not likely to be brought out of bed by travelers on a night like thisthats some consolation isnt it he was a garrulous old man with a shallow heart and a shallow head who chewed the cud of his humdrum livelihood with content on his stipend of fifty pounds a year so this is to be your last night in the old home anna what a pity well tapping his snuffbox naked came i out of my mothers womb and naked shall i return thither blessed be the name of the lord magnus moved his chair impatiently and made contemptuous noises in his throat ive known the old house through all its days of joy and sorrow for fortyfive years anna ever since your poor father thats deadi buried him myself god rest his soul god rest his soul said anna ever since the day he gave you away as a bride and a nervous blushing tenderhearted little bride you were too again magnus shuffled in his chair and made noises in his throat i remember it so well because it was the same year that your fathers big barn was burnt down and his cousin jorgen was found dead in the chasm what a sensation that made what inquiries what examining witnesses your predecessor had something on his hands in those days sheriff the sheriff muttered some commonplace and magnus kicked at the smouldering wood in the stove suspicion actually fell upon your father you remember and because he had been drinking and was such an ungovernable man when he was drunk oh for the lords sake lets have done with this cried magnus magnus stephenson protested the pastor if we are in trouble let us behave like gods rational creatures rational hell growled magnus whereupon the sheriff to avoid further friction closed his book with a bang saying he had finished and was ready to go magnus sat quiet while the sheriffa sharpfeatured man with the eyes of a ferretput on his snowshoes and cloak and then with a tremor in his voice and a somber fire in his eyes he turned and said is it all over sir yes it was a long job but its over at last said the sheriff i mean said magnus is it certain that the auction must take place quite certain there has never been any doubt of it that i know of look here sir said magnus heaving up to his feet a sheriff can do a good deal if he cares to use his influence give me another chance and you shall have everything i owe ive had five bad years in successionno wonder i fell into arrears last spring i lost forty lambs in a single night and next morning two heifers and a calf the floods came in the autumn too and half my hay was swept into the lake but weather like that cant last forever we are sure to have a run of good years next give me four years more sirand you shall see what i can do the thing is past praying for said the sheriff dont say that sir listen my people have farmed this place for a hundred and fifty years and a man doesnt like to be the one to lose it my own flesh and blood are in the land toothe strength of my muscles and the sweat of my brow give me three years more sirjust three impossible said the sheriff sheriff come this way said magnus drawing the man aside by the arm and speaking in a low voice so that the women might not hear i dont care a straw about myself ill get along somehow and if i dont it doesnt matterbut theres the child she ought to inherit the farm and shes an orphan but shell get nothing give me a chance for the childs sake sheriff dont be hard on me sell up half my stock to pay part of the interest and let me have two years moreonly two you know quite well that the mortgage is on the loose property as well as the land said the sheriff how can i sap away the security as for the girl shes young and strong let her go into service magnus bit his lip in an effort to control himself and then he said you are quite right sir the girl and i can take care of ourselves but theres the old mother she was born in this house and she expected to die here i shouldnt so much mind if she were gone and to tell you the truth shes not well now sir give me one more year sheriffone single year its no use wasting words said the sheriff matters have gone too far the only thing i can do now is what sir if you can pay me the whole of the interest before nine oclock tomorrow morning i can stop the sale on my own responsibility eight thousand crowns said magnus raising his voice to a cry of derision you ask me to find you eight thousand crowns before nine oclock tomorrow morning you might as well ask me to find you the moon then let us say no more on the subject the bank has been very patient very indulgent the bank cried magnus in the wild defiance of his despair has the bank got a mother has the bank got a child no the bank is a great grinding monster without bowels of compassion for anybody god damn the bank and all its fools and flunkeys magnus stephenson said the pastor raising his little fat hand i will ask you to remember that a clergyman is in your company and if you take gods name in vain take gods name in vain you do that often enoughyou do it every sunday ill not pretend to misunderstand you magnus stephenson for i know you are deeply tainted with skepticism and since you ceased to come to church church you pray to god in your churches and what does he do for you what does he do for any one what has he done for me if your life had been straight and pure god would have watched over you and hasnt it havent i tried to do what was right and yet god is seeing me sold up and turned out and my dear ones left to die in a ditch god chastises his own and if we only have faith in him faith in him where is he is he in the northlands i have never heard of it is he in the southlands ive never seen him here though ive seen the devil often enough hes in the clouds if hes anywhere and thats no use to me magnus stephenson if god is on the earth let him do something heres his chance you call the poor his people dont you well ive fed and sheltered his people for fifteen years and now i want feeding and sheltering myself i want eight thousand crowns before nine oclock tomorrow morning and if god can do anything in the world let him find me the money and save my mother and my child from starvation but he cant do it he can do nothing magnus stephenson said the little clergyman raising his little fat hand again when you come to stand before the great white throne god will have something to forgive you pastor peter when i come to stand before the great white throne i shall have something to forgive god it seems to me blasphemy blasphemy cried the pastor and as he followed the sheriff out of the house magnus sent a ringing laugh of contempt after him into the darkness of the night at the same moment two sheepdogs that had been lying at the door with their snouts on their paws as if anxious to join the uproar began to growl and bark whereupon magnus who had always been a lover of animals kicked them savagely and then reeled back to his seat by the stove the strangers being gone and the little family alone elin who had been standing by the dresser went over to magnus and slid into her seat on his knee and said you must not think about me uncle magnus wherever you have to go i will go too and what is good enough for you is good enough for elin and then who knows what may happen before the sheriff comes back in the morning this is new years eve you know all good things come at new yearmiracles come at new year uncle but the sweet buoyancy of her girlish spirits which had been the sunshine of his life for so many years was failing him at last and putting her aside with petulant expressions he got up and went out to the back then anna who had been sitting in silence by the table took the bible and four hymnbooks from the corner cupboard and rang the bell for prayers i wonder why i did that she said i forgot that eric was gone i hope he found shelter somewhere poor boyi should pity a dog that had to be out of doors on a night like this and then elin in default of magnus read the lesson which anna had marked for her it was the psalm beginning the lord is my shepherd i shall not want and when the short chapter was finished the two women stood up and sang a hymnelin in the silvery treble of youth and anna in the husky tones of age they two only in the lonely house among the solitary hills with nothing about them but the darkness and the snownothing but that and the immeasurable wings of god happy the man whose tender care relieves the poor distressed when he by troubles compassed round the lord will give him rest anna sat down when the hymn was ended but elin continued to stand by the table and closing her eyes with her innocent face uplifted she said a little prayer for herself o father she said bless uncle magnus so that he may fear no evil show me how to help him so that i may not be a burden and a care dear jesus send the miracle that will save uncle magnus and grandma and me it will be such a little thing to you but such a great great thing to us and we shall all be so happy and dwell in the house of the lord forever for christs sake amen then she opened her trustful eyes and said im sure he will grandma and kissing anna she said good night in a cheery voice and went off to bed prayers being over magnus returned to the hall and began to rake out the stove for the night the clouds hung heavier on him than ever and thinking to banish them anna talked of elin she grows more and more like her mother and sometimes i think it can only be a dream that our dear thora is dead if you had heard her praying for the miracle it would have filled your heart brimful she has gone to bed quite certain that the miracle will come before morning it would have to be a miracle to help us now mother said magnus and miracles dont happenexcept such of them as we make for ourselves what do you mean by that magnus said anna lighting the candles i meanif i had to live my life over again i shouldnt try to do what is right mother you wouldnt do what is wrong would you there is no wrong and no right mother there is only what is best and if i had to begin over again i should do what was bestbest for myself and for the people about me you dont know what you are saying magnus there are moments when it might seem to be best to rob even to kill and why not said magnushe was bolting the door if a man came to this house tonight with eight thousand crowns in his pocket do you think i should hesitate to take them my son you dont mean it i do you are driven to despair magnus and a despairing mans words belong to the wind if i thought you meant it i should diei should die this very minute she was crying and there was silence for a moment and then magnus said never mind mother it doesnt matter whether i meant it or not the temptation isnt likely to come to me give me the candle and let us go to bed you have borne a terrible burden magnus and if i could only have helped you to bear it you have mother if it had not been for you and elin i should have gone under ten years ago your father knew he had robbed you of your inheritance and perhaps that helped to kill him in the end it wasnt fathers fault altogether he tried to do what was right too but the poor wretch who comes after the prodigal gleans in a barren field you know with their candles in hand they were turning to goanna to the badstofa above and magnus to the guestroom off the hallwhen the dogs who had risen again and were snuffling at the bottom of the door began to growl and bark theres somebody coming said magnus a moment later there was a sharp knock at the window as with a metal end of a ridingwhip and a tremulous highpitched voice outside making the customary icelandic salutation god be with you they looked at each other in blank surprise while backward thoughts galloped through their minds and then magnus forgetting to give the customary reply walked back to the door and threw it open there was a dull thud of heavy feet on the outside steps and at the next moment a man stood on the threshold he seemed to be an old man for his eyebrows beard and mustache and as much as could be seen of his hair under the peaked hood of his ulster were white with snow one moment he stood there as if breathless after his journey looking from magnus to the mother and from the mother to magnus then he said in the same tremulous voice as before can i have a bed here tonight and shelter for my horse it seemed to anna that he spoke to her but instead of answering immediately she looked across at magnus with helpless eyes that were full of inexpressible fears magnus looked back at his mother and hesitated for an instant while he held the door open with his hand then come in sir he said and the stranger stepped into the house part vii the ball no question makes of ayes and noes but right or left as strikes the player goes and he who tossed you down into the field he knows about it allhe knowshe knows i the little mare is hotshell want a rub down and a rest before you give her a feed ill see to that sir said magnus and he went out and pulled the door after him christian christiansson had taken two paces into the hall and was standing there like a man who is dazed his heart was thumping against his ribs and his pulse was beating violently and he felt that he would fall if he took another step forward so often had he pictured himself in that place that he could not at first believe in the reality coming out of the darkness the light of the candles dazzled him but he looked round the room trying to remember at one glance he took in everythingthe old portraits on the wall the old bornholme clock in the corner the stove and the armchair in front of itand fresh from the warm comfort of government house the innfarm seemed bare and bleak this sent a chill pang of remorse to his mind and the pain of conscience increased when he looked at his mother her hair was white that had once been dark and her face which had been full of the loveliness of love and the beauty of happiness was scored deep with lines of suffering his heart yearned over her and notwithstanding his determination not to reveal his identity until morning it was as much as he could do to restrain himself from saying as well as he could for the emotion that was mastering him mother dont you know me i am oscar and then throwing his arms about her dear neck as he had always meant to do meantime anna who had recovered her selfcontrol and was lighting the lamp that swung from the ceiling glanced across at the newcomer and thought hes nearly frozen stiff and no wonder with that thought she bustled about to rekindle the stove and called on him to remove his snowcovered clothing wont you take off your cloak and boots sir she said and though the question was so commonplace he could not answer immediately for his voice would not come your cloak and boots sir and ill put them to dry by the stove ah yes of course certainly she stood by him while he threw off his ulster and shook the snow from his hair and beard emerging a younger and stronger man but she only thought a stranger i suppose why does he travel in this weather when he had pulled off his ridingboots she brought him a pair of magnuss slippers and said you must have had a terrible ride sir it was pretty bad certainly he said and after that he got on better a gentleman must have been anxious to get on with his journey to travel on a day like this i wasi had something to do at the end of it have you come far sir altogether yes very far from reykjavik perhaps farther than thatfrom england from england from london as he stooped to put on the slippers he thought his mother was looking at him and he trembled between fear and hope of being recognized i suppose he saidhis head was downi suppose youve never been as far as that landlady no sir nor any of your family he could not resist the temptation to say this but his mother did not seem to hear himshe was on her knees breaking sticks into the stove sit up and warm yourself sir my son raked out the fire but these sticks will burn presently you are here on business i suppose yes im here on business anna thought of the auction and waited for the stranger to speak of it when he did not do so she said travelers come from england to buy sheep and ponies but they dont often come in the winter sir still he did not speak he was thinking of elin and looking round for any trace of her and rising from the stove anna said but youll be hungry after your long ridewhat can i give you to eat anything at allanything you have ready im afraid i have nothing readythat is to say nothing that is good enough for the like of you sir as soon as he could find his voice after that he said dont you always keep smoked mutton in an iceland house well yes if that will do sir i should like it above all things there was a moments silence and he thought his mother was looking at him again then perhaps you are an icelander she said yes im an icelander he answered what is your name another wild impulse to reveal himself immediately to his mother nearly swept down his fears for he was choking with a sense of duplicity and his conscience was fighting in contrary ways but after a moment his prudence conquered and with a gulp in his throat he said they call me christian christiansson well its lucky you found us up sir we were on the point of going to bed i suppose the other members of your family are gone already theres only one besides what youve seenmy granddaughterand she had just gone off as you came in sir he looked at her as she was crossing in front of him and saw that she was wearing the brooch which he had given her when he came back from oxford that sent all the blood to his head again and he was saying before he was aware of it do you know landlady ive slept in this house before it must have been a long time ago theni dont remember you it was a long time ago that pointing to the portrait of anna on the wall that is a portrait of yourself isnt it it used to be but i was younger when it was like me sir a sudden softening came into his voice as he replied it was exactly like you when i saw you last landlady then youve not been here for ten years at least sir quite ten years he answered and that pointing to the portrait of the governor is a portrait of your husband it must be more than ten years since you were here sir for my husband is more than twelve years in his grave it is more than ten years in fact it is sixteen yearsnearly sixteen she looked fixedly at him for a moment and something in her memory seemed to stir for her bosom heaved perceptibly but she only said with a deep sigh weve seen trouble since you traveled in these parts before sir ah yes ive heard of iti heard of it in reykjavik you had a son that was my son who opened the door to you but you had another sona younger son yes butwe never talk of him now sir whos portrait is that in your brooch landlady its hishe is dead died in disgrace didnt he who knows that sir man sees the deed they say but god the circumstance they think hard things of him in reykjavik though they say he robbed his father of every penny when he went away and never sent anything home toward the maintenance of his child it needs no skill to wound the defenceless said anna bridling up the father robbed himself to save his son if you want to know the truth and as for never sending anything home for the child the poor boy had nothing to send for he was poor himself sir so you found that out did you after he was dead we didone of his fathers english friends wrote to tell us so and all the time he had been writing letters to me to say how busy he was and how well he was succeedingjust to keep up my heart and save me from fretting the mothers lingering fondness for her prodigal was rising in her eyes and breaking in her voice and she was trying to turn away but he could not let her go what a pity his father didnt live long enough to hear that it would have softened his heart toward him perhaps it didnt need softening sirnot at the end at all events his father forgave him did he he died thinking his son had become a great man and had justified all his hopes and atoned for everything it was only a delusion sir but it made him very happy your son was a musician wasnt he yes sir and from the time he was a child he used to scribble things and call them his compositions the pieces of paper always disappeared and i never knew what had become of them but when his father was lying dead i found out where they were and where were they in his poor fathers hands christian christiansson had gone on and on while the hot blood throbbed in his brain struggling between the desire to reveal himself and the fear of doing so but he was drawn up at last by a stifling sense of his own unworthiness and before he knew what he was doing he said the man who could do wrong to a father who loved him like that must have been a scoundrela badhearted scoundrel and he deserved everything that happened to him he was nothing of the kind sir said anna he may have done wrongim not defending himbut a betterhearted boy was never born into the world everybody loved him and he loved everybody and as for me christian christiansson recovered himself at the sound of annas faltering words god bless her he thought and his heart danced to a new song but he only said with a perceptible lowering of his voice i beg your pardon naturally his mother cannot think so but this is the first time ive heard a good word for him since i came to iceland i hadnt meant to speak of him at all sir i never do when my other son is nearhush he is coming back but the noise which they heard behind them was that of the opening and closing of a bedroom not a kitchen door and it was followed by the light footstep of a girl whereupon anna said elin i thought you were in bed and asleep my child i was but i awoke and heard you had a visitor so i got up to help grandma christian christiansson trembled from head to foot the silvery voice at his back seemed to come to him from across a wide abyssfor it was a familiar voice but vague as with the mist of dreams and dim as with the clouds of night this is my granddaughter sir said anna and then christian christiansson turned and saw hera young girl as tall as a woman with fair complexion a soft smiling face and beautiful blue eyes she wore a laced bodice a turneddown collar a hufa a tassel plaited hair and looked like the living picture of what her mother had been when he came from college it was his daughter his little elin whom he had traveled so far to see but it seemed to him as if all the cruel years had rolled back in a moment and it was thora returned to life ii well now that you are here you had better lay the table said anna yes grandma said the girl put on the smoked mutton and the rullapilsa and the rikling while i go to the elthouse to make coffee yes grandma make yourself at home christian christianssonmy granddaughter will wait on you i will he tried to say but his voice would scarcely come anna being gone he sat for some moments looking at elin while she tripped from dresser to table and in and out of the pantry spreading the cloth and laying the plates and the food the girl was so simple so natural so free from selfconsciousness that she seemed to be hardly aware of his presence for she hummed to herself softly as if some songbird in her breast could not be kept quite still his heart swelled and throbbed as his eyes followed her about and when she left the room the light seemed to fail in it and when she came back the air seemed to become warm in the dizzy happiness of that hour he felt as if he had lost a daughter in every one of the fifteen years he had lived without her and now that she was near so close his hands burned and itched to hold her he wanted to take her in his arms and say my child my child doesnt something tell you who i am i am your father and i have wanted you so much and thought of you so often and now i have come to fetch you and we shall never be parted again but between fear of frightening her and dread of disclosing himself all he could do was to conquer the fluttering in his throat and say your name is elin isnt it yes sir said the girl what a beautiful name it is tooeleen your father chose it didnt he i have never heard that sir did grandmother say so grandmother and i he stammered have been talking of your father you dont remember him oh no sirhe died when i was quite little what a loss that must have been to you my child i cant say that sir said the girl because you see uncle magnus has been the same as a father to me all my life and i have never known any difference what a loss to your father himself then how happy you would have made him and how proud he would have been of you i cant say that either said the girl again because he lived five years after i was born and it seems he never took any notice of me did grandmother tell you so oh no sir indeed no nor uncle magnus neither but everybody know all about my father and even the girls at school knew that a feeling of mortal shame came over him and the warm pulsing place in his breast grew still and cold so you are not sorry your father is dead elin it wouldnt be right to say that sir at all events you feel no love for him i never knew himyou cant love somebody you never knew can you perhaps if he had lived longer and returned home i might have come to love him but i dont see how i could if what people say about him is true what do they say my child they say he was unkind to my mother and that that was one of the reasons why she died so early then you never wish you could have seen and known your father how can i if he wasnt good to my poor mother why should i think he would have been good to me but see your supper is ready grandma will bring the coffee presently wont you begin with the meat sir he sat down to the table but his hunger was gone for a moment he almost wished himself back in the black night from which he had come the girls simple words had been ringing the deathknell of his expectations he had left her all these years to the keeping and care of otherscould he expect to come back now and find the affection he had forfeited ah no he had come too latetoo late but just as one part of the plan he had formed for himself was becoming vague and shadowy a gleam of new light was shot into his brain and his heart rose with a bound didnt grandma call you christian christiansson asked the girl yes he answered ever hear that name before my child the girl turned to him with a face glowing with excitement and said everybody in iceland has heard it sir it is the same as the name of the great composer who lives in england a deafening tumult of joy was rising within him and he said so youyou have heard of him have you i sing his songs sir they are beautiful i think they are the most beautiful songs in the world would you like me to sing one of them while you eat your supper will you i should like to she said and before he could catch the breath which had been suspended she had slipped off like a shaft of moonlight and was back like a ray of the sun bringing a guitar in her hands this was my mothers guitar and now its mine and its such a good one she said and with the utter freedom from selfconsciousness which is the charm of children she sat and began to play after a moment she stopped with her head aside and said which should it be i wonder but perhaps you know them all and would like me to sing something in particular his face was down the waves of emotion were surging through and through him singsing anything you like my darling he replied the fluttered earnestness of his words startled her for a moment but she only smiled with a new sweetness and began to sing first in low clear halftones and then in a high tremulous treble that was like the peal of a lark at the gate of heaven christian christiansson could not eat he could only rest his elbows on the table and cover his face with his hand his own child was singing his own song to him in a voice that was like her mothers voice and like his own voice too when the song was done she turned to him again with eyes shining with unshed tears and said isnt that beautiful it was beautifully sung my child beautifully he said and then after a moment elin would you like to hear something of the man who wrote that song and how he came to write it elins eagerness was heartbreaking indeed indeed i should she said do you know your namesake then i have known him all his life my child tell me about him oh do tell me one who has such beautiful thoughts and feelings must be so good and noble he is neither the one nor the other elin but only a poor wayward sinner like ourselves in early life he did wrong by his young wife and she died then he did wrong by his father and he had to fly from his country after that he went through many sufferings and was guilty of many sins but he came to himself at the end and then he remembered a little daughter whom he had left behind him he wished to return to her immediately and be a father to her at last and make it up to her for all that he had done amiss to her mother who was dead but there were many things to do first for he was like one who was buried under an avalanche which he had brought down on himself and he had to work his way back to life and the world so when he was far away and his heart was hungry for the love of his little girl and he didnt know what was happening to her and he wanted so muchoh so muchto go to her but could not do so yet because he had sinned and must pay his penalty he wrote that song and it was the cry of his soul to the mother in heaven to comfort and care for their child on earth as elin listened to the story of christian christiansson the tears which had been standing in her eyes rolled down her cheeks and her bosom under her laced bodice slowly rose and as slowly fell again how beautiful she said and seeing how much she was moved by the sorrows of the man who was not her father the new light came to him and he asked himself why if she could not care for him in his true character she should not love him as christian christiansson there was a shadowy ghost of pain in that thought too but he put it aside after years of hope and heavy labor he had come home to claim his child and what he had dreaded had come to passher heart had been poisoned against him but while she loathed him as oscar stephenson she loved him as christian christiansson oh beautiful blind pathetic fallacy could he not let it be in a tumult of heart and brain that was like a whirlpool in a dark river he had risen to go to the girl hardly knowing what he was to do or say when anna came back with a smoking coffeepot in her hand saying in a cheery voice here it is at last the fire had gone out in the elthouse and i had work enough to kindle it and then having both in the room at one momenthis mother and his daughterhis feelings almost mastered him again and he had as much as he could do to keep himself from blurting out everything and so being done with further torture but just as the words of his confession were trembling on his lips he thought not tonight tomorrow morning and then what joy what happiness almost at the same moment magnus returned to the house and said the little mare was nearly done sir but ive rubbed her down and given her hay and she shall have a mash before i go to bed let us have a bottle of brandy first said christian christiansson and a few minutes later elin was carrying away the dishes to wash them anna was going into magnuss bedroom to make it ready for the guest and the two brothers were sitting at opposite sides of the table with the bottle between them iii they were less like each other now than ever beforethe elder with his matted black beard his strong features and the vertical lines in his low brow under the upright stubble of his irongrey hair the younger with his luminous brown eyes and delicate face his full round forehead and his thin silken light hair brushed backward to the crown christian christiansson was quivering to the core at this first encounter with the brother whom he had wronged and ruined but he tried to bear himself bravely and to see how safe it would be to reveal his identity when the time came to do so its good of you to give up your room to me he began thats nothingnothing at all said magnus and perhaps you ought to know why im here tonight please yourself sirplease yourself to tell you the truth then im here to attend the auction tomorrow morning i only heard of it in reykjavik yesterday having arrived by the laura the day before so that was the business that brought you sir it was ive been abroad for fifteen years and ive made some money and now ive come home to invest it so knowing this was a good farm none better in iceland sir if it only had a chance and if you can afford to buy it out and out i think i canive money enough in my pocket at this moment to buy the place tomorrow and leave some for something else im sorry for you though and if its painful to you to hear me talk like this magnus who had been rolling in his chair like a man whose mind as well as his body was uneasy began to laugh immoderately not at all sir not at all he said filling his glass its pleasant to hear of anybody having more money than he wants for my part ive never had enough to pay my debts sir for sixteen years ive been ploughing the waves and now raising his glass and draining it im reaping the breakers b them christian christiansson trembled to his very heart at the sound of magnuss laughterthe bitter laughter of rebellion and despairbut he tried to cover up his fear and to carry it off with a cheery tone dont be too depressed he said nobody knows what the future has in store for him its a pretty dark night outside but all the same the sun will rise tomorrow morning besides theres always a sunny side to misfortune if well only allow ourselves to see it life is sweet my friend whatever happens you think it is sir i know it is so why should we sit down on our little handful of thorns because some of us have nothing else to sit upon said magnus and he laughed againthe same cold quaking laughter christian christiansson shuddered but struggled on you think youve failed but i know some that have succeeded who would be glad to change places with you any minute theyve got their gold or their fame or both pouring down on them like an avalanche and nothing to do with it nobody to share it withso it is only so much dead sea fruit being piled on their backs you are not like that even if you have to lose your land youve got your health and a good character and a clean conscience and your dear ones left to you havent you thats why said magnus you dont suppose im thinking of myself do you its just because ive got my dear ones left to me that this accursed illluck is so hard to bear whats it to me to have my houses full of lambs if the floods have come and they are floating on the lake you talk like a man who has never known misfortune sir christian christiansson felt dizzy perhaps i haventperhaps i have he said in a faint voice but ive known despair and i know that no man can live by that we can only live by hopenot what is but what is to beand if we cannot believe when the clouds are dark that the world is ruled in righteousness and is it said magnus does the bad man suffer in this world do his sheep die of the rot and his cattle tumble over the rocks or do they increase faster than anybody elses no sir he said turning away in his seat if youre a rascal ready to rob your own father the chances are youll prosper in this world but if youre an honest man trying to do good to everybody as likely as not youll do no good to yourself or to anybody about you the dizziness which had seized christian christiansson was increasing every moment but he said the world has its own way of punishing offenders and even if they escape in life death is always waiting for them death said magnus swinging round in his creaking chair death is a blind blundering monster who strikes down the young and leaves the old the happy and leaves the miserable the innocent and leaves the guilty the poor helpless betrayed one and leaves the betrayer we have all seen that havent we i have i know that much the heat and flame of magnuss husky voice had fallen to a thick whisper that was like a broken sob christian christiansson dared not raise his face but he tried to say god brings out all things well in the end i have always found it so the march of the world may be enveloped in darkness but it tends toward justice in the long run what is the long run to me sir said magnus im only here for a few years and i want justice now i want to see the bad man punished in the present not in some future generation justice you say the sins of the fathers visited on the childrenthats the only justice i see in this world a poor child left penniless because her father gambled or drank the money he didnt makedo you call that justice sir i dont magnuss thick voice was breaking again and there was silence for a little while no no sir dont tell me we get our deserts in this worldany of usgood or bad life gives the lie to that old storyalways has always will do if you are a cheat or a profligate or a prodigal you may live in luxury and travel as far as the sun but if you are a poor devil staying at home and working your fingers to the bone youll get thrown out into the road but whats the good of talking the evil day is coming let it come never before had christian christiansson felt so little and so mean the sources of pride were dry in him and he was brought very low in his own esteem in the presence of the brother who had borne his burdens and broken down under them he saw himself as an abject and pitiful thing he could not raise his head for he felt as if his shame were written on his forehead but he struggled to say something and the only words that came to him seemed to scorch his tongue and parch his throat i can not dispute with you he said youve suffered more than i have and no doubt your present troubles are the legacy that was left to you by the prodigal brother your mother was talking about magnuss manner changed instantly at the mention of his mother she was talking about him again was she he said does she often talk of him then too often and she seems to think of nothing else he was the foundation she built her house upon poor soul and it fell but she holds to him all the same god bless her said christian christiansson involuntarily god bless all women i say theyre always on the side of the sinners and the sufferers theyll get their compensation somewherethey musthe was thinking of tomorrow morning i see no sign of it in this case said magnus she was the best mother to him a man ever had and he knew it but he repaid her with neglect and contempt contempt what else would you call it he lived five years abroad and wrote to her only once in all that time yet every night she used to stand outside the door until the post passed winter and summer dry or fine waiting for the letter that never came christian christiansson felt as if his very soul were shriveling up with shame she forgave him for that though and when he diedyou know how he died everybody knows itshe thought that all he had been trying to do when he fell into that foul dishonor was to get money enough to come back home and make amends she thought that did she she still thinks it christian christiansson had a sense of hysterical oppression at his heart again he wanted to tell all and he dared not but if it had been true he saidi dont say it was but if it had beenif your brother had really been trying for years to make money solely in order to wipe out the debts he had left behind himif he had come home with the fortune in his hands magnuss dark face darkened ominously and bringing his great fist down on to the table he said there would have been a curse on every coin of it and i should have flung it in his face christian christiansson did not ask him why he knew too well what magnus meant in an instant by such a flash of the lightning of the mind as must come to the guilty soul on the day of judgment the past of his life lay open before him and the most awful fact of it stood out with naked vividnessthe desecration of his wifes grave it was impossible to plead that this had been only the act of a moment that he had repented it a thousand times with bitter tears that he had derived no profit or advantage from it and had endured for ten years its fearful penalty in the death of his identity again and again he had soothed himself with such excuses but he could not cheat his conscience now why was he christian christiansson how had it come to pass that he had two hundred thousand crowns in his pocket and that his works were known all over the world all the miserable sophistry and false reasoning which had made him what he was the owner of fame and fortune had been riddled through and through by magnuss terrible words all the mocking vanity which had lured him onward to that hour with promises of the great surprise the great denouement when he should say see i am here i have justified all expectations lay stark and dead and cold no he could not reveal himself to his family tomorrow morning he could not reveal himself at all having once become christian christiansson he could never again be known as oscar stephenson thus did the dead punish him and the desecration of his wifes grave had but rendered the vow he made to himself perpetual and registered the oath he made to her in heaven christian christiansson was feeling as if all the world had gone away from him when anna came out of the guestroom saying there sir your room is ready and you can go to bed at any time magnus got up to go to the elthouse to mix the mash for the pony and then mother and son were together again iv in the confusion of that heartquelling moment he was asking himself how he could carry out his plan of rescuing his family from their misfortunes if he could not tell them who he was and how he could claim his daughter and take her away with him if he could not say i am her father she is mine when chance and a commonplace wordthose twin sisters of invention and wisdomshowed him what he was to do i shall want to be awakened early in the morning landlady for i suppose the sheriff will come soon the sheriff sir ive just been telling your son that i intend to bid for your farm at the auction tomorrow morning so that was what you had to do at the end of your journey yes it was what i had to do landlady she looked at him for a moment and then asked what can a gentleman like you want with a farm like this he did not reply so she said you can not think of living in such a lonesome place as thingvellir still he did not speak and she said again you might let the farm certainly but it is hungry land i assure you and everything depends on how you work it she busied herself about the table as if trying to find something to do my son she said is the only one who has ever been able to work it properly and if he has got into difficulties at last it wasnt his fault for there isnt a man in iceland who would have been able to keep his head above water she waited for him to say something but he gave no sign his difficulties are not so very serious either eight thousand crowns arrears of interestthat is all in sixteen years sir again she waited but he was still silent when the sheriff went off this evening he said if my son could find the money before nine oclock tomorrow morning he wouldnt go on with the auction christian christiansson had rested his head on his hand and seemed to be listening intently if my son could only find somebody to lend him the money there was a ring of appeal in her voice which startled herself for she stopped and looking nervously round at the stranger said im sure he would never regret it sir magnus would work his fingers to the bone to repay every penny he has always been a boy like that and with better seasons and a little luck it was then that the new scheme came to christian christiansson and he covered his face with his hand to think of it whereupon anna mistaking the meaning of the altered gesture faltered and began again im taking a great liberty sir but im not thinking of myselfim thinking of my son in one sense im to blame for all that has happened to him he doesnt know it and i darent tell him but i am christian christiansson looked up at her it was all my fault that his father took the mortgage your fault yes sir my husband loved the poor boy who is gone but he was the governor of iceland and every eye was on him to see that he kept his own house in order and but for me he might have let the law take its course i pleaded and prayed with him thinking that we ourselves would be the ones to suffer but i only ruined one son in trying to save the otherand i didnt save him christian christiansson dropped his head for the waters of bitterness were falling over him in a flood and anna thinking she had touched him went on more eagerly then theres the girl sir my granddaughter youve seen her yourself and youll say she doesnt look like a servant but if the auction comes off shell have to go out to service they treat girls shamefully in some farmhouses and my son can not bear the thought of it neither can i for i cant help thinking of her father whatever else he may have been he was a gentleman and to think of his daughter being a drudge to somebody annas voice was faltering again but after a moment she went on bravely as for myself im an old woman and a little misfortune more or less doesnt matter to me now my time is short in any case and i shall be glad to go when im called most of my loved ones are gone alreadymy son and my granddaughter are all that are leftand if i could feel that i was leaving them happy and comfortable christian christiansson could bear no more landlady he said i had set my heart on buying the farmi had a particular reason for wishing to buy itbut instead of doing so ill lend your son the money to pay the interest annas eyes opened wide in astonishment and now that her prayer was answered her breath seemed to be suspended you will sir she said i will on one condition oh never mind the condition let me go and tell him my condition is that you give me the girl to adopt as my daughter ah im a lonely person too though im not so old as you are and when im in england i havent wife or child or mother or brother to share my life with me the girls sweet face would be a great comfort to me there and im ready to pay this interest if you are willing to let her go the light had died out of annas eyesher head was down i should give you every guarantee that she would be taken care of i am rich as men of my class go and she should want for nothing but i didnt think your condition would be like that sir said anna why not are you thinking of the girl or of yourself landlady i am thinking of my son no man was ever so wrapped up in a child he has had her nearly all her life and he is very very fond of her when she was little and the snow was deep as it is today he used to take her to school on his shoulder and at night when she was sleepy he would carry her in his arms to bed if she were his own he could not love her more dearly it is like fatherhood to him and he will never be a father now because anna hesitated as if trying to say something which she was afraid to say and then through her gathering tears she blurted out her secret to tell you the truth sir he cared for her mother but gave her up to somebody else and she died and from that day forward all the best years of his life were wasted in a cruel longing for something to love then the child came and it was almost as if the mother herself had sent her little one to comfort him she could not love him for she loved the other one to the last but the child might and she hasgod bless her she has christian christiansson was wrung to the heart but he struggled on so you think he could not part with the girl even for her own welfare and happiness i dont say that sir and perhaps if it were put to him properly put it yourself landlady i darent he might suppose that i was thinking of myself and if he did would that be such a serious matter can it be nothing to him that his mother will be saved from being homeless if no harm is to come to the girl and no harm shall come to heryou may take my word for that anna thought for a moment and then she said you would tell us where she is to go and what she is to do and how she is to be brought up indeed i would she might write to us constantly and come to see us sometimes perhaps certainly she might after all it would just be like going into service just only she would be a lady not a servant only that you would be good to her something tells me you would and you would wouldnt you i should be as good to the girl as ifas if i were her own father said christian christiansson anna dried her eyes and said i dont know what to say siri really dont know what to say to you say nothing to mespeak to your son landlady you will lend him the money to pay the interest immediately immediately eight thousand crownsyou can find it all by nine oclock tomorrow morning see said christian christiansson taking the pocketbook out of his breastpocket theres enough in this purse to pay the interest twenty times over and ill not lend the money to your sonill give it to him if he will give me the girl instead he will be sorry to part with her but after all it will be one mouth less to feed and when im gone that will be another and then perhaps having no burdens and no embarrassments speak to himhes here said christian christiansson and just at that moment magnus returned to the hall carrying a wooden bowl of smoking bran then in a low and trembling tone hardly daring to raise her eyes to his face anna told her son of the strangers offer dwelling chiefly on the advantages to himself when elin would be provided for and she herself would be under the earth and he no longer crippled by grinding debt would be able to pay his way and win back his lost inheritance but as she went on her voice faltered and her words became confused for he was looking down at her with a lowering brow and at last she stopped altogether saying i didnt mean any harm magnus i only thought you thought i could sacrifice elin to save myself mother said magnus and at that hard word anna sank into a chair and sobbed then magnus turned to christian christiansson and said im much obliged for your offer sir but my niece is not for sale with that he was passing out of the house when christian christiansson who was quivering from head to foot cried wait well you have decided for yourself fast enoughhave you thought of anybody else who else is there to think about your mother for one if you refuse my offer and the house is sold over your heads tomorrow morning what is to become of her magnus flushed as if an invisible hand had smitten him across the face what is to become of the girl toohave you thought of that have you a right to send her into serviceto be a drudge to somebody magnus was shuddering visiblyeven the bowl was trembling in his hands no doubt you are fond of the girl and have been good to her but if she were your own daughter she would be a separate being and in a case like this you would have no right to speak for her then she shall speak for herself said magnus and putting the smoking bowl on the table he crossed to the inner door and cried in an agitated voice elin elin elin in a moment the girl came running into the room with a look of alarm saying what is it has anything happened listen said magnus and christian christiansson could see that though his voice shook as if his soul were shaken he was trying to speak calmly this gentleman he said has told your grandmother that he wishes to adopt you as a daughter and he offers to pay my debts if i am willing to let you go uncle cried the girl i have told him you shall speak for yourself and so you shall and whatever you decide to do your grandmother and i will agree to but uncle dont speak yet my child it is only fair that you should hear everything elin i am a broken man and i have no longer a home to offer you after the auction tomorrow morning i dont know what is to become of grandmother and you and me or where we are to go or what roof is to cover us but this gentleman is rich and he promises to provide for you all your life and to give you all you need and everything you could wish for if you stay with me you may suffer privations but if you go to him you will never know a poor day again as long as you live his deep voice had all it could do to support itself but he bore up to the end and then anna whose eyes were filling as fast as she could wipe them said isnt it wonderful elin isnt it like a miracle like an answer to your prayer my child just when we were so low and downhearted the gentleman will satisfy us that you are going to a good christian home and that you will be properly brought up and cared for and then christian christiansson himself though he could scarcely speak for the contending emotions that shook him to the soul stepped forward and said let me tell you who i am elin we spoke of christian christiansson the composer and you sang his song to me and said you would like to hear something about him i am christian christiansson the girl made a little involuntary cry and his voice faltered for a moment yes i am he and the story i told you was the story of my own unhappy life onlyi have lost my daughter since i wrote that song and now i am quite alone will you not come and take her place my child you shall be just the same to me as my own daughter and you shall never know the difference you will return with me to england and live my life and whatever i do you shall do and wherever i go you shall go also think of that elin said anna you love musicyou take after your poor father that wayand you will travel about just as your dear mother used to do it would be beautiful said elin she had been standing all this time by the table with one hand resting lightly upon it while her sweet face reflected the changing lights of alarm and pain and surprise and joy i cant think of anything in the world i should love so much buti can not i must not elin grandma didnt you tell me yourself when i came here long ago and you put me to bed the first time that i was never to leave uncle magnus and if anybody ever came to take me away i was not to go i was a little mite but i gave you my word i remember and i am going to keep it but i was thinking of somebody else then elin i couldnt know that this gentleman would comeat a time like this too but that makes no difference grandma besides if i were to go to this gentleman and he were to treat me as if i were his own daughter i should have to think of him as if he were my own father would you like that grandma and would uncle magnus like it we should sacrifice ourselves honey we should sacrifice ourselves that you might be well off and happy but i dont want to be well off if you and uncle magnus are going to be poor and i shouldnt be happy at alli should be miserable oh dear oh dear moaned anna unable to say more and then the girl turned with a smile to christian christiansson who was throbbing with pride and pain and she said it is very very good of you sir and there isnt another girl in the world who wouldnt be glad to go but i cant you must see yourself i canti must stay with my uncle grandma is going to do so and why shouldnt i he would be better without either of us elin said anna dont say that grandma i do say it my child and if you only knew how cruel the world is but god isnt and he will not separate us now after we have been together so long you said so yourself you know when i talked of going into service you said he would find another way and he willim sure he will it wrung annas heart to have her own teaching coming back to reproach her yet thinking of magnus she made one more effort but dont you see dear that if you stay with uncle magnus he will lose the land whereas if you go with this gentleman he will be able to keep it then the innocent young face which had been so full of beautiful trust in the greatness and the goodness of god to triumph over all perils and privations clouded over for one moment and she said do you want me to go grandma and does uncle magnus want it neither of them answered her and she looked from one to the otheranna brushing her eyes with the back of her wrinkled hand and magnus standing motionless with a white face broken up like the melting snowand then the cruel swelling in the girls heart subsided and her eyes shone like the sun i know you dont she answered herself you are only thinking about me and then the brave little soul tossed up her head with a proud look and said as for the landif it comes to losing that or losing me i know what uncle magnus will say he will sayi know he willlet me keep my little elin and the landthe land may go and so i do my darling cried magnus and he opened his great arms to her and she ran into them and was gathered to his breast at the next moment anna had joined them and magnus had put his arms around both and it was just as if they had conquered a great temptationas if some dark shadow which had threatened to separate them had passed awayfor they were clinging together and crying like children christian christiansson stood aside for a moment and looked on at their happiness feeling himself without part or lot in it and then fearing that he might cry out and betray himself or break down altogether he turned away and fled into the guestroom v he threw himself face downward on the bed and the waters of marah went over and over him sight of the happiness he had lost the right to claim was the hardest experience that had yet come to him and he wept bitterly my child my dear dear child he had wanted to cry but those were words of proud endearment which he might never use except in the voiceless chambers of his empty heart but this mood lasted only for a few moments and then a fierce and almost savage jealousy took possession of him and he dried his eyes and sat up in contempt of his own weakness what right had any one to rob him of his child elin was flesh of his flesh and no man should take her away even the law would recognize his right to his own offspring he had merely to say to the sheriff she is mine and the sheriff would have no choice but to deliver her up to him then calmer moments came and he saw that he could only assert his legal right to his daughter by disclosing his identity and that was out of the question and even if it were possible to carry his daughter away by force it would be a poor triumph to take her body if he could not also take her soul every man wished his children to love him and unless elin could love her father what was the good of claiming her he opened his eyes to calm the deafening tumult of his conflicting thoughts and saw a little faded photograph in a stand on a table that stood beside the bed it was an old photograph of thora and he remembered it immediately for it was the same that in the better time belonged to aunt margret and stood on the drawers beside her door he took it up in his shaking hand and held the candle to look at it and then in a moment by that magic the almighty knows he was back with thora in the birthroom at government house and she was saying in the tremulous joy of her young motherhood kiss me oscar put your arms about both of us dearest that wayso something of the tenderness of thoras sweet heart returned to him with that haunting memory and along with it came a new and thrilling thought if elin belonged to him by right of nature then nature herself would speak for him he had only to say to her i am your father you are my daughter and she would come to himshe could not help herselfbecause nature is a mighty thing and none of us can resist the mysterious call that comes to our blood from the blood that gave us birth he would do so he would find the girl alone and speak to her he would whisper the secret of his life in the ear of his own child and then the marvelous mother of us all would do the rest when he returned to the hall elin was shaking out the cloth and removing the last of the supper thingsall except the bottle and glasses which she left on the table it must be now he thought and though his heart quailed at coming to this last throw in the game he had played for life and love he put his fortune to the test it was very brave of you my child he said to choose poverty when you might have chosen wealth but you did well for wealth is only of this worlds making and the angel that brings us happiness does not ask us if we are poor or rich his voice faltered when he came to what he had to say next but he rallied and went on it was very sweet of you too to remain with your uncle and your grandmother instead of coming to a stranger for being of your own flesh and blood they have naturally the first claim upon you but ifif instead of christian christiansson i had been your own father would youwould you have come to me then elin did not answer him immediately and he looked steadfastly into her face feeling that all hope of happiness for the remainder of his life hung on her reply would you the sweet young face looked troubled for a moment and then slowlyvery slowly and sadlyelin shook her head he felt like a man who had been sentenced to death but while his face clouded and fell the girls rose and became beautifully calm i dont see how that could make any difference she said i couldnt feel as if you were my father unless i had known you as long as i could remember and longer even than that what i call a father is one who has nursed you on his knee when you were a little thing and kissed you and coaxed you when you were sick and thought of you and cared for you always not one who has been away from you all your life who has never cared for you at all and whom you wouldnt know if you met him in the road but dont you feel dear that there is something in the relation of a child to her father however he may have neglected hersomething intimate and sacredsomething she can never know in her relation to anybody else however much he may have done for herdont you feel that elin again the girl thought for a moment and again she shook her head but if i were to say to you my child my dear dear child i may have done nothing for you but still i am your father and you are the only one who is left to me now and i want you to come to me and be my daughter and we shall never be parted againif i were to say that to you would you still hold to your uncle the tremulous fervor with which he spoke these imploring words brought tears to the girls eyes but her heart stood firm and strong yes she said i couldnt help it because uncle magnus has been my real father after all it was all over his last hold of the girl was lost again he felt as if the world had gone away from him as if the dark column of hope which had shown its bright face for a moment had turned again and now all was hopeless darkness he had thought nature would speak to the girl but it had not spoken nature was a great inexorable instrument in the hand of god and gods hand was on him as he had done so he was being done byas he had taken the love of thora from magnus so magnus after many years had taken the love of elin from him it was right it was inevitable and he must bow his head in speechless submission before the justice and the vengeance of god he must leave the house as he had come to it not only without revealing himself to his mother and brother but also without his child it would be the bitterest moment of his life but he must meet it and go on you are quite right my dearquite right he said a childs love is like a flower in the windowit cannot grow without somebody to water it your uncle has done everything for you and he is entitled to all your affection it wouldnt be fair if your father could come back after all these years and take you away from him cling to him elin love him and comfort him and may god bless you for your loyalty and trust he had tried to speak bravely but his voice broke and he stopped after a moment he said calmly can you give me pen and ink and a sheet of writingpaper she brought them instantly and he sat at the table and wrote a line or two then he took out his pocketbook opened it and put the paper inside of it and closed it up again elin will you do me a great favor oh yes sir said the girl it is late and ive had a long day and i may not be up when the auction begins in the morningwill you take this pocketbook and give it to the sheriff the moment he arrives with pleasure sir you will not open it or show it to anybody else but you will carry it to your room at once and put it under your pillow and tomorrow morning you will be up early and give it to the sheriff before he begins the salewill you do this for me my dear indeed i will sir thank you and now you must go to bed goodby my child but ill see you in the morning sir who can say we may both have other things to think about by that time so we had better say goodby to each other now but am i not to see you again who can say that either i have come a long way you know and now i may have to go he hesitated and then turning away he said i may have to go still farther you have been so kind to me siri am sorry i can not go with you ah god forbidi mean you can noti see you can not but if you could have done so i should have been so fond of you and we should have been such good friends together i shall never forget you sir nor i you i shall always think of the brave little girl i met onceonly onceand then could see no more you are only a stranger to me sir butbut yes i am only a stranger to you my child but we have come together on the great ocean of life and nownow we must say goodby and part goodby sir goodby little girl and god bless you the girl stepped to her bedroom door and then stopped and turned and looked back at him her eyes were fullshe knew not why nature was saying something to her at lastshe knew not what he was looking after her with all his hungry soul in his quivering face and when she turned he stretched out his arms to her elin he whispered and she came back to him and he folded her to his heart and kissed her on the forehead and on the lips ah sweet soft warm lips he felt them to the last a mist floated before his eyes he heard footsteps going away from him he heard a door open and close and thenhis child was gone christian christiansson was alone he felt that he had come to the lees of his life and saw nothing but a blank where he might crawl to die could he go back to reykjavik that was impossible for the minister and his people would be preparing their banquet in honor of his visit and to go through such rejoicing would be a scorching martyrdom at which the devil himself would laugh could he return to england and resume his old life as the unknown composer that was impossible also for he could never write as he had written before because the old impulse was gone the fire was burnt out the life that had inspired him was dead and because the foundations of his fame were broken up by the new consciousness that he had no right to it by the sense that his career and all that had come of it had been built on the desecration of his wifes grave and by the certainty that his success had been paid for as by the sweat of his very soul what then was before him old age what was old age without friends without children without love without respect and with memorythat last joy of a mans declining dayslike a poisoned river running through a wasted land was there nothing before him then yes there was one thingone onlyand as he lay in that room alone with his head over his hands on the table he had the trembling thrilling palpitating sense of supernatural wings hovering above him and of an awful voice that seemed to say the wages of sin is death at that moment he became aware of other voicesmore human and homely voicesmurmuring about him and one of them said he has fallen asleep poor gentleman and another he has drunk too much perhaps then a hand touched him on the shoulder and somebody cried in his ear hadnt you better go to bed sir it was his mother with magnus behind her and looking at both he could see that they supposed he was intoxicated in the wild laboring of heart and brain it suited him that they should continue to think so and indeed the strain of nerve had been so hard that when he rose to his feet he staggered like a drunken man heigho whats this he laughed your brennievin must be pretty heady landlady but no matter it will be a good nightcap and make me sleep the sounder im tired very tired but im going to have a long sleep at lasta long long sleep at last but tomorrow will be new years day said anna the bells ring at daybreak and the sheriff will be here soon after so youll have to be stirring early if you want to be ready for the auction why so i shalli had forgotten all about itand since we can not agree about the girl i must buy the farm whatever happens i told you i wanted it for a particular purpose but i didnt say what it was its my secret landlady but i dont mind telling you i want it for my mother your mother thats so she was born in these parts and the poor old thing would like to end her days here so she tells you to buy up my farmstead not she she doesnt know anything about it thats to be my surprise ive not been a good son but when i go away never to come back again i want to feel that the dear old soul is happy and comfortable and has a roof to cover her he laughed with the same sense as before of an hysterical oppression of the heart and then turned to magnus and said sorry to buy your house over your head but business is business you know and anybody is at liberty to bid who has money to pay magnus moved aside with a contemptuous expression dont look so glum my man you think youve been badly treated and perhaps you have but youre the luckiest man in iceland if you ask me you think because youve done well you ought to be rewarded but what right have poor wretches like us to expect reward in this world you think because a man is rich he is to be envied but whats the use of having your pocket full if your heart is empty and you think because death kills the innocent and the happy it is a cruel monster but there are worse things than death and life is one of them when youve nobody to care whether you live or die then cheer up old fellow youve got your health and your good name and your mother and that sweet girl to love and to love you so what the devil have you got to complain of nothing at all saying this with a mixture of real emotion and its mocking makebelieve a touch of the boy came back to him for a moment and he put his arm across his brothers shoulder as he used to do in the old days but magnus shuddered and shrank away your candle is burning in the bedroom sir said anna coldly and then he saw that his mother also looked black at him as one who had come to turn them out of house and home and as one who had tried to tempt the girl away from them and as one who could laugh at their condition and have no thought except for himself and thinking that this was the last he would see of her that it was so different from the parting he had expected that all hope of pardon and reconciliation was lost that his mother would never hear that her lingering faith in her prodigal had been justified and never know that he had been and gone he had as much as he could do not to break down and betray himself even at the end but gathering up his clothes which had been drying by the stove he turned toward the bedroom saying with another laugha laugh that went to annas heart like a sword dont look so downhearted landlady when things are at their worst they cant move without they mend youve had your troubles but you shall drink my health under my mothers rooftree tomorrow morning good night and then he reeled into the guestroom vi the stranger being gone mother and son looked into each others faces then they spoken in whispers did you hear him said anna about his mothers rooftree asked magnus about the auctionabout everything the man can have no feelingno pity none business is business he said when he talked of buying the place over our heads and when he spoke of his mother ending her days here he never once thought of me he never thought of elin either he would have taken the girl away from us without a moments hesitation he would said anna theres enough in this purse he said to pay your interest twenty times over did he say that he did he took his pocketbook out of his breastpocket and his breastpocket you say yes and ill give the money to your son he said if hell give me the girl instead anna talked on in an innocent helpless way without knowing what bad work she was doing but suddenly mysteriously at the mention of the purse a change passed over magnuss face and it grew ugly with evil passions he must be rich said anna richer than anybody has a right to be said magnus surely god can not mean that anybody should be as rich as that while other people are so poor god said magnus and his distorted face quivered if he would only lend us enough to satisfy the sheriff in the morning said anna whats the good of expecting a man to help us to keep the farm when he has come to buy it for himself its hard though cruelly hard to be turned out of house and home by the first person who comes along with more money thats what i was thinking said magnus down to this moment anna had only been trying to sympathize with magnuss mood but now something in his tone made her suspect that she had awakened a devil and she looked at him in terror he took up the bottle and drank he drank out of the neck and there was a new devil in every drop his eyes began to gleam with a feverish luster and anna trembled she remembered that magnus had not taken any strong drink until today since the day of thoras funeral and then she thought of her father and a sensation of extreme cold crept over her let us not talk of it any more she said as she tried to put the bottle away but magnus held on to it mother and son looked at each other again and then anna went over to the strangers door and listened has he locked it asked magnus no im afraid no no he has not what is he doing the candle is outhe must be in bed already then said magnus he has thrown himself down without undressing and the pocketbook is on him still magnus what are you thinking of said annaher teeth were chattering would it be so very wicked what to take as much as would satisfy the sheriff in the morning magnus i didnt mean that he would never miss itnever know it was goneand it would enable us to keep the farm and so save us from starvation oh dear what have i done hes a prodigal himself it seems very well let prodigal pay for prodigal she could not breathe freelyshe could only look at magnus in speechless surprise he took up the bottle again and gulped clown the last of the liquor he has drunk a good dealhe will sleep heavilyand he wont awake until the auction is over let us go to bed said anna go yourself he growled for the furies that march in the brain of the drunken man had mastered him magnus said anna if you will not go to bed i shall stay up all night with you then the devil that had changed magnus into a cunning savage beast showed him what he had to do very well let us go to bed he replied he bolted the outer door again and raked out the stove while his mother extinguished the lamp and relit the candles she thought the evil impulse that had come to him had been conquered and she talked of other matters ive made up erics bed for you and youll find everything comfortable she said as she passed elins door she opened it gently and held her head aside to listen the sound of the soft and measured breathing came out to them for a moment and then the door was closed again poor child she would lay her head on her pillow full of faith in the miracle that is to happen before tomorrow morning of such is the kingdom of heaven they parted at the door of the badstofa and a few minutes afterward the little house lay silent and dark in the arms of the hills and on the breast of the snow but the wings of death hung over it magnus did not go to bed he threw himself on the eiderdown and went through a fierce fight with god as represented by gods vicar his conscience a vision of the pocketbook in the strangers breastpocket danced before his dark heart and he told himself that come what would he must take enough of the strangers money to pay the interest in the morning if he did not do so the man would buy the farmstead and elin and his mother would be turned adrift on this thought came compunctions to take the mans money would be to steal and magnus had never stolen but faith being already gone morality followed and he wrestled with his conscience and overcame it what he was going to do was what men did every day only they called it business and they did it to wrong the right whereas he would do it to right the wrong magnus marshaled his reasons and justified himself here was a man so rich that he would not know tomorrow morning that he had lost what was sufficient to make his dear ones happy that man was going to expose them to poverty and destitution surely it was right it was necessary it was his duty to prevent him in the mad tangle of his disordered brain he saw everything that had happened that day in a sinister light and it seemed as if fate had thrown the man into his hands he might have gone to lodge at the parsonagehe had come there he might have concealed the purpose of his cominghe had revealed it he might have said nothing of the pocketbookhe had shown it with childlike simplicity surely this was the way out of his difficulties which destiny had marked out for him and not to take it would be to cover himself with selfreproaches when his dear ones came down to want having persuaded himself that he could not help but take as much of the strangers money as was necessary to pay the interest he began to ask why he should take so little if the pocketbook in the mans breastpocket contained enough to pay the interest twenty times over why not take enough to buy the farm out and out that would enable him to leave to elin the inheritance which he had lost through his brothers extravagance and crime this man was about to take it away from herhe must not and he should not do so stage by stage he pushed back the bulwarks of conscience until he came to ask himself why he should not take all his mind was clogged and numb by this time but he knew well what that meant it meant taking the strangers life there was at first an indescribable horror in the thought of killing a human being but after a moment it passed away this man alone stood between his dear ones and shelterwhy shouldnt he this man threatened to take their lives by exposing them to starvationwhy shouldnt he take his life instead a momentary qualm came with the thought that he would be attacking one who had trusted himself to the hospitality of his house a defenseless man in his sleep but he thought of the strangers heartless laughter his callousness to their condition and recalled what he had said of his mother and pictured her sitting there surrounded by every comfort while his own mother born in that place was turned out to perish and then his gorge rose again and his heart knew no pity he began to ask himself how it could be done it could be done quite easily nobody except themselves had seen the man nobody else would ever know that he had been to their house he could tell his mother and elin that the stranger had gone away in the early morning they would believe him and even if they did not they would hold their tongues for his interest would be their interest and all he would do would be done for them a new and awful light illumined his gloomy mind and he saw himself doing everything no other eye would see no other ear would hear it was freezing hard tonight and if it was found in the drowning pool when the ice melted the story would be that the stranger had lost his way in the snowstorm and stumbled over the rocks having satisfied himself that he could defeat this worlds judgment the tortured man in the toils of his temptation began to think of the judgment of the next but fear of that vanished in a moment nothing was known in the other world of what took place in this one and god interfered but little in the affairs of men at the thought of god a singing noise came into his ears like water in the ears of a drowning man it was his conscience going down after its last gasp for he was telling himself that murder though it might be and contrary to gods law god had done nothing for him and therefore he was not called upon to do anything for god he had been a good man all his life yet god had left him in the lurch god and the world were letting his mother and elin perish therefore he must fight the worldand god in the last convulsion of his human nature he remembered that once before the impulse to kill had come to him and that he had suffered the tortures of the damned whenever afterward he had thought of it but that was different that was in the whirlwind of outraged passion and if he had carried out his threat it would have been the worst of crimes the unpardonable sin the sin against the holy ghosta brothers murder a thousand times he had thanked god that oscar had not lived to come home but how strange were the ways of fateanother man another heartless prodigal had come there and if his dear ones were to be saved from starvation and the consequences of oscars crimes he knew what he had to do let prodigal pay for prodigal he thought again and then he leaped up from the bed his brute nature goaded on by the flattering devil of drink had conquered his conscience yet his knees knocked together as he went on tiptoe by his mothers room and when he came to elins door he could hardly breathe their pure souls were sleeping in the protecting atmosphere of prayer and when he asked himself what he was to say in the morning if they wanted to know where he had got the money his mind was so clogged and numb that he could find no answer but this thought with the vision that came after it of how his mother and elin would look at him with searching and suspicious glancesof how when all would be over and he hoped to be at rest he would find them sitting together in silence staring at nothingnearly broke down the brute in him and his whole body was shaken by a kind of tearless sob nevertheless the flash of human light on his dark heart only made the blackness more profound and after a moment he went on with his preparations when he stepped on tiptoe into the hall the two sheepdogs who had been sleeping on the mat by the door got up and stretched themselves and yawned and lest they should make a noise he took them out and locked them up in a shed after that he went over to the stable which was at some distance from the dwelling and saddled and bridled the strangers mare and then with a sharp cut of his whip he sent her galloping and whinnying into the darkness a breath of icy wind was coming down the valley as if day were stirring in its morning sleep and a faint pink and white light in the eastern sky with a glint on the western glaciers seemed to say that the dawn was near but the drink was in magnuss eyes and he could not see clearly no snow had fallen since the traveler arrived and returning to the front of the farmstead magnus made backward tracks from the porch to the river partly in order to obliterate the strangers footsteps and partly to conceal his own when he should come out again carrying a heavy burden the man was gone by this time and magnus was like a nightbird hovering about his own house and thinking of his prey when he returned to the hall there was no sound there except that of the ashes slipping in the stove and of the clock ticking in the darkness the deliberate seconds he took off his boots leaving on his snowstockings only and then he picked up a large cushion from the armchair and stepped to the strangers door and listened but heaven as well as hell is in the heart of every man as long as life is with him and the tearless sob came back to magnus and shook his whole body as he thought at the last moment of the awful pity of the thing he had to do yet telling himself again that god did nothing in this world and saying once more let prodigal pay for prodigal he turned the handle and opened the door then he stepped softly into the guestroom and bolted the door behind him vii anna at that moment had awakened from a frightening dream on first going to her room she had been troubled by the memory of what she had done to awaken evil thoughts in magnus and visions had come to her of how if anything happened magnus might say you put it into my head mother to banish her selfreproaches she had said a prayer for forgiveness telling god she had never once thought of theft or violence but only of magnus and elin and the inheritance they had lost through her importunity and how cruel it seemed that while other people had so much more than they wanted such hard times should come to her dear children then she had gone to bed and the voice of the stranger which had teased her all the evening through with memories she could not fix haunted her again and the light being out and her eyes no longer disturbed by sight of the strangers different face she knew whose voice it reminded her of it was a voice very dear to her a voice always near to her oscars voice which she was never to hear again when with a thrill of the heart this thought came to anna it altered the stranger altogether his laughter ceased to be cruel and what he had said of himself not being a good son became touching and when she thought of his poor mother waiting for her prodigal and so soon to see him home again and pictured her joy when he should say mother mother im here at last and we shall never never be parted again her heart overflowed with sympathy and she was sorry she had not been kinder to him when he was going to bed then she went to sleep and the dream spirit took her back to the good time when she had two boys in her house a dark one and a fair one and the father had punished the dark one unjustly and his stern and gloomy soul with its sense of wrong would not suffer him to explain but the fair one was sobbing out a confessionit was not magnus it was me papaand a moment afterward two happy little heads were on the same pillow side by side and both were laughing merrily in the shifting kaleidoscope of her dream this picture had hardly gone when anna awoke with the clearest consciousness of oscars voice crying mother mother mother she thought it must have been the stranger calling in his sleep for the china ornaments on her dressingtable seemed to ring but when she listened there was no other sound then the memory of magnuss temptation came rolling back on her like a thundercloud over a clear sky and she got up to go to her sons room to make sure that he was in bed magnus had not been to bed with candle in hand and still in her nightdress anna hurried to the hall crying in a whisper of only halfrealized apprehension magnus magnus there was no reply she listened at the strangers door and thought she heard a movement inside the room but she dared not enter or knock magnus magnus she whispered again but no answer came back to her she heard the neighing of a horse that seemed to be running round and round the house and her flesh began to creep for that sound in the night was like the cry of a disembodied soul then there came the deadened noise of dogs barking and she knew they were their own dogs and that they must have been shut up in an outhouse this started a new thought and she ran to the outer door to see if it had been opened the door was unbolted she was about to open it and cry again when she heard a noise behind her it came from the strangers room and putting her ear to the door she distinctly heard the sounds of sobs some one inside was sobbing she knew the low stifled voice it was magnus he was on his knees or prostrate on the floor and he was sobbing as if his heart would break at that anna boldly tried to open the door but found it fastened on the inside magnus magnus she whispered but he did not answer she was now sure that the awful thing she had thought of had come to pass her suspense had deepened to fear but pity and love conquered every other feeling and going down on her knees in her nightdress she whispered through the keyhole magnus magnus open the door it is only mother it was all my fault dear let me come in but the smothered sobbing inside continued and no other sound came back to her then in the silence of all else she heard the sound of sleighbells outside at first she thought this must be a ringing in her ears but the bells grew louder and came nearer and then the dogs in the outhouse barked again fear deepened to terror the necessity for concealment flashed upon her and she knocked at the bedroom door and cried in the same affrighted whisper magnus there is some one coming wait till he has gone dont stir dont come out only tell me you hear me the sobbing ceased but magnus did not speak meantime the sleighbells came nearer and nearer with the cracking of a whip the whoop of a driver and the hiss of runners in the soft snow magnus magnus cried anna loudly in a last effort but she was stopped by the near shout of some one outside helloa helloa thereand she rose to her feet with an intention of bolting the outer door before she could do so there was a metallic knock on the windowpane a voice crying god be with you and footsteps hurrying up the outer steps then anna turned about and fled back to her bedroom while she dressed she heard the outer door thrown open and the sound of many persons trooping into the hall they were very bright and happy for they laughed merrily and talked all together and the house was full of noise when she came out of the badstofa she met the postboy on his way to the elthouse to boil water to give his ponies a hot drink and on returning to the hall she found the door and the shutters of the window open the daylight streaming in and the postman himself there with several passengers including the factor who was muffled up to the eyes and margret neilsen who was unrolling herself from the folds of a white bearskin helloa cried everybody and the postman said here we are at last you see we couldnt come yesterday by reason of the snowstorm but the factor actually got me to start away as soon as it stopped at eleven oclock last nighteleven well we dont kill a pig every day do we said the factor and while the men laughed and winked margret neilsen said and hows anna anna was speechless and ghastly white so the factor said we seem to have startled her out of her senses for she looks as if she had seen a ghost but wheres magnus magnus ohsomewhere about said anna and hows my precious elin said aunt margret shes not up yet said anna then ill go and waken her which is her roomthis one said aunt margret making for the guestroom no no said anna intercepting her and standing with her back to the guestroom door that one and aunt margret went into elins bedroom and now said the factor with winks all round him what about the other one anna looked at the factor in mute terror the newcomer you know not stirring yet i suppose newcomer well guest friend whatever you choose to call him what friend why the friend who came last night of course anna who had never lied in her life wanted to lie now but she could not do so i dont understand you factor she said faintly well said the factor and then as if by an afterthought i thought he wouldnt wish to startle you having been so long away and supposed to be dead but dont you know yet who he is anna trembled and said of whom are you speaking oscar neilsen of the tall fair man with the pointed beard who came to lodge at your house last night anna was now speechless with terror and the company misunderstanding her silence became suddenly very grave can it be possible that he lost his way in the snowstorm said one but he knew every inch of the road and could find his way blindfold said another such a night though said a third he got as far as the house of rest but the boy there said he would never see the end of his journey well this is serious said the factor the minister wanted him to stay at government house overnight but he seemed so anxious to see you to see me said anna naturally after his long absence strange very strange but do you mean to say that no traveler came here last night a vague shadow of the factors meaning had flashed upon annas mind and the terror of a moment ago had deepened to horror what had magnus done in the blindness of his passion and despair but even then the desire to save her son was above all other emotions and she was about to deny all knowledge of the traveler when the door behind her was opened and a voice over her shoulder said yes a traveler did come here last night but he went away again in the early morning it was magnus and when anna turned to look at him she drew a deep breath of relief for she knew he was telling the truth his face since she saw it last had undergone a mysterious and miraculous change the gloomy arrogance of despair had gone something had carried light into the darkness of his soul and he looked like a man who had come as from the immediate presence of his god but this is stranger than ever said the factor it was known that he had taken a large sum of money out of the bank and everybody supposed he meant to buy up this place at the auction yes said aunt margret coming out of elins bedroom to give to his old mother and then elins soft voice was heard to say has the sheriff come yet who is asking for the sheriff said the sheriff himself coming forward at that moment the gentleman gave me this pocketbook last night and told me to deliver it to you before the auction began this morning its not for me though said the sheriff who had taken the pocketbook to the table and opened it and was reading the writing on the sheet of paper which fell out first for elin oscars daughter from christian christiansson a present for elin perhaps said the factor a thousandcrown note cried the sheriff the gaiety of the company was breaking into loud congratulations when the sheriff who was still opening the folds of the pocketbook said wait theres more than thatmuch more onetwothreefifty thousandanotherand anotherandthen the rapid rustling of banknotes followed by the delighted cry two hundred thousand crowns the very sum he took out of the bank said the factor kiss me my precious said aunt margret me too granddaughter cried the factor anna looked stunned and magnus like one who wished the earth to swallow him but the factor rattled along with shouts and laughter now i understand everything he has given the money to the girl but left it to her friends and relations to advise her as to what she is to do with it elins blue eyes being still full of bewilderment the factor kissed her again and said now who do you think has left you this great fortune little one christian christiansson said the girl certainly but dont you know who christian christiansson is no you neither anna anna was trembling on the verge of discovery who she said but rather with her lips than with her voice why oscaryour son oscar who isnt dead at all and has come back and made amends to everybody i always knew there was good stuff in my godson the truth burst on anna in a whirlwind of joyjoy that her son was alive joy that he had come home and justified her faith in him joy too though with a twinge of pain in it that he had gone away again and further trouble with magnus was averted a prayer gushed from her heart and she wanted to go down on her knees my son she said in a breathless whisper my father said elin with a tenderness the word had never had for her before the company were now cackling and crowing again but the two womenthe old one and the young onelooked round for magnus he was standing at the back his strong face all broken up and melted it was not at this moment that the truth had first burst on him that had come like a blinding blow of light the instant he had entered the guestroom and realized that god did something after all in this world for his children motherelin he stammered and he opened his arms to them its the miracle isnt it said the girl it was the miracle indeed there was no auction in thingvellir that day and when the bells rang for service the company went to church the little wooden tabernacle was full of worshippers for it was new years day and the farmers had ridden over with their families from all the country round about they sat in their thick mufflers and snowstockings and the mist of their smoking breath as far up the church as the square rail enclosing the communion table on stools about the octagonal pulpit and even among the refuse the lumber and pottedmeat barrels that were stored in the gallery the factor was there very loud in his responses fixing up the figures on the tin plate which announced the hymns elin too with the wonder not yet gone from her innocent blue eyes anna with her tempered happiness and a heart overflowing with thanksgiving and most strange of all magnus himself a changed and humbled man everybody looked at magnus in surprise at seeing him there but magnus looked at no one while the pastor read the lesson all we like sheep have gone astray while he gave out his text this day shalt thou be with me in paradise while he preached his homely sermon on the conversion of the dying thief on the cross showing the shortness of time the power of redemption and the certainty of deaths sundering and even while the deacon chanted the anthem weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning and the congregation sang the closing hymn and elins silvery young voice ringing up to the round ceiling reminded him of her mothers magnus sat with his face toward the picture on the wall above the communiontable it was a picture of christ in white robes and among warm eastern foliage healing the blind man by the wayside and while he looked at it a great softening of the heart came to him for he thought of the blessed but awful moment only just passed when the scales fell from his own eyes and his naked soul stood face to face with its maker that was the moment when with murder in his mind and a spirit of war with god he had entered the strangers bedroom and bolted the door behind him and then found that his victim had been snatched out of his hands and heard a fearful voice which seemed to say stop or the voice of thy brothers blood will cry unto me from the ground when the service was over there was much handshaking and wellwishing outside the porch for rumor of what had happened in annas household had passed from mouth to mouth but magnus took his old mother on his arm and walked home with her alone except for elin who tripped through the crisp snow by their side humming a little of the last hymn the young people were racing the ponies to and fro in their joy of the first snow the old ones were gossiping in groups on the exciting news of the day and the factor who was swinging along in his plaidshawl with a contented expression like an old cow going home in the evening with her udder full was saluting everybody and inviting all and sundry to the innfarm for a cup of coffee it was more than a cup of coffee he had had prepared for them for assuming command while magnus seemed paralyzed by surprise he had ordered a lamb to be killed and aunt margret remained behind to roast it the dinner was a large and long one for everybody was welcome to it and before it came to an end the factor rose to propose a toast every snowcowl has an end he said and i am happy to inform you all that the cloud that has hung so long over the innfarm over anna magnussons family and over my family is now gone for good show the man and not the table says one of our sagas but in this case we have had to show you the table and not the man he will be on his way to reykjavik by this time i suppose and if prophecy is the wise mans guess i guess he will get such a rousing welcome there as no man ever had in this old island before brothers and sisters i give you a healthannas longlost son our longlost son icelands longlost sonoscar stephenson the toast was received with shouts and the jingling of glasses but anna did not drink and magnus dropped his head viii on the east of the plain and the lake of thingvellir there is a pass going over the mountain of hengel to the little trading station of eyrarbakki it winds through a number of geysers and mineral springs which seem to be always smoking against the bare side of the fell they are little pools of simmering water in the crusted yellow earth some of them white and sparkling as a star some round and deepblue as a womans eye some oval and bloodred like the living heart of some monstrous animal you walk warily on the path between for the earth is hot and thin under his feet and sometimes it throbs like the lid of a boiling kettle and sometimes there is a smothered roar beneath you as of mighty battles in the bowels of the earth and then the pools begin to boil and send up spouts of foaming water and tongues of liquid flame and the air is full of sulphurous vapor an awful evil and devilish place looking like a cauldron over a circle of hellish fire but higher up the pass the snow lies white and calm and crisp and higher still are the glistening glaciers and there while the mountain quakes in its volcanic throes the avalanche comes down in winter so suddenly that no man can hear or see it for it is loud as the crack of doom and swift as the shaft of death at daybreak that day christian christiansson was crossing this pass on his way to eyrarbakki intending to take ship to norway although it was only two hours since he had pushed open the guestroom window and left the innfarm he was already a stronger and braver man then he had thought of nothing but ending everything and the shadow of selfdestruction had floated before him but now he saw clearly that until god ordained he should die it was his duty to live as he had sinned so he should suffer he must pay his penalty to its last pang its uttermost moment his penalty was to live on without the love he had forfeited the happiness he had lost the right to claim it was hard but it was just and he must face the end without flinching welcome life then as long as it lasted welcome death when it was due after he had passed through the heat and smoke and come out on the clear heights beyond he paused to look back the world around was all white and stark under the snow of last nights storm but a crimson shaft from the sun which had not yet risen was crossing the topmost peaks and the lowlands were still sleeping in a veil of mist he thought he could hear the ringing of the church bell and that sweet human sound came winging its way up to him through the vapor of the sulphurpits as the singing of a star might rise through the clouds of the world to the ears of the souls in heaven presently the sun strode up and the mist fell back and then he saw in the valley far below the little church itself and the home he had left behind him he had left happiness there and love and warm comfort for that was his reparation to the dear ones he had injured and now for his atonement to god he was going out alone stripped of everything and unknown to any one it was as much as he could bear to think of that but he smiled to himself sadly while he pictured the surprise and joy of the happy scene when the girl would come out with the pocketbook and the auction would be stopped he thought too of his mother in church with a soul full of gratitude and saw elin with a ray of sunlight from the leadlighted window on the heartbreaking sweetness of her smile it was not thus that he had expected to leave them when for ten years he had worked by the sweat of body and spirit that he might come back and be forgiven but it was not in this world that the prodigal could be taken back not here that any earthly father could run to meet him and throw his arms about his neck what he had sown he must reap and not all his penitence and tears could undo what he had done it was long before he could take his last look at the home he was leaving forever and when at length he drew a deep breath and went on he had to comfort himself with the thought that thora would be pleased with him for giving up their child to magnus her voice from the other world seemed to come to him and say well done poor brave wounded heart gods angels rejoice over you but it was hard to find solace in heavenly cheer while his blood ran warm and yearned for human company before he was aware of it he was at the foot of the glaciers those great lone homes of nature never trodden by the foot of man or animal where no bird sings and no flower grows where only the wind moans over motionless billows of ice and the sun rises in a blank barrenness on chasms of the frozen deep looking back from this place he could see nothing of the valley and the houses of men or of anything but a wide circle of mountain peaks all silent and white in which he was the only living thing and then the feeling of being cut off from the rest of humanity amid these grand but grim surroundings elevated his senses and affected him like music like composing with a sort of ecstacy which was part rapture and partly pain in this ecstasy of emotion he asked himself if his life had been wasted if happiness was gone from him even if because he had sinned there was nothing before him now but renunciation and suffering and then the teaching of his childhood came back to him with a new and sublime significance and he saw for the first time the lesson of life and the meaning of death the lesson of life was dutyto do right without expectation of reward or fear of punishment and the meaning of death was to bring to the sinful penitent soul the pardon the world can not give then thank god for life but thank god for death also whatever a mans sin nature could not forget it and the laws of life could not forgive but the mercy of god was without measure of guilt and the gates of heaven were wide god veiled his face from his creatures and to mans questioning eyes the infinite wisdom was as blank as these white walls of ice and snow but two thousand years ago a simple galilean had read this riddle of life as no man before or since has read it he had read it for all men good or bad but most of all for wayworn sinners like himself for whom the world has no pity and no forgiveness and though he was the guiltiest of the guilty and his sin had found him out and as the price of his repentance he had had to give up everything in life that he held most dearthe love of his child and the hope of pardon and reconciliationyet love and pardon and reconciliation were waiting for him still when gods own voice should call him and this mortal should put on immortality by this time he was in that mood in which a man of his temperament finds it difficult to distinguish the real from the imaginary in which he hears the sounds of nature and mistakes them for voices from the other world he had wandered without knowing it from the path of the pass which was marked by stones standing upright out of the snow when the volcanic fire in the womb of the mountain began to shake it with mighty throbs and then suddenly the awful stillness was broken by a crash and a resounding rumble as of echoing thunder coming down from the snowcapped heights oscar stephenson did not see or hear or feel anything he was only conscious of a burst of heavenly music of a sense of ten thousand angels singing an anthem a triumphant paean of praise that grew louder and louder every moment a sense of blinding light and of traveling at a terrific velocity into the realms of the sun a sense of the day of judgment of the life of the world being over its busy throngs gone its pageants finished its honors distinctions castes gold wealth and fame passed into nothingness a sense of being outside the great judgment hall with an infinite multitude of kings and beggars good men and bad the guilty and the innocent and of kneeling there among the meanest and most ashamed a sense of a spirit stooping to him and taking his hand and saying come of looking up into her face and seeing it was thora and of his breath coming so fast and short that he could scarcely breathe a sense of stumbling along with his head down and the spirit leading him forward and singing as they ascended a sense of an overwhelming presence somewhere in front of him of the music dying down and becoming fainter and fainter and then of an awful hush and of a blessed voice which said for this my son was dead and is alive again was lost and is found a moment afterward there was no one on hengel mountain the great lone home of nature was calm and white and silent the end
