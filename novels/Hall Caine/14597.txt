proofreading team the woman thou gavest me being the story of mary oneill by hall caine author of the prodigal son etc illustration published august the author to the reader how much of the story of mary oneill is a work of my own imagination and how much comes from an authentic source i do not consider it necessary to say but as i have in this instance drawn more largely and directly from fact than is usually the practice of the novelist i have thought it my duty to defeat all possible attempts at personal identification by altering and disguising the more important scenes and characters therefore this novel is not to be understood as referring to any living person or persons and the convent school described in it is not to be identified with any similar educational institution in rome martin conrad to the author here are the memoranda we have talked about do as you like with them alter amend add to or take away from them exactly as you think best they were written in the first instance for my own eye alone and hence they take much for granted which may need explanation before they can be put to the more general uses you have designed for them make such explanation in any way you consider suitable it is my wish that in this matter your judgment should be accepted as mine the deep feeling you could not conceal when i told you the story of my dear ones life gives me confidence in your discretion whatever the immediate effect may be i feel that in the end i shall be justifiedfully justifiedin allowing the public to look for a little while into the sacred

celtic origin with many variations among celtic races is pronounced rah in ellan the narrative of mary oneill first part my girlhood first chapter out of the depths o lord out of the depths begins the most beautiful of the services of our church and it is out of the depths of my life that i must bring the incidents of this story i was an unwanted childunwanted as a girl at all events father dan donovan our parish priest told me all about it i was born in october it had been raining heavily all day long the rain was beating hard against the front of our house and running in rivers down the windowpanes towards four in the afternoon the wind rose and then the yellow leaves of the chestnuts in the long drive rustled noisily and the sea which is a mile away moaned like a dog in pain in my fathers room on the ground floor father dan sat by the fire fingering his beads and listening to every sound that came from my mothers room which was immediately overhead my father himself with his heavy step that made the house tremble was tramping to and fro from the window to the ingle from the ingle to the opposite wall sometimes aunt bridget came down to say that everything was going on well and at intervals of half an hour doctor conrad entered in his noiseless way and sat in silence by the fire took a few puffs from a long clay pipe and then returned to his charge upstairs my fathers impatience was consuming him its long he said searching the doctors face dont worryabove all dont worry said father dan theres no need said doctor conrad then hustle back and get it over said my father it will be five hundred dollars to you if this comes off all right i think my father was a great man at that time i think he is still a great man hard and cruel as he may have been to me i feel bound to say that for him if he had been born a king he would have made his nation feared and perhaps respected throughout the world he was born a peasant the poorest of peasants a crofter the little homestead of his family with its whitewashed walls and strawthatched roof still stands on the bleak ayrelands of ellan like a herd of mottled cattle crouching together in a storm his own father had been a wild creature full of daring dreams and the chief of them had centred in himself although brought up in a mud cabin and known as daniel neale he believed that he belonged by lineal descent to the highest aristocracy of his island the oneills of the mansion house commonly called the big house and the barons of castle raa to prove his claim he spent his days in searching the registers of the parish churches and his nights in talking loudly in the village inn half in jest and half in earnest people called him neale the lord one day he was brought home dead killed in a drunken quarrel with captain oneill a dissolute braggart who had struck him over the temple with a stick his wife my grandmother hung a herring net across the only room of her house to hide his body from the children who slept in the other bed there were six of them and after the death of her husband she had to fend for all the little croft was hungry land and to make a sufficient living she used to weed for her more prosperous neighbours it was illpaid labourninepence a day fine days and sixpence all weathers with a can of milk twice a week and a lump of butter thrown in now and then the ways were hard and the children were the first to feel them five of them died they werent willing to stay with me she used to say my father alone was left to her and he was another daniel as he grew up he was a great help to his mother i feel sure he loved her difficult as it may be to believe it now i really and truly think that his natural disposition was lovable and generous to begin with there is a story of his boyhood which it would be wrong of me not to tell his mother and he had been up in the mountains cutting gorse and ling which with turf from the curragh used to be the crofters only fuel they were dragging down a prickly pile of it by a straw rope when dipping into the high road by a bridge they crossed the path of a splendid carriage which swirled suddenly out of the drive of the big house behind two highspirited bays driven by an english coachman in gorgeous livery the horses reared and shied at the bundle of kindling whereupon a gentleman inside the carriage leaned out and swore and then the brutal coachman lashing out at the bareheaded woman with his whip struck the boy on his naked legs at the next moment the carriage had gone it had belonged to the head of the oneills lord raa of castle raa whose nearest kinsman captain oneill had killed my grandfather so my poor grandmother said nothing but her little son as soon as his smarting legs would allow wiped his eyes with his ragged sleeve and said never mind mammy you shall have a carriage of your own when i am a man and then nobody shall never lash you his mother died he was twenty years of age at that time a largelimbed lustylunged fellow almost destitute of education but with a big brain and an unconquerable will so he strapped his chest and emigrated to america what work he found at first i never rightly knew i can only remember to have heard that it was something dangerous to human life and that the hands above him dropped off rapidly within two years he was a foreman within five years he was a partner in ten years he was a rich man at the end of fiveandtwenty years he was a millionaire controlling trusts and corporations and carrying out great combines i once heard him say that the money tumbled into his chest like crushed oats out of a crown shaft but what happened at last was never fully explained to me something i heard of a collision with the law and of a forced assignment of his interests all that is material to my story is that at fortyfive years of age he returned to ellan he was then a changed man with a hard tongue a stern mouth and a masterful lift of the eyebrows his passion for wealth had left its mark upon him but the whole island went down before his face like a flood and the people who had made game of his father came crawling to his feet like cockroaches the first thing he did on coming home was to buy up his mothers croft rethatch the old house and put in a poor person to take care of it guess it may come handy some day he said his next act was worthy of the son of neale the lord finding that captain oneill had fallen deeply into debt he bought up the braggarts mortgages turned him out of the big house and took up his own abode in it twelve months later he made amends after his own manner by marrying one of the captains daughters there were two of them isabel the elder was a gentle and beautiful girl very delicate very timid and most sweet when most submissive like the woodland herbs which give out their sweetest fragrance when they are trodden on and crushed bridget the younger was rather homely rather common proud of her strength of mind and will to the deep chagrin of the younger sister my father selected the elder one i have never heard that my mothers wishes were consulted her father and my father dealt with the marriage as a question of business and that was an end of the matter on the wedding day my father did two things that were highly significant he signed the parish register in the name of daniel oneill by right of letters patent and on taking his bride back to her early home he hoisted over the tower of his chill grey house the stars and stripes of his once adopted country stitched to the flag of his native island he had talked less than neale the lord but he had thought and acted more two years passed without offspring and my father made no disguise of his disappointment which almost amounted to disgust hitherto he had occupied himself with improvements in his house and estate but now his restless energies required a wider field and he began to look about him ellan was then a primitive place and its inhabitants half landsmen half seamen were a simple pious race living in a sweet poverty which rarely descended into want but my father had magnificent schemes for it by push energy and enterprise he would galvanise the island into new life build hotels theatres casinos drinking halls and dancing palaces lay out racecourses construct electric railways to the tops of the mountains and otherwise transform the place into a holiday resort for the people of the united kingdom well just sail in and make this old island hum he said and a number of his neighbours nothing loth to be made rich by magicadvocates bankers and insular councillorsjoined hands with him in his adventurous schemes but hardly had he begun when a startling incident happened the old lord raa of castle raa head of the oneills the same that had sworn at my grandmother after many years in which he had lived a bad life abroad where he had contracted fatal maladies returned to ellan to die being a bachelor his heir would have been captain oneill but my mothers father had died during the previous winter and in the absence of direct male issue it seemed likely that both title and inheritance which by the conditions of an old patent might have descended to the nearest living male through the female line would go to a distant relative a boy fourteen years of age a protestant who was then at school at eton more than ever now my father chewed the cud of his great disappointment but it is the unexpected that oftenest happens and one day in the spring doctor conrad being called to see my mother who was indisposed announced that she was about to bear a child my fathers delight was almost delirious though at first his happiness was tempered by the fear that the child that was to be born to him might not prove a boy even this danger disappeared from his mind after a time and before long his vanity and his unconquerable will had so triumphed over his common sense that he began to speak of his unborn child as a son just as if the birth of a male child had been prearranged with my mother with doctor conrad and above all with father dan he sometimes went the length of discussing his sons name it was to be hugh because that had been the name of the heads of the oneills through all the ages as far back as the legendary days in which as it was believed they had been the kings of ellan my mother was no less overjoyed she had justified herself at last and if she was happy enough at the beginning in the tingling delight of the woman who is about to know the sweetest of human joys the joy of bearing a child she acquiesced at length in the accepted idea that her child would be a boy perhaps she was moved to this merely by a desire to submit to her husbands will and to realise his hopes and expectations or perhaps she had another reason a secret reason a reason that came of her own weakness and timidity as a woman namely that the man child to be born of her would be strong and brave and free all went well down to the end of autumn and then alarming news came from castle raa the old lord had developed some further malady and was believed to be sinking rapidly doctor conrad was consulted and he gave it as his opinion that the patient could not live beyond the year this threw my father into a fever of anxiety sending for his advocate he took counsel both with him and with father dan come now let us get the hang of this business he said and when he realised that according to the terms of the ancient patent if the old lord died before his child was born his highbuilt hopes would be in the dust his eagerness became a consuming fire for the first time in his life his excitement took forms of religion and benevolence he promised that if everything went well he would give a new altar to our ladys chapel in the parish church of st mary a ton of coals to every poor person within a radius of five miles and a supper to every inhabitant of the neighbouring village who was more than sixty years of age it was even rumoured that he went so far in secret as to provide funds for the fireworks with which some of his flatterers were to celebrate the forthcoming event and that one form of illumination was a gigantic frame which set upon the sky hill immediately in front of our house was intended to display in brilliant lights the glowing words god bless the happy heir certainly the birth was to be announced by the ringing of the big bell of the tower as signal to the country round about that the appointed festivities might begin day by day through september into october news came from castle raa by secret channels morning by morning doctor conrad was sent for to see my mother never had the sun looked down on a more gruesome spectacle it was a race between the angel of death and the angel of life with my fathers masterful soul between struggling to keep back the one and to hasten on the other my fathers impatience affected everybody about him especially it communicated itself to the person chiefly concerned the result was just what might have been expected my mother was brought to bed prematurely a full month before her time second chapter by six oclock the wind had risen to the force of a hurricane the last of the withered leaves of the trees in the drive had fallen and the bare branches were beating together like bundles of rods the sea was louder than ever and the bell on st marys rock a mile away from the shore was tolling like a knell under the surging of the waves sometimes the clashing of the rain against the windowpanes was like the wash of billows over the portholes of a ship at sea pity for the poor folk with their fireworks said father dan theyll eat their suppers for all that said my father it was now dark but my father would not allow the lamps to be lighted there was therefore no light in his gaunt room except a sullen glow from the fire of peat and logs sometimes in a momentary lull of the storm an intermittent moan would come from the room above followed by a dull hum of voices guess it cant be long now my father would say praise the lord father dan would answer by seven the storm was at its height the roaring of the wind in the wide chimney was as loud as thunder save for this the thunderous noise of the sea served to drown all sounds on the land nevertheless in the midst of the clamour a loud rapping was heard at the front door one of the maidservants would have answered it but my father called her back and taking up a lantern went to the door himself as quietly as he could for the rush of wind without he opened it and pulling it after him he stepped into the porch a man in livery was there on horseback with another saddled horse beside him he was drenched through but steaming with sweat as if he had ridden long and hard shouting above the roar of the storm he said doctor conrad is here is he he iswhat of it said my father tell him hes wanted and must come away with me at once who says he must lord raa his lordship is dangerously ill he wishes to see the doctor immediately i think my father must then have gone through a moment of fierce conflict between his desire to keep the old lord alive and his hope of the immediate birth of his offspring but his choice was quickly made tell the lord he cried that a woman is here in childbirth and until shes delivered the doctor cannot come to him but ive brought a horse and the doctor is to go back with me give the lord my message and say it is daniel oneill who sends it but his lordship is dying and unless the doctor is there to tap him he may not live till morning unless the doctor is here to deliver my wife my child may be dead before midnight what is the birth of your child to the death of his lordship cried the man but before the words were well out of his mouth my father in his great strength had laid hold of the reins and swung both horse and rider round about get yourself to the other side of my gate or ill fling you into the road he cried and then returning to the porch he reentered the house and clashed the door behind him father dan used to say that for some moments more the groom from castle raa could be heard shouting the name of the doctor to the lighted windows of my mothers room but his voice was swirled away in the whistling of the wind and after a while the hoofs of his horses went champing over the gravel in the direction of the gate when my father returned to his room shaking the rain from his hair and beard he was fuming with indignation perhaps a memory of forty years ago was seething in his excited brain the old scoundrel he said hed like it wouldnt he theyd all like it which of them wants a son of mine amongst them the roaring night outside became yet more terrible so loud was the noise from the shore that it was almost as if a wild beast were trying to liberate itself from the womb of the sea at one moment aunt bridget came downstairs to say that the storm was frightening my mother all the servants of the house were gathered in the hall full of fear and telling each other superstitious stories suddenly there came a lull rain and wind seemed to cease in an instant the clamour of the sea became less and the tolling of the bell on st marys rock died away in the distance it was almost as if the world which had been whirling through space suddenly stood still in that moment of silence a deeper moan than usual came from the room overhead my father dropped into a chair clasped his hands and closed his eyes father dan rattled his pearl beads and moved his lips but uttered no sound then a faint sound came from the room overhead my father opened his eyes and listened father dan held his breath the sound was repeated but louder clearer shriller than before there could be no mistaking it now it was natures eternal signal that out of the womb of silence a living soul had been born into the world its over said my father glory be to god and all the saints said father dan thatll beat em cried my father and he leapt to his feet and laughed going to the door of the room he flung it open the servants in the hall were now whispering eagerly and one of them the gardener tom dug commonly called tommy the mate stepped out and asked if he ought to ring the big bell certainly said my father isnt that what youve been standing by for a few minutes later the bell of the tower began to ring and it was followed almost immediately by the bell of our parish church which rang out a merry peal thatll beat em i say cried my father and laughing in his triumph he tramped the flagged floor with a firmer step than ever all at once the crying of the child ceased and there was a confused rumble of voices overhead my father stopped his face straightened and his voice which had rung out like a horn wheezed back like a whistle whats going doing wheres conrad why doesnt conrad come to me dont worry hell be down presently said father dan a few minutes passed in which nothing was said and nothing heard and then unable to bear the suspense any longer my father went to the foot of the staircase and shouted the doctors name a moment later the doctors footsteps were heard on the stone stairs they were hesitating halting dragging footsteps then the doctor entered my fathers room even in the sullen light of the peat fire his face was white ashen white he did not speak at first and there was an instant of silence dead silence then my father said well what is it it is speak man do you mean it is dead no oh no not that what then it is a girl a gir did you say a girl yes my god said my father and he dropped back into the chair his lips were parted and his eyes which had been blazing with joy became fixed on the dying fire in a stupid stare father dan tried to console him there were thistles in everybodys crop and after all it was a good thing to have begotten a girl girls were the flowers of life the joy and comfort of man in his earthly pilgrimage and many a father who bemoaned his fate when a daughter had been born to him had lived to thank the lord for her all this time the joy bells had been ringing and now the room began to be illuminated by fitful flashes of variegated light from the fireworkframe on the top of sky hill which as well as it could for the rain that had soaked it was sputtering out its mocking legend god bless the happy heir in his soft irish voice which was like a river running over smooth stones father dan went on with his comforting yes women are the salt of the earth god bless them and when i think of what they suffer that the world may go on that the generations may not fail i feel as if i want to go down on my knees and kiss the feet of the first woman i meet in the street what would the world be without women think of st theresa think of the blessed margaret mary think of the holy virgin herself oh stow this stuff cried my father and leaping to his feet he began to curse and swear stop that accursed bell is the fool going to ring for ever put out those damnable lights too put them out are the devils of hell trying to laugh at me with that and an oath at himself for his folly my father strode out of the room my mother had heard him through the unceiled timbers of the floor between them the words of his rage had reached her she was ashamed she felt as if she were a guilty thing and with a low cry of pain she turned to the wall and fainted the old lord died the same night somewhere towards the dead reaches of the dawn his wicked spirit went to its reckoning and a month afterwards the new lord raa a boy in an eton jacket came over to take possession of his inheritance but long before that my father scoring out his disappointment like an account that was closed had got to work with his advocates bankers and insular councillors on his great schemes for galvanising the old island into new life third chapter out of the mist and veil of my own memory as distinguished from father dans there comes first the recollection of a big room containing a big bed a big wardrobe a big dressing table a big prayingstool with an image of our lady on the wall above it and an open window to which a sparrow used to come in the mornings and chirp when i came to recognise and to classify i realised that this was my mothers room and that the sweet somebody who used to catch me up in her arms when i went tottering on voyages of discovery round the vast place was my mother herself and that she would comfort me when i fell and stroke my head with her thin white hand while she sang softly and rocked me to and fro as i have no recollection of ever having seen my mother in any other part of our house or indeed in any other place except our carriage when we drove out in the sunshine i conclude that from the time of my birth she had been an invalid certainly the faces which first emerge from the islands of my memory are the cheerful and sunny ones of doctor conrad and father dan i recall the soft voice of the one as he used to enter our room after breakfast saying how are we this morning maam and i remember the still softer voice of the other as he said and how is my daughter today i loved both of them but especially father dan who used to call me his nanny and say i was the plague and pet of his life being as full of mischief as a goat he must have been an old child himself for i have clear recollection of how immediately after confessing my mother he would go down on all fours with me on the floor and play at hideandseek around the legs of the big bed amid squeals and squeaks of laughter i remember too that he wore a long sack coat which buttoned close at the neck and hung loose at the skirts where there were two large vertical pockets and that these pockets were my cupboards and drawers for i put my toys and my doll and even the remnants of my cakes into them to be kept in safe custody until wanted again my mother called me mally veen mary dear and out of love of her only child she must have weaned me late for i have vague memories of her soft white breasts filled with milk i slept in a little wickerwork cot placed near her bed so that she could reach me if i uncovered myself in the night she used to say i was like a bird having something birdlike in my small dark head and the way i held it up certainly i remember myself as a swift little thing always darting to and fro on tiptoe and chirping about our chill and rather cheerless house if i was like a bird my mother was like a flower her head which was small and fair and her face which was nearly always tinged with colour drooped forward from her delicate body like a rose from its stalk she was generally dressed in black i remember but she wore a white lace collar as well as a coif such as we see in old pictures and when i call her back to my mind with her large liquid eyes and her sweet soft mouth i think it cannot be my affection alone or the magic of my childish memory which makes me think after all these years and all the countries i have travelled in and all the women i have seen that my darling mother though so little known and so little loved was the most beautiful woman in the world even yet i cannot but wonder that other people my father especially did not see her with my eyes i think he was fond of her after his own fashion but there was a kind of involuntary contempt in his affection which could not conceal itself from my quick little eyes she was visibly afraid of him and was always nervous and timid when he came into our room with his customary salutation how now isabel and hows this child of yours from my earliest childhood i noticed that he always spoke of me as if i had been my mothers child not his and perhaps this affected my feeling for him from the first i was in terror of his loud voice and rough manner the big bearded man with the iron grey head and the smell of the fresh air about his thick serge clothes it was almost as if i had conceived this fear before my birth and had brought it out of the tremulous silence of my mothers womb my earliest recollections are of his muffled shout from the room below keep your child quiet will you when i was disturbing him over his papers by leaping and skipping about the floor if he came upstairs when i was in bed i would dive under the bedclothes as a duck dives under water and only come to the surface when he was gone i am sure i never kissed my father or climbed on to his knee and that during his short visits to our room i used to hold my breath and hide my head behind my mothers gown i think my mother must have suffered both from my fear of my father and from my fathers indifference to me for she made many efforts to reconcile him to my existence some of her innocent schemes as i recall them now seem very sweet but very pitiful she took pride for instance in my hair which was jet black even when i was a child and she used to part it in the middle and brush it smooth over my forehead in the manner of the madonna and one day when my father was with us she drew me forward and said dont you think our mary is going to be very pretty a little like the pictures of our lady perhapsdont you think so daniel whereupon my father laughed rather derisively and answered pretty is she like the virgin eh well well i was always fond of music and my mother used to teach me to sing to a little upright piano which she was allowed to keep in her room and on another day she said do you know our mary has such a beautiful voice dear so sweet and pure that when i close my eyes i could almost think it is an angel singing whereupon my father laughed as before and answered a voice has she like an angels is it what next i wonder my mother made most of my clothes there was no need for her to do so but in the absence of household duties i suppose it stimulated the tenderness which all mothers feel in covering the little limbs they love and one day having made a velvet frock for me from a design in an old pattern book of coloured prints which left the legs and neck and arms very bare she said isnt our mary a little lady but she will always look like a lady whatever she is dressed in and then my father laughed still more contemptuously and replied her grandmother weeded turnips in the fields thoughninepence a day dry days and sixpence all weathers my mother was deeply religious never allowing a day to pass without kneeling on her prayerstool before the image of the virgin and one day i heard her tell my father that when i was a little mite scarcely able to speak she found me kneeling in my cot with my doll perched up before me moving my lips as if saying my prayers and looking up at the ceiling with a rapt expression but she has always had such big beautiful religious eyes and i shouldnt wonder if she becomes a nun some day a nun eh maybe so but i take no stock in the nun business anyway said my father whereupon my mothers lips moved as if she were saying no dearest but her dear sweet pride was crushed and she could go no farther fourth chapter there was a whole colony on the ground floor of our house who like my father could not reconcile themselves to my existence and the head of them was aunt bridget she had been married soon after the marriage of my mother to one colonel macleod a middleaged officer on halfpay a widower a belfast irishman and a tavern companion of my maternal grandfather but the colonel had died within a year leaving aunt bridget with one child of her own a girl as well as a daughter of his wife by the former marriage as this happened about the time of my birth when it became obvious that my mother was to be an invalid my father invited aunt bridget to come to his house as housekeeper and she came and brought her children with her her rule from the outset had been as hard as might have been expected from one who prided herself on her selfcommanda quality that covered everybody including my mother and me and was only subject to softening in favour of her own offspring aunt bridgets own daughter a year older than myself was a fair child with light grey eyes round cheeks of the colour of ripe apples and long yellow hair that was carefully combed and curled her name was betsy which was extended by her mother to betsy beauty she was usually dressed in a muslin frock with a sash of light blue ribbon and being understood to be delicate was constantly indulged and nearly always eating and giving herself generally the airs of the daughter of the house aunt bridgets stepdaughter ten years older was a gaunt ungainly girl with red hair and irregular features her name was nessy and having an instinctive sense of her dependent position she was very humble and subservient and as tommy the mate used to say as smooth as an old threepenny bit to the ruling powers which always meant my aunt but spiteful insolent and acrid to anybody who was outside my aunts favour which usually meant me between my cousin and myself there were constant feuds in which nessy macleod never failed to take the side of betsy beauty while my poor mother became a target for the shafts of aunt bridget who said i was a wilful wicked underhand little vixen and no wonder seeing how disgracefully i was indulged and how shockingly i was being brought up these skirmishes went on for a considerable time without consequences but they came at last to a foolish climax which led to serious results even my mothers life had its gleams of sunshine and flowers were a constant joy to her old tommy the gardener was aware of this and every morning sent up a bunch of them freshly cut and wet with the dew but one day in the spring he could not do so being out in the dubs of the curragh cutting peat for the fires therefore i undertook to supply the deficiency having already with the large solemnity of six begun to consider it my duty to take charge of my mother never mind mammy ill setch some slowers sor you i said every f being an s in those days and armed with a pair of scissors i skipped down to the garden i had chosen a bed of annuals because they were bright and fragrant and was beginning to cut some gilvers when nessy macleod who had been watching from a window came bouncing down me mary oneill how dare you cried nessy you wilful wicked underhand little vixen what will your aunt bridget say dont you know this is betsy beautys bed and nobody else is to touch it i began to excuse myself on the ground of my mother and tommy the mate but nessy would hear no such explanation your mamma has nothing to do with it you know quite well that your aunt bridget manages everything in this house and nothing can be done without her small as i was that was too much for me somewhere in my little heart there had long been a secret pang of mortified pridehow born i do not knowat seeing aunt bridget take the place of my mother and now choking with vexation but without saying a word i swept off the heads of all the flowers in the bed and with my arms full of themten times more than i wantedi sailed back to my mothers room inside two minutes there was a fearful tumult i thought i was doomed to punishment when i heard the big bunch of keys which aunt bridget kept suspended from her waist come jingling up the stairs but it was my poor mother who paid the penalty isabel cried aunt bridget i hope you are satisfied with your child at last what has mary been doing now dear said my mother dont ask me what she has been doing you know quite well or if you dont you ought to my mother glanced at the flowers and she seemed to understand what had happened for her face fell and she said submissively mary has done wrong but i am sure she is sorry and will never do it again sorry indeed cried my aunt not she sorry and shell do it again at the very next opportunity the vixen the little wilful underhand vixen but what wonder if children go wrong when their own mothers neglect to correct them i daresay you are quite right dear bridgetyou are always right said my mother in a low grave voice but then im not very well and mary is all i have you know my mother was in tears by this time but aunt bridget was not content with her triumph sweeping downstairs she carried her complaint to my father who ordered that i was to be taken out of my mothers charge on the ground that she was incapable of attending to my upbringinga task which being assigned to my aunt bridget provided that i should henceforward live on the ground floor and eat oaten cake and barley bonnag and sleep alone in the cold room over the hall while betsy beauty ate wheaten bread and apple tart and slept with her mother in the room over the kitchen in which they always kept a fire fifth chapter the altered arrangements were a cause of grief to my mother but i am bound to confess that for me they had certain compensations one of them was the greater ease with which i could slip out to tommy the mate who had been a sailor before he was a gardener and was still a fine old salt with grizzled beard and shaggy eyebrows and a merry twinkle in what he called his starboard eye i think tommy was one of the few about my fathers house who were really fond of me but perhaps that was mainly because he loathed aunt bridget he used to call her the big woman meaning that she was the master and mistress of everything and everybody about the place when he was told of any special piece of her tyranny to servant or farmhand he used to say aw well shell die for all and when he heard how she had separated me from my mother who had nothing else to love or live for he spat sideways out of his mouth and said our big woman is a wicked devil im thinking and i wouldnt trust shouldnt wonder but shell burn in hell what definite idea i attached to this denunciation i do not now recall but i remember that it impressed me deeply and that many a night afterwards during the miserable halfhours before i fell asleep with my head under the clothes in the cold bedroom over the hall to which as nessy macleod had told me the bad fairies came for bad children i repeated the strange words again and again another compensation was the greater opportunity i had for cultivating an acquaintance which i had recently made with the doctors son when he came with his father on visits to my mother as soon as the hoofs of the horse were heard on the gravel and before the bell could be rung i used to dart away on tiptoe fly through the porch climb into the gig and help the boy to hold the reins while his father was upstairs this led to what i thought a great discovery it was about my mother i had always known my mother was sick but now i got a skute as old tommy used to say into the cause of her illness it was a matter of milk the doctors boy had heard his father saying so if my mother could only have milk morning noon and night every day and all day there wouldnt be nothing the matter with her this too impressed me deeply and the form it took in my mind was that mammy wasnt sed enough a conclusion that gained colour from the fact that i saw betsy beauty perched up in a high chair in the diningroom twice or thrice a day drinking nice warm milk fresh from the cow we had three cows i remember and to correct the mischief of my mothers illness i determined that henceforth she should not have merely more of our milkshe should have all of it losing no time in carrying my intentions into effect i crept into the dairy as soon as the dairymaid had brought in the afternoons milking there it was still frothing and bubbling in three great bowls and taking up the first of them in my little thin armsgoodness knows howi made straight for my mothers room but hardly had i climbed halfway up the stairs puffing and panting under my burden when i met nessy macleod coming down and she fell on me with her usual reproaches mary oneill you wilful underhand little vixen whatever are you doing with the milk being in no mood for explanations i tried to push past but nessy prevented me no indeed you shant go a step further what will your aunt bridget say take the milk back miss this very minute nessys loud protest brought betsy beauty out of the diningroom and in a moment my cousin looking more than ever like a painted doll in her white muslin dress with a large blue bow in her yellow hair had run upstairs to assist her stepsister i was now between the two the one above and the other below and they laid hold of my bowl to take it from me they tugged and i resisted and there was a struggle in which the milk was in danger of being spilled shes a stubborn little thing and she ought to be whipped cried nessy shes stealing my milk and ill tell mamma said betsy tell her then i cried and in a burst of anger at finding myself unable to recover control of my bowl i swept it round and flung its contents over my cousins head thereby drenching her with the frothing milk and making the staircase to run like a river of whitewash of course there was a fearful clamour betsy beauty shrieked and nessy bellowed whereupon aunt bridget came racing from her parlour while my mother white and trembling halted to the door of her room mally mally what have you done cried my mother but aunt bridget found no need of questions after running upstairs to her dripping daughter wiping her down with a handkerchief calling her my poor darling and saying didnt i tell you to have nothing more to do with that little vixen she fell on my mother with bitter upbraidings isabel i hope you see now what your minx of a child isthe little spiteful fury by this time i had dropped my empty bowl on the stairs and taken refuge behind my mothers gown but i heard her timid voice trying to excuse me and saying something about my cousin and a childish quarrel childish quarrel indeed cried my aunt theres nothing childish about that little imp nothing and whats more i shall be obliged to you isabel if you will never again have the assurance to speak of my betsy beauty in the same breath with a child of yours that was more than i could hear my little heart was afire at the humiliation put upon my mother so stepping out to the head of the stairs i shouted down in my shrillest treble your betsy beauty is a wicked devil and i wouldnt trust but shell burn in hell never to the last hour of my life shall i forget the effect of that pronouncement one moment aunt bridget stood speechless in the middle of the stairs as if all breath had been broken out of her then ghastly white and without a word she came flying up at me and before i could recover my usual refuge she caught me slapped me on the cheek and boxed both my ears i do not remember if i cried but i know my mother did and that in the midst of the general tumult my father came out of his room and demanded in a loud voice which seemed to shake the whole house to be told what was going on aunt bridget told him with various embellishments which my mother did not attempt to correct and then knowing she was in the wrong she began to wipe her eyes with her wet handkerchief and to say she could not live any longer where a child was encouraged to insult her i have to leave this housei have to leave it tomorrow she said you dont have to do no such thing cried my father but im just crazy to see if a man cant be captain in his own claim these children must go to school they must all gothe darned lot of em sixth chapter before i speak of what happened at school i must say how and when i first became known to the doctors boy it was during the previous christmastide on christmas eve i awoke in the dead of night with the sense of awakening in another world the churchbells were ringing and there was singing outside our house under the window of my mothers room after listening for a little while i made my voice as soft as i could and said mamma what is it hush dear it is the waits lie still and listen said my mother i lay as long as my patience would permit and then creeping over to the window i saw a circle of men and women with lanterns and the frosty air smoking about their red faces after a while they stopped singing and then the chain of our front door rattled and i heard my fathers loud voice asking the singers into the house they came in and when i was back in bed i heard them talking and then laughing in the room below with aunt bridget louder than all the rest and when i asked what she was doing my mother told me she was serving out bunloaf and sherrywine i fell asleep before the incident was over but as soon as i awoke in the morning i conceived the idea of singing the waits myself being an artful little thing i knew that my plan would be opposed so i said nothing about it but i got my mother to play and sing the carol i had heard overnight until my quick ear had mastered both tune and words and when darkness fell on christmas night i proceeded to carry out my intention in the heat of my impatience i forgot to put on cloak or hat and stealing out of the house i found myself in the carriage drive with nothing on but a pair of thin slippers and the velvet frock that left my neck and arms so bare it was snowing and the snowflakes were whirling round me and making me dizzy for in the light from my mothers window they seemed to come up from the ground as well as down from the sky when i got out of the light of the window it was very dark and i could only see that the chestnuts in the drive seemed to have white blankets on them which looked as if they had been hung out to dry it was a long time before i got to the gate and then i had begun to be nervous and to have half a mind to turn back but the thought of the bunloaf and the sherrywine buoyed me up and presently i found myself on the high road crossing a bridge and turning down a lane that led to the sea whose moaning a mile away was the only sound i could hear i knew quite well where i was going to i was going to the doctors house it was called sunny lodge and it was on the edge of yellow gorse farm i had seen it more than once when i had driven out in the carriage with my mother and had thought how sweet it looked with its whitewashed walls and brown thatched roof and the red and white roses which grew over the porch i was fearfully cold before i got there the snow was in my slippers and down my neck and among the thickening masses of my hair at one moment i came upon some sheep and lambs that were sheltering under a hedge and they bleated in the silence of the night but at last i saw the warm red windows of the doctors cottage and coming to the wicket gate i pushed it open though it was clogged with snow and stepped up to the porch my teeth were now chattering with cold but as well as i could i began to sing and in my thin and creachy voice i had got as far as chist was born in beflem chist was born in beflem chist was born in beflem an in a manger laid when i heard a rumbling noise inside the house immediately afterwards the door was opened upon me and a woman whom i knew to be the doctors wife looked down into my face with an expression of bewilderment and then cried goodness gracious me doctorif it isnt little mary oneill god bless her bring her in at once then said the voice of doctor conrad from within and at the next moment i found myself in a sort of kitchenparlour which was warm with a glowing turf fire that had a kettle singing over it and cosy and bright with a ragwork hearthrug a dresser full of blue pottery and a sofa settle covered with red cloth i suppose the sudden change to a warm room must have caused me to faint for i have no recollection of what happened next except that i was sitting on somebodys lap and that she was calling me boght millish little sweet and vegveen little dear while she rubbed my halffrozen limbs and did other things that were i am sure all womanly and good when i came to myself doctor conrad was saying i would have to sleep there that night and he must go over to the big house and tell my mother what had happened he went and by the time he came back i had been bathed in a dollytub placed in front of the fire and was being carried upstairs in a nightdress many sizes too large for me to a little dimitywhite bedroom where the sweet smelling scraas under the sloping thatch of the roof came down almost to my face i know nothing of what happened during the night except that i was feeling very hot and that as often as i opened my eyes the doctors wife was leaning over me and speaking in a soft voice that seemed far away but next day i felt cooler and then aunt bridget came in her satin mantle and big black hat and said something while standing at the end of my bed about people paying the penalty when they did things that were sly and underhand towards evening i was much easier and when the doctor came in to see me at night he said how are we this evening ah better i see distinctly better and then turning to his wife he said no need to stay up with her tonight christian ann but wont the boght millish be afraid to be left alone she asked i said i shouldnt and she kissed me and told me to knock at the wall if i wanted anything and then with her husbands arm about her waist the good soul left me to myself i dont know how i knew but i did know that that house was a home of love i dont know how i knew but i did know that that sweet woman who had been the daughter of a welltodo man had chosen the doctor out of all the men in the world when he was only a medical student fresh from germany or switzerland i dont know how i knew but i did know that leaving father and mother and a sheltered home she had followed her young husband when he first came to ellan without friends or connections and though poor then and poor still she had never regretted it i dont know how i knew but i did know that all this was the opposite of what had happened to my own dear mother who having everything yet had nothing while this good creature having nothing yet had all seventh chapter when i awoke next morning the sun was shining and after my hair had been brushed smooth over my forehead i was sitting up in bed eating for breakfast the smallest of bantam eggs with the smallest of silver spoons when the door opened with a bang and a small figure tumbled into my room it was a boy two years older than myself he wore a grey norfolk jacket and knickerbockers but the peculiarity of his dress was a white felt hat of enormous size which being soiled and turned down in the brim and having a hole in the crown with a crop of his brown hair sticking through it gave him the appearance of a damaged mushroom except that on entering he tipped up his head so that i saw his face which was far from beautiful and yet had two big blue eyesas blue as the bluest seahe took no notice of my presence but tossed a somersault in the middle of the floor screwed his legs over the back of a chair vaulted over a table and finally stood on his hands with his legs against the wall opposite to my bed and his inverted countenance close to the carpet in this position in which he was clearly making a point of remaining as long as possible while his face grew very red we held our first conversation i had hitherto sat propped up as quiet as a mouse but now i said little boy whats your name mart was the answer where do you come from spitzbergen i cannot remember that this intelligence astonished me for when the inverted face had become scarlet and the legs went down and the head came up and my visitor tossed several somersaults over the end of my bed to the danger of my breakfast tray and then without a word more tumbled out of the room i was still watching in astonishment i did not know at that time that these were the ways which since the beginning of the world have always been employed by savages and boys when they desire to commend themselves to the female of their kind so that when the doctors wife came smiling upstairs i asked her if the little boy who had been to see me was not quite well bless you yes dear but thats his way she said and then she told me all about him his name was martin conrad and he was her only child his hat which had awakened my interest was an old one of his fathers and it was the last thing he took off when he undressed for bed at night and the first thing he put on in the morning when the hole came into its crown his mother had tried to hide it away but he had always found it and when she threw it into the river he had fished it out again he was the strangest boy full of the funniest fancies he used to say that before he was born he lived in a tree and was the fellow who turned on the rain it was with difficulty that he could be educated and every morning on being awakened he said he was sorry he ever started this going to school as a consequence he could not read or write as well as other boys of his age and his grammar was still that of the peasant people with whom he loved to associate chief among these was our gardener old tommy the mate who lived in a mud cabin on the shore and passed the doctors house on his way to work long ago tommy had told the boy a tremendous story it was about arctic exploration and an expedition he had joined in search of franklin this had made an overpowering impression on martin who for mouths afterwards would stand waiting at the gate until tommy was going by and then say been to the north pole today tommy whereupon tommys starboard eye would blink and he would answer not today boy i dont go to the north pole more nor twice a day now dont you though the boy would say and this would happen every morning but later on martin conceived the idea that the north pole was the locality immediately surrounding his fathers house and every day he would set out on voyages of exploration over the garden the road and the shore finding by his own account a vast world of mysterious things and undiscovered places by some meansnobody knew howthe boy who could not learn his lessons studied his fathers german atlas and there was not a name in it north of spitzbergen which he had not got by heart he transferred them all to ellan so that the sky hill became greenland and the black head became franz josef land and the nuns well became behring strait and marthas gullet became new siberia and st marys rock with the bell anchored on it became the pivot of the earth itself he could swim like a fish and climb a rock like a lizard and he kept a logbook on the back pages of the doctors book of visits which he called his diarrhea and now if you lost him you had only to look up to the ridge of the roof or perhaps on to the chimney stack which he called his crows nest and there you found him spying through his fathers telescope and crying out lookout ahead ice floes from eightysix latitude fourteen point north five knots to the starboard bow his mother laughed until she cried when she told me all this but there is no solemnity like that of a child and to me it was a marvellous story i conceived a deep admiration for the doctors boy and saw myself with eyes of worship walking reverently by his side i suppose my poor lonely heart was hungering after comradeship for being a sentimental little ninny i decided to offer myself to the doctors boy as his sister the opportunity was dreadfully long in coming it did not come until the next morning when the door of my room flew open with a yet louder bang than before and the boy entered in a soapbox on wheels supposed to be a sledge and drawn by a dog an irish terrier which being red had been called william rufus his hat was tied over his ears with a tape from his mothers apron and he wore a long pair of his fathers knitted stockings which covered his boots and came up to his thighs he did not at first take any more notice of me than on the previous day but steering his sledge round the room he shouted to his dog that the chair by the side of my bed was a glacier and the sheepskin rug was floating ice after a while we began to talk and then thinking my time had come i tried to approach my subject being such a clever little woman i went artfully to work speaking first about my father my mother my cousin nessy macleod and even aunt bridget with the intention of showing how rich i was in relations so that he might see how poor he was himself i felt myself a bit of a hypocrite in all this but the doctors boy did not know that and i noticed that as i passed my people in review he only said is she any good or is he a stunner at length my great moment came and with a fluttering heart i took it havent you got a sister i said not me said the doctors boy with a dig of emphasis on the last word which cut me to the quick wouldnt you like to have one sisters isnt no good said the doctors boy and he instanced chaps at schooljimmy christopher and otherswhose sisters were afraid of everythinglobsters and crabs and even the sea i knew i was as timid as a hare myself but my lonely little heart was beginning to bleed and as well as i could for my throat which was choking me i said im not afraid of the seanot crabs neither in a moment the big mushroom hat was tipped aside and the seablue eyes looked aslant at me isnt you though no that did it i could see it did and when a minute afterwards i invited the doctors boy into bed he came in stockings and all and sat by my right side while william rufus who had formed an instant attachment for me lay on my left with his muzzle on my lap later the same day my bedroom door being open so that i might call downstairs to the kitchen i heard the doctors boy telling his mother what i was i was a stunner eighth chapter from that day forward the doctors boy considered that i belonged to him but not until i was sent to school with my cousin and her stepsister did he feel called upon to claim his property it was a mixed dayschool in the village and it was controlled by a board which had the village butcher as its chairman the only teacher was a tall woman of thirty who plaited her hair which was of the colour of flax into a ridiculouslooking crown on the top of her head but her expression i remember was one of perpetual severity and when she spoke through her thin lips she clipped her words with great rapidity as if they had been rolls of bread which were being chopped in a charity school afterwards i heard that she owed her position to aunt bridget who had exercised her influence through the chairman by means of his account with the big house perhaps she thought it her duty to display her gratitude certainly she lost no time in showing me that my character had gone to school before me for in order that i might be directly under her eye she placed me in the last seat in the lowest class although my mothers daily teaching would have entitled me to go higher i dare say i was as father dan used to say as full of mischief as a goat and i know i was a chatterbox but i do not think i deserved the fate that followed one day not more than a week after we had been sent to school i held my slate in front of my face while i whispered something to the girl beside and the girl behind me both began to titter silence cried the schoolmistress who was sitting at her desk but i went on whispering and the girls began to choke with laughter i think the schoolmistress must have thought i was saying something about herselfmaking game perhaps of her personal appearancefor after a moment she said in her rapid accents mary oneill please repeat what you have just been saying i held my slate yet closer to my face and made no answer dont you hear miss speak youve a tongue in your head havent you but still i did not answer and then the schoolmistress said mary oneill come forward she had commanded me like a dog and like a dog i was about to obey when i caught sight of betsy beautys face which beaming with satisfaction seemed to be saying now we shall see i would not stir after that and the schoolmistress leaving her desk came towards me and looking darkly into my face said you wilful little vixen do you think you can trifle with me come out miss this very moment i knew where that language came from so i made no movement dont you hear or do you suppose that because you are pampered and spoiled by a foolish person at home you can defy me that reflection on my mother settled everything i sat as rigid as a rock then pale as a whitewashed wall and with her thin lips tightly compressed the schoolmistress took hold of me to drag me out of my seat but with my little nervous fingers i clung to the desk in front of me and as often as she tore one of my hands open the other fixed itself afresh you minx well see whos mistress here will none of you big girls come and help me with the utmost alacrity one big girl from a back bench came rushing to the schoolmistress assistance it was nessy macleod and together after a fierce struggle they tore me from my desk like an ivy branch from a tree and dragged me into the open space in front of the classes by this time the schoolmistress hands and i think her neck were scratched and from that cause also she was quivering with passion stand there miss she said and move from that spot at your peril my own fury was now spent and in the dead silence which had fallen on the entire school i was beginning to feel the shame of my ignominious position children cried the schoolmistress addressing the whole of the scholars put down your slates and listen then as soon as she had recovered her breath she said standing by my side and pointing down to me this child came to school with the character of a wilful wicked little vixen and she has not belied her character by gross disobedience she has brought herself to where you see her spare the rod spoil the child is a scriptural maxim and the foolish parents who ruin their children by overindulgence deserve all that comes to them but there is no reason why other people should suffer and small as this child is she has made the life of her excellent aunt intolerable by her unlovable unsociable and unchildlike disposition children she was sent to school to be corrected of her faults and i order you to stop your lessons while she is publicly punished with this parade of the spirit of justice the schoolmistress stepped back and left me i knew what she was doingshe was taking her cane out of her desk which stood by the wall i heard the desk opened with an impatient clash and then closed with an angry bang i was as sure as if i had had eyes in the back of my head that the schoolmistress was holding the cane in both hands and bending it to see if it was lithe and limber i felt utterly humiliated standing there with all eyes upon me i was conscious of the worst pain that enters into a childs experiencethe pain of knowing that other children are looking upon her degradation i thought of aunt bridget and my little heart choked with anger then i thought of my mother and my throat throbbed with shame i remembered what my mother had said of her little mary being always a little lady and i felt crushed at the thought that i was about to be whipped before all the village children at home i had been protected if only by my mothers tears but here i was alone and felt myself to be so little and helpless but just as my lip was beginning to drop at the thought of what my mother would suffer if she saw me in this position of infamy and i was about to cry out to the schoolmistress dont beat me oh please dont beat me a strange thing happened which turned my shame into surprise and triumph through the mist which had gathered before my eyes i saw a boy coming out of the boys class at the end of the long room it was martin conrad and i remember that he rolled as he walked like old tommy the gardener everybody saw him and the schoolmistress said in her sharp voice martin conrad what right have you to leave your place without permission go back sir this very moment instead of going back martin came on and as he did so he dragged his big soft hat out of the belt of his norfolk jacket and with both hands pulled it down hard on his head go back sir cried the schoolmistress and i saw her step towards him with the cane poised and switching in the air as if about to strike the boy said nothing but just shaking himself like a big dog he dropped his head and butted at the schoolmistress as she approached him struck her somewhere in the waist and sent her staggering and gasping against the wall then without a word he took my hand as something that belonged to him and before the schoolmistress could recover her breath or the scholars awake from their astonishment he marched me as if his little stocky figure had been sixteen feet tall in stately silence out of the school ninth chapter i was never sent back to school and i heard that martin by order of the butcher was publicly expelled this was a cause of distress to our mothers who thought the future of our lives had been permanently darkened but i cannot say that it ever stood between us and our sunshine on the contrary it occurred thataunt bridget having washed her hands of me and martins father being unable to make up his mind what to do with himwe found ourselves for some time at large and were nothing loth to take advantage of our liberty until a day came which brought a great disaster one morning i found martin with old tommy the mate in his pottingshed deep in the discussion of their usual subjectthe perils and pains of arctic exploration when you have little food in your wallet and not too much in your stomach but you has lots of things when you gets therehams and flitches and oranges and thingshasnt you said martin never a haporth said tommy nothing but glory you just takes your alping stock and your sleeping sack and your bit o biscuit and away you go over crevaxes deeper nor marthas gullet and mountains higher nor mount blank and never think o nothing but doing something that nobodys never done before my goodness yes boy thats the way of it when youre out asploring glorys waiting for me says you and on you go at that great word i saw martins blue eyes glisten like the sea when the sun is shining on it and then seeing me for the first time he turned back to old tommy and said i spose you lets women go with you when youre out asploringwomen and girls never a woman said tommy not nevernot if theyre stunners said martin well says tommy glancing down at me while his starboard eye twinkled i wont say nevernot if theyre stunners next day martin attended by william rufus arrived at our house with a big corn sack on his shoulder a long broomhandle in his hand a lemonade bottle half filled with milk a large sea biscuit and a small union jack which came from the confectioners on the occasion of his last birthday glorys waiting for mecome along shipmate he said in a mysterious whisper and without a word of inquiry i obeyed he gave me the biscuit and i put it in the pocket of my frock and the bottle of milk and i tied it to my belt and then off we went with the dog bounding before us i knew he was going to the sea and my heart was in my mouth for of all the things i was afraid of i feared the sea mosta terror born with me perhaps on the fearful night of my birth but i had to live up to the character i had given myself when martin became my brother and the one dread of my life was that finding me as timid as other girls he might want me no more we reached the sea by a little bay called murphys mouth which had a mud cabin that stood back to the cliff and a small boat that was moored to a post on the shore both belonged to tommy the mate who was a widow man living alone and therefore there were none to see us when we launched the boat and set out on our voyage it was then two oclock in the afternoon the sun was shining and the tide which was at the turn was beginning to flow i had never been in a boat before but i dared not say anything about that and after martin had fixed the bow oar for me and taken the stroke himself i spluttered and plunged and made many blunders i had never been on the sea either and almost as soon as we shot clear of the shore and were lifted on to the big waves i began to feel dizzy and dropped my oar with the result that it slipped through the rollocks and was washed away martin saw what had happened as we swung round to his rowing but when i expected him to scold me he only said never mind shipmate i was just thinking we would do better with one and shipping his own oar in the stern of the boat he began to scull my throat was hurting me and partly from shame and partly from fear i now sat forward with william rufus on my lap and said as little as possible but martin was in high spirits and while his stout little body rolled to the rocking of the boat he whistled and sang and shouted messages to me over his shoulder my gracious isnt this what you call ripping he cried and though my teeth were chattering i answered that it was some girlsjimmy christophers sister and nessy macleod and betsy beautywould be frightened to come asploring wouldnt they wouldnt they i said and i laughed though i was trembling down to the soles of my shoes we must have been half an hour out and the shore seemed so far away that murphys mouth and tommys cabin and even the trees of the big house looked like something i had seen through the wrong end of a telescope when he turned his head with a wild light in his eyes and said see the north pole out yonder dont i i answered though i was such a practical little person and had not an ounce of dream in me i knew quite well where he was going to he was going to st marys rock and of all the places on land or sea it was the place i was most afraid of being so big and frowning an ugly black mass standing twenty to thirty feet out of the water draped like a coffin in a pall with long fronds of seaweed and covered save at high water by a multitude of hungry seafowl a white cloud of the birds rose from their sleep as we approached and wheeled and whistled and screamed and beat their wings over our heads i wanted to scream too but martin said my gracious isnt this splendiferous isnt it i answered and little hypocrite that i was i began to sing i remember that i sang one of tommys sailorsongs sally because its jolly doggerel was set to such a jaunty tune oh sallys the gel for me our sallys the gel for me ill marry the gel that i love best when i come back from sea my pretence of happiness was shortlived for at the next moment i made another mistake drawing up his boat to a ledge of the rock and laying hold of our painter martin leapt ashore and then held out his hand to me to follow him but in fear of a big wave i held back when i ought to have jumped and he was drenched from head to foot i was ashamed and thought he would have scolded me but he only shook himself and said thats nothing we dont mind a bit of wet when were out asploring my throat was hurting me again and i could not speak but without waiting for me to answer he coiled the rope about my right arm and told me to stay where i was and hold fast to the boat while he climbed the rock and took possession of it in the name of the king do or die we allus does that when were out asploring he said and with his sack over his shoulder his broomhandle in his hand and his little union jack sticking out of the hole in the crown of his hat he clambered up the crag and disappeared over the top of it being left alone for the dog had followed him my nervousness increased tenfold and thinking at last that the rising tide was about to submerge the ledge on which i stood i tried in my fright to climb the cliff but hardly had i taken three steps when my foot slipped and i clutched the seaweed to save myself from falling with the result that the boats rope slid from my arm and went ripripripping down the rock until it fell with a splash into the sea i saw what i had done and i screamed and then martins head appeared after a moment on the ledge above me but it was too late for him to do anything for the boat had already drifted six yards away and just when i thought he would have shrieked at me for cutting off our only connection with the shore he said never mind shipmate we allus expecs to lose a boat or two when were out asploring i was silent from shame but martin having hauled me up the rock by help of the broom handle rattled away as if nothing had happenedpointing proudly to a rusteaten triangle with a bell suspended inside of it and his little flag floating on top but oh dear what are we to do now i whimpered dont you worrit about that he said well just signal back to the next basewe call them bases when were out asploring i understood from this that he was going to ring the bell which being heard on the land would bring somebody to our relief but the bell was big only meant to be put in motion on stormy nights by the shock and surging of an angry sea and when martin had tied a string to its tongue it was a feeble sound he struck from it half an hour passed an hour two hours and still i saw nothing on the water but our own empty boat rocking its way back to the shore will they ever come i faltered rather just you wait and youll see them coming and when they take us ashore therell be crowds and crowds with bugles and bands and things to take us home my goodness yes he said with the same wild look hundreds and tons of them but the sun set over the sea behind us the land in front grew dim the moaning tide rose around the quaking rock and even the screaming seafowl deserted us and still there was no sign of relief my heart was quivering through my clothes by this time but martin who had whistled and sung began to talk about being hungry my goodness yes im that hungry i could eat i could eat a dogwe allus eats our dogs when were out asploring this reminded me of the biscuit but putting my hand to the pocket of my frock i found to my dismay that it was gone having fallen out perhaps when i slipped in my climbing my lip fell and i looked up at him with eyes of fear but he only said no matter we never minds a bit of hungry when were out asploring i did not know then what now i know that my little boy who could not learn his lessons and had always been in disgrace was a born gentleman but my throat was thick and my eyes were swimming and to hide my emotion i pretended to be ill i know said martin dizzingtory dysentery we allus has dizzingtory when were out asploring there was one infallible cure for that thoughmilk i allus drinks a drink of milk and away goes the dizzingtory in a jiffy this recalled the bottle but when i twisted it round on my belt hoping to make amends for the lost biscuit i found to my confusion that it had suffered from the same misadventure being cracked in the bottom and every drop of the contents gone that was the last straw and the tears leapt to my eyes but martin went on whistling and singing and ringing the big bell as if nothing had happened the darkness deepened the breath of night came sweeping over the sea the boom of the billows on the rock became still more terrible and i began to shiver the sack cried martin we allus sleeps in sacks when were out asploring i let him do what he liked with me now but when he had packed me up in the sack and put me to lie at the foot of the triangle telling me i was as right as ninepence i began to think of something i had read in a storybook and half choking with sobs i said martin what now shipmate its all my fault and im just as frightened as jimmy christophers sister and nessy macleod and betsy beauty and im not a stunner and youll have to give me up and leave me here and save yourself and but martin stopped me with a shout and a crack of laughter not me not much we never leaves a pal when were out asploring long as we lives we never does it not never that finished me i blubbered like a baby and william rufus who was sitting by my side lifted his nose and joined in my howling what happened next i never rightly knew i was only aware though my back was to him that martin impatient of his string had leapt up to the bell and was swinging his little body from the tongue to make a louder clamour one loud clang i heard and then came a crash and a crack and then silence what is it i cried but at first there was no answer have you hurt yourself and then through the thunderous boom of the rising sea on the rock came the breaking voice of my boy he had broken his right arm mingled with the sobs which his unconquered and unconquerable little soul was struggling to suppress we never minds a bit of hurt we never minds nothing when were out asploring meantime on shore there was a great commotion my father was railing at aunt bridget who was upbraiding my mother who was crying for father dan who was flying off for doctor conrad who was putting his horse into his gig and scouring the parish in search of the two lost children but tommy the mate who remembered the conversation in the pottingshed and thought he heard the tinkle of a bell at sea hurried off to the shore where he found his boat bobbing on the beach and thereby came to his own conclusions by the light of a lantern he pulled out to st marys rock and there guided by the howling of the dog he came upon the great little explorers hardly more than three feet above high water lying together in the corn sack locked in each others arms and fast asleep there were no crowds and bands of music waiting for us when tommy brought us ashore and after leaving martin with his broken limb in his mothers arms at the gate of sunny lodge he took me over to the presbytery in order that father dan might carry me home and so stand between me and my fathers wrath and aunt bridgets birch unhappily there was no need for this precaution the big house when we reached it was in great confusion my mother had broken a blood vessel tenth chapter during the fortnight in which my mother was confined to bed i was her constant companion and attendant with the mighty eagerness of a child who knew nothing of what the solemn time foreboded i flew about the house on tiptoe fetching my mothers medicine and her milk and the ice to cool it and always praising myself for my industry and thinking i was quite indispensable you couldnt do without your little mally could you mammy i would say and my mother would smooth my hair lovingly with her thin white hand and answer no indeed i couldnt do without my little mally and then my little birdlike beak would rise proudly in the air all this time i saw nothing of martin and only heard through doctor conrad in his conversations with my mother that the boys broken arm had been set and that as soon as it was better he was to be sent to king georges college which was at the other end of ellan what was to be done with myself i never inquired being so satisfied that my mother could not get on without me i was partly aware that big letters bearing foreign postagestamps and seals and coats of arms with pictures of crosses and hearts were coming to our house i was also aware that at intervals while my mother was in bed there was the sound of voices as if in eager and sometimes heated conference in the room below and that my mother would raise her pale face from her pillow and stop my chattering with hush when my fathers voice was louder and sterner than usual but it never occurred to me to connect these incidents with myself until the afternoon of the day on which my mother got up for the first time she was sitting before the fire for autumn was stealing on and i was bustling about her fixing the rug about her knees and telling her if she wanted anything she was to be sure and call her little mally when a timid knock came to the door and father dan entered the room i can see his fair head and short figure still and hear his soft irish voice as he stepped forward and said now dont worry my daughter above all dont worry by long experience my mother knew this for a sign of the dear fathers own perturbation and i saw her lower lip tremble as she asked hadnt mary better run down to the garden no oh no said father dan it is about mary i come to speak so our little pet may as well remain then at a signal from my mother i went over to her and stood by her side and she embraced my waist with a trembling arm while the father took a seat by her side and fumbling the little silver cross on his chain delivered his message after long and anxious thoughtand he might say prayerit had been decided that i should be sent away to a convent it was to be a convent of the sacred heart in rome he was to take me to rome himself and see me safely settled there and they meaning my father and aunt bridget had promised himfaithfully promised himthat when the holidays came round he should be sent to bring me home again so there was nothing to fear nothing to worry about nothing to to my mother listened as long as she could and thenher beautiful white face distorted by painshe broke in on the fathers message with a cry of protest but she is so young such a child only seven years old how can any one think of sending such a little one away from home father dan tried to pacify her it was true i was very young but then the reverend mother was such a good woman she would love me and care for me as if i were her own child and then the good nuns god bless their holy souls but mary is all i have cried my mother and if they take her away from me i shall be brokenhearted at such a time too how cruel they are they know quite well what the doctor says cant they wait a little longer i could see that father dan was arguing against himself for his eyes filled as he said its hard i know its hard for you my daughter but perhaps its best for the child that she should go away from homeperhaps its all gods blessed and holy will remember theres a certain person here who isnt kind to our little innocent and is making her a cause of trouble not that i think she is actuated by evil intentions but she is she is cried my mother who was growing more and more excited then all the more reason why mary should go to the conventfor a time at all events my mother began to waver and she said let her be sent to a convent in the island then i thought of that but there isnt one said father dan then then then take her to the presbytery said my mother dear dear father she pleaded let her live with you and have somebody to teach her and then she can come to see me every day or twice a week or even once a weeki am not unreasonable it would be beautiful said father dan reaching over to touch my arm to have our little mary in my dull old house would be like having the sun there always but there are reasons why a young girl should not be brought up in the home of a priest so it is better that our little precious should go to rome my mother was breaking down and father dan followed up his advantage then wisha my daughter think what a good thing it will be for the child she will be one of the children of the infant jesus first then a child of mary and then of the sacred heart itself and then remember rome the holy city the city of the holy father why who knows she may even see himself some day yes yes i know said my mother and then turning with her melting eyes to me she said would my mary like to goleaving her mamma but coming home in the holidayswould she i was going to say i would not because mamma could not possibly get on without me but before i could reply aunt bridget with her bunch of keys at her waist came jingling into the room and catching my mothers last words said in her harsh highpitched voice isabel you astonish me to defer to the will of a child such a child too so stubborn and spoiled and selfwilled if we say it is good for her to go she must go i could feel through my mothers arm which was still about my waist that she was trembling from head to foot but at first she did not speak and aunt bridget in her peremptory way went on we say it is good for you too isabel if she is not to hasten your death by preying on your nerves and causing you to break more blood vessels so we are consulting your welfare as well as the girls in sending her away my mothers timid soul could bear no more i think it must have been the only moment of anger her gentle spirit ever knew but gathering all her strength she turned upon aunt bridget in ungovernable excitement bridget she said you are doing nothing of the kind you know you are not you are only trying to separate me from my child and my child from me when you came to my house i thought you would be kinder to my child than a anybody else but you have not been you have been cruel to her and shut your heart against her and while i have been helpless here and in bed you have never shown her one moment of love and kindness no you have no feeling except for your own and it never occurs to you that having brought your own child into my house you are trying to turn my child out of it so thats how you look at it is it said aunt bridget with a flash of her cold grey eyes i thought i came to this houseyour house as you call itonly out of the best intentions just to spare you trouble when you were ill and unable to attend to your duties as a wife but because i correct your child when she is wilful and sly and wicked correct your own child bridget oneill cried my mother and leave mine to me shes all i have and it isnt long i shall have her you know quite well how much she has cost me and that i havent had a very happy married life but instead of helping me with her father say no more said aunt bridget we dont want you to hurt yourself again and to allow this illconditioned child to be the cause of another hemorrhage bridget oneill cried my mother rising up from her chair you are a hardhearted woman with a bad disposition you know as well as i do that it wasnt mary who made me ill but youyou who reproached me and taunted me about my child until my heart itself had to bleed for seven years you have been doing that and now you are disposing of my darling over my head without consulting me has a mother no rights in her own childthe child she has suffered for and loved and lived forthat other people who care nothing for it should take it away from her and send it into a foreign country where she may never see it again but you shall not do that no you shall not as long as theres breath in my body you shall not do it and if you attempt in her wild excitement my mother had lifted one of her trembling hands into aunt bridgets face while the other was still clasped about me when suddenly with a look of fear on her face she stopped speaking she had heard a heavy step on the stairs it was my father he entered the room with his knotty forehead more compressed than usual and said whats this she shall not do my mother dropped back into her seat in silence and aunt bridget wiping her eyes on her black apronshe only wept when my father was presentproceeded to explain it seems i am a hardhearted woman with a bad disposition and though ive been up early and late and made myself a servant for seven years im only in this house to turn my sisters child out of it it seems too that we have no businessnone of us haveto say what ought to be done for this girlher mother being the only person who has any rights in the child and if we attempt whats that in his anger and impatience my father could listen no longer and in his loud voice he said since when has a father lost control of his own daughter he has to provide for her hasnt he if she wants anything its to him she has to look for it isnt it thats the law i guess eh always has been all the world over then whats all this hustling about my mother made a feeble effort to answer him i was only saying daniel you were saying something foolish and stupid i reckon a man can do what he likes with his own cant he if this girl is my child and i say she is to go somewhere she is to go and saying this my father brought down his thick hand with a thump on to a table it was the first time he had laid claim to me and perhaps that acted on my mother as she said submissively very well dear you know best what is best for mary and if you sayyou and bridget and and father dan i do say and thats enough so just go to work and fix up this convent scheme without future notice and hark here let me see for the future if a man cant have peace from these twocent trifles for his important business my mother was crushed her lips moved again but she said nothing aloud and my father turned on his heel and left the room shaking the floor at every step under the weight of his sixteen stone at the next moment aunt bridget jingling her keys went tripping after him hardly had they gone when my mother broke into a long fit of coughing and when it was over she lay back exhausted with her white face and her tired eyes turned upwards then i clasped her about the neck and father dan whose cheeks were wet with tears patted her drooping hand my darling mother never once have i thought of her without the greatest affection but now that i know for myself what she must have suffered i love best to think of her as she was that daymy sweet beautiful timid angelstanding up for one brief moment not only against aunt bridget but against the cruelty of all the ages in the divine right of her outraged motherhood eleventh chapter my mothers submission was complete within twentyfour hours she was busy preparing clothes for my journey to rome the old coloured pattern book was brought out again material was sent for a sewingmaid was engaged from the village and above all in my view an order was dispatched to blackwater for a small squirrelskin scarf a large squirrelskin muff and a closefitting squirrelskin hat with a feather on the side of it a childs heart is a running brook and it would wrong the truth to say that i grieved much in the midst of these busy preparations on the contrary i felt a sort of pride in them poor innocent that i was as in something that gave me a certain high superiority over betsy beauty and nessy macleod and entitled me to treat them with condescension father dan who came more frequently than ever fostered this feeling without intending to do so by telling me whenever we were alone that i must be a good girl to everybody now and especially to my mother my little woman would be sorry to worry mamma wouldnt she he would whisper and when i answered that i would be sorrier than sorry he would say wisha then she must be brave she must keep up she must not grieve about going away or cry when the time comes for parting i said yes and yes to all this feeling very confidential and courageous but i dare say the good father gave the same counsel to my mother also for she and i had many games of makebelieve i remember in which we laughed and chattered and sang though i do not think i ever suspected that the part we played was easier to me than to her it dawned on me at last though when in the middle of the night near to the time of my going away i was awakened by a bad fit of my mothers coughing and heard her say to herself in the deep breathing that followed my poor child what is to become of her nevertheless all went well down to the day of my departure it had been arranged that i was to sail to liverpool by the first of the two daily steamers and without any awakening i leapt out of bed at the first sign of daylight so great was my delight that i began to dance in my nightdress to an invisible skipping rope forgetting my father who always rose at dawn and was at breakfast in the room below my mother and i breakfasted in bed and then there was great commotion it chiefly consisted for me in putting on my new clothes including my furs and then turning round and round on tiptoe and smiling at myself in a mirror i was doing this while my mother was telling me to write to her as often as i was allowed and while she knelt at her prayer stool which she used as a desk to make a copy of the address for my letters then i noticed that the first line of her superscription mrs daniel oneill was blurred by the tears that were dropping from her eyes and my throat began to hurt me dreadfully but i remembered what father dan had told me to do so i said never mind mammy dont worryill be home for the holidays soon afterwards we heard the carriage wheels passing under the window and then father dan came up in a white knitted muffler and with a funny bag which he used for his surplice at funerals and said through a little cloud of white breath that everything was ready i saw that my mother was turning round and taking out her pockethandkerchief and i was snuffling a little myself but at a sign from father dan who was standing at the threshold i squeezed back the water in my eyes and cried goodbye mammy ill be back for christmas and then darted across to the door i was just passing through it when i heard my mother say mary in a strange low voice and i turned and saw heri can see her stillwith her beautiful pale face all broken up and her arms held out to me then i rushed back to her and she clasped me to her breast crying mally veen my mally veen and i could feel her heart beating through her dress and hear the husky rattle in her throat and then all our poor little game of makebelieve broke down utterly at the next moment my father was calling upstairs that i should be late for the steamer so my mother dried her own eyes and then mine and let me go father dan was gone when i reached the head of the stairs but seeing nessy macleod and betsy beauty at the bottom of them i soon recovered my composure and sailing down in my finery i passed them in stately silence with my little birdlike head in the air i intended to do the same with aunt bridget who was standing with a shawl over her shoulders by the open door but she touched me and said arent you going to kiss me goodbye then no i answered drawing my little body to its utmost height and why not because youve been unkind to mamma and cruel to me and because you think theres nobody but betsy beauty and ill tell them at the convent that you are making mamma ill and youre as bad as as bad as the bad women in the bible my gracious said aunt bridget and she tried to laugh but i could see that her face became as white as a whitewashed wall this did not trouble me in the least until i reached the carriage when father dan who was sitting inside said my little mary wont leave home like thatwithout kissing her aunt and saying goodbye to her cousins so i returned and shook hands with nessy macleod and betsy beauty and lifted my little face to my aunt bridget thats better she said after she had kissed me but when i had passed her my quick little ear caught the words good thing shes going though during this time my father with the morning mist playing like hoarfrost about his irongrey hair had been tramping the gravel and saying the horses were getting cold so without more ado he bundled me into the carriage and banged the door on me but hardly had we started when father dan who was blinking his little eyes and pretending to blow his nose on his coloured print handkerchief said look and pointed up to my mothers room there she was again waving and kissing her hand to me through her open window and she continued to do so until we swirled round some trees and i lost the sight of her what happened in my mothers room when her window was closed i do not know but i well remember that creeping into a corner of the carriage i forgot all about the glory and grandeur of going away and that it did not help me to remember when half way down the drive a boy with a dog darted from under the chestnuts and raced alongside of us it was martin and though his right arm was in a sling he leapt up to the step and held on to the open window by his left hand while he pushed his head into the carriage and made signs to me to take out of his mouth a big red apple which he held in his teeth by the stalk i took it and then he dropped to the ground without uttering a word and i could laugh now to think of the gruesome expression of his face with its lagging lower lip and bloodshot eyes i had no temptation to do so then however and least of all when i looked back and saw his little onearmed figure in the big mushroom hat standing on the top of the high wall of the bridge with william rufus beside him we reached blackwater in good tithe for the boat and when the funnels had ceased trumpeting and we were well away i saw that we were sitting in one of two private cabins on the upper deck and then father dan told me that the other was occupied by the young lord raa and his guardian and that they were going up together for the first time to oxford i am sure this did not interest me in the least at that moment so false is it that fate forewarns us when momentous events are about to occur and now that i had time to think a dreadful truth was beginning to dawn on me so that when father dan who was much excited went off to pay his respects to the great people i crudled up in the corner of the cabin that was nearest to the door and told myself that after all i had been turned out of my fathers house and would never see my mother and martin any more i was sitting so with my hands in my big muff and my face to the stern making the tiniest occasional sniff as the mountains of my home faded away in the sunlight which was now tipping the hilltops with a feathery crest when my cabin was darkened by somebody who stood in the doorway it was a tail boy almost a man and i knew in a moment who he was he was the young lord raa and at first i thought how handsome and well dressed he was as he looked down at me and smiled after a moment he stepped into the cabin and sat in front of me and said so you are little mary oneill are you i did not speak i was thinking he was not so very handsome after all having two big front teeth like betsy beauty the girl who ought to have been a boy and put my nose out eh still i did not speak i was thinking his voice was like nessy macleodsshrill and harsh and grating poor little mite going all the way to rome to a convent isnt she even yet i did not speak i was thinking his eyes were like aunt bridgetscold and grey and piercing so silent and demure though quite a little nun already a deuced pretty one too if anybody asks me i was beginning to have a great contempt for him where did you get those big angel eyes from stole them from some picture of the madonna ill swear by this time i had concluded that he was not worth speaking to so i turned my head and i was looking back at the sea when i heard him say i suppose you are going to give me a kiss you nice little woman arent you no oh but you mustwe are relations you know i wont he laughed at that and rising from his seat he reached over to kiss me whereupon i drew one of my hands out of my muff and doubling my little mittened fist i struck him in the face being as i afterwards learned a young autocrat much indulged by servants and generally tyrannising over them he was surprised and angry the spitfire he said who would have believed it the face of a nun and the temper of a devil but youll have to make amends for this my lady with that he went away and i saw no more of him until the steamer was drawing up at the landing stage at liverpool and then while the passengers were gathering up their luggage he came back with father dan and the tall sallow man who was his guardian and said going to give me that kiss to make amends or are you to owe me a grudge for the rest of your life my lady my little mary couldnt owe a grudge to anybody said father dan shell kiss his lordship and make amends im certain and then i did to the young lord raa what i had done to aunt bridgeti held up my face and he kissed me it was a little simple trivial incident but it led with other things to the most lamentable fact of my life and when i think of it i sometimes wonder how it comes to pass that he who numbers the flowers of the field and counts the sparrows as they fall has no handwriting with which to warn his children that their footsteps may not fail twelfth chapter of our journey to rome nothing remains to me but the memory of sleeping in different beds in different towns of trains screaming through tunnels and slowing down in glassroofed railway stations of endless crowds of people moving here and there in a sort of maze nothing but this and the sense of being very little and very helpless and of having to be careful not to lose sight of father dan for fear of being lostuntil the afternoon of the fourth day after we left home we were then crossing a wide rolling plain that was almost destitute of trees and looked from the moving train like green billows of the sea with grass growing over them father dan was reading his breviary for the following day not knowing what he would have to do in it when the sun set in a great blaze of red beyond the horizon and then suddenly a big round black ball like a captive balloon seemed to rise in the midst of the glory i called father dans attention to this and in a moment he was fearfully excited dont worry my child he cried while tears of joy sprang to his eyes do you know what that is thats the dome of st peters rome my child rome it was nine oclock when we arrived at our destination and in the midst of a great confusion i walked by father dans side and held on to his vertical pocket while he carried his own bag and a basket of mine down the crowded platform to an open cab outside the station then father dan wiped his forehead with his print handkerchief and i sat close up to him and the driver cracked his long whip and shouted at the pedestrians while we rattled on and on over stony streets which seemed to be full of statues and fountains that were lit up by a great white light that was not moonlight and yet looked like it but at last we stopped at a little door of a big house which seemed to stand with a church beside it on a high shelf overlooking the city for i could see many domes like that of st peter lying below us a grill in the little door was first opened and then a lady in a black habit with a black band round her forehead and white bands down each side of her face opened the door itself and asked us to step in and when we had done so she took us down a long passage into a warm room where another lady dressed in the same way only a little grander sat in a big red armchair father dan who was still wearing his knitted muffler bowed very low to this lady calling her the reverend mother magdalene and she answered him in english but with a funny sound which i afterwards knew to be a foreign accent i remember that i thought she was very beautiful nearly as beautiful as my mother and when father dan told me to kiss her hand i did so and then she put me to sit in a chair and looked at me what is her age she asked whereupon father dan said he thought i would be eight that month which was right being october small isnt she said the lady and then father dan said something about poor mamma which i cannot remember after that they talked about other things and i looked at the pictures on the wallspictures of saints and popes and above all a picture of jesus with his heart open in his bosom the child will be hungry said the lady she must have something to eat before she goes to bedthe other children have gone already then she rang a handbell and when the first lady came back she said ask sister angela to come to me immediately a few minutes later sister angela came into the room and she was quite young almost a girl with such a sweet sad face that i loved her instantly this is little mary oneill take her to the refectory and give her whatever she wants and dont leave her until she is quiet and comfortable very well mother said sister angela and taking my hand she whispered come mary you look tired i rose to go with her but at the same moment father dan rose too and i heard him say he must lose no time in finding an hotel for his bishop had given him only one day to remain in rome and he had to catch an early train home the following morning this fell on me like a thunderbolt i hardly know what i had led myself to expect but certainly the idea of being left alone in rome had never once occurred to me my little heart was fluttering and dropping the sisters hand i stepped back and took father dans and said you are not going to leave your little mary are you father it was harder for the dear father than for me for i remember that fearfully flurried he stammered in a thick voice something about the reverend mother taking good care of me and how he was sure to come back at christmas according to my fathers faithful promise to take me home for the holidays after that sister angela led me sniffing a little still to the refectory which was a large echoing room with rows of plain deal tables and forms ranged in front of a reading desk that had another and much larger picture of the sacred heart on the wall above it only one gasjet was burning and i sat under it to eat my supper and after i had taken a basin of soup i felt more comforted then sister angela lit a lamp and taking my hand she led me up a stone staircase to the dormitory which was a similar room but not so silent because it was full of beds and the breathing of the girls who were all asleep made it sound like the watchmakers shop in our village only more churchlike and solemn my bed was near to the door and after sister angela had helped me to undress and tucked me in she made her voice very low and said i would be quite comfortable now and she was sure i was going to be a good little girl and a dear child of the infant jesus and then i could not help taking my arms out again and clasping her round the neck and drawing her head down and kissing her after that she took the lamp and went away to a cubicle which was partitioned off the end of the dormitory and there i could see her prepare to go to bed herselftaking the white bands off her cheeks and the black band off her forehead and letting her long light hair fall in beautiful wavy masses about her face which made her look so sweet and home like but oh i was so lonely never in my life sinceno not even when i was in my lowest depthshave i felt so little and helpless and alone after the sister had gone to bed and everything was quiet in the dormitory save for the breathing of the girlsall strangers to me and i to themfrom mere loneliness i covered up my head in the clothes just as i used to do when i was a little thing and my father came into my mothers room i try not to think bitterly of my father but even yet i am at a loss to know how he could have cast me away so lightly was it merely that he wanted peace for his business and saw no chance of securing it in his own home except by removing the chief cause of aunt bridgets jealousy or was it that his old grudge against fate for making me a girl made him wish to rid himself of the sight of me i do not know i cannot say but in either case i try in vain to see how he could have thought he had a right caring nothing for me to tear me from the mother who loved me and had paid for me so dear or how he could have believed that because he was my father charged with the care of my poor little body he had control over the little bleeding heart which was not his to make to suffer he is my fathergod help me to think the best of him thirteenth chapter at half past six in the morning i was awakened by the loud ringing of the gettingup bell and as soon as i could rouse myself from the deep sleep of childhood i saw that a middleaged nun with a severe face was saying a prayer and that all the girls in the dormitory were kneeling in their beds while they made the responses a few minutes later when the girls were chattering and laughing as they dressed making the room tingle with twittering sounds like a tree full of linnets in the spring a big girl came up to me and said i am mildred bankes and sister angela says i am to look after you today she was about fifteen years of age and had a long plainfeatured face which reminded me of one of my fathers horses that was badly used by the farm boys but there was something sweet in her smile that made me like her instantly she helped me to dress in my brown velvet frock but said that one of her first duties would be to take me to the lay sisters who made the black habits which all the girls in the convent wore it was still so early that the darkness of the room was just broken by pale shafts of light from the windows but i could see that the children of my own age were only seven or eight altogether while the majority of the girls were several years older and mildred explained this by telling me that the children of the infant jesus like myself were so few that they had been put into the dormitory of the children of the sacred heart in a quarter of an hour everybody was washed and dressed and then at a word from sister angela the girls went leaping and laughing downstairs to the meeting room which was a large hail with a platform at the farther end of it and another picture of the sacred heart pierced with sharp thorns on the wall the reverend mother was there with the other nuns of the convent all palefaced and slow eyed women wearing rosaries and she said a long prayer to which the scholars there were seventy or eighty altogether made responses and then there was silence for five minutes which were supposed to be devoted to meditation although i could not help seeing that some of the big girls were whispering to each other while their heads were down after that and mass in the church we went scurrying away to the refectory which was now warm with the steam from our breakfast and bubbling with cheerful voices making a noise that was like water boiling in a saucepan i was so absorbed by all i saw that i forgot to eat until mildred nudged me to do so and even when my spoon was half way to my mouth something happened which brought it down again at the tinkle of a handbell one of the big girls had stepped up to the readingdesk and begun to read from a book which i afterwards knew to be the imitation of christ she was about sixteen years of age and her face was so vivid that i could not take my eyes off it her complexion was fair and her hair was auburn but her eyes were so dark and searching that when she raised her head as she often did they seemed to look through and through you who is she i whispered alma lier mildred whispered back and when breakfast was over and we were trooping off to lessons she told me something about her alma was an american her father was very rich and his home was in new york but her mother lived in paris though she was staying at an hotel in rome at present and sometimes she came in a carriage to take her daughter for a drive alma was the cleverest girl in the school too and sometimes at the end of terms when parents and friends came to the convent and one of the cardinals distributed the prizes she had so many books to take away that she could hardly carry them down from the platform i listened to this with admiring awe thinking alma the most wonderful and worshipful of all creatures and when i remember it now after all these years and the bitter experiences which have come with them i hardly know whether to laugh or cry at the thought that such was the impression she first made on me my class was with the youngest of the children and sister angela was my teacher she was so sweet to me that her encouragement was like a kiss and her reproof like a caress but i could think of nothing but alma and at noon when the bell rang for lunch and mildred took me back to the refectory i wondered if the same girl would read again she did but this time in a foreign language french as mildred whisperedfrom the letters of the blessed margaret mary alacoqueand my admiration for alma went up tenfold i wondered if it could possibly occur that i should ever come to know her there is no worship like that of a child and life for me which had seemed so cold and dark the day before became warm and bright with a new splendour i was impatient of everything that took me away from the opportunity of meeting with almathe visit to the laysisters to be measured for my new black clothes the three oclock rosary when the nuns walked with their classes in the sunshine and above all the voluntary visit to the blessed sacrament in the church of the convent which seemed to me large and gorgeous though divided across the middle by an open bronze screen called a cancellothe inner half as mildred whispered being for the inmates of the school while the outer half was for the congregation which came on sunday to benediction but at four oclock we had dinner when alma read againthis time in italianfrom the writings of saint francis of salesand then to my infinite delight came a long recreation when all the girls scampered out into the convent garden which was still bright with afternoon sunshine and as merry with laughter and shouts as the seashore on a windy summer morning the garden was a large bare enclosure bounded on two sides by the convent buildings and on the other two by a yellow wall and an avenue made by a line of stone pines with heads like open umbrellas but it had no other foliage except an old tree which reminded me of tommy the mate having gnarled and sprawling limbs and standing like a weatherbeaten old sailor foursquare in the middle a number of the girls were singing and dancing around this tree and i felt so happy just then that i should have loved to join them but i was consumed by a desire to come to close quarters with the object of my devotion so i looked eagerly about me and asked mildred if alma was likely to be there sure to be said mildred and hardly were the words out of her mouth when alma herself came straight down in our direction surrounded by a group of admiring girls who were hanging on to her and laughing at everything she said my heart began to thump and without knowing what i was doing i stopped dead short while mildred went on a pace or two ahead of me then i noticed that alma had stopped too and that her great searching eyes were looking down at me in my nervousness i tried to smile but alma continued to stare and at length in the tone of one who had accidentally turned up something with her toe that was little and ridiculous she said goodness girls whats this then she burst into a fit of laughter in which the other girls joined and looking me up and down they all laughed together i knew what they were laughing atthe clothes my mother had made for me and i had felt so proud of that burnt me like iron and i think my lip must have dropped but alma showed no mercy dare say the little doll thinks herself pretty though she said and then she passed on and the girls with her and as they went off they looked back over their shoulders and laughed again never since has any human creaturenot even alma herselfmade me suffer more than i suffered at that moment my throat felt tight tears leapt to my eyes disappointment humiliation and shame swept over me like a flood and i stood squeezing my little handkerchief in my hand and feeling as if i could have died at the next moment mildred stepped back to me and putting her arm about my waist she said never mind mary shes a heartless thing dont have anything to do with her but all the sunshine had gone out of the day for me now and i cried for hours i was still crying silently but bitterly when at eight oclock we were saying the night prayers and i saw alma who was in the opposite benches whispering to one of the girls who sat next to her and then looking straight across at me and at nine oclock when we went to bed i was crying more than ever so that after the goodnightbell had been rung and the lights had been put down sister angela not knowing the cause of my sorrow stepped up to my bed before going down stairs for her own studies and whispered you mustnt fret for home mary you will soon get used to it but hardly had i been left alone with the dull pain i could find no ease for when somebody touched me on the shoulder and looking up i saw a girl in her nightdress standing beside me it was alma and she said say little girl is your name oneill trembling with nervousness i answered that it was do you belong to the oneills of ellan still trembling i told her that i did my she said in quite another tone and then i saw that by some means i had begun to look different in her eyes after a moment she sat on the side of my bed and asked questions about my homeif it was not large and very old with big stone staircases and great open fireplaces and broad terraces and beautiful walks going down to the sea i was so filled with the joy of finding myself looking grand in almas eyes that i answered yes and yes without thinking too closely about her questions and my tears were all brushed away when she said i knew somebody who lived in your house once and ill tell her all about you she stayed a few moments longer and when going off she whispered hope you dont feel badly about my laughing in the garden today i didnt mean a thing but if any of the girls laugh again just say youre alma liers friend and shes going to take care of you i could hardly believe my ears some great new splendour had suddenly dawned upon me and i was very happy i did not know then that the house which alma had been talking of was not my fathers house but castle raa i did not know then that the person who had lived there was her mother and that in her comely and reckless youth she had been something to the bad lord raa who had lashed my father and sworn at my grandmother i did not know anything that was dead and buried in the past or shrouded and veiled in the future i only knew that alma had called herself my friend and promised to take care of me so with a glad heart i went to sleep fourteenth chapter alma kept her word though perhaps her method of protection was such as would have commended itself only to the heart of a child it consisted in calling me margaret mary after our patron saint of the sacred heart in taking me round the garden during recreation as if i had been a pet poodle and above all in making my bed the scene of the conversaziones which some of the girls held at night when they were supposed to be asleep the secrecy of these gatherings flattered me and when the unclouded moon in the depths of the deep blue italian sky looked in on my group of girls in their nightdresses bunched together on my bed with my own little body between i had a feeling of dignity as well as solemnity and awe of course alma was the chief spokeswoman at these whispered conferences sometimes she told us of her drives into the borghese gardens where she saw the king and queen or to the hunt on the campagna where she met the flower of the aristocracy or to the pincio where the municipal band played in the pavilion while ladies sat in their carriages in the sunshine and officers in blue cloaks saluted them and smiled sometimes she indicated her intentions for the future which was certainly not to be devoted to retreats and novenas or to witness another black dress as long as she lived and if she married which was uncertain it was not to be to an american but to a frenchman because frenchmen had family and blood or perhaps to an englishman if he was a member of the house of lords in which case she would attend all the racemeetings and coronations and take tea at the carlton where she would eat meringues glaces every day and have as many eclairs as she liked and sometimes she would tell us the stories of the novels which she bribed one of the washingwomen to smuggle into the conventstories of ladies and their lovers and of intoxicating dreams of kissing and fondling at which the bigger girls with faroff suggestions of sexual mysteries still unexplored would laugh and shudder and then alma would say but hush girls margaret mary will be shocked occasionally these conferences would be interrupted by mildreds voice from the other end of the dormitory where she would raise her head from her pillow and say alma lier you ought to be ashamed of yourselfkeeping that child up when she ought to be asleep instead of listening to your wicked stories helloa mother mildred is that you alma would answer and then the girls would laugh and mildred was supposed to be covered with confusion one night sister angelas footsteps were heard on the stairs and then the girls flew back to their beds where with the furtive instinct of their age and sex they pretended to be sleeping soundly when the sister entered the room but the sister was not deceived and walking up the aisle between the beds she said in an angry tone alma lier if this ever occurs again ill step down to the reverend mother and tell her all about you little as i was i saw that between alma and sister angela there was a secret feud which must soon break into open rupture but for my own part i was entirely happy being still proud of almas protection and only feeling any misgivings when mildreds melancholy eyes were looking at me thus week followed week until we were close upon christmas and the girls who were to be permitted to go home before the feast began to count the days to the holidays i counted them too and when anybody talked of her brother i thought of martin conrad though his faithful little figure was fading away from me and when anybody spoke of her parents i remembered my mother for whom my affection never failed but within a week from the time for breaking up the reverend mother sent for me and with a sinking heart i went to her room knowing well what she was going to say you are not to go home for the holidays this time my child you are to remain here and sister angela is to stay to take care of you she had a letter from father dan telling her that my mother was still unwell and for this and other reasons it was considered best that i should not return at christmas father dan had written a letter to me also beginning my dear daughter in jesus and ending yours in xt saying it was not his fault that he could not fulfil his promise but my father was much from home nowadays and aunt bridget was more difficult than ever so perhaps i should be happier at the convent it was a bitter blow though the bitterest part of it lay in the fear that the girls would think i was of so little importance to my people that they did not care to see me but the girls were too eager about their own concerns to care much about me and even on the very last day and at the very last moment when everything was bustle and joy and boxes were being carried downstairs and everybody was kissing everybody else and wishing each other a happy christmas and then flying away like mad things and i alone was being left alma herself before she stepped into a carriage in which a stout lady wearing furs was waiting to receive her only said byby margaret mary take care of sister angela next day the reverend mother went off to her cottage at nemi and the other nuns and novices to their friends in the country and then sister angela and i were alone in the big empty echoing conventsave for two elderly lay sisters who cooked and cleaned for us and the chaplain who lived by himself in a little white hut like a cell which stood at the farthest corner of the garden we moved our quarters to a room in the front of the house so as to look out over the city and down into the piazza which was full of traffic and after a while we had many cheerful hours together during the days before christmas we spent our mornings in visiting the churches and basilicas where there were little illuminated models of the nativity with the virgin and the infant jesus in the stable among the straw the afternoons we spent at home in the garden where the chaplain in his black soutane and biretta was always sitting under the old tree reading his breviary his name was father giovanni and he was a tall young man with a long thin pale face and when sister angela first took me up to him she said this is our margaret mary then his sad face broke into warm sunshine and he stroked my head and sent me away to skip with my skippingrope while he and sister angela sat together under the tree and afterwards walked to and fro in the avenue between the stone pines and the wall until they came to his cell in the corner where she craned her neck at the open door as if she would have liked to go in and make things more tidy and comfortable on christmas day we had currant cake in honour of the feast and sister angela asked father giovanni to come to tea and he came and was quite cheerful so that when the sister who was also very happy signalled to me to take some mistletoe from the bottom of a picture i held it over his head and kissed him from behind then he snatched me up in his arms and kissed me back and we had a great romp round the chairs and tables but the ave maria began to ring from the churches and father giovanni according to the rule of our convent having to go he kissed me again and then i said why dont you kiss sister angela too at that they only looked at each other and laughed but after a moment he kissed her hand and then she went downstairs to see him out into the garden when she came back her eyes were sparkling and her cheeks were flushed and that night when she took away her black and white whimple and gorget on going to bed she stood before a lookingglass and wound her beautiful light hair round her finger and curled it over her forehead in the way it was worn by the ladies we saw in the streets i think it was two nights later that she told me i was to go to bed early because father giovanni was not well and she would have to go over to see him she went and i got into bed but i could not sleep and while i lay waiting for sister angela i listened to some men who as they crossed the piazza were singing in tremulous voices to their mandolines and guitars what i believed to be love songs for i had begun to learn italian oh bella napoli oh suol beato onde soiridere volta il creato it was late when sister angela came back and then she was breathing hard as if she had been running i asked if father giovannis sickness was worse and she said no it was better and i was to say nothing about it but she could not rest and at last she said didnt we forget to say our prayers mary so i got up again and sister angela said one of the beautiful prayers out of our prayerbook but her voice was very low and when she came to the words o father of all mankind forgive all sinners who repent of their sins she broke down altogether i thought she was ill but she said it was only a cold she had caught in crossing the garden and i was to go to sleep like a good girl and think no more about her but in the middle of the night i awoke and sister angela was crying fifteenth chapter most of the girls were depressed when they returned to school but alma was in high spirits and on the first night of the term she crept over to my bed and asked what we had been doing during the holidays not a thing eh i answered that we had done lots of things and been very happy happy in this gloomy old convent you and sister angela alone i told her we had two lay sistersand then there was father giovanni father giovanni that serious old crossbones i said he was not always serious and that on christmas day he had come to tea and kissed me under the mistletoe kissed you under the mistletoe said alma and then she whispered eagerly he didnt kiss sister angela did he i suppose i was flattered by her interest and this loosened my tongue for i answered he kissed her hand though kissed her hand my of course she was very angry wasnt she angry i answered no and in my simplicity i proceeded to prove this by explaining that sister angela had taken father giovanni down to the door and when he was ill she had nursed him nursed him in his own house you mean yes at night too and she stayed until he was better and caught a cold coming back well i never said alma and i remember that i was very pleased with myself during this interview for by the moonlight which was then shining into the room i could see that almas eyes were sparkling the next night we recommenced our conferences in bed when alma told us all about her holiday which she had spent way up in st moritz among deep snow and thick ice skating bobbing lugging and above all riding astride and dragging a man on skis behind her such lots of fun she said and the best of it was at night when there were dances and fancydress balls with company which included all the smart people in europe and men who gave a girl such a good time if she happened to be pretty and was likely to have a dot alma had talked so eagerly and the girls had listened so intently that nobody was aware that sister angela had returned to the room until she stepped forward and said alma lier im ashamed of you go back to your bed miss this very minute the other girls crept away and i half covered my face with my bedclothes but alma stood up to sister angela and answered her back go to bed yourself and dont speak to me like that or youll pay for your presumption pay presumption you insolent thing you are corrupting the whole school and are an utter disgrace to it i warned you that i would tell the reverend mother what you are and now ive a great mind to do it do it i dare you to do it do it tonight and tomorrow morning i will do something what will you do you brazen hussy said sister angela but i could see that her lip was trembling never mind what if im a hussy im not a hypocrite and as for corrupting the school and being a disgrace to it ill leave the reverend mother to say who is doing that low as the light was i could see that sister angela was deadly pale there was a moment of silence in which i thought she glanced in my direction and then stammering something which i did not hear she left the dormitory it was long before she returned and when she did so i saw her creep into her cubicle and sit there for quite a great time before going to bed my heart was thumping hard for i had a vague feeling that i had been partly to blame for what had occurred but after a while i fell asleep and remembered no more until i was awakened in the middle of the night by somebody kissing me in my sleep it was sister angela and she was turning away but i called her back and she knelt by my bed and whispered hush i know what has happened but i dont blame you for it i noticed that she was wearing her outdoor cloak and that she was breathing rapidly just as she did on the night she came from the chaplains quarters and when i asked if she was going anywhere she said yes and if i ever heard anything against sister angela i was to think the best of her but you are so good no i am not good i am very wicked i should never have thought of being a nun but im glad now that im only a novice and have never taken the vows after that she told me to go to sleep and then she kissed me again and i thought she was going to cry but she rose hurriedly and left the room next morning after the gettingup bell had been rung and i had roused myself to full consciousness i found that four or five nuns were standing together near the door of the dormitory talking about something that had happened during the nightsister angela had gone half an hour afterwards when full of this exciting event the girls went bursting down to the meeting room they found the nuns in great agitation over an incident of still deeper gravityfather giovanni also had disappeared a convent school is like a shell on the shore of a creek always rumbling with the rumour of the little sea it lives under and by noon the girls who had been palpitating with curiosity thought they knew everything that had happenedhow at four in the morning father giovanni and sister angela had been seen to come out of the little door which connected the garden with the street how at seven they had entered a clothing emporium in the corso where going in at one door as priest and nun they had come out at another as ordinary civilians how at eight they had taken the first train to civita vecchia arriving in time to catch a steamer sailing at ten and how they were now on their way to england by some mysterious instinct of their sex the girls had gathered with glistening eyes in front of the chaplains deserted quarters where alma leaned against the wall with her insteps crossed and while the others talked she smiled as much as to say i told you so as for me i was utterly wretched and being now quite certain that i was the sole cause of sister angelas misfortune i was sitting under the tree in the middle of the garden when alma surrounded by her usual group of girls came down on me whats this she said margaret mary crying feeling badly for sister angela is she why you little silly you neednt cry for her shes having the time of her life she is at this the girls laughed and shuddered as they used to do when alma told them stories but just at that moment the nun with the stern face she was the mother of the novices came up and said solemnly alma lier the reverend mother wishes to speak to you to me said alma in a tone of surprise but at the next moment she went off jauntily hours passed and alma did not return and nothing occurred until afternoon rosary when the mother of the novices came again and taking me by the hand said come with me my child i knew quite well where we were going to and my lip was trembling when we entered the reverend mothers room for alma was there sitting by the stove and close beside her with an angry look was the stout lady in furs whom i had seen in the carriage at the beginning of the holidays dont be afraid said the reverend mother and drawing me to her side she asked me to tell her what i had told alma about sister angela i repeated our conversation as nearly as i could remember it and more than once alma nodded her head as if in assent but the reverend mothers face grew darker at every word and seeing this i said but if sister angela did anything wrong im sure she was very sorry for when she came back she said her prayers and when she got to father of all mankind forgive all sinners yes yes that will do said the reverend mother and then she handed me back to the mother of the novices telling her to warn me to say nothing to the other children alma did not return to us at dinner or at recreation or at chapel when another chaplain said vespers or even at nine oclock when we went to bed but next morning almost as soon as the mother of the novices had left the dormitory she burst into the room saying im leaving this silly old convent girls mother has brought the carriage and ive only come to gather up my belongings nobody spoke and while she wrapped up her brushes and combs in her nightdress she joked about sister angela and father giovanni and then about mildred bankes whom she called reverend mother mildred saying it would be her turn next then she tipped up her mattress and taking a novel from under it she threw the book on to my bed saying margaret mary will have to be your storyteller now byby girls nobody laughed for the first time almas humour had failed her and when we went downstairs to the meeting room it was with sedate and quiet steps the nuns were all there with their rosaries and crosses looking as calm as if nothing had occurred but the girls were thinking of alma and when after prayers during the five minutes of silence for meditation we heard the wheels of a carriage going off outside we knew what had happenedalma had gone we were rising to go to mass when the reverend mother said children i have a word to say to you you all know that one of our novices has left us you also know that one of our scholars has just gone it is my wish that you should forget both of them and i shall look upon it as an act of disobedience if any girl in the convent ever mentions their names again all that day i was in deep distress and when night coming i took my troubles to bed telling myself i had now lost alma also and it was all my fault somebody put her arms about me in the darkness and whispered mary oneill are you awake it was mildred and i suppose my snuffling answered her for she said you mustnt cry for alma lier she was no friend of yours and it was the best thing that ever happened to you when she was turned out of the convent sixteenth chapter a child lives from hour to hour and almost at the same moment that my heart was made desolate by the loss of my two friends it was quickened to a new interest immediately after the departure of sister angela and alma we were all gathered in the meeting room for our weekly rehearsal of the music of the benedictionthe girls the novices the nuns the reverend mother and a maestro from the popes choir a short fat man who wore a black soutane and a short lace tippet benediction was the only service of our church which i knew being the one my mother loved best and could do most of for herself in the solitude of her invalid room but the form used in the convent differed from that to which i had been accustomed and even the tantum ergo and the o salutaris hostia i could not sing on this occasion a litany was added which i had heard before and then came a hymn of the blessed virgin which i remembered well my mother sang it herself and taught me to sing it so that when the maestro swinging his little ivory baton began in his alto voice ave maris stella dei mater alma i joined in with the rest but sang in english instead of latin of all appeals to the memory that of music is the strongest and after a moment i forgot that i was at school in rome being back in my mothers room in ellan standing by her piano and singing while she played i think i must have let my little voice go just as i used to do at home when it rang up to the wooden rafters for utterly lost to my surroundings i had got as far as virgin of all virgins to thy shelter take us when suddenly i became aware that i alone was singing the children about me being silent and even the maestros baton slowing down then i saw that all eyes were turned in my direction and overwhelmed with confusion i stopped for my voice broke and slittered into silence go on little angel said the maestro but i was trembling all over by this time and could not utter a sound nevertheless the reverend mother said let mary oneill sing the hymn in church in future as soon as i had conquered my nervousness at singing in the presence of the girls i did so singing the first line of each verse alone and i remember to have heard that the congregations on sunday afternoons grew larger and larger until within a few weeks the church was densely crowded perhaps my childish heart was stirred by vanity in all this for i remember that ladies in beautiful dresses would crowd to the bronze screen that separated us from the public and whisper among themselves which is she the little one in the green scarf with the big eyes god bless her but surely it was a good thing that at length life had began to have a certain joy for me for as time went on i became absorbed in the life of the convent and particularly in the services of the church so that home itself began to fade away and when the holidays came round and excuses were received for not sending for me the pain of my disappointment became less and less until at last it disappeared altogether if ever a child loved her mother i did and there were moments when i reproached myself with not thinking of her for a whole day these were the moments when a letter came from father dan telling me she was less well than before and her spark of life had to be coaxed and trimmed or it would splutter out altogether but the effect of such warnings was wiped away when my mother wrote herself saying i was to be happy as she was happy because she knew that though so long separated we should soon be together and the time would not seem long not understanding the deeper meaning that lay behind words like these i was nothing loath to put aside the thought of home until little by little it faded away from me in the distance just as the island itself had done on the day when i sailed out with martin conrad on our great voyage of exploration to st marys rock thus two years and a half passed since i arrived in rome before the great fact befell me which was to wipe all other facts out of my remembrance it was holy week the season of all seasons for devotion to the sacred heart and our convent was palpitating with the joy of its spiritual duties the many offices the masses for the repose of the souls in purgatory the preparations for tenebrae with the chanting of the miserere and for holy saturday and easter day with the singing of the gloria and the return of the alleluia but beyond all this for me were the arrangements for my first confession which coming a little late i made with ten or twelve other girls of my sodality feeling so faint when i took my turn and knelt by the grating and heard the whispering voice within like something from the unseen something supernatural something divine that i forgot all i had come to say and the priest had to prompt me and beyond that again were the arrangements for my first communion which was to take place on easter morning when i was to walk in procession with the other girls dressed all in white behind a gilded figure of the virgin singing ave maris stella through the piazza into the church where one of the cardinals in the presence of the fathers and mothers of the other children was to put the holy wafer on our tongues and we were to know for the first time the joy of communion with our lord but that was not to be for me on the morning of holy wednesday the blow fell the luminous grey of the italian dawn was filtering through the windows of the dormitory like the light in a tomb and a multitude of little birds on the old tree in the garden were making a noise like water falling on small stones in a fountain when the mother of the novices came to my bedside and said you are to go to the reverend mother as soon as possible my child her voice usually severe was so soft that i knew something had happened and when i went downstairs i also knew before the reverend mother had spoken what she was going to say mary she said i am sorry to tell you that your mother is ill i listened intently fearing that worse would follow she is very illvery seriously ill and she wishes to see you therefore you are to go home immediately the tears sprang to my eyes and the reverend mother drew me to her side and laid my head on her breast and comforted me saying my dear mother had lived the life of a good christian and could safely trust in the redeeming blood of our blessed saviour but i thought she must have some knowledge of the conditions of my life at home for she told me that whatever happened i was to come back to her tell your father you wish to come back to me she said and then she explained the arrangements that were being made for my journey i was to travel alone by the paris express which left rome at six oclock that evening the mother of the novices was to put me in a sleeping car and see that the greatest care would be taken of me until i arrived at calais where father donovan was to meet the train and take me home i cried a great deal i remember but everybody in the convent was kind and when of my own choice i returned to the girls at recreation the sinister sense of dignity which by some strange irony of fate comes to all children when the angel of death is hovering over them came to me alsopoor helpless innocentand i felt a certain distinction in my sorrow at five oclock the omnibus of the convent had been brought round to the door and i was seated in one corner of it with the mother of the novices in front of me when mildred bankes came running breathlessly downstairs to say that the reverend mother had given her permission to see me off half an hour later mildred and i were sitting in a compartment of the wagonlit while the mother was talking to the conductor on the platform mildred whose eyes were wet was saying something about herself which seems pitiful enough now in the light of what has happened since she was to leave the convent soon and before i returned to it she would be gone she was poor and an orphan both her parents being dead and if she had her own way she would become a nun in any case our circumstances would be so different our ways of life so far apart that we might never meet again but if before she had finished a bell rang on the platform and a moment or two afterwards the train slid out of the station then for the first time i began to realise the weight of the blow that had fallen on me i was sitting alone in my big compartment we were running into the campagna the heavens were ablaze with the glory of the sunset which was like fields of glistening fire but darkness seemed to have fallen on all the world seventeenth chapter early on good friday i arrived at calais it was a misty rimy clammy morning and a thick fog was lying over the channel almost before the train stopped i saw father dan with his coat collar turned up waiting for me on the platform i could see that he was greatly moved at the sight of me but was trying hard to maintain his composure now dont worry my child dont worry he said it will be all ri but how well you are looking and how you have grown and how glad your poor mother will be to see you i tried to ask how she was is she yes thank god shes alive and while theres life theres hope we travelled straight through without stopping and arrived at blackwater at seven the same evening there we took train for railways were running in ellan now and down the sweet valleys that used to be green with grass and through the little crofts that used to be red with fuchsia there was a long raw welt of upturned earth at the station of our village my fathers carriage was waiting for us and a strange footman shrugged his shoulders in answer to some whispered question of father dans and from that i gathered that my mothers condition was unchanged we reached home at dusk just as somebody was lighting a line of new electric lamps that had been set up in the drive to show the way for the carriage under the chestnuts in which the rooks used to build and caw i knew the turn of the path from which the house could be first seen and i looked for it remembering the last glimpse i had of my mother at her window father dan looked too but for another reasonto see if the blinds were down aunt bridget was in the hall and when father dan who had grown more and more excited as we approached the end of our journey asked how my mother was now poor thing she answered worse distinctly worse past recognising anybody so all this trouble and expense has been wasted as she had barely recognised me i ran upstairs with a timid and quiet step and without waiting to take off my outer clothes made my way to my mothers bedroom i remember the heavy atmosphere of the room as i opened the door i remember the sense i had of its being lower and smaller than i thought i remember the black fourfoot bedstead with the rosary hanging on a brass nail at the pillow end i remember my little cot which still stood in the same place and contained some of the clothes i had worn as a child and even some of the toys i had played with a strange woman in the costume of a nurse turned to look at me as i entered but i did not at first see my mother and when at length i did see her with her eyes closed she looked so white and small as to be almost hidden in the big white bed presently father dan came in followed by doctor conrad and aunt bridget and finally my father who was in his shirt sleeves and had a pen in his ear i remember then father dan who was trembling very much took me by the hand and led me to my mothers side where stooping over her and making his voice very low yet speaking as one who was calling into a long tunnel he said my daughter my daughter here is our little mary she has come home to see you never shall i forget what followed first my mothers long lashes parted and she looked at me with a dazed expression as if still in a sort of dream then her big eyes began to blaze like torches in dark hollows and then though they had thought her strength was gone and her voice would never be heard again she raised herself in her bed stretched out her arms to me and cried in loud strong tones mally veen my mally veen how long i lay with my arms about my mother and my mothers arms about me i do not know i only know that over my head i heard father dan saying as if speaking to a child you are happy now are you not yes yes i am happy now my mother answered you have everything you want everythingeverything then came my fathers voice saying well youve got your girl isabel you wanted her so we sent for her and here she is you have been very good to me daniel said my mother who was kissing my forehead and crying in her joy when i raised my head i found father dan in great excitement did you see that then he was saying to doctor conrad i would have gone on my knees all the way to blackwater to see it i couldnt have believed it possible the doctor replied ah what children we are entirely god confounds all our reckoning we cant count with his miracles and the greatest of all miracles is a mothers love for her child let us leave her now though said the doctor shes like herself again but still yes let us leave them together whispered father dan and having swept everybody out before him i thought aunt bridget went away ashamed he stepped off himself on tiptoe as if treading on holy ground then my mother who was holding my hand and sometimes putting it to her lips said tell me everything that has happened as soon as my little tongue was loosed i told her all about my life at the conventabout the reverend mother and the nuns and the novices and the girls all except sister angela and alma and the singing of the hymn to the virgintalking on and on and on without observing that after a while my mothers eyes had closed again and that her hand had become cold and moist at length she said is it getting dark mary i told her it was night and the lamp was burning is it going out then she asked and when i answered that it was not she did not seem to hear so i stopped talking and for some time there was silence in which i heard nothing but the ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece the barking of a sheep dog a long way off and the husky breathing in my mothers throat i was beginning to be afraid when the nurse returned she was going to speak quite cheerfully but after a glance at my mother she went out quickly and came back in a moment with doctor conrad and father dan i heard the doctor say something about a change whereupon father dan hurried away and in a moment there was much confusion the nurse spoke of taking me to another room but the doctor said no our little woman will be brave and then leading me aside he whispered that god was sending for my mother and i must be quiet and not cry partly undressing i climbed into my cot and lay still for the next half hour while the doctor held his hand on my mothers pulse and the nurse spread a linen cloth over a table and put four or five lighted candles on it i remember that i was thinking that if god sending for my mother meant that she was to be put into a box and buried under the ground it was terrible and cruel and perhaps if i prayed to our lady he would not find it in his heart to do so i was trying to do this beginning under my breath o holy virgin thou art so lovely thou art so gracious when the nurse said here they are back again then i heard footsteps outside and going to the window i saw a sight not unlike that which i had seen on the night of the waits a group of men were coming towards the house with father dan in the middle of them father dan with his coat hung over his arms like a cloak was carrying something white in both hands and the men were carrying torches to light him on his way i knew what it wasit was the blessed sacrament which they were bringing to my mother and when father dan had come into the room saying peace be to this house and laid a little white box on the table and thrown off his coat he was wearing his priests vestments underneath then the whole of my fathers householdall except my father himselfcame into my mothers room including aunt bridget who sat with folded arms in the darkness by the wall and the servants who knelt in a group by the door father dan roused my mother by calling to her again and after she had opened her eyes he began to read sometimes his voice seemed to be choked with sobs as if the heart of the man were suffering and sometimes it pealed out loudly as if the soul of the priest were inspiring him after communion he gave my mother extreme unctionanointing the sweet eyes which had seen no evil the dear lips which had uttered no wrong and the feet which had walked in the ways of god all this time there was a solemn hush in the house like that of a churchno sound within except my fathers measured tread in the room below and none without except the muffled murmur which the sea makes when it is far away and going out when all was over my mother seemed more at ease and after asking for me and being told i was in the cot she said you must all go and rest mary and i will be quite right now a few minutes afterwards my mother and i were alone once more and then she called me into her bed and clasped her arms about me and i lay with my face hidden in her neck what happened thereafter seems to be too sacred to write of almost too sacred to think about yet it is all as a memory of yesterday while other events of my life have floated away to the ocean of things that are forgotten and lost listen darling she said and then speaking in whispers she told me she had heard all i had said about the convent and wondered if i would not like to live there always becoming one of the good and holy nuns i must have made some kind of protest for she went on to say how hard the world was to a woman and how difficult she had found it not that your father has been to blameyou must never think that mary yet still but tears from her tender heart were stealing down her face and she had to stop even yet i had not realised all that the solemn time foreboded for i said something about staying with my mother and then in her sweet voice she told me nervously breaking the news to me gently that she was going to leave me that she was going to heaven but she would think of me when she was there and if god permitted she would watch over me or if that might not be she would ask our lady to do so so you see we shall never be parted never really we shall always be together something tells me that wherever you are and whatever you are doing i shall know all about it this comforted me and i think it comforted my mother also though god knows if it would have done so if with her dying eyes she could have seen what was waiting for her child it fills my heart brimful to think of what happened next she told me to say a de profundis for her sometimes and to think of her when i sang the hymn to the virgin then she kissed me and told me to go to sleep saying she was going to sleep too and if it should prove to be the eternal sleep it would be only like going to sleep at night and awaking in the morning and then we should be together again and the time between would not seem long so goodnight darling and god bless you she said and as well as i could i answered her goodnight when i awoke from the profound slumber of childhood it was noon of the next day and the sun was shining doctor conrad was lifting me out of bed and father dan who had just thrown open the window was saying in a tremulous voice your dear mother has gone to god i began to cry but he checked me and said dont call her back shes on her way to gods beautiful paradise after all her suffering let her go so i lost her my mother my saint my angel it was easter eve and the church bells were ringing the gloria eighteenth chapter after my mothers death there was no place left for me in my fathers house betsy beauty who was now called miss betsy and gave herself more than ever the airs of the daughter of the family occupied half her days with the governess who had been engaged to teach her and the other half in driving dressed in beautiful clothes to the houses of the gentry round about nessy macleod called the young mistress had become my fathers secretary and spent most of her time in his private room a privilege which enlarged her pride without improving her manners martin conrad i did not see for in reward for some success at school the doctor had allowed him to spend his easter holidays in london in order to look at nansens ship the fram which had just then arrived in the thames hence it happened that though home made a certain tug at me with its familiar sights and sounds and more than once i turned with timid steps towards my fathers busy room intending to say please father dont send me back to school i made no demur when six or seven days after the funeral aunt bridget began to prepare for my departure theres odds of women said tommy the mate when i went into the garden to say good bye to him theyre like sheeps broth is women if theres a head and a heart in them theyre good and if there isnt you might as well be supping hot water our big woman is hot waterbut shell die for all within a fortnight i was back at the convent and there the reverend mother atoned to me for every neglect i knew you would come back to me she said and from that hour onward she seemed to be trying to make up to me for the mother i had lost i became deeply devoted to her as a consequence her spirit became my spirit and little by little the religious side of the life of the convent took complete possession of me at first i loved the church and its services because the reverend mother loved them and perhaps also for the sake of the music the incense the flowers and the lights on the altar but after i had taken my communion the mysteries of our religion took hold of methe confessional with its sense of cleansing and the unutterable sweetness of the mass for a long time there was nothing to disturb this religious side of my mind my father never sent for me and as often as the holidays came round the reverend mother took me with her to her country home at nemi that was a beautiful placea sweet white cottage some twenty kilometres from rome at the foot of monte cavo in the middle of the remains of a mediaeval village which contained a castle and a monastery and had a little blue lake lying like an emerald among the green and red of the grass and poppies in the valley below in the hot months of summer the place was like a paradise to me with its roses growing wild by the wayside its green lizards running on the rocks its goats its sheep its vineyards its brownfaced boys in velvet and its gleesome girls in smart red petticoats and gorgeous outside stays its shrines and its blazing sunsets which seemed to girdle the heavens with quivering bands of purple and gold years went by without my being aware of their going for after a while i became entirely happy i heard frequently from home occasionally it was from betsy beauty who had not much to say beyond stories of balls at government house where she had danced with the young lord raa and of hunts at which she had ridden with him more rarely it was from aunt bridget who usually began by complaining of the everincreasing cost of my convent clothes and ended with accounts of her daughters last new costume and how well she looked in it from nessy macleod and my father i never heard at all but father dan was my constant correspondent and he told me everything first of my father himselfthat he had carried out many of his great enterprises his marine works electric railways drinking and dancing palaces which had brought tens of thousands of visitors and hundreds of thousands of pounds to ellan though the good father doubted the advantage of such innovations and lamented the decline of piety which had followed on the lust for wealth next of aunt bridgetthat she was bringing up her daughter in the ways of worldly vanity and cherishing a serpent in her bosom meaning nessy macleod who would poison her heart some day next of tommy the matethat he sent his best respecs to the lilmissy but thought she was well out of the way of the big woman who was getting that hightytighty that you couldnt say tom to a cat before her but she was agate of you to make it thomas then of martin conradthat he was at college studying for a doctor but his heart was still at the north pole and he was like a seagull in the nest of a wood pigeon always longing to be out on the wild waves finally of the young lord raathat the devils dues must be in the man for after being sent down from oxford he had wasted his substance in riotous living in london and his guardian had been heard to say he must marry a rich wife soon or his estates would go to the hammer such was the substance of the news that reached me over a period of six years yet welcome as were father dans letters the life they described seemed less and less important to me as time went on for the outer world was slipping away from me altogether and i was becoming more and more immersed in my spiritual exercises i spent much of my time reading religious booksthe life of saint teresa the meditations of saint francis of sales and above all the letters and prayers of our blessed margaret mary alacoque whose love of the sacred heart was like a flaming torch to my excited spirit the soul of rome too seemed to enter into my soulnot the new rome for of that i knew nothing but the old rome the holy city that could speak to me in the silence of the night within the walls of my conventschool with its bells of the dominican and franciscan monasteries on either side its stories of miracles performed on the sick and dying by the various shrines of the madonna its accounts of the vast multitudes of the faithful who came from all ends of the earth to the ceremonials at st peters and above all its sense of the immediate presence of the pope half a mile away the vicar and mouthpiece of god himself the end of it all was that i wished to become a nun i said nothing of my desire to anybody not even to the reverend mother but day by day my resolution grew perhaps it was natural that the orphaned and homeless girl should plunge with all this passion into the aurora of a new spiritual life but when i think how my nature was made for love human love the love of husband and children i cannot but wonder with a thrill of the heart whether my mother in heaven who while she was on earth had fought so hard with my father for the body of her child was now fighting with him for her soul i was just eighteen years of age when my desire to become a nun reached its highest point and then received its final overthrow mildred bankes who had returned to rome and was living as a novice with the little sisters of the poor was about to make her vows and the reverend mother took me to see the ceremony never shall i forget the effect of it the sweet summer morning tingling with snowwhite sunshine the little white chapel in the garden of the convent covered with flowers the altar with its lighted tapers the friends from without clad in gay costumes as for a festival the bishop in his bright vestments and then mildred herself dressed as a bride in a beautiful white gown with a long white veil and attended by other novices as bridesmaids it was just like a marriage to look upon except for the absence of a visible bridegroom the invisible one being christ and the taking of the vows was like a marriage service tooonly more solemn and sacred and touchingthe bride receiving the ring on her finger and promising to serve and worship her celestial lover from that day forward for better for worse for richer for poorer in sickness and in health as long as life should last and through the eternity that was to follow it i cried all through the ceremony for sheer joy of its loveliness and when it was over and we went into the refectory and mildred told me she was returning to england to work among the fallen girls of london i vowed in my heart though i hardly understood what she was going to do that i would follow her example it was something of a jar to go back into the streets so full of noise and bustle and all the way home with the reverend mother i was forming the resolution of telling her that very night that i meant to be a nun for stirred to the depths of my soul by what i had seen and remembering what my poor mother had wished for me i determined that no other life would i live under any circumstances then came the shock as we drew up at our door a postman was delivering letters one of them was for the reverend mother and i saw in a moment that it was in my fathers handwriting she read it in silence and in silence she handed it to me it ran madam i have come to rome to take back my daughter i believe her education will now be finished and i reckon the time has arrived to prepare her for the change in life that is before her the bishop of our diocese has come with me and we propose to pay our respects to you at ten oclock prompt tomorrow morning yours madam daniel oneill nineteenth chapter i saw as by a flash of light what was before me and my whole soul rose in rebellion against it that my father after all the years during which he had neglected me should come to me now when my plans were formed and change the whole current of my life was an outragean iniquity it might be his righthis natural rightbut if so his natural right was a spiritual wrongand i would resist itto my last breath and my last hour i would resist it such were the brave thoughts with which i passed that night but at ten oclock next morning when i was summoned to meet my father himself it was on trembling limbs and with a quivering heart that i went down to the reverend mothers room except that his hair was whiter than before my father was not much changed he rose as i entered saying here she is herself and when i went up to him he put his hands on my shoulders and looked into my face quite a little italian woman grown like your mother though he said and then speaking over my head to the bishop who sat on the other side of the room he added guess this will do bishop eh perfectly said the bishop i was colouring in confusion at the continued scrutiny with a feeling of being looked over for some unexplained purpose when the reverend mother called me and turning to go to her i saw by the look of pain on her face that she too had been hurt by it she put me to sit on a stool by the side of her chair and taking my right hand she laid it in her lap and held it there during the whole of the interview the bishop whom i had never seen before was the first to speak he was a type of the fashionable ecclesiastic suave smiling faultlessly dressed in silk soutane and silver buckled shoes and wearing a heavy gold chain with a jewelled cross reverend mother he said you would gather from mr oneills letter that he wishes to remove his daughter immediatelyi presume there will be no difficulty in his doing so the reverend mother did not speak but i think she must have bent her head naturally said the bishop there will be a certain delay while suitable clothes are being made for her but i have no doubt you will give mr oneill your help in these preparations my head was down and i did not see if the reverend mother bowed again but the two gentlemen apparently satisfied with her silence began to talk of the best date for my removal and just when i was quivering with fear that without a word of protest i was to be taken away the reverend mother said monsignor reverend mother you are aware that this childhere she patted my trembling handhas been with me for ten years i am given to understand so and that during that time she has only once been home i was not awarebut no doubt it is as you say in short that during the greater part of her life she has been left to my undivided care you have been very good to her very and im sure her family are extremely grateful in that case monsignor doesnt it seem to you that i am entitled to know why she is being so suddenly taken away from me and what is the change in life which mr oneill referred to in his letter the smile which had been playing upon the bishops face was smitten away from it by that question and he looked anxiously across at my father tell her said my father and then while my heart thumped in my bosom and the reverend mother stroked my hand to compose me the bishop gave a brief explanation the time had not come when it would be prudent to be more definite but he might say that mr oneill was trying to arrange a happy and enviable future for his daughter and therefore he wished her to return home to prepare for it does that mean marriage said the reverend mother it may be so i am not quite prepared to and that a husband has already been found for her that too perhaps i will not say monsignor said the reverend mother sitting up with dignity is that fair fair is it fair that after ten years in which her father has done nothing for her he should determine what her life is to be without regard to her wish and will i raised my eyes and saw that the bishop looked aghast reverend mother you surprise me he said since when has a father ceased to be the natural guardian of his child has he not been so since the beginning of the world doesnt the church itself build its laws on that foundation does it said the reverend mother shortly and then i could feel her hand trembling as she spoke some of its servants do i know but when did the church say that anybodyno matter whoa father or anybody elseshould take the soul of another and control it and govern it and put it in prison my good lady said the bishop would you call it putting the girl in prison to marry her into an illustrious family to give her an historic name to surround her with the dignity and distinction bishop said my father raising his hand i guess its my right to butt in here isnt it i saw that my fathers face had been darkening while the reverend mother spoke and now rolling his heavy body in his chair so as to face her he said excuse me maam but when you say ive done nothing for my gel here i suppose youll allow ive kept her and educated her youve kept and educated your dogs and horses also i dare say but do you claim the same rights over a human being i do maami think i do and when the human being happens to be my own daughter i dont allow that anybody else has anything to say if her mother were alive would she have nothing to say i thought my father winced at that word but he answered her mother would agree to anything i thought best her mother so far as i can see was a most unselfish most submissive most unhappy woman said the reverend mother my father glanced quickly at me and then after a moment he said im obliged to you maam much obliged but as im not a man to throw words away ill ask you to tell me what all this means does it mean that youve made plans of your own for my daughter without consulting me no sir then perhaps it means that the gel herself that may be so or noti cannot say but when you sent your daughter to a conventschool wrong maam wrong for once it was my wifes sisterwho thinks the gel disobedient and rebellious and unruly then your wifes sister is either a very stupid or a very badhearted woman maam i have known your daughter longer than she has and there isnt a word of truth in what she says it was as much as i could do not to fall on the reverend mothers neck but i clung to her hand with a convulsive grasp may be so maam may be no said my father but when you talk about my sending my daughter to a conventschool i would have you know that ive been so busy with my business that you havent had time to take care of the most precious thing god gave you maam said my father rising to his feet may i ask what right you have to speak to me as if the right of one who for ten years has been a mother to your motherless child sir while you have neglected and forgotten her at that my father whose bushy eyebrows were heavily contracted turned to the bishop bishop he said is this what ive been paying my money for ten years fees and middling high ones too im thinking and then the bishop apparently hoping to make peace said suavely but arent we crossing the river before we reach the bridge the girl herself may have no such objections have you he asked turning to me i was trembling more than ever now and at first i could not reply dont you wish to go back home with your father no sir i answered and why not please because my fathers home is no home to mebecause my aunt has always been unkind to me and because my father has never cared for me or protected me and because well what else because because i wish to become a nun there was silence for a moment and then my father broke into bitter laughter so thats it is it i thought as much you want to go into partnership with the mother in the nun business eh my mother wished me to become a nun and i wish it myself sir your mother was a babythats what she was my mother was an angel sir i said bridling up and when she was dying she hoped i should become a nun and i can never become anything else under any circumstance bah said my father with a contemptuous lift of the hand and then turning to the reverend mother he said hark here maam theres an easy way and a hard way in most everything i take the easy way first and if it wont work i take the hard way next and then its stiff pulling for the people who pull against me i came to rome to take my daughter home i dont feel called upon to explain why i want to take her home or what im going to do with her when i get her there i believe ive got the rights of a father to do what i mean to do and that it will be an ugly business for anybody who aids and abets my daughter in resisting her fathers will so ill leave her here a week longer and when i come back ill expect her to be ready and waiting and willingready and waiting and willing mind youto go along with me after saying this my father faced about and with his heavy flat step went out of the room whereupon the bishop bowed to the reverend mother and followed him my heart was by this time in fierce rebellionall that the pacifying life of the conventschool had done for me in ten years being suddenly swept awayand i cried i wont do it i wont do it but i had seen that the reverend mothers face had suddenly become very white while my father spoke to her at the end and now she said in a timid almost frightened tone mary well go out to nemi today i have something to say to you twentieth chapter in the late afternoon of the same day we were sitting together for the last time on the terrace of the reverend mothers villa it was a peaceful evening a sweet and holy time not a leaf was stirring not a breath of wind was in the air but the voice of a young boy singing a lovesong came up from somewhere among the rocky ledges of the vineyards below and while the bell of the monastic church behind us was ringing the ave maria the faroff bell of the convent church at gonzano was answering from the other side of the lakelike angels calling to each other from long distances in the sky mary said the reverend mother i want to tell you a story it is the story of my own lifemine and my sisters and my fathers i was sitting by her side and she was holding my hand in her lap and patting it as she had done during the interview of the morning they say the reason so few women become nuns is that a woman is too attached to her home to enter the holy life until she has suffered shipwreck in the world that may be so with most women it was not so with me my father was what is called a selfmade man but his fortune did not content him he wanted to found a family if he had had a son this might have been easy having only two daughters he saw no way but that of marrying one of us into the italian nobility my sister was the first to disappoint him she fell in love with a young roman musician the first time the young man asked for my sister he was contemptuously refused the second time he was insulted the third time he was flung out of the house his nature was headstrong and passionate and so was my fathers if either had been different the result might not have been the same yet who knows who can say the reverend mother paused for a moment the boys voice in the vineyard was going on to remove my sister from the scene of temptation my father took her from rome to our villa in the hills above albano but the young musician followed her since my father would not permit him to marry her he was determined that she should fly with him and when she hesitated to do so he threatened her if she did not meet him at a certain hour on a certain night my father would be dead in the morning the reverend mother paused again the boys voice had ceased the daylight was dying out my sister could not bring herself to sacrifice either her father or her lover hence she saw only one way leftto sacrifice herself herself the reverend mother patted my hand isnt that what women in tragic circumstances are always doing she said by some excusei dont know whatshe persuaded our father to change rooms with her that nighthe going upstairs to her bedroom in the tower and she to his on the ground floor at the back opening on to the garden and the pine forest that goes up the hill what happened after that nobody ever knew exactly in the middle of the night the servants heard two pistol shots and next morning my sister was found deadshot to the heart through an open window as she lay in my fathers bed the authorities tried in vain to trace the criminal only one person had any idea of his identity that was my father and in his fierce anger he asked himself what he ought to do in order to punish the man who had killed his daughter then a strange thing happened on the day before the funeral the young musician walked into my fathers room his face was white and wasted and his eyes were red and swollen he had come to ask if he might be allowed to be one of those to carry the coffin my father consented ill leave him alone he thought the man is punished enough all the people of albano came to the funeral and there was not a dry eye as the cortege passed from our chapel to the grave everybody knew the story of my sisters hopeless love but only two in the world knew the secret of her tragic deathher young lover who was sobbing aloud as he staggered along with her body on his shoulder and her old father who was walking bareheaded and in silence behind him my heart was beating audibly and the reverend mother stroked my hand to compose meperhaps to compose herself also it was now quite dark the stars were coming out and the bells of the two monasteries on opposite sides of the lake were ringing the first hour of night thats my sisters story mary said the reverend mother after a while and the moral of my own is the same though the incidents are different i was now my fathers only child and all his remaining hopes centred in me so he set himself to find a husband for me before the time came when i should form an attachment for myself his choice fell on a middleaged roman noble of distinguished but impoverished family he has a great name you will have a great fortunewhat more do you want said my father we were back in rome by this time and thereat school or elsewherei had formed the conviction that a girl must passionately love the man she marries and i did not love the roman noble i had also been led to believe that a girl should be the first and only passion of the man who marries her and young as i was i knew that my middleaged lover had had other domestic relations consequently i demurred but my father threatened and stormed and then remembering my sisters fate i pretended to agree and i was formally engaged i never meant to keep my promise and i began to think out schemes by which to escape from it only one way seemed open to me then and cherishing the thought of it in secret i waited and watched and made preparations for carrying out my purpose at length the moment came to me it was midlent and a masked ball was given by my fiances friends in one of the old roman palaces i can see it stillthe great hall ablaze with glowing frescoes beautiful venetian candelabras gilded furniture red and yellow damask and velvet and then the throng of handsome men in many uniforms and beautiful women with rows of pearls falling from their naked throats i had dressed myself as a bacchante in a white tunic embroidered in gold with bracelets on my bare arms a tigerskin band over my forehead and a cluster of grapes in my hair i danced every dance i remember most of them with my middleaged lover and i suppose no one seemed so gay and happy and heedless at three oclock in the morning i returned home in my fathers carriage at six i had entered a convent nobody in the outer world ever knew what had become of me and neither did i know what happened at home after i left it the rule of the convent was very strict sometimes after morning prayers the superior would say the mother of one of you is deadpray for her soul and that was all we ever heard of the world outside but nature is a mighty thing my child and after five years i became restless and unhappy i began to have misgivings about my vocation but the mother who was wise and human saw what was going on in my heart you are thinking about your father she said that he is growing old and needing a daughter to take care of him go out and nurse him and then come back to your cell and pray i went but when i reached my fathers house a great shock awaited me a strange man was in the porters lodge and our beautiful palace was let out in apartments my father was deadthree years dead and buried after my disappearance he had shut himself up in his shame and grief for little as i had suspected it and hard and cruel as i had thought him he had really and truly loved me during his last days his mind had failed him and he had given away all his fortunescattered it no one knew how as something that was quite uselessand then he died alone and brokenhearted that was the end of the reverend mothers narrative she did not try to explain or justify or condemn her own or her sisters conduct neither did she attempt to apply the moral of her story to my own circumstances she left me to do that for myself i had been spellbound while she spoke creeping closer and closer to her until my head was on her breast for some time longer we sat like this in the soft italian night while the fireflies came out in clouds among the unseen flowers of the garden and the dark air seemed to be alive with sparks of light when the time came to go to bed the reverend mother took me to my room and after some cheerful words she left me but hardly had i lain down shaken to the hearts core by what i had heard and telling myself that the obedience of a daughter to her father whatever he might demand of her was an everlasting and irreversible duty imposed by no human lawgiver and that marriage was a necessity which was forced upon most women by a mysterious and unyielding law of god when the door opened and the reverend mother with a lamp in her hand came in again mary she said i forgot to tell you that i am leaving the sacred heart the sisters of my old convent have asked me to go back as superior i have obtained permission to do so and am going shortly so that in any case we should have been parted soon it is the convent of here she gave me the name of a private society of cloistered nuns in the heart of rome i hope you will write to me as often as possible and come to see me whenever you can and if it should ever occur that but no i will not think of that marriage is a sacred tie too and under proper conditions god blesses and hallows it with that she left me in the darkness the church bell was ringing the monks of the passionist monastery were getting up for their midnight offices twentyfirst chapter a week later i was living with my father in the hotel europa on the edge of the piazza di spagna he was kinder to me than he had ever been before but he did not tell me what the plans were which he had formed for my future and i was left to discover them for myself our apartment was constantly visited by ecclesiasticsmonsignori archbishops even one of the cardinals of the propaganda brought there by bishop walsh the bishop of our own diocese and i could not help but hear portions of their conversation it will be difficult extremely difficult the cardinal would say such marriages are not encouraged by the church which holds that they are usually attended by the worst consequences to both wife and husband stillunder the exceptional circumstancesthat the bridegrooms family was catholic before it was protestantit is possible just possible cardinal my father would answer while his strong face was darkening excuse me sir but im kind of curious to get the hang of this business either it can be done or it cant if it can well just sail in and do it but if it cant i believe ill go home quick and spend my money another way then there would be earnest assurances that in the end all would be right only rome moved slowly and it would be necessary to have patience and wait my father waited three weeks and meantime he occupied himself in seeing the sights of the old city but the mighty remains which are the luminous lighthouses of the pastthe forum with the broken columns of its dead centuries the coliseum with its gigantic ruins like the desolate crater of a moon the campagna with its hollow crumbling tombs and shattered aqueductsonly vexed and irritated him guess if i had my way he said i would just clean out this old stoneyard of monuments to dead men and make it more fit for living ones at length the bishop came to say that the necessary business had been completed and that to mark its satisfactory settlement the pope had signified his willingness to receive in private audience both my father and myself this threw me into a state of the greatest nervousness for i had begun to realise that my fathers business concerned myself so that when early the following morning clad according to instructions my father in evening dress and i in a long black mantilla we set out for the vatican i was in a condition of intense excitement what happened after we got out of the carriage at the bronze gate near st peters i can only describe from a vague and feverish memory i remember going up a great staircase past soldiers in manycoloured coats into a vast corridor where there were other soldiers in other costumes i remember going on and on through salon after salon each larger and more luxurious than the last and occupied by guards still more gorgeously dressed than the guards we had left behind i remember coming at length to a door at which a chamberlain wearing a sword knelt and knocked softly and upon its being opened announced our names and then i remember that after all this grandeur as of a mediaeval court i found myself in a plain room like a library with a simple white figure before me and i was in the presence of the holy father himself can i ever forget that moment i had always been taught in the convent to think of the pope with a reverence only second to that which was due to the saints so at first i thought i should faint and how i reached the holy fathers feet i do not know i only know that he was very sweet and kind to me holding out the delicate white hand on which he wore the fishermans emerald ring and smoothing my head after i had kissed it when i recovered myself sufficiently to look up i saw that he was an old man with a very pale and saintly face and when he spoke it was in such a soft and fatherly voice that i loved and worshipped him so this is the little lady he said who is to be the instrument in the hands of providence in bringing back an erring family into the folds of mother church somebody answered him and then he spoke to me about marriage saying it was a holy state instituted by the almighty under a natural law and sanctioned by our divine redeemer into the dignity of a sacrament so that those who entered it might live together in peace and love it is a spiritual and sacred union my child he said a type of the holy mystery of christs relation to his church then he told me i was to make the best possible preparation for marriage in order to obtain the abundant graces of god and to approach the altar only after penance and communion and when you leave the church my daughter he said do not profane the day of your marriage by any sinful thought or act but remember to bear yourself as if jesus christ himself were with you as he was at the marriagefeast in cana of galilee then he warned me that when i entered into the solemn contract of holy matrimony i was to do so in the full consciousness that it could not be broken but by death whom god has joined together let no man put asunderremember that too my daughter finally he said something about childrenthat a catholic marrying a person of another religion must not enter into any agreement whereby any of her children should be brought up in any other than the catholic faith after that and something said to my father which i cannot recall he gave me his blessing in words so beautiful and a voice so sweet that it fell on me like the soft breeze that comes out of the rising sun on a summer morning may the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob be with you my daughter may your marriage be a yoke of love and peace and may you see your childrens children to the third and fourth generation then he raised me to my feet and at a touch from the chamberlain i backed out of the room when the door had closed on me i drew a deep breath feeling as if i had come out of the holy of holies and when i reached the piazza of st peters and came again upon the sight and sound of common thingsthe cabs and electric carsit was the same as if i had suddenly descended from heaven to earth after my audience with the pope following on the reverend mothers story all my objections to marriage had gone and i wished to tell my father so but an opportunity did not arise until late the same night and then it was he who was the first to speak being in good spirits after a dinner to the ecclesiastics he said as soon as his guests had gonespeaking in the tone of one who believed he was doing a great thing for me mary matters are not quite settled yet but you might as well know right here what were trying to fix up for you then he told me i was to marry the young lord raa i was stunned it was just as if the power of thought had been smitten out of me twentysecond chapter that night and during the greater part of the following day i felt without quite knowing why as if i were living under the dark cloud of a gathering thunderstorm all my fear of the world and my desire to escape from it had fallen upon me afresh hence it was not altogether by the blind leading of fate that half an hour before ave maria i entered the church of the convent which the reverend mother had given me the name of the church was empty when i pushed past the leather hanging that covered the door but the sacristan was lighting the candles for benediction so i went up to the bronze screen the cancello that divides the public part from the part occupied by the sisters and knelt on the nearest step after a while the churchbell rang overhead and then the congregation having gathered in the meantime the nuns came in by way of a corridor which seemed to issue out of the darkness from under a figure of the virgin and child they were all in white snowwhite from head to foot with a glimmer of blue scapular beneath their outer garment and they wore long thick veils which entirely concealed their features when they entered but were raised when they reached their seats and faced the altar familiar as i was with similar scenes this one moved me as i had never before been movedthe silent white figures with hands clasped on their breasts coming in one by one with noiseless and unhurried footsteps like a line of wraiths from another world but a still deeper emotion was to come to me as the last of the nuns entered the superior as i knew she would be i recognised her instantly it was my own reverend mother herself and when after kneeling to the altar she came down to her seat nearest to the screen immediately in front of the place where i knelt i knew by the tremor of the clasped hands which held the rosary that she had seen and recognised me i trembled and my heart thumped against my breast then the priest entered and the litany began it was sung throughout almost the whole of the service was sung never had benediction seemed so beautiful so pathetic so appealing so irresistible by the time the tantum ergo had been reached and the sweet female voices over the soft swell of the organ were rising to the vaulted roof in sorrowful reparation for the sins of all sinners in the world who did not pray for themselves the religious life was calling to me as it had never called before come away from the world it seemed to say obedience to your heavenly father cancels all duty to your earthly one leave everything you fear behind you and find peace and light and love the service was over the nuns had dropped their veils and gone out as slowly and noiselessly as they had come in the last of them with her head down the sacristan with his long rod was extinguishing the candles on the altar the church was growing dark and a laysister in black was rattling a bunch of keys at the door behind me before i moved from my place beside the rails then i awoke as from a dream and looking longingly back at the dark corridor down which the nuns had disappeared i was turning to go when i became aware that a young man was standing beside me and smiling into my face mally he said very softly and he held out his hand something in the voice made me giddy something in the blue eyes made me tremble i looked at him but did not speak dont you know me mally he said i felt as if a rosy veil were falling over my face and neck a flood of joy was sweeping through me at last i knew who it was it was martin conrad grown to be a man a tall powerful manly man but with the same face stillan elusive ghost of the boys face i used to look up to and love a few minutes later we were out on the piazza in front of the church and with a nervous rush of joyous words he was telling me what had brought him to rome having just scraped through his examinations and taken his degreecouldnt have done so if the examiners had not been jolly good to himhe had heard that lieut was going down to the great ice barrier that bounds the south pole to investigate the sources of winds and tides so he had offered himself as doctor to the expedition and been accepted sailing from the thames ten days ago they had put into naples that morning for coal and taking advantage of the opportunity he had run up to rome remembering that i was at school here but never expecting to see me and coming upon me by the merest accident in the worldsomething having said to him lets go in here and look at this queer old church he had to leave tomorrow at two though having to sail the same night but of course it would be luck to go farther south than charcot and make another attack on the antarctic night i could see that life was full of faith and hope and all good things for him and remembering some episodes of the past i said so you are going asploring in earnest at last at last he answered and we looked into each others eyes and laughed as we stood together on the church steps with little tender waves of feeling from our childhood sweeping to our feet and you he said you look just the same i knew you instantly yet you are changed too so grown and so so wonderfully i knew what he meant to say and being too much of a child to pretend not to know and too much of a woman notwithstanding my nunlike impulses not to find joy in it i said i was glad youve left the convent i see when did that happen i told him three weeks agothat my father had come for me and we were going back to ellan and then what are you going to do then he asked for a moment i felt ashamed to answer but at last i told him that i was going home to be married married when to whom i said i did not know when but it was to be to the young lord raa raa did you say raa that good gbut surely you know he did not finish what he was going to say so i told him i did not know anything not having seen lord raa since i came to school and everything having been arranged for me by my father not seen him since everything arranged by your father yes then he asked me abruptly where i was staying and when i told him he said he would walk back with me to the hotel his manner had suddenly changed and several times as we walked together up the tritoni and along the du marcelli he began to say something and then stopped surely your father knows if he does i cannot possibly understand i did not pay as much attention to his broken exclamations as i should have done but for the surprise and confusion of coming so suddenly upon him again and when as we reached the hotel he said i wonder if your father will allow me to speak im sure hell be delighted i said and then in my great impatience i ran upstairs ahead of him and burst into my fathers room crying father whom do you think i have brought to see youlook to my concern and discomfiture my fathers reception of martin was very cool and at first he did not even seem to know him you dont remember me sir said martin im afraid i cant just place you said my father after i had made them known to each other they sat talking about the south pole expedition but it was a chill and cheerless interview and after a few minutes martin rose to go i find it kind of hard to figure you fellows out said my father no money that i know of has ever been made in the unknown as you call it and if you discover both poles i dont just see how theyre to be worth a twocent stamp to you but you know best so goodbye and good luck to you i went out to the lift with martin who asked if he could take me for a walk in the morning i answered yes and inquired what hour he would call for me twelve oclock he replied and i said that would suit me exactly the bishop came to dine with us that night and after dinner when i had gone to the window to look out over the city for the three lights on the loggia of the vatican he and my father talked together for a long time in a low tone they were still talking when i left them to go to bed twentythird chapter at breakfast next morning my father told me that something unexpected had occurred to require that we should return home immediately and therefore he had sent over to cooks for seats by the noon express i was deeply disappointed but i knew my father too well to demur so i slipped away to my room and sent a letter to martin explaining the change in our plans and saying goodbye to him when we reached the station however i found martin waiting on the platform in front of the compartment that was labelled with our name i thought my father was even more brusque with him than before and the bishop who was to travel with us was curt almost to rudeness but martin did not seem to mind that this morning for his lower lip had the stiff setting which i had seen in it when he was a boy and after i stepped into the carriage he stepped in after me leaving the two men on the platform shall you be long away i asked too long unfortunately six months nineperhaps twelve worse luck wish i hadnt to go at all he answered i was surprised and asked why whereupon he stammered some excuse and then said abruptly i suppose youll not be married for some time at all events i told him i did not know everything depending on my father anyhow youll see and hear for yourself when you reach home and then perhaps youll i answered that i should have to do what my father desired being a girl and therefore but surely a girl has some rights of her own he said and then i was silent and a little ashamed having a sense of female helplessness which i had never felt before and could find no words for ill write to your father he said and just at that moment the bell rang and my father came into the compartment saying now then young man if you dont want to be taken up to the north pole instead of going down to the south one thats all right sir dont you trouble about me i can take care of myself said martin something in his tone must have said more than his words to my father and the bishop for i saw that they looked at each other with surprise then the bell rang again the engine throbbed and martin said goodbye goodbye while the train moved out of the station he stood bareheaded on the platform with such a woebegone face that looking back at him my throat began to hurt me as it used to do when i was a child i was very sad that day as we travelled north my adopted country had become dear to me during my ten years exile from home and i thought i was seeing the last of my beautiful italy crowned with sunshine and decked with flowers but there was another cause of my sadness and that was the thought of martins uneasiness about my marriage the feeling that if he had anything to say to my father he ought to have said it then and there was yet another cause of which i was quite unconsciousthat like every other girl before love dawns on her half of my nature was still asleep the half that makes life lovely and the world dear to think that martin conrad was the one person who could have wakened my sleeping heart that a word a look a smile from him that day could have changed the whole current of my life and that but no i will not reproach him have i not known since the day on st marys rock that above all else he is a born gentleman and yet and yet memorandum by martin conrad and yet i was a fool or in spite of everything i should have spoken to daniel oneill before he left rome i should have said to him do you know that the man to whom you are going to marry your daughter is a profligate and a reprobate if you do know this are you deliberately selling her body and soul to gratify your lust of rank and power and all the rest of your rotten aspirations that is what i ought to have done but didnt do i was afraid of being thought to have personal motivesof interfering where i wasnt wanted of butting in when i had no right yet i felt i had a right and i had half a mind to throw up everything and go back to ellan but the expedition was the big chance i had been looking forward to and i could not give it up so i resolved to write but writing isnt exactly my job and it took me a fortnight to get anything done to my satisfaction by that time we were at port said and from there i posted three lettersthe first to daniel oneill the second to bishop walsh the third to father dan would they reach in time if so would they be read and considered or resented and destroyed i did not know i could not guess and then i was going down into the deep antarctic night where no sound from the living world could reach me what would happen before i could get back only god could say mc second part my marriage twentyfourth chapter notwithstanding my fathers anxiety to leave rome we travelled slowly and it was a week before we reached ellan by that time my depression had disappeared and i was quivering with mingled curiosity and fear at the thought of meeting the man who was to be my husband my father for reasons of his own was equally excited and as we sailed into the bay at blackwater he pointed out the developments which had been made under his directionthe hotels theatres dancing palaces and boarding houses that lined the seafront and the electric railways that ran up to the tops of the mountains see that he cried i told them i could make this old island hum on a great stone pier that stood deep into the bay a crowd of people were waiting for the arrival of the steamer thats nothing said my father nothing to what you see at the height of the season as soon as we had drawn up alongside the pier and before the passengers had landed four gentlemen came aboard and my heart thumped with the thought that my intended husband would be one of them but he was not and the first words spoken to my father were his lordships apologies sir he has an engagement today but hopes to see you at your own house tomorrow morning i recognised the speaker as the guardian grown greyer and even less prepossessing who had crossed with the young lord raa when he was going up to oxford and his companions were a smoothfaced man with searching eyes who was introduced as his lordships solicitor from london a mr curphy whom i knew to be my fathers advocate and my dear old father dan i was surprised to find father dan a smaller man than i had thought him very plain and provincial a little country parish priest but he had the tender smile i always remembered and the sweet irish roll of the vowels that i could never forget god bless you he said how well youre looking and how like your mother lord rest her soul i knew the blessed virgin would take care of you and she has she has three conveyances were waiting for usa grand brougham for the bishop a big motorcar for the guardian and the london lawyer and a still bigger one for ourselves well slong until tomorrow then cried my father getting up into the front row of his own ear with the advocate beside him and father dan and myself behind on the way home father dan talked of the business that had brought me back saying i was not to think too much of anything he might have said of lord raa in his letters seeing that he had spoken from hearsay and the world was so censoriousand then there was no measuring the miraculous influence that might be exercised by a good woman he said this with a certain constraint and was more at ease when he spoke of the joy that ought to come into a girls life at her marriageher first love her first loveletter her weddingday and her first baby all the sweet and wonderful things of a new existence which a man could never know even an old priest may see that he said with a laugh and a pat of my hand we dropped mr curphy at his house in holmtown and then my father sat with us at the back and talked with tremendous energy of what he had done of what he was going to do and of all the splendours that were before me youll be the big woman of the island gel and there wont be a mothers son that dare say boo to you i noticed that in his excitement his tongue dropping the suggestion of his adopted country reverted to the racy speech of his native soil and i had a sense of being with him before i was born when he returned home from america with millions of dollars at his back and the people who had made game of his father went down before his face like a flood such of them as had not done so then being of the aristocracy of the island and remembering the humble stock he came from were to do so now for in the second generation and by means of his daughters marriage he was going to triumph over them all well beat em gel my gough yes well beat em he cried with a flash of his black eyes and a masterful lift of his eyebrows as we ran by the mansions of the great people of ellan he pointed them out to me with a fling of the arm and spoke of the families in a tone of contempt see that thats christian of ballachristian the man snubbed me six months ago hell know better six months to come thats eyreton his missus was too big to call on your mothershell call on you though you go bail see yonder big tower in the trees thats folksdale where the farragans live the daughters have been walking over the world like peacocks but theyll crawl on it like cockroaches hulloh heres ould balgean of eagle hill in his grand carriage with his english coachman see that though see him doff his hat to you the ould hypocrite he knows something hes got an inkling things travel well beat em gel well beat em theyll be round us like bees about a honeypot it was impossible not to catch the contagion of my fathers triumphant spirits and in my different way i found myself tingling with delight as i recognised the scenes associated with my childhoodthe village the bridge the lane to sunny lodge and murphys mouth and the trees that bordered our drive nearly everything looked smaller or narrower or lower than i had thought but i had forgotten how lovely they all were lying so snugly under the hill and with the sea in front of them our house alone when we drove up to it seemed larger than i had expected but my father explained this by saying improvements gel ill show you over them tomorrow morning aunt bridget whiteheaded now and wearing spectacles and a white cap betsy beauty grown tall and round with a kind of country comeliness and nessy macleod looking like a premature old maid who was doing her best to be a girl were waiting at the open porch when our car drew up and they received me with surprising cordiality here she is at last said aunt bridget and such luck as she has come home to said betsy beauty there were compliments on the improvement in my appearance aunt bridget declaring she could not have believed it she really could not and then nessy undertook to take me to my room its the same room still mary said my aunt calling to me as i went upstairs when they were changing everything else i remembered your poor dear mother and wouldnt hear of their changing that it isnt a bit altered it was not everything was exactly as i remembered it but just as i was beginning for the first time in my life to feel grateful to aunt bridget nessy said no thanks to her though if shed had her way she would have wiped out every trace of your mother and arranged this marriage for her own daughter instead more of the same kind she said which left me with the impression that my father was now the god of her idolatry and that my return was not too welcome to my aunt and cousin but as soon as she was gone and i was left alone home began to speak to me in soft and entrancing whispers how my pulses beat how my nerves tingled home home home from that dear spot everything seemed to be the same and everything had something to say to me what sweet and tender and touching memories here was the big black fourpost bed with the rosary hanging at its head and here was the prayingstool with the figure of our lady on the wall above it i threw up the window and there was the salt breath of the sea in the crisp island air there was the sea itself glistening in the afternoon sunshine there was st marys rock draped in its garment of seaweed and there were the clouds of white seagulls whirling about it taking off my hat and coat i stepped downstairs and out of the housegoing first into the farmyard where the springless carts were still clattering over the cobblestones then into the cowhouse where the milkmaids were still sitting on low stools with their heads against the sides of the sloweyed brownies and the milk rattling in their noisy pails then into the farmkitchen where the air was full of the odour of burning turf and the still sweeter smell of cakes baking on a griddle and finally into the pottingshed in the garden where tommy the mate more than ever like a weatherbeaten old salt was still working as before the old man looked round with his starboard eye and recognised me instantly god bless my sowl he cried if it isnt the lil missy well well well well and shes a woman grown a real lady too my gracious yes he said after a second and longer look and there hasnt been the match of her on this island since they laid her mother under the sod i wanted to ask him a hundred questions but aunt bridget who had been watching from a window called from the house to say she was mashing a cup of tea for me so i returned to the drawingroom where my father being busy with his letters in the library betsy beauty talked for half an hour about lord raa his good looks distinguished manners and general accomplishments but arent you just dying to see him she said i saw him the following morning twentyfifth chapter i was sitting in my own room writing to the reverend mother to tell her of my return home when i heard the toot of a horn and raising my eyes saw a motorcar coming up the drive it contained three gentlemen one of them wore goggles and carried a silverhaired terrier on his knees a little later nessy macleod came to tell me that lord raa and his party had arrived and i was wanted immediately i went downstairs hesitatingly with a haunting sense of coming trouble reaching the door of the drawingroom i saw my intended husband for the first timethere being nothing in his appearance to awaken in me the memory of ever having seen him before he was on the hearthrug in front of the fire talking to betsy beauty who was laughing immoderately to get a better look at him and at the same time to compose myself i stopped for a moment to speak to the three gentlemen the two lawyers and lord raas trustee or guardian who were standing with my father in the middle of the floor he was undoubtedly welldressed and had a certain air of breeding but even to my girlish eyes he betrayed at that first sight the character of a man who had lived an irregular perhaps a dissipated life his face was pale almost puffy his grey eyes were slow and heavy his moustache was dark and small his hair was thin over his forehead and he had a general appearance of being much older than his years which i knew to be thirtythree his manners when i approached him were courteous and gentle almost playful and indulgent but through all their softness there pierced a certain hardness not to say brutality which i afterwards learned when life had had its tug at me to associate with a man who has spent much of his time among women of loose character betsy beauty made a great matter of introducing us but in a drawling voice and with a certain play of humour he told her it was quite unnecessary since we were very old friends having made each others acquaintance as far back as ten years ago when i was the prettiest little woman in the world he remembered though perhaps my manners were not quite cordial we had a slight difference on the subject of kisses dont you remember it happily there was no necessity to reply for my father came to say that he wished to show his lordship the improvements he had been making and the rest of us were at liberty to follow them the improvements consisted chiefly of a new wing to the old house containing a dining room still unfurnished which had been modelled as i found later on the corresponding room in castle raa with a proud lift of his white head my father pointed out the beauties of his new possession while my intended husband with his monocle to his eye looked on with a certain condescension and answered with a languid humour that narrowly bordered on contempt oak sir solid oak said my father rapping with his knuckles on the tall dark heavy wainscoting as old as our hearts and as hard as our heads i suppose said lord raa harder than some sir said my father exactly said lord raa in his slow drawl and then there was general laughter the bell rang for luncheon and we went into the plain old dining room where aunt bridget placed her principal guest on her right and told him all about her late husband the colonel his honours and military achievements i could see that lord raa was soon very weary of this and more than once sitting by his side i caught the cynical and rather supercilious responses to which under the gloss of his gracious manners aunt bridget seemed quite oblivious i was so nervous and embarrassed that i spoke very little during luncheon and even aunt bridget observed this at last mary dear why dont you speak she said but without waiting for my reply she proceeded to explain to his lordship that the strangest change had come over me since i was a child when i had been the sauciest little chatterbox in the world whereas now i was so shy that it was nearly impossible to get a word out of me hope i shall be able to get one word out of her at least said his lordship whereupon aunt bridget smiled significantly and betsy beauty burst into fits of laughter almost before the meal was over my father rose from his seat at the head of the table and indicating the lawyers who sat near to him he said these gentlemen and i have business to fix upmoney matters and all thatso i guess well step into the library and leave you young people to look after yourselves everybody rose to leave the room all back for teatime said aunt bridget of course you dont want me said betsy beauty with a giggle and at the next moment i was alone with his lordship who drew a long breath that was almost like a yawn and said is there no quiet place we can slip away to there was the glen at the back of the house the cape flora of martin conrad so i took him into that not without an increasing sense of embarrassment it was a clear october day the glen was dry and the air under the shadow of the thinning trees was full of the soft light of the late autumn ah this is better said his lordship he lit a cigar and walked for some time by my side without speaking merely flicking the seeding heads off the dying thistles with his walking stick and then ruckling it through the withered leaves with which the path was strewn but half way up the glen he began to look aslant at me through his monocle and then to talk about my life in rome wondering how i could have been content to stay so long at the convent and hinting at a rumour which had reached him that i had actually wished to stay there altogether extraordinary pon my word extraordinary its well enough for women who have suffered shipwreck in their lives to live in such places but for a young gal with any fortune any looks why i wonder she doesnt die of ennui i was still too nervous and embarrassed to make much protest so he went on to tell me with what difficulty he supported the boredom of his own life even in london with its clubs its racemeetings its dances its theatres and music halls and the amusement to be got out of some of the ladies of society not to speak of certain wellknown professional beauties one of his great friendshis name was eastcliffwas going to marry the most famous of the latter class a foreign dancer at the empire and since he was rich and could afford to please himself why shouldnt he when we reached the waterfall at the top of the glen it had been the north cape of martin conrad we sat on a rustic seat which stands there and then to my still deeper embarrassment his lordships conversation came to close quarters throwing away his cigar and taking his silverhaired terrier on his lap he said of course you know what the business is which the gentlemen are discussing in the library as well as i could for the nervousness that was stifling me i answered that i knew he stroked the dog with one hand prodded his stick into the gravel with the other and said well i dont know what your views about marriage are mine i may say are liberal i listened without attempting to reply i think ninetenths of the trouble that attends married lifethe breakdowns and what notcome of an irrational effort to tighten the marriage knot still i said nothing to imagine that two independent human beings can be tied together like a couple of siamese twins neither to move without the other living precisely the same life year in year out why its silly positively silly in my ignorance i could find nothing to say and after another moment my intended husband swished the loosened gravel with his stick and said i believe in married people leaving each other freeeach going his and her own waywhat do you think i must have stammered some kind of answeri dont know whatfor i remember that he said next quite so thats my view of matrimony and im glad to see you appear to share it tell the truth i was afraid you wouldnt he added with something more about the nuns and the convent i wanted to say that i didnt but my nervousness was increasing every moment and before i could find words in which to protest he was speaking to me again our friends in the library seem to think that you and i could get along together and im disposed to think theyre rightarent you in my ignorance and helplessness and with the consciousness of what i was expected to do i merely looked at him without speaking then he fixed his monocle afresh and looking back at me in a curious way he said i dont think i should bore you my dear in fact i should be rather proud of having a goodlooking woman for my wife and i fancy i could give you a good time in any casethis with a certain condescensionmy name might be of some use to you a sort of shame was creeping over me the dog was yawning in my face my intended husband threw it off his knee shall we consider it a settled thing then he asked and when in my confusion i still made no reply having nothing which i felt myself entitled to say he said something about aunt bridget and what she had told him at luncheon about my silence and shyness and then rising to his feet he put my arm through his own and turned our faces towards home that was all as i am a truthful woman that was everything not a word from me nay not half a word merely a passive act of silent acquiescence and in my youthful and almost criminal innocence i was committed to the most momentous incident of my life but if there was no lovemaking no fondling no kissing no courtship of any kind and none of the delirious rapture which used to be described in almas novels i was really grateful for that and immensely relieved to find that matters could he completed without them when we reached the house the bell was ringing for tea and my father was coming out of the library followed by the lawyers so thats all right gentlemen he was saying yes thats all right sir they were answering and then seeing us as we entered my father said to lord raa and what about you two were all right also said his lordship in his drawling voice good said my father and he slapped his lordship sharply on the back to his surprise and i think discomfiture then with a cackle of light laughter among the men we all trooped into the drawing room aunt bridget in her goldrimmed spectacles and new white cap poured out the tea from our best silver teapot while nessy macleod with a geranium in her red hair and betsy beauty with large red roses in her bosom handed round the cups after a moment my father with a radiant face standing back to the fire said in a loud voice friends all i have something to tell you everybody except myself looked up and listened though everybody knew what was coming weve had a stiff tussle in the library this afternoon but everything is settled satisfactoryand the marriage is as good as made there was a chorus of congratulations for me and a few for his lordship and then my father said again of course therell be deeds to draw up and i want things done correct even if it costs me a bit of money but weve only one thing more to fix up today and then were throughthe wedding when is it to come off an appeal was made to me but i felt it was only formal so i glanced across to lord raa without speaking come now said my father looking from one to the other the clean cut is the short cut you know and when im sot on doing a thing i cant take rest till its done what do you say to this day next month i bowed and my intended husband in his languid way said agreed a few minutes afterwards the motor was ordered round and the gentlemen prepared to go then the silverhaired terrier was missed and for the first time that day his lordship betrayed a vivid interest telling us its price and pedigree and how much he would give rather than lose it but at the last moment tommy appeared with the dog in his arms and dropped it into the car whereupon my intended husband thanked him effusively yes said tommy i thought you set store by that sir at the next moment the car was gone well you are a lucky girl said betsy beauty and aunt bridget began to take credit to herself for all that had come to pass and to indicate the methods by which she meant to manage castle raa as soon as ever i became mistress of it thus in my youth my helplessness my ignorance and my inexperience i became engaged to the man who had been found and courted for me if i acquiesced i had certainly not been consulted my father had not consulted me my intended husband had not consulted me nobody consulted me i am not even sure that i thought anybody was under any obligation to consult me love had not spoken to me sex was still asleep in me and my marriage was arranged before my deeper nature knew what was being done twentysixth chapter the next weeks were full of hurry hubbub and perturbation our house was turned upside down milliners sewingmaids and dressmakers were working day and night flowers feathers and silk remnants were flowing like seawrack into every room orders were given orders were retracted and given again and then again retracted such flying up and down stairs everybody so breathless everybody so happy every face wearing a smile every tongue rippling with laughter the big grey mansion which used to seem so chill and cold felt for the first time like a house of joy in the midst of these busy preparations i had no time to think my senses were excited i was dazed stunned wrapped round by a kind of warm air of hothouse happiness and this condition of moral intoxication increased as the passing of the days brought fresh developments our neighbours began to visit us my father had been right about the great people of the island though they had stood off so long they found their account in my good fortune and as soon as my marriage was announced they came in troops to offer their congratulations never according to tommy the mate had the gravel of our carriage drive been so rucked up by the pawing feet of highbred horses but their owners were no less restless it was almost pitiful to see their shamefacedness as they entered our house for the first time and to watch the shifts they were put to in order to account for the fact that they had never been there before aunt bridgets vanity was too much uplifted by their presence to be particular about their excuses but my fathers contempt of their subterfuges was naked and undisguised and i hardly know whether to feel amused or ashamed when i think of how he scored off them how he lashed them to the bone with what irony and sarcasm he scorched their timeserving little souls when they were very great folks the aristocracy of ellan he pretended not to know who they were and asked their names their fathers names and what parishes they came from some of the christians of ballachristian are you think of that now and me a born ellanman and not knowing you from adam when they were very near neighbours with lands that made boundary with our own he pretended to think they had been twenty years abroad or perhaps sick or even dead and buried too bad maam too bad he would say and me thinking you were under the sod through all the lonely years my poor wife was ill and dying but when they were insular officials who walked on the stars and sometimes snubbed him in public the rapier of ridicule was too light for his heavy hand and he took up the sledgehammer telling them he was the same man today as yesterday and only his circumstances were differenthis daughter being about to become the lady of the first house in the island and none of them being big enough to be left out of it after such scenes aunt bridget for all her despotism within her own doors used to tremble with dread of our neighbours taking lasting offence but my father would say chut woman theyll come again and make no more faces about it they did and if they were shy of my father they were gracious enough to me saying it was such a good thing for society in the island that castle raa was to have a lady a real lady at the head of it at last then came their wedding presentspictures books silver ornaments gold ornaments clocks watches chains jewellery until my bedroom was blocked up with them as each fresh parcel arrived there would be a rush of all the female members of our household to open it after which betsy beauty would say what a lucky girl you are i began to think i was i found it impossible to remain unaffected by the whirlwind of joyous turmoil in which i lived the refulgence of the present hour wiped out the past which seemed to fade away altogether after the first few days i was flying about from place to place and wherever i went i was a subject for congratulation and envy if there were moments of misgiving when like the cold wind out of a tunnel there came the memory of the reverend mother and the story she had told me at nemi there were other moments when i felt quite sure that in marrying lord raa i should be doing a selfsacrificing thing and a kind of solemn duty one such moment was when mr curphy my fathers advocate who with his clammy hands always made me think of an overfatted fish came to tell him that after serious legal difficulties the civil documents had been agreed to for after he had finished with my father he drew me aside and said as he smoothed his long brown beard you ought to be a happy girl mary i suppose you know what you are doing for your father you are wiping out the greatest disappointment of his life and rectifying the crueltythe inevitable crueltyof the law when you were born a daughter after he had expected a son another such moment was when the bishop came in his grand carriage to say that after much discussion he had persuaded his lordship to sign the necessary declaration that all the children of our union irrespective of sex should be brought up as catholics for taking me aside as the advocate had done the day before he said in his suave voice fingering his jewelled cross i congratulate you my child yours is a great and precious privilegethe privilege of bringing back to the church a family which has been estranged from it for nineteen years at the end of a fortnight we signed the marriage settlement the little ceremony took place in the drawingroom of my fathers house my intended husband who had not been to see me in the meantime brought with him as well as his trustee and lawyer a lady and a gentleman the lady was his maiden aunt lady margaret anslem a fair woman of about forty fashionably dressed redolent of perfume and except to me to whom she talked quite amicably rather reserved and haughty as if the marriage of her nephew into our family were a bitter pill which she had compelled herself to swallow the gentleman was a tall young man wearing a very high collar and cravat and using a handkerchief with embroidered initials in the corner of it he turned out to be the hon edward eastcliffthe great friend who being rich enough to please himself was about to marry the professional beauty i noticed that aunt bridget with something of the instinct of the fly about the flame immediately fixed herself upon the one and that betsy beauty attached herself to the other lord raa himself looked as tired as before and for the first halfhour he behaved as if he did not quite know what to do with himself for wretchedness and ennui then the deeds were opened and spread out on a table and though the gentlemen seemed to be trying not to discuss the contents aloud i could not help hearing some of the arrangements that had been made for the payment of my intended husbands debts and certain details of his annual allowance looking back upon that ugly hour i wonder why under the circumstances i should have been so wounded but i remember that a sense of discomfort amounting to shame came upon me at sight of the sorry bargaining it seemed to have so little to do with the spiritual union of souls which i had been taught to think marriage should be but i had no time to think more about that before my father who had signed the documents himself in his large heavy hand was saying now gel come along were waiting for your signature i cannot remember that i read anything i cannot remember that anything was read to me i was told where to sign and i signed thinking what must be must be and that was all i had to do with the matter i was feeling a little sick nevertheless and standing by the tire with one foot on the fender when lord raa came up to me at the end and said in his drawling voice so its done yes its done i answered after a moment he talked of where we were to live saying we must of course pass most of our time in london but have you any choice about the honeymoon he said where we should spend it i mean i answered that he would know best but when he insisted on my choosing saying it was my right to do so i remembered that during my time in the convent the one country in the world i had most desired to see was the holy land never as long as i live shall i forget the look in his lordships grey eyes when i gave this as my selection you mean jerusalemnazareththe dead sea and all that he asked i felt my face growing red as at a frightful faux pas but his lordship only laughed called me his little nun and said that since i had been willing to leave the choice to him he would suggest egypt and italy and berlin and paris on the way back with the condition that we left ellan for london on the day of our marriage after the party from castle raa had gone leaving some of their family lace and pearls behind for the bride to wear at her wedding and after aunt bridget had hoped that that woman meaning lady margaret didnt intend to live at the castle after my marriage because such a thing would not fit in with her plans at all at all i mentioned the arrangements for the honeymoon whereupon betsy beauty to whom italy was paradise and london glimmered in an atmosphere of vermillion and gold cried out as usual what a lucky lucky girl you are but the excitement which had hitherto buoyed me up was partly dispelled by this time and i was beginning to feel some doubt of it twentyseventh chapter as my weddingday approached and time ran short the air of joy which had pervaded our house was driven out by an atmosphere of irritation we were all living on our nerves the smiles that used to be at everybodys service gave place to frowns and in aunt bridgets case to angry words which were distributed on all sides and on all occasions as a consequence i took refuge in my room and sat long hours there in my dressinggown and slippers hearing the hubbub that was going on in the rest of the house but taking as little part in it as possible in this semiconventual silence and solitude the excitement which had swept me along for three weeks subsided rapidly i began to think and above all to feel and the one thing i felt beyond everything else was a sense of something wanting i remembered the beautiful words of the pope about marriage as a mystic relation a sacred union of souls a bond of love such as christs love for his church and i asked myself if i felt any such love for the man who was to become my husband i knew i did not i reminded myself that i had had nearly no conversation with him that our intercourse had been of the briefest that i had seen him only three times altogether and that i scarcely knew him at all and yet i was going to marry him in a few days more i should be his wife and we should be bound together as long as life should last then i remembered what father dan had said about a girls first love her first loveletter and all the sweet good things that should come to her at the time of her marriage none of them had come to me i do not think my thoughts of love were ever disturbed by any expectation of the delights of the heartlanguors of tenderness long embraces sighs and kisses and the joys and fevers of the fleshfor i knew nothing about them but nevertheless i asked myself if i had mistaken the matter altogether was love really necessary in all their busy preparations neither my father nor my husband nor the lawyers nor the bishop himself had said anything about that i began to sleep badly and to dream it was always the same dream i was in a frozen region of the far north or south living in a ship which was stuck fast in the ice and had a great frowning barrier before it that was full of dangerous crevasses then for some reason i wanted to write a letter but was unable to do so because somebody had trodden on my pen and broken it it seems strange to me now as i look back upon that time that i did not know what angel was troubling the waters of my soulthat nature was whispering to me as it whispers to every girl at the first great crisis of her life but neither did i know what angel was leading my footsteps when three mornings before my weddingday i got up early and went out to walk in the crisp salt air almost without thinking i turned down the lane that led to the shore and before i was conscious of where i was going i found myself near sunny lodge the chimney was smoking for breakfast and there was a smell of burning turf coming from the house which was so pretty and unchanged with the last of the years roses creeping over the porch and round the windows of the room in which i had slept when a child somebody was digging in the garden it was the doctor in his shirt sleeves good morning doctor i called speaking over the fence he rested on his spade and looked up but did not speak for a moment dont you know who i am i asked why yes of course you must be without finishing he turned his head towards the porch and cried mother mother come and see whos here at last martins mother came out of the porch a little smaller i thought but with the same dear womanly face over her light print frock which was as sweet as mayblossom she held up both hands at sight of me and cried there now what did i tell you doctor didnt i say they might marry her to fifty lords but she wouldnt forget her old friends i laughed the doctor laughed and then she laughed and the sweetest part of it was that she did not know what we were laughing at then i opened the gate and stepped up and held out my hand and involuntarily she wiped her own hand which was covered with meal from the porridge she was making before taking mine goodness me its mary oneill yes its i but let me have a right look at you she said taking me now by both hands they were saying such wonderful things about the young misthress that i wasnt willing to believe them but no no she said after a moment they didnt tell me the half i was still laughing but it was as much as i could do not to cry so i said may i come in my goodness yes and welcome she said and calling to the doctor to wash his hands and follow us she led the way into the kitchenparlour where the kettle was singing from the slowery and a porridgepot was bubbling over the fire sit down take the elbowchair in the chiollagh the hearth place there thats nice aw yes you know the house being by this time unable to speak for a lump in my throat that was hurting me i looked round the room so sweet so homely so closely linked with tender memories of my childhood while martins mother herself a little nervous and with a touching softness in her face went on talking while she stirred the porridge with a porridgestick well well to think of all the years since you came singing carols to my door you remember it dont you of course you do doctor i said dont talk foolish shell not forget i know mary oneill she may be going to be a great lady but havent i nursed her on my knee then youve heard whats to happen i asked aw yes woman yes she answered in a sadder tone i thought everybodys bound to hear itwhat with the bands practising for the procession and the bullocks roasting for the poor and the fireworks and the illuminations and i dont know what she was silent for a moment after that and then in her simple way she said but its all as one if you love the man even if he is a lord you think thats necessary dont you what millish love you think its necessary to love ones husband goodness sakes girl yes if you dont have love what have you whats to keep the pot boiling when the fires getting low and the winters coming on maybe the doctors telling me some of the fine ladies in london are marrying without itjust for money and titles and all to that but i cant believe it i really cant theyve got their troubles same as ourselves poor things and whats the use of their fine clothes and grand carriages when the dark days come and the nights falling on them it was harder than ever to speak now so i got up to look at some silver cups that stood on the mantelpiece martins said his mother to whom they were precious as rubies he won them at swimming and running and leaping and climbing and all to that aw yes yes he was always grand at games if he couldnt learn his lessons poor boy and now hes gone away from uslooking for south poles somewheres i knowi saw him in rome said i she dropped her porridgestick and looked at me with big eyes saw him in rome you say after he sailed you mean i nodded and then she cried excitedly to the doctor who was just then coming into the house after washing his hands under the pump father she saw himself in rome after he sailed there was only one himself in that house therefore it was not difficult for the doctor to know who was meant and so great was the eagerness of the old people to hear the last news of the son who was the apple of their eye that i had to stay to breakfast and tell them all about our meeting while martins mother laid the tables with oatcake and honey and bowls of milk and deep plates for the porridge i told the little there was to tell and then listened to their simple comments there now doctor think of that those two meeting in foreign parts that used to be such friends when they were children like brother and sister you might say and whiles and whiles we were thinking that some day but well say no more about that now doctor no well say no more about that now christian ann said the doctor then there was a moment of silence and it was just as if they had been rummaging among halfforgotten things in a dark corner of their house and had come upon a cradle and the child that had lived in it was dead it was sweet but it was also painful to stay long in that house of love and as soon as i had eaten my oatcake and honey i got up to go the two good souls saw me to the door saying i was not to expect either of them at the big house on my weddingday because she was no woman for smart clothes and the doctor who was growing rheumatic had given up his nightcalls and therefore his gig so as to keep down expenses well be at the church though said martins mother and if we dont see you to speak to youll know were there and wishing you happiness in our hearts i could not utter a word when i left them but after i had walked a little way i looked back intending to wave my farewell and there they were together at the gate still and one of her hands was on the doctors shoulderthe sweet woman who had chosen love against the world and did not regret it even now when the night was falling on her i had to pass the presbytery on my way home and as i did so i saw father dan in his study he threw up the window sash and called in a soft voice asking me to wait until he came down to me he came down hurriedly just as he was in his worn and discoloured cassock and biretta and walked up the road by my side breathing rapidly and obviously much agitated the bishop is staying with me over the wedding and he is in such a fury that dont worry it will be all right but yes did you see young martin conrad while you were in rome i answered that i did and did anything pass between you about your marriage i mean i told him all that i had said to martin and all that martin had said to me because he has written a long letter to the bishop denouncing it and calling on him to stop it to stop it thats so he says it is nothing but trade and barter and if the church is willing to give its blessing to such rank commercialism let it bless the stock exchange let it sanctify the slave market well the bishop threatens to tell your father who is this young man he says who dares to but if i thought there was nothing more to your marriage than if i imagined that what occurred in the case of your dear mother but thats not all not all no martin has written to me too saying worsefar worse what does he say father dan i dont really know if i ought to tell you i really dont yet if its true if theres anything in it i was trembling but i begged him to tell me what martin had said he told me it was about my intended husbandthat he was a man of irregular life a notorious loose liver who kept up a connection with somebody in london a kind of actress who was practically his wife already and therefore his marriage with me would beso martin had saidnothing but legalised and sanctified concubinage with many breaks and pauses my dear old priest told me this story as if it were something so infamous that his simple and innocent heart could scarcely credit it if i really thought it was true he said that a man living such a life could come here to marry my little but no god could not suffer a thing like that i must ask though i must make sure we live so far away in this little island that but i must go back now the bishop will be calling for me still deeply agitated father dan left me by the bridge and at the gate of our drive i found tommy the mate on a ladder covering with flowers from the conservatory a triumphal arch which the joiner had hammered up the day before the old man hardly noticed me as i passed through and this prompted me to look up and speak to him tommy i said do you know you are the only one who hasnt said a good word to me about my marriage am i missy he answered without looking down then maybe thats because ive had so many bad ones to say to other people i asked which other people old johnny christopher for one i met him last night at the horse and saddle grand doings at the big house theyre telling me says johnny i wont say no i says itll be a proud day for the granddaughter of neill the lord when shes mistress of castle raa says johnny maybe so i says but itll be a prouder day for castle raa when she sets her clane little foot in it twentyeighth chapter i should find it difficult now after all that has happened since to convey an adequate idea of the sense of shame and personal dishonour which was produced in me by father dans account of the contents of martins letter it was like opening a door out of a beautiful garden into a stagnant ditch that martins story was true i had never one moments doubt first because martin had told it and next because it agreed at all points with the little i had learned of lord raa in the only real conversation i had yet had with him obviously he cared for the other woman and if like his friend eastcliff he had been rich enough to please himself he would have married her but being in debt and therefore in need of an allowance he was marrying me in return for my fathers money it was shocking it was sinful i could not believe that my father the lawyers and the bishop knew anything about it i determined to tell them but how to do so being what i was a young girl out of a convent i did not know never before had i felt so deeply the need of my mother if she had been alive i should have gone to her and with my arms about her neck and my face in her breast i should have told her all my trouble there was nobody but aunt bridget and little as i had ever expected to go to her under any circumstances with many misgivings and after much hesitation i went it was the morning before the day of my marriage i followed my aunt as she passed through the house like a biting march wind scolding everybody until i found her in her own room she was ironing her new white cap and as i entered looking pale i suppose she flopped down her flat iron on to its stand and cried goodness me girl whats amiss caught a cold with your morning walks eh havent i enough on my hands without that we must send for the doctor straight we cant have you laid up now after all this trouble and expense it isnt that auntie then in the name of goodness what is it i told her as well as i could for the cold grey eyes that kept looking at me through their goldrimmed spectacles at first my aunt listened with amazement and then she laughed outright so youve heard that story have you mary oneill she said with a thump of her flat iron im surprised at you i asked if she thought it wasnt true how do i know if its true and what do i care whether it is or isnt young men will be young men i suppose she went on with her ironing as she added did you expect you were marrying a virgin if every woman asked for that there would be a nice lot of old maids in the world wouldnt there i felt myself flushing up to the forehead yet i managed to say but if he is practically married to the other woman not he married whoever thinks about marriage in company like that you might as well talk about marriage in the hen coop but all the same if he cares for her auntie who says he cares for her and if he does hell settle her off and get rid of her before he marries you but will that be right i said whereupon my aunt rested her iron and looked at me as if i had said something shameful mary oneill what do you mean of course it will be right he shouldnt have two women should he do you think the mans a barndoor rooster my confusion was increasing but i said that in any case my intended husband could not care for me or he would have seen more of me oh youll see enough of him by and by dont you worry about that i said i was not sure that he had made me care much for him time enough for that too you cant expect the man to work miracles then with what courage was left me i tried to say that i had been taught to think of marriage as a sacrament instituted by the almighty so that those who entered it might live together in union peace and love whereas but i had to stop for aunt bridget who had been looking at me with her hard lip curled said tut thats all right to go to church with on sunday but on weekdays marriage is no moonshine i can tell you its a practical matter just an arrangement for making a home and getting a family and bringing up childrenthats what marriage is if you ask me but dont you think love is necessary depends what you mean by love if you mean what they talk about in poetry and songsbleeding hearts and sighs and kisses and all that nonsenseno said my aunt with a heavy bang on her ironing thats what people mean when they talk about marrying for love and it generally ends in poverty and misery and sensible women have nothing to do with it look at me she said spitting on the bottom of her iron do you think i married for love when i married the colonel no indeed heres a quiet respectable man with a nice income i said and if i put my little bit to his little bit well get along comfortably if he is a taste in years i said look at your mother though she was one of the marryingforlove kind and if we had let her have her way where would she have been afterwards with her fifteen years as an invalid and where would you have been by this time no said aunt bridget bringing down her flatiron with a still heavier bang a commonsense marriage founded on suitability of position and property and all that is the only proper sort of match and thats whats before you now girl so for goodness sake dont go about like the parish pan letting every busybody make mischief with you my betsy wouldnt if she had your chancei can tell you that much my lady i did not speak there was another bang or two of the flatiron and then besides love will come of course it will it will come in time if you dont exactly love your husband when you marry him youll love him later on a wife ought to teach herself to love her husband i know i had to and if but if she cant auntie then she ought to be ashamed of herself and say nothing about it it was useless to say more so i rose to go yes go said aunt bridget im so bothered with other peoples business that my heads all throughothers and mary oneill she said looking after me as i passed through the door for mercys sake do brighten up a hit and dont look as if marrying a husband was like taking a dose of jalap it isnt as bad as that anyway it served me right i should have known better my aunt and i spoke different languages we stood on different ground returning to my room i found a letter from father dan it ran dear daughter in jesus i have been afraid to go far into the story we spoke about from fear of offending my bishop but i have inquired of your father and he assures me that there is not a word of truth in it so i am compelled to believe that our good martin must have been misinformed and am dismissing the matter from my mind trusting you will dismiss it from your mind also yours in xt dd twentyninth chapter i could not do as father dan advised being now enmeshed in the threads of innumerable impulses unknown to myself and therefore firmly convinced that martins story was not only true but a part of the whole sordid business whereby a husband was being bought for me with this thought i went about all day asking myself what i could do even yet but finding no answer until nine oclock at night when immediately after supper we lived country fashion aunt bridget said now then off to bed girls everybody must be stirring early in the morning and then i slipped upstairs to my room and replied to father dan never had i written such a letter before i poured my whole heart on to the paper saying what marriage meant to me as the pope himself had explained it a sacrament implying and requiring love as the very soul of it and since i did not feel this love for the man i was about to marry and had no grounds for thinking he felt it for me and being sure that other reasons had operated to bring us together i begged father dan by his memory of my mother and his affection for me and his desire to see me good and happy to intervene with my father and the bishop even at this late hour and at the church door itself to stop the ceremony it was late before i finished and i thought the household was asleep but just as i was coming to an end i heard my father moving in the room below and then a sudden impulse came to me and with a new thought i went downstairs and knocked at his door whos there he cried come in he was sitting in his shirt sleeves shaving before a lookingglass which was propped up against two ledgers the lather on his upper lip gave his face a fierce if rather grotesque expression oh its you he said sit down got to do this tonightgoodness knows if ill have time for it in the morning i took the seat in the ingle which father dan occupied on the night of my birth the fire had nearly burnt out thought you were in bed by this time guess i should have been in bed myself but for this business look therehe pointed with the handle of his razor to the table littered with papersthats a bit of what ive had to do for you i kind o think you ought to be grateful to your father my gel i told him he was very kind and then very nervously said but are you sure its quite right sir not catching my meaning he laughed right he said holding the point of his nose aside between the tips of his left thumb and first finger guess its about as right as law and wax can make it i dont mean that sir i mean what he said facing round then trembling and stammering i told him i did not love lord raa lord raa did not love me therefore i begged him for my sake for his sake for everybodys sake i think i said for my mothers sake also to postpone our marriage at first my father seemed unable to believe his own ears postpone now after all this money spent and everything signed and sealed and witnessed yes if you please sir because i got no farther for flinging down his razor my father rose in a towering rage are you mad has somebody been putting the evil eye on you the greatest match this island has ever seen and you say postponeput it off stop it thats what you mean do you want to make a fool of a man at the last moment too just when theres nothing left but to go to the high bailiff and the church but i seei see what it is its that young conradhes been writing to you i tried to say no but my father bore me down dont go to deny it maam he has been writing to every onethe bishop father dan myself even denouncing the marriage if you plaze my father in his great excitement was breaking with withering scorn into his native speech aw yes though denouncing and damning it theyre telling me mighty neighbourly of him im sure just a neighbour lad without a penny at his back to take all that throuble if i had known he felt like that about it i might have axed his consent the imperence though the imperence of sin a father has no rights it seems a daughter is a separate being and all to that well well amazing thick isnt it he was walking up and down the room with his heavy tread making the floor shake then that woman in romei wouldnt trust but she has been putting notions into your head too all the newfangled fooleries ill go bail women and men equal not a haporth of difference between them the blatherskites i was silenced and i must have covered my face and cried for after a while my father softened and touching my shoulder he asked me if a man of sixtyfive was not likely to know better than a girl of nineteen what was good for her and whether i supposed he had not satisfied himself that this marriage was a good thing for me and for him and for everybody do you think im not doing my best for you gelmy very best i must have made some kind of assent for he said then dont moither me any more and dont let your aunt bridget moither metelling me and telling me what i might have done for her own daughter instead at last with a kind of rough tenderness he took me by the arm and raised me to my feet there there go to bed and get some sleep well have to start off for the high bailiffs early in the morning my will was broken down i could resist no longer without a word more i left him returning to my room i took the letter i had been writing to father dan and tore it up piece by piece as i did so i felt as if i were tearing up a living thingsomething of myself my heart and all that was contained in it then i threw open the window and leant out i could hear the murmur of the sea i felt as if it were calling to me though i could not interpret its voice the salt air was damp and it refreshed my eyelids at length i got into bed shivering with cold when i had put out the light i noticed that the moon which was near the full had a big yellow ring of luminous vapour around it thirtieth chapter my sleep that night was much troubled by dreams it was the same dream as before again and again repeatedthe dream of frozen regions and of the great ice barrier and then of the broken pen when i awoke in the hazy light of the dawn i thought of what the pope had said about beginning my weddingday with penance and communion so i rose at once to go to church the dawn was broadening but the household was still asleep only the servants in the kitchen stirring when i stepped through a side door and set out across the fields the dew was thick on the grass and under the gloom of a heavy sky the day looked cold and cheerless a wind from the southeast had risen during the night the sea was white with breakers and from st marys rock there came the faroff moaning of surging waves the church too when i reached it looked empty and chill the sacristan in the dim choir was arranging lilies and marguerites about the high altar and only one poor woman with a little red and black shawl over her head and shoulders was kneeling in the side chapel where father dan was saying mass with a sleepy little boy in clogs to serve him the woman was quite young almost as young as myself but she was already a widow having lately lost her husband at the herrings somewhere up by stornoway where he had gone down in a gale leaving her with one child a year old and another soon to come all this she told me the moment i knelt near her the poor thing seemed to think i ought to have remembered her for she had been at school with me in the village im bella quark that was she whispered i married willie shimmin of the lhen you recollect its only a month this morning since he was lost but it seems like years and years there isnt nothing in the world like it she knew about my marriage and said she wished me joy though the world was so dark and lonely for some then she said something about her lil willie she had left him asleep in her cottage on the curragh and he might awake and cry before she got back so she hoped father dan wouldnt keep her long i was so touched by the poor things trouble that i almost forgot my own and creeping up to her side i put my arm through hers as we knelt together and that was how the father found us when he turned to put the holy wafer on our tongues the wind must have risen higher while i was in the church for when i was returning across the fields it lashed my skirts about my legs so that i could scarcely walk a mist had come down and made a sort of monotonous movement in the mountains where they touched the vague line of the heavy sky i should be afraid to say that nature was still trying to speak to me in her strange inarticulate voice but i cannot forget that a flock of yearlings which had been sheltering under a hedge followed me bleating to the last fence and that the moaning of the sea about st marys rock was the last sound i heard as i reentered the house everything there was running like a millrace by this time the servants were flying to and fro my cousins were calling downstairs in accents of alarm aunt bridget was answering them in tones of vexation and my father was opening doors with a heavy push and closing them with a clash they were all so suddenly pacified when i appeared that it flashed upon me at the moment that they must have thought i had run away goodness gracious me girl where have you been said aunt bridget i told her and she was beginning to reproach me for not ordering round the carriage instead of making my boots and stockings damp by traipsing across the grass when my father said thatll do thatll do change them and take a snack of something i guess were due at holmtown in half an hour i ate my breakfast standing the car was brought round and by eight oclock my father and i arrived at the house of the high bailiff who had to perform the civil ceremony of my marriage according to the conditions required by law the high bailiff was on one knee before the fire in his office holding a newspaper in front of it to make it burn nobody else here yet asked my father traa dy liooar time enough the high bailiff muttered he was an elderly man of intemperate habits who spent his nights at the crown and mitre and was apparently out of humour at having been brought out of bed so early his office was a room of his private house it had a high desk a stool and a revolving chair placards were pinned on the walls one over another and a testament with the binding much worn lay on a table the place looked half like a doctors consulting room and half like a small police court presently mr curphy my fathers advocate came in rather irritatingly cheerful in that chill atmosphere and half an hour late my intended husband arrived with his london lawyer and his friend eastcliff my mind was far from clear and i had a sense of seeing things by flashes only but i remember that i thought lord raa was very nervous and it even occurred to me that early as it was he had been drinking beastly nuisance isnt it he said to me aside and then there was something about this legal fuss and fuddlement with the air of a man with a grievance the high bailiff took a big book out of the desk and a smaller one off a shelf and then we sat in a half circle and the ceremony began it was very brief and cold like a matter of business as far as i can remember it consisted of two declarations which lord raa and i made first to the witnesses present and afterwards to each other one of them stated that we knew of no lawful impediment why we should not be joined together in matrimony and the other declared that we were there and then so joined i remember that i repeated the words automatically as the high bailiff in his thick alcoholic voice read them out of the smaller of his books and that lord raa in tones of obvious impatience did the same then the high bailiff opened the bigger of his books and after writing something in it himself he asked lord raa to sign his name and this being done he asked me also am i to sign too i asked vacantly well who else do you think said mr curphy with a laugh betsy beauty perhaps eh come gel come said my father sharply and then i signed i had no longer any will of my own in this as in everything i did whatever was asked of me it was all as dreary and lifeless as an empty house i can remember that it made no sensible impression upon my heart my father gave some money a few shillings i think to the high bailiff who then tore a piece of perforated blue paper out of the bigger of his books and offered it to me saying this belongs to you to me i said who else said mr curphy who was laughing again and then something was said by somebody about marriage lines and no one knowing when a wise woman might not want to use them the civil ceremony of my marriage was now over and lord raa who had been very restless rose to his feet saying beastly early drive anything in the house to steady ones nerves high bailiff the high bailiff made some reply at which the men laughed all except my father then they left me and went into another room the diningroom and i heard the jingling of glasses and the drinking of healths while i sat before the fire with my foot on the fender and my marriage lines in my hand my brain was still numbed i felt as one might feel if drowned in the sea and descending without quite losing consciousness to the depths of its abyss i remember i thought that what i had just gone through differed in no respect from the signing of my marriage settlement except that in the one case i had given my husband rights over my money my fathers money whereas in this case i seemed to have given him rights over myself otherwise it was all so cold so drear so dead so unaffecting the blue paper had slipped out of my hand on to the worn hearthrug when my helpless meditations were interrupted by the thrumming and throbbing of the motorcar outside and by my father who was at the office door saying in his loud commanding voice come gel guess its time for you to be back half an hour afterwards i was in my own room at home and given over to the dressmakers i was still being moved automaticallya creature without strength or will thirtyfirst chapter i have only an indefinite memory of floating vaguely through the sights and sounds of the next two hoursof everybody except myself being wildly excited of my cousins railing repeatedly from unseen regions of the house of aunt bridget scolding indiscriminately of the dressmakers chattering without ceasing as they fitted on my wedding dress of their standing off from me at intervals with cries of delight at the success of their efforts of the wind roaring in the chimney of the churchbells ringing in the distance of the everincreasing moaning of the sea about st marys rock and finally of the rumbling of the rubber wheels of several carriages and the plash of horses hoofs on the gravel of the drive when the dressmakers were done with me i was wearing an ivory satin dress embroidered in silver with a coronal of myrtle and orange blossoms under the old limerick lace of the family veil as well as a string of pearls and one big diamond of the noble house i was marrying into i remember they said my black hair shone with a blue lustre against the sparkling gem and i dare say i looked gay on the outside anyway at last i heard a fluttering of silk outside my room and a running stream of chatter going down the stairs followed by the banging of carriage doors and then my fathers deep voice saying bride ready good time to go i guess he alone had made no effort to dress himself up for he was still wearing his everyday serge and his usual heavy boots there was not even a flower in his buttonhole we did not speak very much on our way to church but i found a certain comfort in his big warm presence as we sat together in the carriage with the windows shut for the rising storm was beginning to frighten me it will be nothing said my father just a puff of wind and a slant of rain maybe the little church was thronged with people even the galleries were full of the children from the village school there was a twittering overhead like that of young birds in a tree and as i walked up the nave on my fathers arm i could not help but hear over the sound of the organ the whispered words of the people in the pews on either side of us dear heart alive the straight like her mother she is bless her goodness yes its the poor misfortunate mother come to life again deed but the daughters in luck though lord raa was waiting for me by the communion rail he looked yet more nervous than in the morning and though he was trying to bear himself with his usual composure there was or i thought there was a certain expression of fear in his face which i had never seen before his friend and witness mr eastcliff wearing a carnation buttonhole was by his side and his aunt lady margaret carrying a sheaf of beautiful white flowers was standing near my own witnesses and bridesmaids betsy beauty and nessy macleod in large hats with soaring black feathers were behind me i could hear the rustle of their rosecoloured skirts and the indistinct buzz of their whispered conversation as well as the more audible reproofs of aunt bridget who in a crinkly black silk dress and a bonnet like a half moon was telling them to be silent and to look placid at the next moment i was conscious that a bell had been rung in the chancel that the organ had stopped that the coughing and hemming in the church had ceased that somebody was saying stand here my lord that lord raa with a nervous laugh was asking here and taking a place by my side that the lighted altar laden with flowers was in front of me and that the bishop in his vestments father dan in his surplice and white stole and a clerk carrying a book and a vessel of holy water were beginning the service surely never was there a sadder ceremony never did any girl under similar circumstances feel a more vivid presentiment of the pains and penalties that follow on a forced and illassorted marriage and yet there came to me in the course of the service such a startling change of thought as wiped out for a while all my sadness made me forget the compulsion that had been put upon me and lifted me into a realm of spiritual ecstasy the bishop began with a short litany which asked gods blessing on the ceremony which was to join together two of his children in the bonds of holy wedlock while that was going on i was conscious of nothing except the howling of the wind about the church windows and the faroff tolling of the bell on st marys rocknothing but this and a voice within me which seemed to say again and again i dont love him i dont love him but hardly had the actual ceremony commenced when i began to be overawed by the solemnity and divine power of the service and by the sense of god leaning over my littleness and guiding me according to his will what did it matter how unworthy were the preparations that had led up to this marriage if god was making it god makes all marriages that are blessed by his church and therefore he overrules to his own good ends all human impulses however sordid or selfish they may be after that thought came to me nothing else seemed to matter and nothing however jarring or incongruous was able to lower the exaltation of my spirit but the service which had this effect upon me appeared to have an exactly opposite effect on lord raa his nervousness increased visibly though he did his best to conceal it by a lightness of manner that sometimes looked like derision thus when the bishop stepped down to us and said james charles munster wilt thou take mary here present for thy lawful wife according to the rite of our holy mother the church my husband halted and stammered over his answer saying beneath his breath i thought i was a heretic but when the corresponding question was put to me and father dan thinking i must be nervous leaned over me and whispered dont worry child take your time i replied a loud clear unfaltering voice i will and again when my husband had to put the ring and the gold and silver on the salver he fumbled and dropped them as he did so and fumbled and dropped them a second time when he had to take them up after they had been blessed laughing too audibly at his own awkwardness and then repeat after the bishop with this ring i thee wed this gold and silver i thee give with my body i thee worship and with all my worldly goods i thee endow he tendered the ring slowly and with an obvious effort but i took it without trembling because i was thinking that in spite of all i had heard of his ways of life this solemn and sacred sacrament made him mine and no one elses it is all very mysterious i cannot account for it i only know it was so and that everything considered it was perhaps the strangest fact of all my life i remember that more than once during the ceremony father dan spoke to me softly and caressingly as if to a child but i felt no need of his comforting for my strength was from a higher source i also remember that it was afterwards said that all through the ceremony the eyes of the newlywedded couple seemed sedulously to shun each other but if i did not look at my husband it was because my marriage was like a prayer to me carrying me back with its sense of purity and sanctity to the little sunlit church in rome where mildred bankes had taken her vows after the marriage service there was nuptial mass and benediction special dispensation from rome and that raised to a still higher pitch the spiritual exaltation which sustained me father dan read the epistle beginning let wives be subject to their husbands and then the bishop read the gospel concluding therefore now they are not two but one flesh what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder i had trembled when i thought of these solemn and sonorous words in the solitude of my own room but now that they were spoken before the congregation i had no fear no misgiving nothing but a sense of rapture and consecration the last words being spoken and lord raa and i being man and wife we stepped into the sacristy to sign the register and not even there did my spirit fail me i took up the pen and signed my name without a tremor but hardly had i done so when i heard a rumbling murmur of voices about mefirst the bishops voice in such a worldly tone and then my fathers and then my husbands and then the voices of many others in light conversation mingled with trills of laughter and then in a moment in a twinkling as fast as a snowflake melts upon a stream the spell of the marriage service seemed to break i have heard since that my eyes were wet at that moment and i seemed to have been crying all through the ceremony i know nothing about that but i do know that i felt a kind of internal shudder and that it was just as if my soul had suddenly awakened from an intoxicating drug the organ began to play the wedding march and my husband putting my arm through his said come there was much audible whispering among the people waiting for us in the church and as we walked towards the door i saw ghostly faces smiling at me on every side and heard ghostly voices speaking in whispers that were like the backward plash of wavelets on the shore sakes alive how whites shes looking though said somebody and then somebody else saidi could not help but hear it dear heart knows if her father has done right for all that i did not look at anybody but i saw martins mother at the back and she was wiping her eyes and saying to some one by her sideit must have been the doctor god bless her for the sweet child veen she always was anyway the storm had increased during the service and the sacristan who was opening the door for us had as much as he could do to hold it against the wind which came with such a rush upon us when we stepped into the porch that my veil and the coronal of myrtle and orange blossoms were torn off my head and blown back into the church god bless my sowl said somebodyit was tommys friend johnny christophertheres some ones would he calling that bad luck though a band of village musicians who were ranged up in the road struck up the black and grey as we stepped out of the churchyard and the next thing i knew was that my husband and i were in the carriage going home he had so far recovered from the frightening effects of the marriage service that he was making light of it and saying when will this mummery come to an end i wonder the windows of the carriage were rattling with the wind and my husband had begun to talk of the storm when we came upon the trunk of a young tree which had been torn up by the roots and was lying across the road so that our coachman had to get down and remove it beastly bad crossing im afraid hope youre a good sailor must be in london tomorrow morning you know the band was playing behind us the leafless trees were beating their bare boughs in front the wedding bells were pealing the storm was thundering through the running sky the sea was very loud at my fathers gate tommy the mate with a serious face was standing cap in hand under his triumphal arch which as well as it could for the wind that was tearing its flowers and scattering them on the ground spelled out the words god bless the happy bride when we reached the open door of the house a group of maids were waiting for us they were holding on to their white caps and trying to control their aprons which were swirling about their black frocks as i stepped out of the carriage they addressed me as my lady and your ladyship the seagulls driven up from the sea were screaming about the house my husband and i went into the drawingroom and as we stood together on the hearthrug i caught a glimpse of my face in the glass over the mantelpiece it was deadly white and had big staring eyes and a look of faded sunshine i fixed afresh the pearls about my neck and the diamond in my hair which was much disordered almost immediately the other carriages returned and relatives and guests began to pour into the room and offer us their congratulations first came my cousins who were too much troubled about their own bedraggled appearance to pay much attention to mine then aunt bridget holding on to her halfmoon bonnet and crying you happy happy child but what a wind theres been nothing like it since the day you were born my father came next like a gale of wind himself saying im proud of you gel right proud i am you done well then came lady margaret who kissed me without saying many words and finally a large and varied company of gailydressed friends and neighbours chiefly the aristocracy of our island who lavished many unnecessary ladyships upon me as if the great name reflected a certain glory upon themselves i remember that as i stood on the hearthrug with my husband receiving their rather crude compliments a vague gaiety came over me and i smiled and laughed although my heart was growing sick for the effect of the weddingservice was ebbing away into a cold darkness like that of a night tide when the moonlight has left it it did not comfort me that my husband without failing in good manners was taking the whole scene and company with a certain scarcelyveiled contempt which i could not help but see and neither did it allay my uneasiness to glance at my father where he stood at the end of the room watching with a look of triumph in his glistening black eyes his proud guests coming up to me one by one and seeming to say to himself theyre here at last ive bet them yes by gough ive bet them many a time since i have wondered if his conscience did not stir within him as he looked across at his daughter in the jewels of the noble house he had married her intothe pale bride with the bridegroom he had bought for herand thought of the mockery of a sacred union which he had brought about to gratify his pride his vanity perhaps his revenge but it was all over now i was married to lord raa in the eyes equally of the law the world and the church the knot between us was irrevocably tied memorandum by martin conrad i am no mystic and no spiritualist and i only mention it as one of the mysteries of human sympathy between fardistant friends that during a part of the time when my dear one was going through the fierce struggle she describes and was dreaming of frozen regions and a broken pen the ship i sailed on had got itself stuck fast in a field of pack ice in latitude under the ice barrier by charcot bay and that while we were lying like helpless logs cut off from communication with the world unable to do anything but groan and swear and kick our heels in our bunks at every fresh grinding of our crunching sides my own mind sleeping and waking was for ever swinging back with a sort of yearning prayer to my darling not to yield to the pressure which i felt so damnably sure was being brought to bear on her mc third part my honeymoon thirtysecond chapter when the bishop and father dan arrived the bell was rung and we went in to breakfast we breakfasted in the new diningroom which was now finished and being used for the first time it was a gorgeous chamber beblazoned with large candelabra huge mirrors and pictures in gold framesresembling the room it was intended to imitate yet not resembling it as a woman overdressed resembles a welldressed woman my father sat at the head of his table with the bishop lady margaret and aunt bridget on his right and myself my husband betsy beauty and mr eastcliff on his left the lawyers and the trustee were midway down father dan with nessy macleod was at the end and a large company of our friends and neighbours wearing highlycoloured flowers on their breasts and in their buttonholes sat between the meal was very long and much of the food was very largelarge fish large roasts of venison veal beef and mutton large puddings and large cheeses all cut on the table and served by waiters from blackwater there were two long black lines of thema waiter behind the chair of nearly every other guest all through the breakfast the storm raged outside more than once it drowned the voices of the people at the table roaring like a wild beast in the great throat of the wide chimney swirling about the lantern light licking and lashing and leaping at the outsides of the walls like lofty waves breaking against a breakwater and sending up a thunderous noise from the sea itself where the big bell of st marys rock was still tolling like a knell somebodyit must have been aunt bridget againsaid there had been nothing like it since the day of my birth and it must be fate chut woman said my father were living in the twentieth century whos houlding with such ould wifes wonders now he was intensely excited and his excitement betrayed itself as usual in reversion to his native speech sometimes he surveyed in silence with the old masterful lift of his eyebrows his magnificent room and the great guests who were gathered within it sometimes he whispered to the waiters to be smarter with the serving of the dishes and sometimes he pitched his voice above the noises within and without and shouted in countryfashion to his friends at various points of the table to know how they were faring how are you doing mr curphy sir doing well sir are you doing well yourself mr oneill sir lordamassy yes sir im always doing well sir never had anybody in ellan seen so strange a mixture of grandeur and country style my husband seemed to be divided between amused contempt for it and a sense of being compromised by its pretence more than once i saw him with his monocle in his eye look round at his friend eastcliff but he helped himself frequently from a large decanter of brandy and drank healths with everybody there were the usual marriage pleasantries facetious compliments and chaff in which to my surprise the solemnity of the service being still upon me the bishop permitted himself to join i was now very nervous and yet i kept up a forced gaiety though my heart was cold and sick i remember that i had a preternatural power of hearing at the same time nearly every conversation that was going on at the table and that i joined in nearly all the laughter at a more than usually loud burst of wind somebody said it would be a mercy if the storm did not lift the roof off chut man cried my father solid oak and wrought iron here none of your mouldy old monuments that have enough to do to keep their tiles on then nobody said my husband with a glance at his friend need be afraid of losing his head in your house sir not if hes got one to come in with sir betsy beauty sitting next to mr eastcliff was wondering if he would do us the honour to visit the island oftener now that his friend had married into it but my dear betsy said my husband who would live in this godforsaken place if he could help it godforsaken is it said my father maybe so sirbut thats what the cuckoo said after he had eaten the eggs out of the thrushs nest and left a mess in it aunt bridget was talking in doleful tones to lady margaret about my mother saying she had promised her on her deathbed to take care of her child and had been as good as her word always putting me before her own daughter although her ladyship would admit that betsy was a handsome girl and now that his lordship was married there were few in the island that were fit for her why no mrs macleod said my husband after another significant glance at his friend i dare say youve not got many who can make enough to keep a carriage truth enough sir said my father weve got hundreds and tons that can make debts though the breakfast came to an end at length and almost before the last of the waiters had left the room my father rose to speak friends all he said the young married couple have to leave us for the afternoon steamer in this weather said somebody pointing up to the lantern light through which the sky was now darkening chut a puff of wind and a slant of rain as ive been saying to my gel here but my soninlaw lord raa loud cheers followed this description with some laughter and much hammering on the table my soninlaw says he has to be in london tomorrow and this morning my daughter has sworn obedience whats that monsignor not obedience exactly something like it then so shes bound to go along with him so fill up your glasses to the brim and drink to the bride and bridegroom as soon as the noise made by the passing of decanters had died down my father spoke again this is the proudest day of my life its the day ive worked for and slaved for and saved for and its come to pass at last there was another chorus of applause whats that you were saying in church mr curphy sir time brings in its revenges it does too look at me my father put his thumbs in the armpits of his waistcoat you all know what i am and where i come from my husband put his monocle to his eye and looked up i come from a mud cabin on the curragh not a hundred miles from here my father was kill but never mind about that now when he left us it was middling hard collar work i can tell youwhat with me working the bit of a croft and the mother weeding for some of yousome of your fathers i maneninepence a day dry days and sixpence all weathers when i was a lump of a lad i was sworn at in the high road by a gentleman driving in his grand carriage and the mother was lashed by his but never mind about that neither i guess ive hustled round considerable since then and this morning ive married my daughter into the first family in the island there was another burst of cheering at this but it was almost drowned by the loud rattling of the rain which was now falling on the lantern light monsignor cried my father pitching his voice still higher whats that you were saying in rome about the mills of god fumbling his jewelled cross and smiling blandly the bishop gave my father the familiar quotation truth enough too the mills of god grind slowly but theyre grinding exceeding small nineteen years ago i thought i was as sure of what i wanted as when i got out of bed this morning if my gel here had been born a boy my son would have sat where his lordship is now sitting but alls well that ends well if i havent got a son ive got a soninlaw and when i get a grandson hell be the richest man that ever stepped into castle raa and the uncrowned king of ellan at that there was a tempest of cheers which mingling with the clamour of the storm made a deafening tumult theyre saying a dale nowadays about fathers and childrendaughters being separate beings and all to that but show me the daughter that could do better for herself than my gels father has done for her she has a big fortune and her husband has a big name and what more do they want in this world anyway nothing at all came from various parts of the room neighbours said my father looking round him with a satisfied smile im laying you dry as herrings in a hould but before i call on you to drink this toast ill ask the bishop to spake to you hes a grand man is the bishop and in fixing up this marriage i dont in the world know what i could have done without him the bishop still fingering his jewelled cross and smiling spoke in his usual suave voice he firmly believed that the church had that morning blessed a most propitious and happy union something might be said against mixed marriages but under proper circumstances the church had never forbidden them and his lordship this with a deep bow to my husband had behaved with great liberality of mind as for what their genial and rugged host had said of certain foolish and dangerous notions about the relations of father and child he was reminded that there were still more foolish and dangerous ones about the relations of husband and wife from the earliest ages of the church however those relations had been exactly defined let wives be subject to their husbands said the epistle we had read this morning and no less conclusive had been our closing prayer asking that the wife keep true faith with her husband being lovely in his eyes even as was rachel wise as was rebecca and dutiful as was sara beautiful whispered aunt bridget to lady margaret its what i always was myself in the days of the dear colonel and now said the bishop before you drink this toast and call upon the noble bridegroom to respond to it another deep bow to my husband i will ask for a few words from the two legal gentlemen who have carried out the admirably judicious financial arrangements without which this happy marriage would have been difficult if not impossible then my husbands lawyer with a supercilious smile on his cleanshaven face said it had been an honour to him to assist in preparing the way for the uncrowned king of ellan it has sir cried my father in a loud voice which straightened the gentlemans face instantly and finally mr curphy speaking through his long beard congratulated my father and my husband equally on the marriage and gave it as his opinion that there could be no better use for wealth than to come to the rescue of an historic family which had fallen on evil times and only required a little money to set it on its feet again the bride and bridegroom cried my father and then everybody rose and there was much cheering with cries of his lordship his lordship all through the speechmaking my husband had rolled uneasily in his chair he had also helped himself frequently from the decanter so that when he got up to reply he was scarcely sober in his drawling voice he thanked the bishop and said that having made up his mind to the marriage he had never dreamt of raising difficulties about religion as to the modern notions about the relations of husband and wife he did not think a girl brought up in a convent would give him much trouble on that subject not likely cried my father ill clear her of that anyway so i thank you for myself and for my family continued my husband and oh yes of course this to lady margaret i thank you for my wife also and and thats all i felt sick and cold and ashamed a rush of blood came under the skin of my face that must have made me red to the roots of my hair in all this speaking about my marriage there had not been one word about myselfmyself really a living soul with all her future happiness at stake i cannot say what vague impulse took possession of me but i remember that when my husband sat down i made a forced laugh though i knew well that i wanted to cry in an agony of shame i was beginning to feel a wild desire to escape from the room and even from the house that i might breathe in some of the free wind outside when all at once i became aware that somebody else was speaking it was father dan he had risen unannounced from his seat at the end of the table i saw his sack coat which was much worn at the seams i saw his round face which was flushed i heard the vibrating note in his soft irish voice which told me he was deeply moved and then i dropped my head for i knew what was coming thirtythird chapter mr oneill said father dan may your parish priest take the liberty of speaking without being spoken to my father made some response and then a hush fell over the diningroom either the storm ceased for a time or in my great agitation it seemed to do so for i did not hear it we have heard a great deal about the marriage we have celebrated today but have we not forgotten something what is marriage is it the execution of a contract is it the signing of a register is it even the taking of an oath before an altar no marriage is the sacred covenant which two souls make with each other the woman with the man the man with the woman when she chooses him from all other men when he chooses her from all other women to belong to each other for ever so that no misfortune no storm of life no sin on either side shall ever put them apart thats what marriage is and all we have been doing today is to call on god and man to bear witness to that holy bond my heart was beating high i raised my head and i think my eyes must have been shining i looked across at the bishop his face was showing signs of vexation mr oneill sir cried father dan raising his trembling voice you say your daughter has a big fortune and her husband has a big name and what more do they want in this world ill tell you what they want sir they want love love on both sides if they are to be good and happy and if theyve got that theyve got something which neither wealth nor rank can buy i had dropped my head again but under my eyelashes i could see that the company were sitting spellbound only my husband was shuffling in his seat and the bishop was plucking at his gold chain my bishop said father dan has told us of the submission a wife owes to her husband and of her duty to be lovely and wise and faithful in his eyes but isnt it the answering thought that the husband on his part owes something to the wife arent we told that he shall put away everything and everybody for her sake and cleave to her and cling to her and they shall be one flesh isnt that too a divine commandment my heart was throbbing so loud by this time that the next words were lost to me when i came to myself again father dan was saying think what marriage means to a womana young girl especially it means the breaking of old ties the beginning of a new life the setting out into an unknown world on a voyage from which there can be no return in her weakness and her helplessness she leaves one dependency for another the shelter of a father for the shelter of a husband what does she bring to the man she marries herself everything she is everything she can be to be made or marred by him and never never never to be the same to any other man whatsoever as long as life shall last more than ever now but for other reasons i wanted to fly from the room friends cried father dan we dont know much of the bridegroom in this parish but we know the bride weve known her all her life we know what she is i do anyway if you are her father mr oneill sir i am her father also i was in this house when she was born i baptized her i took her out of the arms of the angel who bore her so shes my child too god bless her his voice was breakingi was sobbingthough he was speaking so loudly i could scarcely hear himi could scarcely see himi only knew that he was facing about in our direction and raising his trembling hand to my husband she is my child too i say and now that she is leaving us now that you are taking her away from us i charge you my lord to be good and faithful to her as you will have to answer for her soul some day what else he said i do not know from that moment i was blind and deaf to everything nevertheless i was conscious that after father dan had ceased to speak there was a painful silence i thought the company seemed to be startled and even a little annoyed by the emotion so suddenly shot into their midst the bishop looked vexed my father looked uncomfortable and my husband who had been drinking glass after glass of brandy was muttering something about a sermon it had been intended that mr eastcliff should speak for the bridesmaids and i was afterwards told by betsy beauty that he had prepared himself with many clever epigrams but everybody felt there could be no more speaking of any kind now after a few awkward moments my father looked at his watch and said it was about time for us to start if we were to catch the steamer so i was hurried upstairs to change for our journey when i came down again in my tailormade travelling dress with sables the whole company was in the hall and everybody seemed to be talking at the same time making a noise like water in a weir i was taken possession of by each in turn nessy macleod told me in an aside what an excellent father i had betsy beauty whispered that mr eastcliff was so handsome and their tastes were so similar that she hoped i would invite him to castle raa as soon as i came back aunt bridget surrounded by a group of sympathising ladies including lady margaret who was making an obvious effort to be gracious was wiping her eyes and saying i had always been her favourite and she had faithfully done her duty by me mary my love she said catching my eye im just telling her ladyship i dont know in the world what ill do when you are gone my husband was there too wearing a heavy overcoat with the collar up and receiving from a group of insular gentlemen their cheerful prognostics of a bad passage deed but im fearing it will be a dirty passage my lord chut said my father the winds from the southwest theyll soon get shelter the first of our two cars came round and my husbands valet went off in advance with our luggage then the second car arrived and the time came for our departure i think i kissed everybody everybody seemed to be cryingeverybody except myself for my tears were all gone by this time just as we were about to start the storm which must certainly have fallen for a while sprang up suddenly and when tommy the mate barely recognisable in borrowed black garments opened the door the wind came rushing into the house with a longdrawn whirr i had said goodbye to the old man and was stepping into the porch when i remembered father dan he was standing in his shabby sack coat with a sorrowful face in a dark corner by the door as if he had placed himself there to see the last of me i wanted to put my arms around his neck but i knew that would be wrong so i dropped to my knees and kissed his hand and he gave me his blessing my husband who was waiting by the side of the throbbing automobile said impatiently come come dear dont keep me in the rain i got into the landaulette my husband got in after me the car began to move there were cries from within the house goodbye good luck which sounded like stifled shrieks as they were carried off by the wind without and then we were under weigh as we turned the corner of the drive something prompted me to look back at my mothers windowwith its memories of my first going to school at the next moment we were crossing the bridgewith its memories of martin conrad and william rufus at the next we were on the road thirtyfourth chapter thank god thats over said my husband then half apologetically he added you didnt seem to enjoy it any more than myself my dear at the entrance to our village a number of men stood firing guns in the middle a group of girls were stretching a rope across the road a number of small flags torn by the wind and wet with the rain were rattling on flagstaffs hung out from some of the window sills a few women with shawls over their heads were sheltering on the weather side of their porches to see us pass my husband was impatient of our simple island customs once or twice he lowered the window of the car threw out a handful of silver and at the same time urged the chauffeur to drive quicker as soon as we were clear of the village he fell back in his seat saying heavens how sleepy i am no wonder either late going to bed last night and up so early this morning after a moment he began to yawn and almost before he could have been aware of it he had closed his eyes at the next moment he was asleep it was a painful almost a hideous sleep his cheeks swelled and sank his lips parted he was breathing heavily and sometimes gaping like a carp out of water i could not detach my eyes from his face which without eyes to relieve it seemed to be almost repulsive now it would be difficult to describe my sensations i felt dreadfully humiliated even my personal pride was wounded i remembered what father dan had said about husband and wife being one flesh and told myself that this was what i belonged to what belonged to methis then i tried to reproach and reprove myself but in order to do so i had to turn my eyes away our road to blackwater lay over the ridge of a hill much exposed to the wind from the southwest when we reached this point the clouds seemed to roll up from the sea like tempestuous battalions torrential rain fell on the car and came dripping in from the juncture of the landaulette roof some of it fell on the sleeper and he awoke with a start damn he stopped as if caught in guilt and began to apologise again was i asleep i really think i must have been stupid isnt it excuse me he blinked his eyes as if to empty them of sleep looked me over for a moment or two in silence and then said with a smile which made me shudder so you and i are man and wife my dear i made no answer and still looking fixedly at me he said well worse things might have happened after allwhat do you think still i did not answer him feeling a certain shame not to say disgust then he began to pay me some compliments on my appearance do you know youre charming my dear really charming that stung me and made me shudder i dont know why unless it was because the words gave me the sense of having been used before to other women i turned my eyes away again dont turn away dear let me see those big black eyes of yours i adore black eyes they always pierce me like a gimlet he reached forward as he spoke and drew me to him i felt frightened and pushed him off whats this he said as if surprised but after another moment he laughed and in the tone of a man who had had much to do with women and thought he knew how to deal with them he said wants to be coaxed does she they all do bless them saying this he pulled me closer to him putting his arm about my waist but once more i drew and forcibly pushed him from me his face darkened for an instant and then cleared again oh i see he said offended is she paying me out for having paid so little court to her well shes right there too bless her but never mind youre a decidedly goodlooking little woman my dear and if i have neglected you thus far i intend to make up for it during the honeymoon so come little gal lets be friends taking hold of me again he tried to kiss me putting at the same time his hand on the bosom of my dress but i twisted my face aside and prevented him oh oh hurt her modesty have i he said laughing like a man who was quite sure both of himself and of me but my little nun will get over that by and by wait awhile wait awhile by this time i was trembling with the shock of a terror that was entirely new to me i could not explain to myself the nature of it but it was there and i could not escape from it hitherto when i had thought of my marriage to lord raa i had been troubled by the absence of love between us and what i meant to myself by lovethe love of husband and wifewas the kind of feeling i had for the reverend mother heightened and deepened and spiritualised as i believed by the fact with all its mysterious significance that the one was a man and the other a woman but this was something quite different not having found in marriage what i had expected i was finding something else for there could be no mistaking my husbands meaning when he looked at me with his passionate eyes and said wait awhile i saw what was before me and in fear of it i found myself wishing that something might happen to save me i was so frightened that if i could have escaped from the car i should have done so the only thing i could hope for was that we should arrive at blackwater too late for the steamer or that the storm would prevent it from sailing what relief from my situation i should find in that beyond the delay of one day one night in which i imagined i might be allowed to return home i did not know but none the less on that account i began to watch the clouds with a feverish interest they were wilder than ever nowrolling up from the southwest in huge black whorls which enveloped the mountains and engulfed the valleys the wind too was howling at intervals like a beast being slaughtered it was terrible but not so terrible as the thing i was thinking of i was afraid of the storm and yet i was fearfully frightfully glad of it my husband who after my repulse had dropped back into his own corner of the car was very angry he talked again of our godforsaken island and the folly of living in it said our passage would be a long one in any case and we might lose our connection to london damnably inconvenient if we do ive special reasons for being there in the morning he said at a sharp turn of the road the wind smote the car as with an invisible wing one of the windows was blown in and to prevent the rain from driving on to us my husband had to hold up a cushion in the gap this occupied him until we ran into blackwater and then he dropped the cushion and put his head out although the rain was falling heavily to catch the first glimpse of the water in the bay it was in terrific turmoil my heart leapt up at the sight of it my husband swore we drew up on the drenched and naked pier my husbands valet in waterproofs came to the sheltered side of the car and shouting above the noises of the wind in the rigging of the steamer he said captain will not sail today my lord inshore wind says he couldnt get safely out of the harbour my husband swore violently i was unused to oaths at that time and they cut me like whipcord but all the same my pulse was bounding joyfully bad luck my lord but only one thing to do now shouted the valet whats that said my husband growling sleep in blackwater tonight in hopes of weather mending in the morning anticipating this course he had already engaged rooms for us at the fort george my heart fell and i waited for my husbands answer i was stifling all right hobson if it must be it must he answered i wanted to speak but i did not know what to say there seemed to be nothing that i could say a quarter of an hour afterwards we arrived at the hotel where the proprietor attended by the manageress and the waiters received us with rather familiar smiles thirtyfifth chapter when i began to write i determined to tell the truth and the whole truth but now i find that the whole truth will require that i should invade some of the most sacred intimacies of human experience at this moment i feel as if i were on the threshold of one of the sanctuaries of a womans life and i ask myself if it is necessary and inevitable that i should enter it i have concluded that it is necessary and inevitablenecessary to the sequence of my narrative inevitable for the motive with which i am writing it four times already i have written what is to follow in the first case i found that i had said too much in the second i had said too little in the third i was startled and shocked by the portrait i had presented of myself and could not believe it to be true in the fourth i saw with a thrill of the heart that the portrait was not only true but too true let me try again i entered our rooms at the hotel my husbands room and mine with a sense of fear almost of shame my sensations at that moment had nothing in common with the warm flood of feeling which comes to a woman when she finds herself alone for the first time with the man she loves in a little room which holds everything that is of any account to her in the world they were rather those of a young girl who walking with a candle through the dark corridors of an empty house at night is suddenly confronted by a strange face i was the young girl with the candle the strange face was my husbands we had three rooms all communicating a sittingroom in the middle with bedrooms right and left the bedroom on the right was large and it contained a huge bed with a covered top and tailboards that on the left was small and it had a plain brass and iron bedstead which had evidently been meant for a ladys maid i had no maid yet it was intended that i should engage a french one in london almost immediately on entering the sittingroom my husband who had not yet recovered from his disappointment left me to go downstairs saying with something like a growl that he had telegrams to send to london and instructions to give to his man hobson without taking off my outer things i stepped up to the windows which were encrusted with salt from the flying spray the hotel stood on a rocky ledge above the harbour and the sound of the sea beating on the outer side of the pier came up with a deafening roar the redfunnelled steamer we should have sailed by lay on the piers sheltered side letting down steam swaying to her creaking hawsers and heaving to the foam that was surging against her bow i was so nervous so flurried so preoccupied by vague fears that i hardly saw or heard anything porters came up with our trunks and asked me where they were to place them but i scarcely know how i answered them although i was aware that everythingboth my husbands luggage and minewas being taken into the large bedroom a maid asked if she ought to put a light to the fire and i said yes no yes and presently i heard the fire crackling after awhile my husband came back in a better temper and said confounded nuisance but i suppose we must make the best of it he laughed as he said this and coming closer and looking me over with a smile which was at the same time passionate and proud he whispered dare say well not find the time long until tomorrow morning what do you think my little beauty something in his voice rather than in his question made my heart beat and i could feel my face growing hot not taken off your things yet he said come let me help you i drew out my hatpins and removed my hat at the same moment my husband removed my sables and cloak and as he did so he put his arms about me and held me close to him i shuddered i tried not to but i could not help it my husband laughed again and said not got over it yet little woman perhaps thats only because you are not quite used to me still laughing he pulled me still closer to him and putting one of his hands under my chin he kissed me on the mouth it will be difficult and perhaps it will be ridiculous to say how my husbands first kiss shocked me my mouth felt parched i had a sense of intense disgust and before i was quite aware of what i was doing i had put up both hands to push him off come come this is going too far he said in a tone that was half playful half serious it was all very well in the automobile but here in your own rooms you know he broke off and laughed again saying that if my modesty only meant that nobody had ever kissed me before it made me all the more charming for him i could not help feeling a little ashamed of my embarrassment and crossing in front of my husband i seated myself in a chair before the fire he looked after me with a smile that made my heart tremble and then coming behind my chair he put his arms about my shoulders and kissed my neck a shiver ran through me i felt as if i had suffered a kind of indecency i got up and changed my place my husband watched me with the look of a man who wanted to roar with laughter it was the proud and insolent as well as passionate look of one who had never so much as contemplated resistance well this is funny he said but well see presently well see a waiter came in for orders and early as it was my husband asked for dinner to be served immediately my heart was fluttering excitedly by this time and i was glad of the relief which the presence of other people gave me while the table was being laid my husband talked of the doings of the day he asked who was the seedy old priest who had given us the sermon at the wedding breakfasthe had evidently forgotten that he had seen the father before i told him the seedy old priest was father dan and he was a saint if ever there was one a saint is he said my husband wish saint were not synonymous with simpleton though then he gave me his own views of the holy state of matrimony by holding people together who ought to be apart it often caused more misery and degradation of character than a dozen entirely natural adulteries and desertions which a man had sometimes to repair by marriage or else allow himself to be regarded as a seducer and a scoundrel i do not think my husband was conscious of the naive coarseness of all this as spoken to a young girl who had only just become his wife i am sure he was not aware that he was betraying himself to me in every word he uttered and making the repugnance i had begun to feel for him deepen into horror my palms became moist and again and again i had to dry them with my handkerchief i was feeling more frightened and more ashamed than i had ever felt before but nevertheless when we sat down to dinner i tried to compose myself partly for the sake of appearance before the servants and partly because i was taking myself to task for the repugnance i felt towards my husband i found something to say though my voice shook my husband ate ravenously and drank a good deal once or twice when he insisted on pouring out champagne for me i clinked glasses with him although every moment at table was increasing my fear and disgust i sometimes allowed myself to laugh encouraged by this he renewed his endearments even before the waiters had left the room and when they had gone with orders not to return until he rang and the door was closed behind them he switched off the lights pushed a sofa in front of the fire put me to sit on it sat down beside me and redoubled his tenderness hows my demure little nun now he said frightened wasnt she theyre all frightened at first bless them i could smell the liquor he had been drinking i could see by the firelight the prominent front tooth partly hidden by his moustache which i had noticed when i saw him first and the down of soft hair which grew as low on his hands as his knuckles above all i thought i could feel the atmosphere of other women about himloose women bad women as it seemed to meand my fear and disgust began to be mixed with a kind of physical horror for a little while i tried to fight against this feeling but when he began to put his arms about me calling me by endearing names complaining of my coldness telling me not to be afraid of him reminding me that i belonged to him now and must do as he wished a faintness came over me i trembled from head to foot and made some effort to rise let me go i said nonsense he said laughing and holding me to my seat you bewitching little woman youre only teasing me how they love to tease these charming little women the pupils of his eyes were glistening i closed my own eyes in order to avoid his look at the next moment i felt his hand stray down my body and in a fury of indignation i broke out of his arms and leapt to my feet when i recovered my selfpossession i was again looking out of the window and my husband who was behind me was saying in a tone of anger and annoyance whats the matter with you i cant understand what have i done good heavens we are man and wife arent we i made no answer my heart which had been hot with rage was becoming cold with dread it seemed to me that i had suffered an outrage on my natural modesty as a human being a sort of offence against my dignity as a woman it was now dark with my face to the window i could see nothing the rain was beating against the glass the sea was booming on the rocks i wanted to fly but i felt cagedmorally and physically caged my husband had lit a cigarette and was walking up and down the sittingroom apparently trying to think things out after awhile he approached me out his hand on my shoulder and said i see how it is youre tired and no wonder youve had a long and exhausting day better go to bed well have to be up early glad to escape from his presence i allowed him to lead me to the large bedroom as i was crossing the threshold he told me to undress and get into bed and after that he said something about waiting then he closed the door softly and i was alone thirtysixth chapter there was a fire in the bedroom and i sat down in front of it many forces were warring within me i was trying to fix my thoughts and found it difficult to do so some time passed my husbands man came in with the noiseless step of all such persons opened one of the portmanteaux and laid out his masters combs and brushes on the dressing table and his sleeping suit on the bed a maid of the hotel followed him and taking my own sleeping things out of the top tray of my trunk she laid them out beside my husbands goodnight my lady they said in their low voices as they went out on tiptoe i hardly heard them my mind at first numb was now going at lightning speed brought face to face for the first time with one of the greatest facts of a womans life i was asking myself why i had not reckoned with it before i had not even thought of it my whole soul had been so much occupied with one great spiritual issuethat i did not love my husband as i understood love that my husband did not love methat i had never once plainly confronted even in my own mind the physical fact that is the first condition of matrimony and nobody had mentioned it to me or even hinted at it i could not plead that i did not know of this condition i was young but i was not a child i had been brought up in a convent but a convent is not a nursery then why had i not thought of it while sitting before the fire gathering together these dark thoughts i was in such fear that i was always conscious of my husbands movements in the adjoining room at one moment there was the jingling of his glass against the decanter at another moment the smell of his cigarette smoke from time to time he came to the door and called to me in a sort of husky whisper asking if i was in bed dont keep me long little girl i shuddered but made no reply at last he knocked softly and said he was coming in i was still crouching over the fire as he came up behind me not in bed yet he said then i must put you to bed before i could prevent him he had lifted me in his arms dragged me on to his knee and was pulling down my hair laughing as he did so calling me by coarse endearing names and telling me not to fight and struggle but the next thing i knew i was back in the sittingroom where i had switched up the lights and my husband whose face was distorted by passion was blazing out at me what do you mean he said im your husband am i not you are my wife arent you what did you marry for good heavens can it be possible that you dont know what the conditions of matrimony are is that what comes of being brought up in a convent but has your father allowed you to marry without and your auntwhat in gods name has the woman been doing i crossed towards the smaller bedroom intending to enter it but my husband intercepted me dont be a fool he said catching at my wrist think of the servants think what theyd say think what the whole island would say do you want to make a laughing stock of both of us i returned and sat by the table my husband lit another cigarette nervously flicking the ends off with the index finger of his left hand and speaking quickly as if the words scorched his lips he told me i was mistaken if i supposed that he wanted a scene like this he thought he could spend his time better i was equally mistaken if i imagined that he had desired our marriage at all something quite different might have happened if he could have afforded to please himself he had made sacrifices to marry me too perhaps i had not thought of that but did i suppose a man of his class wanted a person like my father for his fatherinlaw and then my aunt and my cousinsugh the bishop too was it nothing that a man had been compelled to make all those ridiculous declarations children to be brought up catholics wife not to be influenced even to keep an open mind himself to all the muss and mummery of the church it wasnt over either that seedy old saint was probably my confessor did any rational man want another man to come between him and his wifeknowing all he did and said and everything about him i was heartsick as i listened to all this apparently the moral of it was that if i had been allowed to marry without being instructed in the first conditions of married life my husband had suffered a gross and shocking injustice the disgust i felt was choking me it was horribly humiliating and degrading to see my marriage from my husbands point of view and when i remembered that i was bound fast to the man who talked to me like this and that he could claim rights in me tonight tomorrow as long as i lived until death parted us a wild impulse of impotent anger at everybody and everything made me drop my head on to the table and burst into tears my husband misunderstood this as he misunderstood everything taking my crying for the last remnant of my resistance he put his arms round my shoulders again and renewed his fondling come dont let us have any more conjugal scenes he said the people of the hotel will hear us presently and there will be all sorts of ridiculous rumours if your family are rather common people you are a different pair of shoes altogether he was laughing again kissing my neck in spite of my shuddering and saying you really please me very much you do indeed and if theyve kept you in ignorance what matter come now my sweet little woman well soon repair that i could bear no more i must speak and i did leaping up and facing round on him i told him my side of the storyhow i had been married against my will and had not wanted him any more than he had wanted me how all my objections had been overruled all my compunctions borne down how everybody had been in a conspiracy to compel me and i had been bought and sold like a slave but you cant go any farther than that i said between you you have forced me to marry you but nobody can force me to obey you because i wont i saw his face grow paler and paler as i spoke and when i had finished it was ashenwhite so thats how it is is it he said and for some minutes more he tramped about the room muttering inaudible words as if trying to account to himself for my conduct at length he approached me again and said in the tone of one who thought he was making peace look here mary i think i understand you at last you have some other attachmentthats it i suppose oh dont think im blaming you i may be in the same case myself for all you know to the contrary but circumstances have been too strong for us and here we are well were in it and weve got to make the best of it and why shouldnt we lots of people in my class are in the same position and yet they get along all right why cant we do the same ill not be too particular neither will you for the rest of our lives let each of us go his and her own way but thats no reason why we should be strangers exactly not on our weddingday at all events youre a damned pretty woman and im well im not an ogre i suppose we are man and wife too so look here we wont expect too much affection from each otherbut lets stop this fooling and be good friends for a little while anyway come now once more he took hold of me as if to draw me back kissing my hands as he did so but his gross misinterpretation of my resistance and the immoral position he was putting me into were stifling me and i cried no i will not dont you see that i hate and loathe you there could be no mistaking me this time the truth had fallen on my husband with a shock i think it was the last thing his pride had expected his face became shockingly distorted but after a moment recovering himself with a cruel laugh that made my hot blood run cold he said nevertheless you shall do as i wish you are my wife and as such you belong to me the law allows me to compel you and i will the words went shrieking through and through me he was coming towards me with outstretched arms his teeth set and his pupils fixed in the drunkenness of his rage he was laughing brutally but all my fear had left me i felt an almost murderous impulse i wanted to strike him on the face if you attempt to touch me i will throw myself out of the window i said no fear of that he said catching me quickly in his arms if you do not take your hands off me ill shriek the house down i cried that was enough he let me go and dropped back from me at the next moment i was breathing with a sense of freedom without resistance on my husbands part i entered the little bedroom to the left and locked the door behind me thirtyseventh chapter some further time passed i sat by the fireless grate with my chin in my hand if the storm outside was still raging i did not hear it i was listening to the confused sounds that came from the sittingroom my husband was pacing to and fro muttering oaths knocking against the furniture breaking things at one moment there was a crash of glass as if he had helped himself to brandy and then in his ungovernable passion flung the decanter into the fire grate somebody knocked at the sittingroom it must have been a waiter for through the wall i heard the muffled sound of a voice asking if there had been an accident my husband swore at the man and sent him off hadnt he told him not to come until he was rung for at length after half an hour perhaps my husband knocked at the door of my little room are you there he asked i made no answer open the door i sat motionless you neednt be afraid im not going to do anything ive something to say still i made no reply my husband went away for a moment and then came back if you are determined not to open the door i must say what ive got to say from here are you listening sitting painfully rigid i answered that i was then he told me that what i was doing would entitle him to annul our marriagein the eyes of the church at all events if he thought that threat would intimidate me he was mistakena wave of secret joy coursed through me it wont matter much to meill take care it wontbut it will be a degrading business for youinvalidity and all that are you prepared for it i continued to sit silent and motionless i daresay we shall both be laughed at but i cannot help that we cant possibly live together on terms like these another wave of joy coursed through me anyhow i intend to know before i leave the island how things are to be im not going to take you away until i get some satisfaction you understand i listened almost without breathing but i did not reply im think of writing a letter to your father and sending hobson with it in the car immediately do you hear me yes well you know what your father is unless im much mistaken hes not a man to have much patience with your semiromantic semireligious sentiments are you quite satisfied quite very well thats what ill do then after this there was a period of quiet in which i assumed that my husband was writing his letter then i heard a bell ring somewhere in the corridor and shortly afterwards there was a second voice in the sittingroom but i could not hear the words that were spoken i suppose it was hobsons low voice for after another short interval of silence there came the thrum and throb of a motorcar and the rumble of indiarubber wheels on the wet gravel of the courtyard in front of the hotel then my husband knocked at my door again ive written that letter and hobson is waiting to take it your father will probably get it before he goes to bed it will be a bad break on the festivities he was preparing for the village people but you are still of the same mind i suppose i did not speak but i rose and went over to the window for some reason difficult to explain that reference to the festivities had cut me to the quick my husband must have been fuming at my apparent indifference and i felt as if i could see him looking at me passionate and proud between the lot of you i think youve done me a great injustice have you nothing to say even then i did not answer all right as you please a few minutes afterwards i heard the motorcar turning and driving away the wind had fallen the waves were rolling into the harbour with that monotonous moan which is the seas memory of a storm and a full moon like a whiterobed queen was riding through a troubled sky thirtyeighth chapter the moon had died out a new day had dawned the sea was lying as quiet as a sleeping child far out on the level horizon the sky was crimsoning before the rising sun and clouds of white seagulls were swirling and jabbering above the rocks in the harbour below the house before i lay down to sleep i was awakened by a hurried knocking at my door and by an impatient voice crying mary mary get up let me in it was aunt bridget who had arrived in my husbands automobile when i opened the door to her she came sailing into the room with her new halfmoon bonnet a little awry as if she had put it on hurriedly in the dim light of early morning and looking at me with her cold grey eyes behind their goldrimmed spectacles she began to bombard me with mingled ridicule and indignant protest goodness me girl whats all this fuss about you little simpleton tell me what has happened she was laughing i had hardly ever heard aunt bridget laugh before but her vexation soon got the better of her merriment his lordships letter arrived in the middle of the night and nearly frightened us out of our senses your father was for coming away straight and it would have been worse for you if he had but i said no this is work for a woman ill go and here i am and now tell me what in the name of goodness does this ridiculous trouble mean it was hard to say anything on such a subject under such circumstances especially when so challenged but aunt bridget without waiting for my reply proceeded to indicate the substance of my husbands letter from this i gathered that he had chosen probably to save his pride to set down my resistance to ignorance of the first conditions of matrimony and had charged my father first and aunt bridget afterwards with doing him a shocking injustice in permitting me to be married to him without telling me what every girl who becomes a wife ought to know but good gracious said my aunt bridget who would have imagined you didnt know i thought every girl in the world knew before she put up her hair and came out of short frocks my betsy did im sure of that and to think that youyou whom we thought so cute so cunning mary oneill im ashamed of you i really really am why you goose aunt bridget was again trying to laugh how did you suppose the world went on the coarse ridicule of what was supposed to be my maidenly modesty cut me like a knife but i could not permit myself to explain so my aunt bridget ran on talking i see how it has been its the fault of that reverend mother at the convent what sort of a woman is she is she a woman at all i wonder or only a piece of stucco that ought to be put up in a church corner to think she could have you nine years and never say one word about well well what has she been doing with you talking about the mysteries i supposeprayers and retreats and novenas and the spiritual bridegroom and the rest of it while all the while but you must put the convent out of your head my girl you are a married woman now youve got to think of your husband and a husband isnt a spiritual bridegroom i can tell you hes flesh and blood thats what a husband is and you cant expect him to spend his time talking about eternity and the rosary not on his weddingday anyway i was hot in my absurd embarrassment and i dare say my face was scarlet but aunt bridget showed me no mercy the way you have behaved is too silly for anything it really is a husbands a husband and a wifes a wife the wife has to obey her husband of course she has every wife has to some dont like it i cant say that i liked it very much myself but to think of anybody objecting why its shocking nobody ever heard of such a thing i must have flushed up to my forehead for i became conscious that in my aunt bridgets eyes there had been a kind of indecency in my conduct but come she said we must be sensible its timidity thats what it is i was a little timid myself when i was first married but i soon got over it once get over your timidity and you will be all right sakes alive yes youll be as happy as the day is long and before this time tomorrow youll wonder what on earth you made all this fuss about i tried to say that what she predicted could never be because i did not love my husband and therefore but my aunt bridget broke in on me saying mary oneill dont be a fool your maiden days are over now and you ought to know what your husband will do if you persist i jumped at the thought that she meant he would annul our marriage but that was not what she was thinking of hell find somebody elsethats what hell do serve you right too youll only have yourself to blame for it perhaps you think youll be able to do the same but you wont women cant hell be happy enough and youll be the only one to suffer so dont make a fool of yourself accept the situation you may not like your husband too much i cant say i liked the colonel particularly he took snuff and no woman in the world could keep him in clean pocket handkerchiefs but when a sensible person has got something at stake she puts up with things and thats what you must do he who wants fresh eggs must raise his own chickens you know aunt bridget ran on for some time longer telling me of my fathers anger which was not a matter for much surprise seeing how he had built himself upon my marriage and how he had expected that i should have a child a son to carry on the family do you mean to disappoint him after all he has done for you it would be too silly too stupid youd be the laughingstock of the whole island so get up and get dressed and be ready and willing to go with his lordship when he sails by this afternoons steamer i cant i said you cant you mean you wont very well auntie i wont at that aunt bridget stormed at me for several minutes telling me that if my stubborn determination not to leave the island with my husband meant that i intended to return home she might inform me at once that i was not wanted there and i need not come ive enough on my hands in that house already what with betsy unmarried and your father doing nothing for her and that nasty nessy macleod making up to him you ungrateful minx you are ruining everything after all ive done for you too but no matter if you will make your bed i shall take care that you lie on it with that and the peak of her halfmoon bonnet almost dancing over her angry face aunt bridget flounced out of my room half an hour afterwards when i went into the sittingroom i found my fathers advocate mr curphy waiting for me he looked down at me with an indulgent and significant smile which brought the colour rushing back to my face put me to sit by his side touched my arm with one of his large white clammy hands stroked his long brown beard with the other and then in the halfreproving tone which a sundayschool teacher might have used to a wayward child he began to tell me what the consequences would be if i persisted in my present conduct they would be serious the law was very clear on marital rights if a wife refused to live with her husband except on a plea of cruelty or something equally plausible he could apply to the court and compel her to do so and if she declined if she removed herself from his abode or having removed refused to return the court might punish herit might even imprison her so you see the man is the top dog in a case like this my dear and he can compel the woman to obey him do you mean i said that he can use force to compel her reasonable force yes i think thats so and quite right too when you come to think of it the woman has entered into a serious contract and it is the duty of the law to see that she fulfills the conditions of it i remembered how little i had known of the conditions of the contract i had entered into but i was too heartsick and ashamed to say anything about that aw yes thats so said the advocate force reasonable force you may say it puts a woman in a worse position as a wife than she would be if she were a mistress thats true but its the law and once a woman has married a man the only escape from this condition of submission is imprisonment then i would rather thata thousand times rather i said for i was hot with anger and indignation again the advocate smiled indulgently patted my arm and answered me as if i were a child tut tut my dear tut tut youve made a marriage that is founded on suitability of position property and education and everything will come right by and by dont act on a fit of pique or spleen and so destroy your happiness and that of everybody about you think of your father remember what he has done to make this marriage i may tell you that he has paid forty thousand pounds to discharge your husbands debts and undertaken responsibility for an allowance of six thousand a year beside do you want him to lose all that money i was so sick with disgust at hearing this that i could not speak and the advocate who in his different way was as dead to my real feelings as my husband had been went on to say come be reasonable you may have suffered some slight some indignity no doubt you have your husband is proud and he has peculiarities of temper which we have all to make allowances for but even if you could establish a charge of cruelty against him and so secure a separationwhich you cantwhat good would that do you none at allworse than none the financial arrangements would remain the same your father would be a frightful loser and what would you be a married widow the worst condition in the world for a womanespecially if she is young and attractive and subject to temptations ask anybody who knowsanybody i felt as if i would suffocate with shame come now said the advocate in his superior way taking my hand as if he were going to lead me like a child to my husband let us put an end to this little trouble his lordship is downstairs and he has consentedkindly and generously consentedto wait an hour for your answer but he must leave the island by the afternoon steamer and if then tell him he must leave it without me i said as well as i could for the anger that was choking me the advocate looked steadily into my face i think he understood the situation at last you mean thatreally and truly mean it he asked i do i answered and unable to say or hear any more without breaking out on him altogether i left the room thirtyninth chapter down to this moment i had put on a brave front though my very heart had been trembling but now i felt that all the weight of law custom parental authority and even religion was bearing me down down down and unless help came i must submit in the long run i was back in the small bedroom with my hot forehead against the cold glass of the window looking out yet seeing nothing when somebody knocked at the door softly almost timidly it was father dan and the sight of his dear face broken up with emotion was the same to me as the last plank of a foundering ship to a sailor drowning at sea my heart was so full that though i knew i ought not i threw my arms about his neck and burst into a flood of tears the good old priest did not put me away he smoothed my drooping head and patted my shoulders and in his sweet and simple way he tried to comfort me dont cry dont worry it will be all right in the end my child there was something almost grotesque in his appearance under his soft clerical outdoor hat he was wearing his faded old cassock as if he had come away hurriedly at a sudden call i could see what had happenedmy family had sent him to reprove me and remonstrate with me he sat on a chair by my bed and i knelt on the floor at his feet just as my mother used to do when i was a child and she was making her confession perhaps he thought of that at the same moment as myself for the golden light of my mothers memory lay always about him for some moments we did not speak i think we were both weeping at length i tried to tell him what had happenedhiding nothing softening nothing speaking the simple and naked truth i found it impossible to do so my oddsounding voice was not like my own and even my words seemed to be somebody elses but father dan understood everything i know i know he said and then to my great relief interrupting my halting explanations he gave his own interpretation of my husbands letter there was a higher love and there was a lower love and both were necessary to gods plans and purposes but the higher love must come first or else the lower one would seem to be cruel and gross and against nature nature was kind to a young girl left to itself it awakened her sex very gently first with love which came to her like a whisper in a dream like the touch of an angel on her sleeping eyelids so that when she awoke to the laws of life the mysteries of sex did not startle or appal her but sex in me had been awakened rudely and ruthlessly married without love i had been suddenly confronted by the lower passion what wonder that i had found it brutal and barbarous thats it my child thats it i know i know then he began to blame himself for everything saying it was all his fault and that he should have held out longer when he saw how things stood between me and my husband he should have said to my father to the bishop and to the lawyers notwithstanding all their bargainings this marriage must not go on it will lead to disaster it begins to end badly but now it is all over my child and theres no help for it i think the real strength of my resistance to aunt bridgets coarse ridicule and the advocates callous remonstrance must have been the memory of my husbands threat when he talked about the possible annulment of our marriage the thought of that came back to me now and half afraid half ashamed with a fluttering of the heart i tried to mention it is there no way out i asked what way can there be said father dan god knows i know what pressure was put upon you but you are married you have made your vows you have given your promises thats all the world sees or cares about and in the eyes of the law and the church you are responsible for all that has happened with my head still buried in father dans cassock i got it out at last but annulment isnt that possibleunder the circumstances i asked the good old priest seemed to be too confused to speak for a moment then he explained that what i hoped for was quite out of the question i dont say that in the history of the church marriages have not been annulled on equally uncertain grounds but in this case the civil law would require proofsomething to justify nullity failing that there would have to be collusion either on one side or both and that is not possiblenot to you my child not to the daughter of your mother that dear saint who suffered so long and was silent more than ever now i felt like a shipbroken man with the last plank sinking under him the cold mysterious dread of my husband was creeping back and the future of my life with him stood before me with startling vividness in spite of all my struggling and fighting of the night before i saw myself that very night the next night and the next and every night and day of my life thereafter a victim of the same sickening terror must i submit then i said father dan smoothed my head and told me in his soft voice that submission was the lot of all women it always had been so in the history of the world and perhaps it always would be remember the epistle we read in church yesterday morning wives submit yourselves to your husbands with a choking sensation in my throat i asked if he thought i ought to go away with my husband when he left the island by the afternoon steamer i see no escape from it my poor child they sent me to reprove you i cant do that but neither can i encourage you to resist it would be wrong it would be cruel it would only lead you into further trouble my mouth felt parched but i contrived to say then you can hold out no hope for me god knows i cant although i do not love this man i must live with him as his wife it is hard very hard but there seems to be no help for it i rose to my feet and went back to the window a wild impulse of rebellion was coming over me i shall feel like a bad woman i said dont say that said father dan you are married to the man anyway all the same i shall feel like my husbands mistresshis married mistress his harlot father dan was shocked and the moment the words were out of my mouth i was more frightened than i had ever been before for something within seemed to have forced them out of me when i recovered possession of my senses father dan nervously fumbling with the silver cross that hung over his cassock was talking of the supernatural effect of the sacrament of marriage it was god who joined people together and whom god joined together no man might put asunder no circumstances either no trial or tribulation could it be thought that a bond so sacred so indissoluble was ever made without good effect no the almighty had his own ways with his children and this great mystery of holy wedlock was one of them so dont lose heart my child who knows what may happen yet god works miracles now just as he did in the old days you may come yes you may come to love your husband and thenthen all will be well suddenly out of my despair and my defiance a new thought came to me it came with the memory of the emotion i had experienced during the marriage service and it thrilled me through and through father dan i said with a nervous cry for my heart was fluttering again what is it my child it was hard to say what i was thinking about but with a great effort i stammered it out at last i should be willing to leave the island with my husband and live under the same roof with him and bear his name so that there might be no trouble or scandal and nobody except ourselves might ever know that there was anything dividing us any difference of any kind between us if he on his part would promisefirmly and faithfully promisethat unless and until i came to love him he would never claim my submission as a wife while i spoke i hardly dared to look at father dan fearing he would shake his head again perhaps reprove me perhaps laugh at me but his eyes which had been moist began to sparkle and smile you mean that he asked yes and you will go away with him on that condition yes yes then he must agree to it the pureminded old priest saw no difficulties no dangers no risks of breakdown in my girlish scheme already my husband had got all he had bargained for he had got my fathers money in exchange for his noble name and if he wanted more if he wanted the love of his wife let him earn it let him win it thats only right only fair it will be worth winning toobetter worth winning than all your fathers gold and silver ten times over i can tell him that much anyway he had risen to his feet in his excitement the simple old priest with his pure heart and his beautiful faith in me and you my child youll try to love him in returnpromise you will a shiver ran through me when father dan said thata sense of the repugnance i felt for my husband almost stifled me promise me said father dan and though my face must have been scarlet i promised him thats right that alone will make him a better man he may be all that people say but who can measure the miraculous influence of a good woman he was making for the door i must go downstairs now and speak to your husband but hell agree why shouldnt he i know hes afraid of a public scandal and if he attempts to refuse ill tell him that but no that will be quite unnecessary goodbye my child if i dont come back youll know that everything has been settled satisfactorily youll be happy yet im sure you will ah what did i say about the mysterious power of that solemn and sacred sacrament goodbye i meant what i had said i meant to do what i had promised god knows i did but does a woman ever know her own heart or is heaven alone the judge of it at four oclock that afternoon my husband left ellan for england i went with him fortieth chapter having made my bargain i set myself to fulfil the conditions of it i had faithfully promised to try to love my husband and i prepared to do so did not love require that a wife should look up to and respect and even reverence the man she had married i made up my mind to do that by shutting my eyes to my husbands obvious faults and seeing only his better qualities what disappointments were in store for me what crushing and humiliating disillusionments on the night of our arrival in london we put up at a fashionable hotel in a quiet but wellknown part of the westend which is inhabited chiefly by consulting physicians and celebrated surgeons here to my surprise we were immediately discovered and lines of visitors waited upon my husband the following morning i thought they were his friends and a ridiculous little spurt of pride came to me from heaven knows where with the idea that my husband must be a man of some importance in the metropolis but i discovered they were his creditors moneylenders and bookmakers to whom he owed debts of honour which he had been unable or unwilling to disclose to my father and his advocate one of my husbands visitors was a pertinacious little man who came early and stayed late he was a solicitor and my husband was obviously in some fear of him the interviews between them while they were closeted together morning after morning in one of our two sittingrooms were long and apparently unpleasant for more than once i caught the sound of angry words on both sides with oaths and heavy blows upon the table but towards the end of the week my husbands lawyer arrived in london and after that the conversations became more pacific one morning as i sat writing a letter in the adjoining room i heard laughter the popping of corks the jingling of glasses and the drinking of healths and i judged that the difficult and disagreeable business had been concluded at the close of the interview i heard the door opened and my husband going into the outer corridor to see his visitors to the lift and then something prompted megod alone knows whatto step into the room they had just vacated it was thick with tobacco smoke an empty bottle of champagne with three empty wine glasses was on the table and on a desk by the window were various papers including a sheet of foolscap which bore a seal and several signatures and a thick packet of old letters bound together with a piece of purple ribbon hardly had i had time to recognise these documents when my husband returned to the room and by the dark expression of his face i saw instantly that he thought i had looked at them no matter he said without any preamble i might as well tell you at once and have done with it he told me the letters were his they had been written to a woman whom he had promised to marry and he had had to buy them back from her although for three years he had spent a fortune on the creature she had shown him no mercy through her solicitor who was a scoundrel she had threatened him saying in plain words that if he married anybody else she would take proceedings against him immediately that was why in spite of the storm we had to come up to london on the day after our wedding now you know said my husband look here holding out the sheet of foolscap five thousand poundsthats the price ive had to pay for marrying i can give no idea of the proud imperiousness and the impression of injury with which my husband told his brutal story but neither can i convey a sense of the crushing shame with which i listened to it there was not a hint of any consciousness on his part of my side of the case not a suggestion of the clear fact that the woman he had promised to marry had been paid off by money which had come through me not a thought of the humiliation he had imposed upon his wife in dragging her up to london at the demand of his castoff mistress when my husband had finished speaking i could not utter a word i was afraid that my voice would betray the anger that was boiling in me but i was also degraded to the very dust in my own eyes and to prevent an outburst of hysterical tears i ran back to my room and hid my face in my pillow what was the good of trying to make myself in love with a man who was separated from me by a moral chasm that could never be passed what was the good what was the good fortyfirst chapter but next morning having had time to think things out in my simple and ignorant way i tried to reconcile myself to my position remembering what aunt bridget had said both before my marriage and after it about the different moralities of men and women i told myself i had placed my standard too high perhaps a husband was not a superior being to be regarded with respect and reverence but a sort of grownup child whom it was the duty of a wife to comfort coax submit to and serve i determined to do this still clinging to the hope of falling in love with my husband i set myself to please him by every means within my power even to the length of simulating sentiments which i did not feel but what a task i was setting myself what a steep and stony calvary i was attempting to climb after the degrading business with the other woman had been concluded i thought we should have left england immediately on the honeymoon tour which my husband had mapped out for us but he told me that would not be convenient and we must remain in london a little longer we stayed six weeks altogether and never did a young wife pass a more cheerless and weary time i had no friends of my own within reach and to my deep if secret mortification no woman of my husbands circle called upon me but a few of his male friends were constantly with us including mr eastcliff who had speedily followed us from ellan and a mr vivian who though the brother of a cabinet minister seemed to me a very vain and vapid person with the eyes of a mole a vacant smile a stupid expression an abrupt way of speaking through his teeth and a shrill voice which gave the impression of screeching against the wind with these two men and others of a similar kind we passed many hours of nearly every day lunching with them dining with them walking with them driving with them and above all playing bridge with them in one of our sitting rooms in the hotel i knew nothing of the game to begin with never having touched a card in my life but in accordance with the theories which i believed to be right and the duties i had imposed upon myself i took a hand with my husband when he could find nobody better to be his partner the results were very disheartening in spite of my desire to please i was slow to learn and my husbands impatience with my mistakes which confused and intimidated me led to some painful humiliations first he laughed next he sneered then he snapped me up in the midst of my explanations and apologies and finally at a moment of loss he broke out on me with brutal derision saying he had never had much opinion of my intellect but was now quite sure that i had no more brains than a rabbit and could not say boo to a goose one day when we were alone and he was lying on the couch with his vicious little terrier by his side i offered to sing to him remembering how my voice had been praised i thought it would be pleasant to my husband to see that there was something i really could do but nine years in a convent had left me with next to no music but memories of the longbreathed harmonies of some of the beautiful masses of our church and hardly had i begun on these when my husband cried oh stop stop for heavens sake stop or i shall think were attending a funeral another day i offered to read to him the reverend mother used to say i was the best reader she had ever heard but perhaps it was not altogether my husbands fault if he formed a different opinion and indeed i cannot but think that the holy saints themselves would have laughed if they had heard me reading aloud in the voice and intonation which i had assumed for the meditations of st francis of assisi the mystic allusions to certs and bookies and punters and evens and scratchings which formed the substance of the sporting journals that were my husbands only literature oh stop it stop it he cried again you read the winning post as if it were the book of revelation as time passed the gulf that separated me from my husband became still greater if i could have entertained him with any kind of gossip we might have got on better but i had no conversation that interested him and he had little or none that i could pretend to understand he loved the town i loved the country he loved the night and the blaze of electric lights i loved the morning and the sweetness of the sun at the bottom of my heart i knew that his mind was common low and narrow and that his tastes were gross and vulgar but i was determined to conquer the repulsion i felt for him it was impossible if i could have struck one spark from the flint of his heart the relations between us might have been different if his look could have met my look in a single glance of understanding i could have borne with his impatience and struggled on but nothing of this kind ever happened and when one dreary night after grumbling at the servants cursing his fate and abusing everybody and everything he put on his hat and went out saying he had better have married lena the other woman after all for in that case he would have had some sort of society anyway the revulsion i had felt on the night of my marriage came sweeping over me like a wave of the sea and i asked myself again whats the good whats the good fortysecond chapter nevertheless next day i found myself taking my husbands side against myself if he had sacrificed anything in order to marry me it was my duty to make it up to him i resolved that i should make it up to him i would study my husbands likes and dislikes in every little thing i would share in his pleasures and enter into his life i would show him that a wife was something other and better than any hired woman in the world and that when she cast in her lot with her husband it was for his own sake only and not for any fortune he could spend on her yes yes thats what ill do i thought and i became more solicitous of my husbands happiness than if i had really and truly loved him a woman would smile at the efforts which i made in my inexperience to make my husband forget his castoff mistress and indeed some of them were very childish the first was a ridiculous failure my husbands birthday was approaching and i wished to make him a present it was difficult to know what to select for i knew little or nothing of his tastes or wants but walking one day in a street off oxford street i saw in the window of a shop for the sale of objects of ecclesiastical vertu among crosses and crucifixes and rosaries a little ivory inkstand and paperholder which was surmounted by a figure of the virgin i cannot for the life of me conceive why i thought this would be a suitable present for my husband except that the face of our lady was so young so sweet so beautiful and so exquisitely feminine that it seemed impossible that any man in the world should not love her but however that might be i bought her and carrying her home in a cab i set her on my husbands desk without a word and then stood by like the mother of moses to watch the result there was no resultat first at all events my husband was several hours in the room with my treasure without appearing to be aware of its presence but towards evening his two principal friends came to play bridge with him and then from the ambush of my own apartments i heard the screechy voice of mr vivian saying dash it all jimmy you dont say youre going to be a pape dont fret yourself old fellow replied my husband thats my wifes little flutter dare say the poor fool has had to promise her priest to make me a vert my next experiment was perhaps equally childish but certainly more successful seeing that my husband was fond of flowers and was rarely without a rose in his buttonhole i conceived the idea of filling his room with them in honour of his birthday with this view i got up very early before anybody in the hotel was stirring and hurried off to covent garden through the empty and echoing streets while the air of london was fresh with the breath of morning and the big city within its highbuilt walls seemed to dream of the green fields beyond i arrived at the busy and noisy square just as the waggons were rolling in from the country with huge crates of red and white roses bright with the sunshine and sparkling with the dew then buying the largest and loveliest and costliest bunch of them a great armful as much as i could hold i hurried back to the hotel and set them in vases and glasses in every part of my husbands roomhis desk his sideboard his mantelpiece and above all his table which a waiter was laying for breakfastuntil the whole place was like a bridal bower ah this is something like i heard my husband say as he came out of his bedroom an hour or two afterwards with his vicious terrier at his heels i heard no more until he had finished breakfast and then while drawing on his gloves for his morning walk he said to the waiter who was clearing the table tell your manageress i am much obliged to her for the charming flowers with which she has decorated my room this morning but it wasnt the manageress my lord said the waiter then who was it it was her her ladyship said the waiter ooh said my husband in a softer if more insinuating tone and a few minutes afterwards he went out whistling god knows that was small reward for the trouble i had taken but i was so uplifted by the success of my experiment that i determined to go farther and when towards evening of the same day a group of my husbands friends came to tell him that they had booked a box at a wellknown musical comedy theatre i begged to be permitted to join them nonsense my dear brompton oratory would suit you better said my husband chucking me under the chin but i persisted in my importunities and at length mr eastcliff said let her come why shouldnt she very well said my husband pinching my cheek as you please but if you dont like it dont blame me it did not escape me that as a result of my change of front my husband had risen in his own esteem and that he was behaving towards me as one who thought he had conquered my first repugnance or perhaps triumphantly ridden over it but in my simplicity i was so fixed in my determination to make my husband forget the loss of his mistress that i had no fear of his familiarities and no misgivings about his mistakes all that was to come later with a fresh access of revulsion and disgust fortythird chapter i had seen enough of london by this time to know that the dresses which had been made for me at home were by no means the mode but after i had put on the bestfitting of my simple quakerlike costumes with a string of the family pearls about my neck and another about my head not all the teaching of the good women of the convent could prevent me from thinking that my husband and his friends would have no reason to be ashamed of me we were a party of six in all whereof i was the only woman and we occupied a large box on the first tier near the stage a position of prominence which caused me a certain embarrassment when as happened at one moment of indefinable misery the opera glasses of the people in the dresscircle and stalls were turned in our direction i cannot say that the theatre impressed me certainly the building itself did not do so although it was beautifully decorated in white and gold for i had seen the churches of rome and in my eyes they were much more gorgeous neither did the audience impress me for though i had never before seen so many welldressed people in one place i thought too many of the men when past middle life seemed fat and overfed and too many of the women with their plump arms and bare shoulders looked as if they thought of nothing but what to eat and what to put on nor did the performers impress me for though when the curtain rose disclosing the stage full of people chiefly girls in delicate and beautiful toilettes i thought i had never before seen so many lovely and happy faces after a while when the faces fell into repose i thought they were not really lovely and not really happy but hard and strained and painful as if life had been very cruel and above all i was not impressed by the play for i thought in my ignorance of such productions that i had never heard anything so frivolous and foolish and more than once i found myself wondering whether my good nuns if they could have been present would not have concluded that the whole company had taken leave of their senses there was however one thing which did impress me and that was the leading actor it was a woman and when she first came on to the stage i thought i had never in my life seen anybody so beautiful with her lovely soft round figure her black eyes her red lips her pearly white teeth and a smile so sunny that it had the effect of making everybody in the audience smile with her but the strange thing wasi could not account for itthat after a few minutes i thought her extremely ugly and repellent for her face seemed to be distorted by malice and envy and hatred and nearly every other bad passion nevertheless she was a general favourite for not only was she applauded before she did anything but everything she said though it was sometimes very silly was accompanied by a great deal of laughter and everything she sang though her voice was no great matter was followed by a chorus of applause seeing this and feeling that her appearance had caused a flutter of interest in the box behind me i laughed and applauded also in accordance with the plan i had prepared for myself of sharing my husbands pleasures and entering into his life although at the bottom of my heart i really thought the joy was not very joyful or the mirth very merry this went on for nearly an hour and then a strange thing happened i was leaning forward on the velvet barrier of the box in front of me laughing and clapping my hands with the rest when all at once i became aware that the lady had wheeled about and walking down the stage in the direction of our box was looking boldly back at me i could not at first believe it to be so and even now i cannot say whether it was something in her face or something whispered at my back which flashed it upon my mind that this was the woman my husband ought to have married the woman whose place i had taken the woman of the foolscap document and the letters in the purple ribbon after that i could play my poor little part no longer and though i continued to lean on the yellow velvet of the barrier in front of me i dropped my eyes as often as that woman was on the stage and hoped and prayed for the end of the performance it came at length with a crash of instruments and voices and a few minutes afterwards my husband and i were in the cab on our way back to the hotel i was choking with mingled anger and shameanger at my husband for permitting me to come to a place in which i could be exposed to a public affront from his castoff mistress shame at the memory of the pitiful scheme for entering into his life which had fallen to such a welter of wreck and ruin but my husband himself was only choking with laughter it was as good as a play he said upon my soul it was i never saw anything funnier in the whole course of my life that served him repeated again and again until we reached the hotel when he ordered a bottle of wine to be sent upstairs and then shook with suppressed laughter as we went up in the lift coming to our floor i turned towards my bedroom wishing to be alone with my outraged feelings but my husband drew me into one of our sittingrooms telling me he had something to say he put me to sit in an armchair threw off his overcoat lit a cigarette as well as he could for the spurts and gusts of his laughter and then standing back to the fireplace with one hand in his pocket and his coattail over his arm he told me the cause of his merriment i dont mind telling you that was lena he said the goodlooking girl in the scarlet dress and the big diamonds she spotted me the moment she stepped on to the stage must have guessed who you were too did you see how she looked at you thought i had brought you there to walk over her im sure she did there was another gust of laughter and then shed been going about saying i had married an old frump for the sake of her fortune and when she saw that you could wipe her off the face of the earth without a gown that was worth wearing she was ready to die with fury there was another gust of laughter through the smoke that was spurting from his mouth and then and you too my dear laughing and applauding she thought you were trying to crow over her on her own particular barndoor too upon my soul it was too amusing i wonder she didnt throw something at you shes like that when shes in her tantrums the waiter came in with the wine and my husband poured out a glass for me have a drink no well heres to your health my dear i cant get over it i really cant lenas too funny for anything why what else do you think shes been saying shes been saying ill come back to her yet yes ill give him six months to come crawling back to me she said to eastcliff and vivian and some of the other fellows at the club wonder if she thinks so now i wonder he threw away his cigarette drank another glass of the wine came close up to me and said in a lower tone which made my skin creep as with cold whether shes right or wrong depends on you though on me why yes of course thats only natural one may have all the goodwill in the world but a mans a man you know i felt my lips quivering with anger and in an effort to control myself i rose to go but my husband drew me back into my chair and sat on the arm of it dont go yet by the way dear ive never thanked you for the beautiful flowers with which you decorated my room this morning charming but i always knew you would soon come round to it come round to what i said but it was just as if somebody else were speaking you know of course you know when that simple old priest proposed that ridiculous compact i agreed but i knew quite well that it would soon break down not on my side though why should it a man can afford to wait but i felt sure you would soon tire of your resistance and you have havent you oh im not blind ive seen whats been going on though ive said nothing about it again i tried to rise and again my husband held me to my seat saying dont be ashamed theres no reason for that you were rather hard on me you know but im going to forget all about it why shouldnt i ive got the loveliest little woman in the world so i mean to meet her half way and shes going to get over her conventbred ideas and be my dear little darling wife now isnt she i could have died of confusion and the utter degradation of shame to think that my poor efforts to please him my vain attempts to look up to him and reverence him my bankrupt appeals to the spiritual woman in me that i might bring myself to love him as i thought it was my duty to do should have been perverted by his gross and vulgar mind into overtures to the animal man in himthis was more than i could bear i felt the tears gushing to my eyes but i kept them back for my selfpity was not so strong as my wrath i rose this time without being aware of his resistance let me go to bed i said certainly most certainly my dear but let me go to bed i said again and at the next moment i stepped into my room he did not attempt to follow me i saw in a mirror in front what was taking place behind me my husband was standing where i had left him with a look first of amazement and then of rage i cant understand you he said upon my soul i cant there isnt a man in the world who could after that he strode into his own bedroom and clashed the door after him oh whats the good i thought again it was impossible to make myself in love with my husband it was no use trying fortyfourth chapter i must leave it to those who know better than i do the way to read the deep mysteries of a womans heart to explain how it came to pass that the only result of this incident was to make me sure that if we remained in london much longer my husband would go back to the other woman and to say why seeing that i did not love him i should have become feverishly anxious to remove him from the range of this temptation yet so it was for the very next morning i wrote to my father saying i had been unwell and begging him to use his influence with my husband to set out on the egyptian trip without further delay my fathers answer was prompt what he had read between the lines of my letter i do not know what he said was this daughtercertainly i am writing to soninlaw telling him to quit london quick i guess youve been too long there already and while you are away you can draw on me yourself for as much as you please for where it is a matter of money you must never let nobody walk over you yoursc the letter to my husband produced an immediate result within twentyfour hours the telephone was at work with inquiries about trains and berths on steamers and within a week we were on our way to marseilles to join the ship that was to take us to port said our staterooms were on the promenade deck of the steamer with a passageway between them this admitted of entirely separate existences which was well for knowing or guessing my share in our altered arrangements my husband had become even more morose than before and no conversation could be sustained between us he spent the greater part of his time in his stateroom grumbling at the steward abusing his valet beating his badtempered terrier and cursing the luck that had brought him on this senseless voyage more than ever now i felt the gulf that divided us i could not pass one single hour with him in comfort my life was becoming as cold as an empty house and i was beginning to regret the eagerness with which i had removed my husband from a scene in which he had at least lived the life of a rational creature when an unexpected event brought me a thrill of passing pleasure our seats in the saloon were at the top of the doctors table and the doctor himself was a young irishman of three or fourandtwenty as bright and breezy as a march morning and as racy of the soil as newcut peat hearing that i was from ellan he started me by asking if by chance i knew martin conrad martin conrad i repeated feeling i hardly knew why as if a rosy veil were falling over my face and neck yes mart conrad as we call him the young man who has gone out as doctor with lieutenant s expedition to the south pole a wave of tender feeling from my childhood came surging up to my throat and i said he was the first of my boy friendsin fact the only one the young doctors eyes sparkled and he looked as if he wanted to throw down his soupspoon jump up and grasp me by both hands god bless me is that so he said it turned out that martin and he had been friends at dublin university they had worked together roomed together and taken their degrees at the same time so you know mart lord alive the way things come out it was easy to see that martin was not only his friend but his hero he talked of him with a passionate love and admiration with which men whatever they feel rarely speak of each other martin was the salt of the earth he was the finest fellow and the staunchest friend and the bravesthearted chap that walked under the stars of god the greatest chum i have in the world too and by the holy immaculate mother im destroyed at being away from him it was like music to hear him speak a flood of joy went sweeping through me at every word of praise he gave to martin and yeti cannot explain why unless it was the woman in me the irishwoman or something like itbut i began to depreciate martin in order to hoosh him on so that he might say more on the same subject then he did take his degree i said he was never very clever at his lessons i remember and i heard that he was only just able to scrape through his examinations the young doctor fell to my bait like a darling with a flaming face and a nervous rush of racy words which made me think that if i closed my eyes i should be back on the steps of the church in rome talking to martin himself he told me i was mistaken if i thought his friend was a numskull for he had had the biggest brainpan in college green and the way he could learn things when he wanted to was wonderful he might be a bit shaky in his spelling and perhaps he couldnt lick the world in latin but his heart was always in exploring and the way he knew geography especially the part of it they call the unknown the arctic and the antarctic and what charcot had done there and biscoe and bellamy and durville and greely and nansen and shackleton and peary was enough to make the provost and professors look like fools of the earth by the side of him why what do you think said the doctor when he went to london to apply for his billet the lieutenant said to him you must have been down there before young man no such luck said martin but you know as much about the antarctic already as the whole boiling of us put together said the lieutenant yes by st patrick and st thomas hes a geographer any way i admitted that much and to encourage the doctor to go on i told him where i had seen martin last and what he had said of his expedition in rome you say said the doctor with a note of jealousy you beat me there then i saw him off from london though a few of us dublin boys being in town at the time went down to tilbury to see him sail and when they were lifting anchor and the tug was hitching on we stood on the piersixteen strongand set up some of our college songs stop your noising boys said he the lieutenant will be hearing you but not a bit of it we sang away as long as we could see him going out with the tide and then we went back in the train smoking our pipes like so many vauxhall chimneys and narra a word out of the one of us yes yes there are some men like that they come like the stars of night and go like the light of heaven same as there are some women who walk the world like the sun and leave the grass growing green wherever their feet have trod it was very ridiculous i did not then understand why it should be so but the tears came gushing into my eyes while the doctor spoke and it was as much as i could do to preserve my composure what interpretation my husband put upon my emotion i do not know but i saw that his face darkened and when the doctor turned to him to ask if he also knew martin he answered curtly and brusquely not i no loss either i should say no loss said the doctor show me the man under the stars of god thats fit to hold a candle to martin conrad and by the angel gabriel ill go fifty miles out of my way to put a sight on him more than ever after this talk about martin conrad i was feeling defenceless and at the mercy of my husbands wishes and whims when something happened which seemed to change his character altogether the third day out on a bright and quiet morning we called at malta and while my husband went ashore to visit some friends in the garrison i sat on deck watching the life of the little port and looking at the big warships anchored in the bay a maltese woman came on board to sell souvenirs of the island and picking out of her tray a tiny twisted thing in coral i asked what it was thats a charm my lady said the woman a charm for what to make my ladys husband love her i felt my face becoming crimson but my heart was sore so in my simplicity i bought the charm and was smuggling it into my bag when i became aware that one of my fellowpassengers a lady was looking down at me she was a tall singularly handsome woman fashionably and although on shipboard almost sumptuously dressed a look in her face was haunting me with a memory i could not fix when she stooped and said arent you mary oneill the voice completed the identification and i knew who it was it was alma lier she was now about sevenandtwenty and in the prime of her young womanhood her beautiful auburn hair lay low over her broad forehead almost descending to her long sablecoloured eyebrows her cheeks were very white rather beyond the whiteness of nature i thought and her lips were more than commonly red with the upper one a little thin and the lower slightly set forward but her eyes were still her distinguishing feature being larger and blacker than before and having that vivid gaze that looked through and through you and made you feel that few women and no man in the world would have the power to resist her her movements were almost noiseless and as she sank into the chair by my side there was a certain oversweetness in the soft succulent tones of the voice with which she began to tell me what had happened to her since i had seen her last it was a rather painful story after two or three years in a girls college in her own country she had set out with her mother for a long tour of the european capitals in berlin at what was falsely called a charity ball she had met a young russian count who was understood to be rich and related to one of the grand ducal families against the protests of her father a shrewd american banker she had married the count and they had returned to new york where her mother had social ambitions there they had suffered a serious shock it turned out that her husband had deceived them and that he was really a poor and quite nameless person only remotely related to the family he claimed to belong to nevertheless alma had won out at last by digging deep into her fathers treasury she got rid of her treacherous husband and going way out west she had been able in due time to divorce him since then she had resumed her family name being known as madame lier and now she was on her way to egypt to spend the season at cairo and you she said you stayed long at the conventyes i answered that i had and then in my fluttering voice for some of the old spell of her presence had come sweeping back upon me i replied one by one to the questions she asked about the reverend mother the reverend mother mildred sister angela and father giovanni not to speak of myself whom she had always thought of as margaret mary because i had looked so innocent and nunlike and now you are married she said married so splendidly too we heard all about it mother was so interested what a lucky girl you are everybody says your husband is so handsome and charming he is isnt he i was doing my utmost to put the best face upon my condition without betraying the facts or simulating sentiments which i could not feel when a boat from the shore pulled up at the ships side and my husband stepped on to the deck in his usual morose manner he was about to pass without speaking on his way to his stateroom when his eyes fell on alma sitting beside me then he stopped and looked at us and stepping up he said in a tone i had never heard from him before mary my dear will you not present me to your friend i hesitated and then with a quivering of the lips i did so but something told me as i introduced my husband to alma and alma to my husband and they stood looking into each others eyes and holding each others hands for alma had risen and i was sitting between them that this was the most momentous incident of my life thus farthat for good or ill my hour had struck and i could almost hear the bell fortyfifth chapter from that hour forward my husband was a changed man his manner to me so brusque before became courteous kind almost affectionate every morning he would knock at the door of my stateroom to ask if i had slept well or if the movement of the steamer had disturbed me his manner to alma was charming he was up before breakfast every day promenading the deck with her in the fresh salt air i would slide back my window and hear their laughter as they passed above the throb of the engines and the wash of the sea sometimes they would look in upon me and joke and alma would say and hows margaret mary this morning our seats in the saloon had been changed now we sat with alma at the captains table and though i sorely missed the doctors racy talk about martin conrad i was charmed by almas bright wit and the fund of her personal anecdotes she seemed to know nearly everybody my husband knew everybody also and their conversation never flagged something of the wonderful and worshipful feeling i had had for alma at the sacred heart came back to me and as for my husband it seemed to me that i was seeing him for the first time he persuaded the captain to give a dance on our last night at sea so the awnings were spread the electric lights were turned on and the deck of the ship became a scene of enchantment my husband and alma led off he danced beautifully and she was dressed to perfection not being a dancer myself i stood with the captain in the darkness outside looking in on them in the bright and dazzling circle while the moonrays were sweeping the waters like a silver fan and the little waves were beating the ships side with friendly pats i was almost happy in my simplicity i was feeling grateful to alma for having wrought this extraordinary change so that when on our arrival at port said my husband said your friend madame lier has made no arrangements for her rooms at cairohadnt i better telegraph to our hotel dear i answered yes and wondered why he had asked me our hotel was an oriental building situated on an island at the further side of the nile formerly the palace of a dead khedive who had built it in honour of the visit of an empress it had a vast reception hall with a great staircase there with separated rooms as in london we remained for three months i was enthralled too young and inexperienced to be conscious of the darker side of the picture before me i found everything beautiful i was seeing fashionable life for the first time and it was entrancing lovely and richlydressed ladies in silk velvet lace and no limit of jewellerythe dark french women the blonde german women the stately english women and the american women with their flexuous grace and then the british soldiers in their various uniforms the semiturks in their red tarbooshes and the diplomats of all nationalities italian austrian french germanwhat a cosmopolitan world it was what a meetingplace of all nations every hour had its interest but i liked best the hour of tea on the terrace for that was the glorious hour of woman when every condition invested her dress with added beauty and her smile with greater charm such a blaze of colour in the sunshine such a sea of muslin flowers and feathers such lovely female figures in diaphanous clouds of toilettes delicate as gossamer and varied as the colours in the rainbow they were like a living bouquet as they sat under the shade of the verandah with the green lawns and the palm trees in front the redcoated orchestra behind and the noiseless forms of swarthy bednouins and nubians moving to and fro although i had been brought up in such a different world altogether i could not help being carried away by all this beauty my senses burgeoned out and my heart seemed to expand as for alma and my husband they seemed to belong to the scene of themselves she would sit at one of the teatables swishing away the buzzing flies with a little whip of cord and cowries and making comments on the crowd in soft undertones which he alone seemed to catch her vivid and searching eyes with their constant suggestion of laughter seemed to be picking out absurdities on every side and finding nearly everybody funny she found me funny also my innocence and my conventbred ideas were a constant subject of jest with her what does our dear little margaret mary think of that she would say with a significant smile at sights that seemed to me quite harmless after a while i began to have a feeling of indefinable uneasiness about alma she was daily redoubling her cordiality always calling me her dearest sweetest girl and the oldest friend she had in the world but little by little i became conscious of a certain commerce between her and my husband in which i had no part sometimes i saw her eyes seeking his and occasionally i heard them exchange a few words about me in french which because i did not speak it being uncertain of my accent they thought i did not understand perhaps this helped to sharpen my wits for i began to see that i had gone the wrong way to work with my husband instead of trying to make myself fall in love with my husband i should have tried to make my husband fall in love with me when i asked myself how this was to be done i found one obvious answeri must become the sort of woman my husband admired and liked in short i must imitate alma i resolved to do this and after all that has happened since i feel a little ashamed to tell of the efforts i made to play a part for which i was so illfitted by nature and education some of them were silly enough perhaps but some were almost pathetic and i am not afraid that any good woman will laugh at the futile shifts i was put to in my girlish ignorance to make my husband love me i must do it i thought i must i must fortysixth chapter hitherto i had attended to myself but now i determined to have a maid i found one without much difficulty her name was price she was a very plain woman of thirty with piercing black eyes and when i engaged her she seemed anxious above all else to make me understand that she never saw anything i soon discovered that she saw everything especially the relations between myself and my husband and that she put her own interpretation not a very flattering one on our separated apartments she also saw the position of alma and putting her own interpretation upon that also she tortured me with many pinpricks under the guidance of my maid i began to haunt the shops of the dressmakers the milliners and the jewellers it did not require the memory of my fathers letter to make me spend his moneyi spent it like water feeling ashamed of my quakercut costumes alma had a costume for every day of the week and wore a large gold snake on her arm i bought the most costly toilettes and loaded myself with bracelets rings and necklaces i was dressing for my husband and for him i did many things i had never dreamt of doing before for him i filed my nails put cream on my skin perfume on my handkerchief and even rouge on my lips although i did not allow myself to think of it so i was running a race with alma my maid knew that before i did and the first night she put me into one of my uncomfortable new gowns she stood off from me and said his lordship must be a strange gentleman if he can resist you now i felt ashamed yet pleased too and went downstairs with a certain confidence the result was disappointing my husband smiled rather condescendingly and though alma praised me beyond measure i saw that she was secretly laughing as she said our margaret mary is coming out isnt she nevertheless i persevered without too much preparation for so perilous an enterprise i threw myself into the gaieties of cairo attending polo matches racemeetings picnics at the pyramids dances at the different hotels and on the island of roda where according to tradition pharaohs daughter found moses in the bulrushes i think i may say that i drew the eyes of other men upon me particularly those of the colonel commanding on the citadel a fine type of scotsman who paid me the most worshipful attention but i thought of nobody but my husband being determined to make him forget alma and fall in love with me it was a hopeless task and i had some heartbreaking hours one day calling at a jewellers to see a diamond necklace which i greatly coveted i was told in confidence that my husband had been pricing it but had had to give it up because it was a thousand francs too dear for him i was foolish enough to pay the thousand francs myself under a pledge of secrecy and to tell the jeweller to send the necklace to my husband feeling sure in my simplicity that it had been meant for me next night i saw it on almas neck and could have died of mortification and shame i daresay it was all very weak and very childish but i really think my last attempt if rather ridiculous was also very pitiful towards the end of our stay the proprietors of the hotel gave a cotillon as this was the event of the season and nearly every woman was giving a dinner in honour of it i resolved that i too would give one inviting the gayest of the gay acquaintances i had made in cairo feeling that it would be my last battle and that so much depended upon it i dressed myself with feverish care in a soft white satin gown which was cut lower than i had ever worn before with slippers to match a tight band of pearls about my throat and another about my head when price had finished dressing me she said well if his lordship prefers anybody else in the world tonight i shant know where he puts his eyes the compliment was a crude one but i had no time to think of that for my heart was fluttering with hopes and fears and i think any woman would forgive me under the circumstances if i told myself as i passed the tall mirrors on the stairs that i too was beautiful the diningroom was crowded when i entered it with my guests and seeing that we were much observed it flashed upon me that my husband and i had become a subject of gossip partly for that reason i strangled the ugly thing that was writhing in my bosom and put alma who had flown to me with affectionate rapture next to my husband and the colonel commanding on the citadel in the seat beside me throughout the dinner which was very long i was very nervous and though i did my best to keep up conversation with the colonel i knew quite well that i was listening to what was being said at the other side of my big round table and as often as any mention was made of margaret mary i heard it more than once alma lifted her glass with a gracious nod and smile crying mary dearest and then in another moment gave my husband one of her knowing glances which seemed to me to say look at that foolish little wife of yours by the time we returned to the hall for coffee we were rather a noisy party and even the eyes of the ladies betrayed the fact that they had dined the talk which had grown louder was also a little more free and god forgive me i joined in it being feverishly anxious to outdo alma and be looked upon as a woman of the world towards eleven oclock the redcoated orchestra began to play a waltz and then the whole variegated company of ladies soldiers and diplomats stood up to dance and the colonel asked me to join him i was ashamed to tell him that i had never danced except with a schoolgirl so i took his hand and started but hardly had we begun when i made mistakes which i thought everybody saw i am sure alma saw them and before we had taken many turns my partner had to stop whereupon i retired to my seat with a forced laugh and a sense of confusion it was nearly twelve when they began the cotillon which alma and my husband led with supreme selfpossession as one of the hostesses i sat in the front row of the square and when i was taken out i made further mistakes which also alma saw and communicated by smiles to my husband before the cotillon came to an end the night was far spent and then the company which had become very boisterous began to look for some new excitement no matter how foolish one or other started turkey trot and grizzly bear and finally alma with memories of the winter sports at st moritz proposed that they should toboggan down the great staircase the suggestion was welcomed with a shout and a broad board was immediately laid on the first long flight of stairs for people to slide on soldiers went first and then there were calls for the ladies when alma took her turn tucking her dress under her at the top and alighting safely on her feet at the bottom other ladies followed her example with similar good fortune and then alma who had been saying such fun such lots of fun set up a cry of margaret mary i refused at first feeling ashamed of even looking at such unwomanly folly but something alma said to my husband and something that was conveyed by my husbands glance at me set my heart afire and poor feverish and entangled fool that i was i determined to defy them so running up to the top and seating myself on the toboggan i set it in motion but hardly had i done so when it swayed reeled twisted and threw me off with the result that i rolled downstairs to the bottom of course there were shrieks of laughter and if i had been in the spirit of the time and place i suppose i should have laughed too and there would have been an end of the matter but i had been playing a part a tragic part and feeling that i had failed and covered myself with ridicule i was overwhelmed with confusion i thought my husband would be angry with me and feel compromised by my foolishness but he was not he was amused and when at last i saw his face it was running in rivulets from the laughter he could not restrain that was the end of all things and when alma came up to me saying everything that was affectionate and insincere about her poor dear unfortunate margaret mary only women know how to wound each other so i brushed her aside went off to my bedroom and lay face down on the sofa feeling that i was utterly beaten and could fight no more half an hour afterwards my husband came in and though i did not look up i heard him say in a tone of indulgent sympathy that cut me to the quick youve been playing the wrong part my child a madonna yes but a venus no its not your metier whats the good whats the good whats the good i asked myself i thought my heart was broken fortyseventh chapter with inexpressible relief i heard the following day that we were to leave for rome immediately alma was to go with us but that did not matter to me in the least outside the atmosphere of this place so artificial so unrelated to nature her power over my husband would be gone once in the holy city everything would be different alma would be different i should be different above all my husband would be different i should take him to the churches and basilicas i should show him the shrines and papal processions and he would see me in my true part at last but what a deep disappointment awaited me on reaching rome we put up at a fashionable hotel in the new quarter of the ludovisi and although that was only a few hundred yards from the spot on which i had spent nine happy years it seemed to belong to another world altogether instead of the church domes and the monastery bells there were the harsh clang of electric trams the thrum and throb of automobiles the rattle of cars and the tramp of soldiers then i realised that there were two romesan old rome and a new one and that the rome we had come to hardly differed from the cairo we had left behind there was the same varied company of people of all nations english americans french german the same nomad tribes of the rich and dissolute pitching their tents season by season in the sunny resorts of europe the same aimless society the same debauch of fashion the same callous and wicked luxury the same thirst for selfish pleasures the same busy idleness the same corruption of character and sex this made me very unhappy but from first to last alma was in the highest spirits everybody seemed to be in rome that spring and everybody seemed to be known either to her or to my husband for almas sake we were invited everywhere and thus we saw not only the life of the foreign people of the hotels but that of a part not the better part of the roman aristocracy alma was a great success she had the homage of all the men and being understood to be rich and having the gift of making every man believe he was her special favourite she was rarely without a group of italian noblemen about her chair with sharper eyes the italian women saw that her real reckoning lay with my husband but they seemed to think no worse of her for that they seemed to think no worse of him either it was nothing against him that having married me as everybody appeared to know for the settlement of his financial difficulties he had transferred his attentions even on his honeymoon to this brilliant and alluring creature as for me i was made to realise that i was a person of a different class altogether when people wished to be kind they called me spirituelle and when they were tempted to be the reverse they voted me insipid as a result i became very miserable in this company and i can well believe that i may have seemed awkward and shy and stupid when i was in some of their grey old palaces full of tapestry and bronze for i sometimes found the talk there so free especially among the women that the poisoned jokes went quivering through me things i had been taught to think sacred were so often derided that i had to ask myself if it could be rome my holy and beloved romethis city of license and unbelief but alma was entirely happy especially when the talk turned on conjugal fidelity and the faithful husband was held up to ridicule this happened very often in one house we used to go tothat of a countess of ancient family who was said to have her husband and her lover at either side of her when she sat down to dinner she was a large and handsome person of middle age with a great mass of fair hair and she gave me the feeling that in her case the body of a woman was inhabited by the soul of a man she christened me her little irish bambino meaning her child and one night in her drawingroom after dinner before the men had joined us she called me to her side on the couch lit a cigarette crossed her legs and gave us with startling candour her views of the marriage bond what can you expect you women she said you run after the men for their titlestheyve very little else except debts poor thingsand what is the result the first result is that though you have bought them you belong to them yes your husband owns his beautiful woman just as he owns his beautiful horse or his beautiful dog this was so pointed that i felt my face growing crimson but alma and the other women only laughed so the countess went on what then once in a blue moon each goes his and her own way without sin you agree to a sort of partnership for mutual advantage in which you live together in chastity under the same roof what a life what an icehouse again the other women laughed but i felt myself blushing deeply but in the majority of cases it is quite otherwise the business purpose served each is open to other emotions the man becomes unfaithful and the woman if she has any spirit pays him out tit for tatand why shouldnt she after that i could bear no more and before i knew what i was saying i blurted out but i find that wrong and wicked infidelity on the part of the man does not justify infidelity in the woman the prayerbook says so alma burst out laughing and the countess smiled and continued once in a hundred years there comes a great passiondante and beatrice petrarch and laura the woman meets the right man too late what a tragedy what a daily and hourly crucifixion unless said the countess with emphasis she is prepared to renounce the law and reject society and live a life of complete emancipation but in a catholic country where there is no divorce what woman can afford to do that nobody in the higher classes canespecially if she has to sacrifice her title so the wise woman avoids scandal keeps her little affair with her lover to herself and and thats marriage my dears a twitter of approval led by alma came from the other women but i was quivering with anger and i said then marriage is an hypocrisy and an imposture if i found i loved somebody better than my husband i should go to him in spite of the law and society and title and and everything of course you would my dear said the countess smiling at me as at a child but thats because you are such a sweet simple innocent little irish bambino it must have been a day or two after this that we were invited to the roman hunt i had no wish to go but alma who had begun to use me in order to save her face in relation to my husband induced me to drive them out in a motorcar to the place on the campagna where they were to mount their horses dear sweet girl said alma how could we possibly go without you it was sunday and i sat between alma in her riding habit and my husband in his riding breeches while we ran through the porta san giovanni and past the osterie where the pleasureloving italian people were playing under the pergolas with their children until we came to the meetingground of the hunt by the trappist monastery of tre fontane a large company of the roman aristocracy were gathered there with their horses and hounds and they received alma and my husband with great cordiality what they thought of me i do not know except that i was a childish and complacent wife and when at the sound of the horn the hunt began and my husband and alma went prancing off with the rest without once looking back i asked myself in my shame and distress if i could bear my humiliation much longer but then came a moment of unexpected pleasure a cheerful voice on the other side of the car said good morning lady raa it was the young irish doctor from the steamer his ship had put into naples for two days and like martin conrad before my marriage he had run up to look at rome but have you heard the news he cried what news about the south pole expeditiontheyre on their way home so soon yes they reached new zealand on saturday was a week and and and martin conrad hes well and whats better he has distinguished himself i i i knew he would so did i the way i was never fearing that if they gave mart half a chance he would come out top do or diethat was his watchword i know i know his eyes were sparkling and so i suppose were mine while with a joyous rush of racy words punctuated by me with yes yes yes he told of a long despatch from the lieutenant published by one of the london papers in which martin had been specially mentionedhow he had been put in command of some difficult and perilous expedition and had worked wonders how splendid how glorious how perfectly magnificent i said isnt it said the doctor and for a few moments more we bandied quick questions and replies like children playing at battledore and shuttlecock then he said but im after thinking its mortal strange i never heard him mention you there was only one chum at home he used to talk about and that was a mana boy i mean mally he was calling himthats short for maloney i suppose for mary i said mary is it why by the saints so it is where in the name of st patrick has been the irish head at me that i never thought of that before and you were yes well by the powers yeve a right to be proud of him for he was thinking pearls and diamonds of you i was mortal jealous of mally i remember mallys a stunner he used to say follow you anywhere if you wanted it in spite of the devil and hell the sparkling eyes were growing misty by this time but the woman in me made me sayi couldnt help it i dare say hes had many girl friends since my time though narra a one the girls used to be putting a glime on him in dublintheyre the queens of the world too those dublin girlsbut never a skute of the eye was he giving to the one of them i used to think it was work but maybe it wasnt maybe it was i dare not let him finish what i saw he was going to sayi didnt know what would happen to me if he didso i jumped in by telling him that if he would step into the car i would drive him back to rome he did so and all the way he talked of martin his courage and resource and the hardships he had gone through until with backward thoughts of alma and my husband riding away over the campagna my heart which had been leaping like a lamb began to ache and ache we returned by the old appian way where the birds were building their nests among the crumbling tombs through the porta san paolo and past the grave of the young english poet of whom i have always thought it was not so sad that he died of consumption as in the bitterness of a broken heart all this time i was so much at home with the young irish doctor who was martins friend that it was not until i was putting him down at his hotel that i remembered i did not even know his name it was osullivan fortyeighth chapter every day during our visit to rome i had reminded myself of the reverend mothers invitation to call on her and a sense of moral taint had prevented me but now i determined to see her at least by going to benediction at her convent church the very next day it happened however that this was the time when the artists club of rome were giving a veglione a kind of fancydress ball and as alma and my husband desired to go to it and were still in the way of using me to keep themselves in countenance i consented to accompany them on condition that i did not dress or dance and that they would go with me to benediction the following day dear sweet girl said alma well do whatever you like of course we will i wore my soft satin without any ornaments and my husband merely put scarlet facings on the lapels of his evening coat but alma was clad in a gorgeous dress of old gold with oriental skirts which showed her limbs in front but had a long train behind and made her look like a great vampire bat it was eleven oclock before we reached the theatre but already the auditorium was full and so well had the artists done their work of decoration making the air alive with floating specks of manycoloured lights like the fireflies at nemi that the scene was one of enchantment it was difficult to believe that on the other side of the walls was the street with the clanging electric bells and people hurrying by with their collars up for the night was cold and it had begun to rain as we came in and one poor woman with a child under her shawl was standing by the entrance trying to sell evening papers i sat alone in a box on the ground tier while alma and my husband and their friends were below on the level of the poltroni the stalls that had been arranged for the dancing which began immediately after we arrived and went on without a break until long after midnight then there was supper on the stage and those who did not eat drank a good deal until nearly everybody seemed to be under the influence of alcohol as a consequence many of the people especially some of the women not good women i fear seemed to lose all control of themselves singing snatches of noisy songs sipping out of the mens glasses taking the smoke of cigarettes out of the mens mouths sitting on the mens knees and even riding astride on the mens arms and shoulders i bore these sights as long as i could making many fruitless appeals to my husband to take me home and i was just about to leave of myself being sick of the degradation of my sex when a kind of rostrum with an empty chair on top of it was carried in on the shoulders of a number of men this was for the enthronement of the queen of beauty and as it passed round the arena with the mock judges in paper coronets walking ahead to make their choice some of the women lost to all sense of modesty were shouting take me take me i felt sure they would take alma so i reached forward to get a better view of her where she stood below my box but as they approached her with the chair still empty i saw her make a movement in my direction and say something to the judges about the little nun which made my husband nod his head and then laugh uproariously at the next moment before i knew what they were doing six or seven men jumped into my box lifted me on to the rostrum and placed me in the chair whereupon the whole noisy company in the theatre broke into wild shouts of salutation and pelted me with flowers and confetti if there was any pride there was more mortification in the position to which alma and my husband had exposed me for as i was being carried round the arena with the sea of foaming faces below me all screaming out of their hot and open mouths i heard the men cry smile signorina not so serious mademoiselle it would do no good to say what memories of other scenes flashed back on my mind as i was being borne along in the mad procession i felt as if it would last for ever but it came to an end at length and as soon as i was released i begged my husband again to take me home and when he said not yet well all be going byandby i stole away by myself found a cab and drove back to the hotel the day was dawning as i passed through the stony streets and when i reached my room and pulled down my dark green blinds the bell of the capuchin monastery in the via veneto was ringing and the monks were saying the first of their offices i must have been some time in bed hiding my hot face in the bedclothes when price my maid came in to apologise for not having seen me come back alone the pain of the womans scrutiny was more than i could bear at that moment so i tried to dismiss her but i could not get her to go and at last she said if you please my lady i want to say something i gave her no encouragement yet she continued i daresay its as much as my place is worth but im bound to say it still i said nothing yet she went on his lordship and madame have also arrived they came back half an hour ago and just now i saw his lordship coming out of madames room go away woman go away i cried in the fierce agony of my shame and she went out at last closing the door noisily behind her we did not go next day to benediction at the reverend mothers church but late the same night when it was quite dark i crept out of my room into the noisy streets hardly knowing where my footsteps were leading me until i found myself in the piazza of the convent of the sacred heart it was quiet enough there only the carabinieri were walking on the paved way with measured steps and the bell of the dominican monastery was slowly ringing under the silent stars i could see the light on the popes loggia at the vatican and hear the clock of st peters striking nine there were lights in the windows of some of the dormitories also and by that i knew that the younger children the children of the infant jesus were going to bed there was a light too in the large window of the church and that told me that the bigger girls were saying their night prayers creeping close to the convent wall i heard the girls voices rising and falling and then through the closed door of the church came the muffled sound of their evening hymn ave maris stella dei mater alma i did not know why i was putting myself wilfully to this bitter painthe pain of remembering the happy years in which i myself was a girl singing so and then telling myself that other girls were there now who knew nothing of me i thought of the reverend mother and then of my own mother my saint my angel who had told me to think of her when i sang that hymn and then i remembered where i was and what had happened to me virgin of all virgins to thy shelter take me i felt like an outcast a stifling sensation came into my throat and i dropped to my knees in the darkness i thought i was brokenhearted fortyninth chapter not long after that we left italy on our return to england we were to reach home by easy stages so as to see some of the great capitals of europe but i had no interest in the journey our first stay was at monte carlo that sweet garden of the mediterranean which god seems to smile upon and man to curse if i had been allowed to contemplate the beautiful spectacle of nature i think i could have been content but alma with her honeyed and insincere words took me to the casino on the usual plea of keeping her in countenance i hated the place from the first with its stale air its chink of louis dor its cry of the croupiers its strained faces about the tables and its general atmosphere of wasted hopes and fears and needless misery and despair as often as i could i crept out to look at the flower fetes in the streets or to climb the hill of la turbie and think i was on my native rocks with martin conrad or even to sit in my room and watch the poor wounded pigeons from the pigeontraps as they tumbled and ducked into the sea after the shots fired by cruel and unsportsmanlike sportsmen from the riflerange below in monte carlo my husbands vices seemed to me to grow rank and fast the gambling fever took complete possession of him at first he won and then he drank heavily but afterwards he lost and then his nature became still more ugly and repulsive one evening towards eight oclock i was in my room trying to comfort a brokenwinged pigeon which had come floundering through the open window when my husband entered with wild eyes the reds coming up at all the tables he cried breathlessly give me some money quick i told him i had no money except the few gold pieces in my purse youve a cheque bookgive me a cheque then i told him that even if i gave him a cheque he could not cash it that night the banks being closed the jewellers are open though and you have jewels havent you stop fooling with that creature and let me have some of them to pawn the situation was too abject for discussion so i pointed to the drawer in which my jewels were kept and he tore it open took what he wanted and went out hurriedly without more words after that i saw no more of him for two days when with black rings about his eyes he came in to say he must leave this accursed place immediately or we should all be ruined our last stoppingplace was paris and in my ignorance of the great french capital which has done so much for the world i thought it must be the sink of every kind of corruption we put up at a wellknown hotel in the champs elysees and there as well as in the cafes in the bois and at the races at longchamps on sundays we met the same people again most of them english and americans on their way home after the winter it seemed to me strange that there should be so many men and women in the world with nothing to do merely loafing round it like trampsthe richest being the idlest and the idlest the most immoral my husband knew many frenchmen of the upper classes and i think he spent several hours every day at their clubs but perhaps at almas instigation he made us wallow through the filth of paris by night it will be lots of fun said alma and then who is to know us in places like those i tolerated this for a little while and then refused to be dragged around any longer as a cloak for almas pleasures telling myself that if i continued to share my husbands habits of life for any reason or under any pretext i should become like him and my soul would rot inch by inch i resolved to be clean in my own eyes and to resist the contaminations of his company as a consequence he became more and more reckless and alma made no efforts to restrain him so that it came to pass at last that they went together to a scandalous entertainment which was for a while the talk of the society papers throughout europe i know no more of this entertainment than i afterwards learned from those sourcesthat it was given by a notorious woman who was not shut out of society because she was the good friend of a king that she did the honours with clever imitative elegance that her salon that night was crowded with such male guests as one might see at the court of a queenprinces dukes marquises counts english noblemen and members of parliament as well as some reputable women of my own and other countries that the tables were laid for supper at four oclock with every delicacy of the season and wines of the rarest vintage that after supper dancing was resumed with increased animation and that the dazzling and improper spectacle terminated with a chaine diabolique at seven in the morning when the sun was streaming through the windows and the bells of the surrounding churches were ringing for early mass i had myself risen early that morning to go to communion at the madeleine and never shall i forget the effect of cleansing produced upon me by the sacred sacrament from the moment whenthe priest standing at the foot of the altarthe choir sang the kyrie eleison down to the solemn silence of the elevation i had a sense of being washed from all the taint of the contaminating days since my marriage the music was perosis i remember and the voices in the gloria in excelsis which i used to sing myself seemed to carry up the cry of my sorrowful heart to the very feet of the virgin whose gracious figure hung above me cleanse me and intercede for me o mother of my god it was as though our blessed lady did so for as i walked out of the church and down the broad steps in front of it i had a feeling of purity and lightness that i had never known since my time at the sacred heart it was a beautiful day with all the freshness and fragrance of early morning in summer when the white stone houses of paris seem to blush in the sunrise and as i walked up the champs elysees on my way back to the hotel i met under the chestnut trees which were then in bloom a little company of young girls returning to school after their first communion how sweet they looked in their white muslin frocks white shoes and stockings and gloves white veils and coronets of white flowers they were twittering away as merrily as the little birds that were singing unseen in the leaves above them it made me feel like a child myself to look at their sweet faces but turning into the hotel i felt like a woman too for i thought the great and holy mystery the sacrament of union and love had given me such strength that i could meet any further wrong i might have to endure in my walk through the world with charity and forgiveness but how little a woman knows of her heart until it is tried in the fires of passion as i entered the salon which as usual divided my husbands bedroom from mine i came upon my maid price listening intently at my husbands closed door this seemed to me so improper that i was beginning to reprove her when she put her finger to her lip and coming over to me with her black eyes ablaze she said i know you will pack me off for what im going to say yet i cant help that youve stood too much already my lady but if you are a woman and have any pride in yourself as a wife go and listen at that door and see if you can stand any more with that she went out of the salon and i tried to go to my own room but i could not stir something held me to the spot on which i stood and i found myself listening to the voices which i could distinctly hear in my husbands bedroom there were two voices one a mans loud and reckless the other a womans soft and cautious there was no need to tell myself whose voices they were and neither did i ask myself any questions i did not put to my mind the pros and cons of the case for myself or the case for my husband i only thought and felt and behaved as any other wife would think and feel and behave at such a moment an ugly and depraved thing which my pride or my selfrespect had never hitherto permitted me to believe in suddenly leapt into life i was outraged i was a victim of the treachery the duplicity the disloyalty and the smothered secrecy of husband and friend my heart and soul were aflame with a sense of wrong all the sweetening and softening and purifying effects of the sacrament were gone in an instant and moving stealthily across the carpet towards my husbands door i swiftly turned the handle the door was locked i heard a movement inside the room and in a moment i hurried from the salon into the corridor intending to enter by another door as i was about to do so i heard the lock turned back by a cautious hand within then i swung the door open and boldly entered the room nobody was there except my husband but i was just in time to catch the sound of rustling skirts in the adjoining apartment and to see a door closed gently behind them i looked around although the sun was shining the blinds were down and the air was full of a rank odour of stale tobacco such as might have been brought back in peoples clothes from that shameless womans salon my husband who had clearly been drinking was looking at me with a halfsenseless grin his thin hair was a little disordered his prominent front teeth showed hideously i saw that he was trying to carry things off with an air this is an unexpected pleasure i think it must be the first time the very first time that i felt deadly cold i almost swooned i could scarcely breathe but i said is that all youve got to say to me all what else my dear i dont understand you understand quite well i answered and then looking towards the door of the adjoining apartment i said both of you understand my husband began to laugha drunken idiotic laugh oh you mean that perhaps you imagine that listen i said this is the end of everything between you and me the end why i thought that was long ago in fact i thought everything ended before it began i mean i knew i was faltering i mean that i can no longer keep up the farce of being your wife farce again he laughed i congratulate you my dear farce is exactly the word for it our relations have been a farce ever since the day we were married and if anything has gone wrong you have only yourself to blame for it whats a man to do whose wife is no company for anybody but the saints and angels his coarse ridicule cut me to the quick i was humiliated by the thought that after all in his own gross way my husband had something to say for himself knowing i was no match for him i wanted to crawl away without another word but my silence or the helpless expression of my face must have been more powerful than my speech for after a few seconds in which he went on saying in his drawling way that i had been no wife to him and if anything had happened i had brought it on myself he stopped and neither of us spoke for a moment then feeling that if i stayed any longer in that room i should faint i turned to go and he opened the door for me and bowed low perhaps in mockery as i passed out when i reached my own bedroom i was so weak that i almost dropped and so cold that my maid had to give me brandy and put hot bottles to my feet and then the tears came and i cried like a child fiftieth chapter i was far from well next morning and price wished to keep me in bed but i got up immediately when i heard that my husband was talking of returning to london our journey was quite uneventful we three sat together in the railway carriage and in the private cabin on the steamer with no other company than bimbo my husbands terrier and prue almas pekinese spaniel although he made no apology for his conduct of the day before my husband was quiet and conciliatory and being sober he looked almost afraid as if telling himself that he might have to meet my father soonthe one man in the world of whom he seemed to stand in fear alma looked equally frightened but she carried off her nervousness with a great show of affection saying she was sorry i was feeling badly that france and the south did not agree with me and that i should be ever so much better when i was way up north we put up at a wellknown hotel near trafalgar square the same that in our girlhood had been the subject of almas dreams of future bliss and i could not help observing that while my husband was selecting our rooms she made a rather ostentatious point of asking for an apartment on another floor it was late when we arrived so i went to bed immediately being also anxious to be alone that i might think out my course of action i was then firmly resolved that one way or other my life with my husband should come to an end that i would no longer be befouled by the mire he had been dragging me through that i should live a clean life and drink a pure draught and oh how my very soul seemed to thirst for it this was the mood in which i went to sleep but when i awoke in the morning almost before the dawn the strength of my resolution ebbed away i listened to the rumble of the rubberbound wheels of the carriages and motorcars that passed under my window and remembering that i had not a friend in london i felt small and helpless what could i do alone where could i turn for assistance instinctively i knew it would be of no use to appeal to my father for though it was possible that he might knock my husband down it was not conceivable that he would encourage me to separate from him in my loneliness and helplessness i felt like a shipwrecked sailor who having broken away from the foundering vessel that would have sucked him under is yet tossing on a raft with the threatening ocean on every side and looking vainly for a sail at last i thought of mr curphy my fathers advocate and decided to send a telegram to him asking for the name of some solicitor in london to whom i could apply for advice to carry out this intention i went down to the hall about nine oclock when people were passing into the breakfastroom and visitors were calling at the bureau and livened pageboys were shouting names in the corridors there was a little writingroom at one side of the hall and i sat there to write my telegram it ran please send name and address reliable solicitor london whom i can consult on important business i was holding the telegraphform in my hand and reading my message again and again to make sure that it would lead to no mischief when i began to think of martin conrad it seemed to me that some one had mentioned his name but i told myself that must have been a mistakethat being so helpless and so much in need of a friend at that moment my heart and not my ears had heard it nevertheless as i sat holding my telegraphform i became conscious of somebody who was moving about me it was a man for i could smell the sweet peaty odour of his harris tweeds at length with that thrill which only the human voice can bring to us when it is the voice of one from whom we have been long parted i heard somebody say from the other side of the desk mary is it you i looked up the blood rushed to my face and a dazzling mist floated before my eyes so that for a moment i could hardly see who was there but i knew who it wasit was martin himself he came down on me like a breeze from the mountain took me by both hands telegram and all and said my goodness this is stunning i answered as well as i could for the confusion that overwhelmed me im so glad so glad how well you are looking a little thin perhaps but such a colour im so glad so glad i repeated though i knew i was only blushing when did you arrive i told him and he said we came into port only yesterday and to think that you and i should come to the same hotel and meet on the very first morning its like a fate as our people in the island say but its stunning perfectly stunning a warm tide of joy was coursing through me and taking away my breath but i managed to say ive heard about your expedition you had great hardships that was nothing just a little pleasuretrip down to the eightysixth latitude and great successes that was nothing either the chief was jolly good and the boys were bricks im so glad so glad i said again for a kind of dumb joy had taken possession of me and i went on saying the same thing over and over again as people do when they are very happy for two full minutes i felt happier than i had ever been in my life before and then an icy chill came over me for i remembered that i had been married since i saw martin conrad last and i did not know how i was to break the news to him just then my husband and alma came down the lift and seeing me with a stranger as they crossed the hall to go into the breakfastroom they came up and spoke i had to introduce them and it was hard to do for it was necessary to reveal everything in a word i looked at martin conrad when i presented him to my husband and he did not move a muscle then i looked at my husband and under a very small bow his face grew dark i could not help seeing the difference between the two men as they stood togethermartin with his seablue eyes and his look of splendid health and my husband with his sallow cheeks and his appearance of wasted strengthand somehow from some unsearchable depths of my soul the contrast humbled me when i introduced alma she took martins hand and held it while she gazed searchingly into his eyes from under her eyebrows as she always did when she was being presented to a man but i saw that in this instance her glance fell with no more effect on its object than a lighted vesta on a running stream after the usual banal phrases my husband inquired if martin was staying in the house and then asked if he would dine with us some day certainly delighted with all the pleasure in the world said martin then said my husband with rather frigid politeness you will see more of your friend mary yes said alma in a way that meant much you will see more of your friend mary dont you worry about that maam you bet i will said martin looking straight into almas eyes and though she laughed as she passed into the breakfastroom with my husband i could see that for the first time in her life a mans face had frightened her then you knew i said when they were gone yes a friend of mine who met you abroad came down to see us into port and he dr osullivan thats the man isnt he a boy and my gracious the way he speaks of you but now now you must go to breakfast yourself and i must be off about my business dont go yet i said ill stay all day if you want me to but i promised to meet the lieutenant on the ship in half an hour and then you must go not yet sit down again five minutes will do no harm and by the way now that i look at you again im not so sure that you italy egypt theres enough sun down there but youre pale a little pale arent you i tried to make light of my pallor but martin looked uneasy and after a moment he asked how long are you staying in london i told him i did not know whereupon he said well im to be here a month making charts and tables and reports for the royal geographical society but if you want me for anything do you want me now noo no not now i answered well if you do want me for anythinganything at all mind just pass the word and the charts and the tables and the reports and the royal geographical society may go to the well somewhere i laughed and rose and told him he ought to go though at the bottom of my heart i was wishing him to stay and thinking how little and lonely i was while here was a big brave man who could protect me from every danger we walked together to the door and there i took his hand and held it feeling like a child that if i let him go he might be lost in the human ocean outside and i should see no more of him at last struggling hard with a lump that was gathering in my throat i said martin i have been so happy to see you ive never been so happy to see anybody in my life youll let me see you again wont you wont i bet your life i will he said and then as if seeing that my lip was trembling and my eyes were beginning to fill he broke into a cheerful little burst of our native tongue so as to give me a heise as we say in ellan and to make me laugh at the last moment look herekeep tomorrow for me will ye if them ones my husband and alma is afther axing ye to do anything else just tell them theres an ould shipmate ashore and hes wanting ye to go asploring see solong it had been like a dream a beautiful dream and as soon as i came to myself in the hall with the visitors calling at the bureau and the pageboys shouting in the corridors i found that my telegraphform crumpled and crushed was still in the palm of my left hand i tore it up and went in to breakfast fourth part i fall in love fiftyfirst chapter during our first day in london my husband had many visitors including mr eastcliff and mr vivian who had much to tell and arrange about i dare say a great many events had happened during our six months absence from england but the only thing i heard of was that mr eastcliff had married his dancinggirl that she had retired from the stage and that her public appearances were now confined to the boxseat of a fourinhand coach which he drove from london to brighton this expensive toy he proposed to bring round to the hotel the following day which chanced to be derby day when a party was to be made up for the races in the preparations for the party alma who as usual attracted universal admiration was of course included but i did not observe that any provision was made for me though that circumstance did not distress me in the least because i was waiting for martins message it came early next morning in the person of martin himself who running into our sittingroom like a breath of wind from the sea said his fellow officers were separating that day each going to his own home and their commander had invited me to lunch with them on their ship which was lying off tilbury it did not escape me that my husband looked relieved at this news and that almas face brightened as she said in her most succulent tones i should go if i were you mary the breeze on the river will do you a world of good dear i was nothing loath to take them at their word so i let them go off in their fourinhand coach a big and bustling party while with a fastbeating heart i made ready to spend the day with martin having as i thought so much and such serious things to say to him a steam launch from the ship was waiting for us at the westminster pier and from the moment i stepped into it i felt like another woman it was a radiant day in may when the climate of our muchmaligned london is the brightest and best and the biggest city in the world is also the most beautiful how i loved it that day the sunlight the moving river the soft air of early summer the passing panorama of buildings old and newwhat a joy it was to me i sat on a side seat dipping my hand over the gunwale into the cool water while martin with a rush of racy words was pointing out and naming everything st pauls was soon past with the sun glistening off the golden cross on its dome then london bridge then the tower with its traitors gate then the new thames bridge and then we were in the region of the barges and wharfs and warehouses with their colliers and coasting traders and with the scum of coal and refuse floating on the surface of the stream after that came uglier things still which we did not mind and then the great docks with the hammering of rivets and the cranking noise of the lightermens donkey engines loading and unloading the big steamers and sailing ships and then the broad reaches of the river where the great liners looking so high as we steamed under them lay at anchor to their rusty cablechains with their portholes gleaming in the sun like rows of eyes as martin said in the bodies of gigantic fish at last we came out in a fresh breadth of water with marshes on either side and a far view of the sea and there heaving a little to the flowing tide and with a seagull floating over her mizzen mast lay martins ship she was a wooden schooner once a dundee whaler called the mary but now rechristened the scotia and it would be silly to say how my eyes filled at sight of her just because she had taken martin down into the deep antarctic and brought him safely back again shes a beauty isnt she said martin isnt she i answered and in spite of all my troubles i felt entirely happy we had steamed down against a strong tide so we were half an hour late for luncheon and the officers had gone down to the saloon but it was worth being a little after time to see the way they all leapt up and received me like a queenmaking me feel as i never felt before the difference between the politeness of the fashionable idlers and the manners of the men who do things holloa they cried excuse us wont you we thought something had happened and perhaps you were not coming said the commander and then he put me to sit between himself and martin the strange thing was that i was at home in that company in a moment and if anybody imagines that i must have been embarrassed because i was the only member of my sex among so many men he does not know the heart of a woman they were such big bronzed manly fellows with the note of health and the sense of space about themlarge spaceas if they had come out of the heroic youth of the world that they set my blood atingling to look at them they were very nice to me too though i knew that i only stood for the womankind that each had got at home and was soon to go back to but none the less it was delightful to feel as if i were taking the first fruits of their love for them so it came to pass that within a few minutes i who had been called insipid and was supposed to have no conversation was chattering away softly and happily making remarks about the things around me and asking all sorts of questions of course i asked many foolish ones which made the men laugh very much but their laughter did not hurt me the least bit in the world because everybody laughed on that ship even the sailors who served the dishes and especially one grizzly old salt a cockney from wapping who for some unexplained reason was called treacle it made me happy to see how they all deferred to martin saying isnt that so doctor or dont you agree doctor and though it was strange and new to hear martin my mart of spitzbergen called doctor it was also very charming after luncheon was over and while coffee was being served the commander sent treacle to his cabin for a photograph of all hands which had been taken when they were at the foot of mount erebus and when it came i was called upon to identify one by one the shaggy tousled unkempt bearded middleaged men in the picture with the smart cleanshaven young officers who sat round me at the table naturally i made shockingly bad shots and the worst of them was when i associated treacle with the commander which made the latter rock in his seat and the former shake and shout so much that he spilled the coffee but what about the fourth man in the front row from the left asked the commander oh i should recognise him if i were blindfolded i answered by what by his eyes i said and after this truly irish and feminine answer the men shrieked with laughter shes got you there doc cried somebody she has sure said martin who had said very little down to that moment but was looking supremely happy at length the time came for the men to go and i went up on deck to see them off by the launch and then nobody was left on the ship except martin and myself with the cook the cabinboy and a few of the crew including treacle i knew that that was the right time to speak but i was too greedy of every moment of happiness to break in on it with the story of my troubles so when martin proposed to show me over the ship away i went with him to look at the theodolites and chronometers and sextants and sledges and skis and the aeronautic outfit and the captive balloon and the doublebarrelled guns and the place where they kept the petroleum and the gun cotton for blasting the ice and the hold forward for the mens provisions in hermeticallysealed tins and the hold aft for the dried fish and biscuit that were the food for the siberian dogs and the empty cage for the dogs themselves which had just been sent up to the zoo to be taken care of last of all he showed me his own cabin which interested me more than anything else being such a snug little place though i thought i should like to tidy it up a bit with his medical outfit his books his bed like a shelf and one pretty photograph of his mothers cottage with the roses growing over it that i almost felt as if i would not mind going to the antarctic myself if i could live in such comfortable quarters two hours passed in this way though they had flown like five minutes when the cabinboy came to say that tea was served in the saloon and then i skipped down to it as if the ship belonged to me and no sooner had i screwed myself into the commanders chair which was fixed to the floor at the head of the narrow table and found the teatray almost on my lap than a wave of memory from our childhood came sweeping back on me and i could not help giving way to the coquetry which lies hidden in every girls heart so as to find out how much martin had been thinking of me ill bet you anything i said i had caught martins style you cant remember where you and i first saw each other he couldit was in the little dimitywhite room in his mothers house with its sweetsmelling scraas under the sloping thatch well you dont remember what you were doing when we held our first conversation he didhe was standing on his hands with his feet against the wall and his inverted head close to the carpet but youve forgotten what happened next he hadnti had invited william rufus and himself into bed and they had sat up on either side of me poor william rufus i heard at last what had become of him he had died of distemper soon after i was sent to school his master had buried him in the backgarden and thinking i should be as sorry as he was for the loss of our comrade he had set up a stone with an inscription in our joint namesall of his own inditing it ranhe spelled it out to me here lice wilyam roofus wreckted by iz ole frens martin conrad and mary oneill two big blinding beads came into my eyes at that story but they were soon dashed away by martin who saw them coming and broke into the vernacular i broke into it too hardly knowing that the well of my native speech was still there until i began to tap it and we talked of tommy the mate and his starboard eye called each other bogh mulish said things were middling spoke of the threes trees and the tunder thunder and remembered that our big woman was a wicked devil and we wouldnt trust but shed burn in hell how we laughed we laughed at everything we laughed at nothing we laughed until we cried but i have often thought since that this was partly because we knew in our secret hearts that we were always hovering on the edge of tragic things martin never once mentioned my husband or my marriage or his letters to my father the bishop and father dan which had turned out so terribly true but we had our serious moments for all that and one of them was when we were bending over a large chart which he had spread out on the table to show me the course of the ship through the great unknown leaning shoulder to shoulder so close that our heads almost touched and i could see myself in his eyes as he turned to speak to me you were a little under the weather yesterday shipmatewhat was the cause of it he asked oh we we can talk of that another time cant we i answered and then we both laughed again goodness knows why unless it was because we felt we were on the verge of unlocking the doors of each others souls oh that joyful wonderful heartswelling day but no day ever passed so quickly at halfpast six martin said we must be going back or i should be late for dinner and a few minutes afterwards we were in the launch which had returned to fetch us i had had such a happy time on the ship that as we were steaming off i kissed my hand to her whereupon treacle who was standing at the top of the companion taking the compliment to himself returned the salute with affectionate interest which sent martin and me into our last wild shriek of laughter the return trip was just as delightful as the coming out had been everything looking different the other way round for the sunset was like a great celestial fire which had been lighted in the western sky and the big darkening city seemed to have turned its face to it martin talked all the way back about a scheme he had afoot for going down to the region of the pole again in order to set up some machinery that was to save life and otherwise serve humanity and while i sat close up to him looking into his flashing eyesthey were still as blue as the bluest seai said again and again how splendid how glorious what a great great thing it will be for the world wont it he said and his eyes sparkled like a boys thus the time passed without our being aware how it was going and we were back at westminster pier before i bethought me that of the sad and serious subject i had intended to speak about i had said nothing at all but all london seemed to have been taking holiday that day for as we drove in a taxi up parliament street streams of vehicles full of happy people were returning from the derby including costers donkey carts in which the girls were carrying huge boughs of may blossom and the boys were wearing the girls feathery hats and at the top of their lusty lungs they were waking the echoes of the stately avenue with the honeysuckle and the bee yew aw the enny oi em ther bee oid like ter sip ther enny from those red lips yew see as we came near our hotel we saw a rather showy fourinhand coach called the phoebus drawing up at the covered way in front of it and a lady on top in a motor veil waving her hand to us it was alma with my husbands and mr eastcliffs party back from the races and as soon as we met on the pavement she began to pay me high compliments on my improved appearance didnt i say the river air would do you good dearest she said and then she added something else which would have been very sweet if it had been meant sweetly about there being no surer way to make a girl beautiful than to make her happy there was some talk of our dining together that night but i excused myself and taking leave of martin who gave my hand a gentle pressure i ran upstairs without waiting for the lift being anxious to get to my own room that i might be alone and go over everything in my mind i did so ever so many times recalling all that had been said and done by the commander and his comrades and even by treacle but above all by martin and laughing softly to myself as i lived my day over again in a world of dream my maid came in once or twice with accounts of the gorgeous derby dinner that was going on downstairs but that did not matter to me in the least and as soon as i had swallowed a little food i went to bed earlypartly in order to get rid of price that i might go over everything again and yet again i must have done so far into the night and even when the wings of my memory were weary of their fluttering and i was dropping off at last i thought i heard martin calling shipmate and i said yes quite loud as if he had been with me still in that vague and beautiful shadowland which lies on the frontier of sleep how mysterious how magical how wonderful looking back i cannot but think it strange that even down to that moment i did not really know what was happening to me being only conscious of a great flood of joy i cannot but think it strange that though nature had been whispering to me for months i did not know what it had been saying i cannot but think it strange that though i had been looking for love so long without finding it i did not recognise it immediately when it had come to me of itself but when i awoke early in the morning very early while the sunrise was filling my bedroom with a rosy flush and the thought of martin was the first that was springing from the mists of sleep to my conscious mind and i was asking myself how it happened that i was feeling so glad while i had so many causes for grief then suddenlysuddenly as the sun streams through the cloudscud over the seai knew that what had long been predestined had happened that the wondrous new birth the great revelation the joyous mystery which comes to every happy woman in the world had come at last to me i was in love i was in love with martin conrad fiftysecond chapter my joy was shortlived no sooner had i become aware that i loved martin conrad than my conscience told me i had no right to do so i was married and to love another than my husband was sin it would be impossible to say with what terror this thought possessed me it took all the sunlight out of my sky which a moment before had seemed so bright it came on me like a storm of thunder and lightning sweeping my happiness into the abyss all my religion everything i had been taught about the sanctity of the sacrament of marriage seemed to rise up and accuse me it was not that i was conscious of any sin against my husband i was thinking only of my sin against god the first effect was to make me realise that it was no longer possible for me to speak to martin about my husband and alma to do this now that i knew i loved him would be deceitful mean almost treacherous the next effect was to make me see that all thought of a separation must now be given up how could i accuse my husband when i was myself in the same position if he loved another woman i loved another man in my distress and fright i saw only one means of escape either from the filthy burden to which i was bound or the consciousness of a sinful heart and that was to cure myself of my passion i determined to do so i determined to fight against my love for martin conrad to conquer it and to crush it my first attempt to do this was feeble enough it was an effort to keep myself out of the reach of temptation by refusing to see martin alone for three or four days i did my best to carry out this purpose making one poor excuse after another when as happened several times a day he came down to see methat i was just going out or had just come in or was tired or unwell it was tearing my heart out to deny myself so but i think i could have borne the pain if i had not realised that i was causing pain to him also my maid whose head was always running on martin would come hack to my room after delivering one of my lying excuses and say you should have seen his face when i told him you were ill it was just as if id driven a knife into him everybody seemed to be in a conspiracy to push me into martins armsalma above all others being a woman she read my secret and i could see from the first that she wished to justify her own conduct in relation to my husband by putting me into the same position with martin seen mr conrad today she would ask not today i would answer really and you such old friends and staying in the same hotel too when she saw that i was struggling hard she reminded my husband of his intention of asking martin to dinner and thereupon a night was fixed and a party invited martin came and i was only too happy to meet him in company though the pain and humiliation of the contrast between him and my husband and his friends and the difference of the atmosphere in which he lived from that to which i thought i was doomed for ever was almost more than i could bear i think they must have felt it themselves for though their usual conversation was of horses and dogs and racemeetings i noticed they were silent while martin in his rugged racy poetic way for all explorers are poets talked of the beauty of the great polar night the cloudless polar day the midnight calm and the moonlight on the glaciers which was the loveliest weirdest most desolate yet most entrancing light the world could show i wonder you dont think of going back to the antarctic if its so fascinating said alma i do bet your life i do said martin and then he told them what he had told me on the launch but more fully and even more rapturouslythe story of his great scheme for saving life and otherwise benefiting humanity for hundreds of years man prompted merely by the love of adventure the praise of achievement and the desire to know the globe he lived on had been shouldering his way to the hitherto inviolable regions of the poles but now the time had come to turn his knowledge to account how said my husband by putting himself into such a position said martin that he will be able to predict six eight ten days ahead the weather of a vast part of the navigable and habitable worldby establishing installations of wireless telegraphy as near as possible to the long icebarrier about the pole from which icefloes and icebergs and blizzards come so that we can say in ten minutes from the side of mount erebus to half the southern hemisphere look out its coming down and thus save millions of lives from shipwreck and hundreds of millions of money splendid by jove said mr eastcliff yes ripping by jingo said mr vivian a ridiculous dream muttered my husband but not until martin had gone and then alma seeing that i was all aglow said what a lovely man i wonder you dont see more of him mary my love hell be going to the ends of the earth soon and then youll be sorry you missed the chance her words hurt me like the sting of a wasp but i could not resist them and when some days later martin called to take me to the geographical society where his commander lieutenant was to give an account of their expedition i could not find it in my heart to refuse to go oh the difference of this world from that in which i had been living for the past six months all that was best in england seemed to be there the men who were doing the work of the world and the women who were their wives and partners the theatre was like the inside of a dish and i sat by martins side on the bottom row of seats just in front of the platform and face to face with the commander his lecture which was illustrated by many photographic lantern slides of the exploring party including the one that had been shown to me on the ship was very interesting but terribly pathetic and when he described the hardships they had gone through in a prolonged blizzard on a high plateau with food and fuel running low and no certainty that they would ever see home again i found myself feeling for martins hand to make sure that he was there towards the end the commander spoke very modestly of himself saying he could never have reached the th parallel if he had not had a crew of the finest comrades that ever sailed on a ship and though theyre all splendid fellows he said theres one i can specially mention without doing any wrong to the rest and thats the young doctor of our expeditionmartin conrad martin has a scheme of his own for going down to the antarctic again to make a great experiment in the interests of humanity and if and when he goes i say good luck to him and god bless him at these generous words there was much applause during which martin sat blushing like a big boy when he is introduced to the girl friends of his sister as for me i did not think any speech could have been so beautiful and i felt as if i could have cried for joy when i got back to the hotel i did cry but it was for another reason i was thinking of my father and wondering why he did not wait why why why i asked myself fiftythird chapter next day martin came rushing down to my sittingroom with a sheaf of letters in his hand saying that was jolly good of the boss but look what he has let me in for they were requests from various newspapers for portraits and interviews and particularly from one great london journal for a special article to contain an account of the nature and object of the proposed experiment what am i to do he said im all right for stringing gabble but i couldnt write anything to save my soul now you could im sure you could you could write like robinson crusoe why shouldnt you write the article and ill tell you what to put into it there was no resisting that and down at the bottom of my secret heart i was glad of the excuse to my conscience that i could not any longer run away from martin because i was necessary to help him so we sat together all day long and though it was like shooting the rapids to follow martins impetuous and imaginative speech i did my best to translate his disconnected outbursts into more connected words and when the article was written and read aloud to him he was delighted stunning didnt i say you could write like robinson crusoe in due course it was published and made a deep impression for wherever i went people were talking of it and though some said fudge and others like my husband said dreams the practical result was that the great newspaper started a public subscription with the object of providing funds for the realisation of martins scheme this brought him an immense correspondence so that every morning he came down with an armful of letters and piteous appeals to me to help him to reply to them i knew it would be dangerous to put myself in the way of so much temptation but the end of it was that day after day we sat together in my sittingroom answering the inquiries of the sceptical the congratulations of the convinced and the offers of assistance that came from people who wished to join in the expedition what a joy it was it was like the dawn of a new life to me but the highest happiness of all was to protect martin against himself to save him from his overgenerous impulsesin a word to mother him many of the letters he received were mere mendicancy he was not rich yet he could not resist a pitiful appeal especially if it came from a woman and it was as much as i could do to restrain him from ruining himself sometimes i would see him smuggle a letter into his side pocket with hm that will do later what is it i would ask oh nothing nothing he would answer hand it out sir i would say and then i would find a fierce delight in sending six freezing words of refusal to some impudent woman who was trying to play upon the tender side of my bighearted boy oh it was delightful my whole being seemed to be renewed if only the dear sweet hours could go on and on for ever sometimes my husband and alma would look in upon us at our work and then while the colour mounted to my eyes martin would say im fishing with another mans floats you see i see my husband would reply fixing his monocle and showing his front teeth in a painful grin just what dear mary loves though alma would say i do believe she would rather he sitting in this sunless room writing letters for mr conrad than wearing her coronet at a kings coronation just so maam there are women like that martin would answer looking hard at her and when she had gone laughing lightly but with the frightened look i had seen before he would say as if speaking to himself i hate that woman shes like a snake i feel as if i want to put my foot on it at length the climax came one day martin rushed downstairs almost beside himself in his boyish joy to say that all the money he needed had been subscribed and that in honour of the maturing of the scheme the proprietor of the newspaper was to give a public luncheon at one of the hotels and though no women were to be present at the feed a few ladies were to occupy seats in a gallery and i was to be one of them i had played with my temptation too long by this time to shrink from the dangerous exaltation which i knew the occasion would cause so when the day came i went to the hotel in a fever of pleasure and pride the luncheon was nearly over the speeches were about to begin and the ladies gallery was buzzing like a hive of bees when i took my seat in it two bright young american women sitting next to me were almost as excited as myself and looking down at the men through a pair of operaglasses they were asking each other which was martin whereupon my vanity not to speak of my sense of possession was so lifted up that i pointed him out to them and then borrowed their glasses to look at the chairman he seemed to me to have that light of imagination in his eyes which was always blazing in martins and when he began to speak i thought i caught the note of the same wild passion he said they were that day opening a new chapter in the wonderful book of mans story and though the dangers of the great deep might never be entirely overcome and the wind would continue to blow as it listed yet the perils of the one and the movements of the other were going to be known to and therefore checked by the human family after that and a beautiful tribute to martin as a man that everybody who had met him had come to love him and that there must be something in the great solitudes of the silent white world to make men simple and strong and great as the sea made them staunch and true he drank to the success of the expedition and called on martin to respond to the toast there was a great deal of cheering when martin rose but i was so nervous that i hardly heard it he was nervous too as i could plainly see for after a few words of thanks he began to fumble the sheets of a speech which he and i had prepared together trying to read it but losing his place and even dropping his papers beads of perspiration were starting from my forehead and i knew i was making noises in my throat when all at once martin threw his papers on the table and said in quite another voice shipmates i mean gentlemen i never could write a speech in my life and you see i cant read one but i know what i want to say and if youll take it as it comes here goes then in the simple style of a sailor not always even grammatical yet splendidly clear and bold and natural blundering along as he used to do when he was a boy at school and could not learn his lessons but with his blue eyes ablaze he told of his aims and his expectations and when he came to the end he said his lordship the chairman has said something about the good effects of the solitudes of nature on a mans character i can testify to that and i tell you thiswhatever you are when youre up here and have everything you want its wonderful strange the way youre asking the lord to stretch out his hand and help you when youre down there all alone and with an empty hungry stomach i dont know where you were last christmas day shipmates i mean gentlemen but i know where i was i was in the th latitude longitude four miles south and thirty west of mount darwin it was my own bit of an expedition that my commander has made too much of and i believe in my heart my mates had had enough of it when we got out of our sleeping bags that morning there was nothing in sight but miles and miles of rolling waves of snow seven thousand feet up on a windy plateau with glaciers full of crevasses shutting us off from the sea and not a living thing in sight as far as the eye could reach we were six in company and none of us were too good for paradise and onehe was an old wapping sailor we called him treaclehad the name of being a shocking old rip ashore but we remembered what day it was and we wanted to feel that we werent cut off entirely from the world of christian menour brothers and sisters who would be going to church at home so i dug out my little prayerbook that my mother put in my kit going away and we all stood round bareheaded in the snowa shaggy old lot i can tell you with chins that hadnt seen a razor for a monthand i read the prayers for the day the first and second vespers and laudate dominum and then the de profundis i think we felt better doing that but they say the comical and the tragical are always chasing each other which can get in first and it was so with us for just as i had got to an end with the solemn words out of the depths we cry unto thee o lord lord hear our cry in jumps old treacle in his thickest cockney and gawd bless our pore ole wives and sweethearts fur awye if martin said any more nobody heard it the men below were blowing their noses and the women in the gallery were crying openly well the man who can talk like that may open all my letters and telegrams said one of the young american women who was wiping her eyes without shame what i was doing and what i was looking like i did not know until the lady who had lent me the operaglasses leaned over to me and said excuse me but are you his wife may i ask oh no no i said nervously and eagerly but only god knows how the word went through and through me i had taken the wrong course and i knew it my pride my joy my happiness were all accusing me and when i went to bed that night i felt as if i had been a guilty woman fiftyfourth chapter i tried to take refuge in religion every day and all day i humbly besought the pardon of heaven for the sin of loving martin conrad the little religious duties which i had neglected since my marriage such as crossing myself at rising from the table i began to observe afresh and being reminded by martins story that i had promised my mother to say a de profundis for her occasionally i now said one every day i thought these exercises would bring me a certain relief but they did not i searched my missal for words that applied to my sinful state and every night on going to bed i prayed to god to take from me all unholy thoughts all earthly affections but what was the use of my prayers when in the first dream of the first sleep i was rushing into martins arms it was true that my love for martin was what the world would call a pure love it had no alloy of any kind but all the same i thought i was living in a condition of adulteryadultery of the heart early every morning i went to mass but the sense i used to have of returning from the divine sacrifice to the ordinary occupations of life with a new spirit and a clean heart i could feel no longer i went oftener to confession than i had done beforetwice a week to begin with then every other day then every day but the old joy the sense of purity and cleansing did not come i thought at first the fault might be with my confessor for though i knew i was in the presence of god the whispering voice behind the grating which used to thrill me with a feeling of the supernatural was that of a young man and i asked myself what a young priest could know by experience of the deep temptations of human love this was at the new cathedral at westminster so i changed to a little catholic church in a kind of mews in mayfair and there my confessor was an older man whose quivering voice seemed to search the very depths of my being he was deeply alarmed at my condition and counselled me to pray to god night and day to strengthen me against temptation the evil one is besieging your soul my child he said fight with him my daughter i tried to follow my ghostly fathers direction but how hard it was to do so martin had only to take my hand and look into my eyes and all my good resolutions were gone in a moment as a result of the fierce struggle between my heart and my soul my health began to fail me from necessity now and not from design i had to keep my room but even there my love for martin was always hanging like a threatening sword over my head my maid price was for ever singing his praises he was so bright so cheerful so strong so manly in fact he was perfect and any woman in the world might be forgiven if she fell in love with him her words were like music in my ears and sometimes i felt as if i wanted to throw my arms about her neck and kiss her but at other moments i reproved her telling her it was very wicked of her to think so much of the creature instead of fixing her mind on the creatora piece of counsel which made price who was all woman open her sparkling black eyes in bewilderment nearly every morning she brought me a bunch of flowers which martin had bought at covent garden all glittering from the sunshine and damp with the dew i loved to have them near me but finding they tempted me to think more tenderly of him who sent them i always contrived by one excuse or another to send them into the sittingroom that they might be out of my sight at all events after a while price remembering my former artifice began to believe that i was only pretending to be ill in order to draw martin on and then taking a certain liberty with me as with a child she reproved me if i were a lady i couldnt have the heart she said i really couldnt its all very well for us women but men dont understand such ways theyre only children men are when you come to know them i began to look upon poor price as a honeyed fiend sent by satan to seduce me and to say the truth she sometimes acted up to the character one day she said if i was tied to a man i didnt love and who didnt love me and somebody else worth ten of him was ready and waiting i would take the sweet with the bitter i would we women must follow our hearts and why shouldnt we then i scolded her dreadfully asking if she had forgotten that she was speaking to her mistress and a married woman but all the while i knew that it was myself not my maid i was angry with for she had only been giving voice to the thoughts that were secretly tormenting me i had been in bed about a week when price came with a letter in her hand and a look of triumph in her black eyes and said there my lady what did i tell you youve had it all your own way and now youve driven him off he has left the hotel and gone to live on his ship this frightened me terribly and partly for that reason i ordered her out of the room telling her she must leave me altogether if she ever took such liberties again but im sure she saw me as she was going through the door take up martins letter which i had thrown on to the table and press it to my lips the letter was of no consequence it was merely to tell me that he was going down to tilbury for a few days to take possession of his old ship in the name of his company but it said in a postscript if theres anything i can do for you pass me the word and ill come up like quicksticks what can i do what can i do i thought everything my heart desired my soul condemned as sinful and religion had done nothing to liberate me from the pains of my guilty passion all this time my husband and alma were busy with the gaieties of the london season which was then in full swing with the houses in mayfair being ablaze every night the blinds up and the windows open to cool the overheated rooms in which men and women could be seen dancing in closelypacked crowds one night after alma and my husband had gone to a reception in grosvenor square i had a sudden attack of heartstrain and had to be put to bed whereupon price who had realised that i was really ill told hobson my husbands valet to go after his master and bring him back immediately itll be all as one but ill go if you like said hobson in half an hour he came back with my husbands answer send for a doctor this put price into a fever of mingled anger and perplexity and not knowing what else to do she telegraphed to martin on his ship telling him that i was ill and asking what doctor she ought to call in to see me inside an hour a reply came not from tilbury but from portsmouth saying call doctor of brook street am coming up at once all this i heard for the first time when price with another triumphant look came into my bedroom flourishing martins telegram as something she had reason to be proud of you dont mean to say that you telegraphed to mr conrad i said why not said price when a lady is ill and her husband pays no attention to her and theres somebody else not far off who would give his two eyes to save her a pain in her little finger what is a woman to do i told her what she was not to do she was not to call the doctor under any circumstances and when martin came she was to make it plain to him that she had acted on her own responsibility towards midnight he arrived and price brought him into my room in a long ulster covered with dust i blushed and trembled at sight of him for his face betrayed the strain and anxiety he had gone through on my account and when he smiled at seeing that i was not as ill as he had thought i was ashamed to the bottom of my heart youll be sorry youve made such a long journey now that you see theres so little amiss with me i said sorry he said by the holy saints i would take a longer one every night of my life to see you looking so well at the end of it his blue eyes were shining like the sun from behind a cloud and the cruellest looks could not have hurt me more i tried to keep my face from expressing the emotion i desired to conceal and asked if he had caught a train easily from portsmouth seeing he had arrived so early no oh no there was no train up until eleven oclock he said then how did you get here so soon i asked and though he would not tell me at first i got it out of him at lasthe had hired a motorcar and travelled the ninety miles to london in two hours and a half that crushed me i could not speak i thought i should have choked lying there with martin at arms length of me i was afraid of myself and did not know what i might do next but at last with a great effort to control myself i took his hand and kissed it and then turned my face to the wall fiftyfifth chapter that was the beginning of the end and when next day towards noon my husband came with drowsy eyes to make a kind of ungracious apology saying he supposed the doctor had been sent for i said james i want you to take me home home you mean castle raa yes he hesitated and i began to plead with him earnestly and eagerly not to deny me what i asked take me home i beg i pray at length seeming to think i must be homesick he said well you know my views about that godforsaken place but the seasons nearly at an end and i dont mind going back on one conditionthat you raise no objection to my inviting a few friends to liven it up a bit it is your house i said you must do as you please in it very good thats settled he said getting up to go and i dare say it will do you no harm to be out of the way of all this churchgoing and confessing to priests who are always depressing people even when theyre not making mischief hardly had my husband left me when alma came into my sittingroom in the most affectionate and insincere of her moods my poor dear sweet child she said if id had the least idea you were feeling so badly i shouldnt have allowed jimmy to stay another minute at that tiresome reception but how good it was of mr conrad to come all that way to see you thats what i call being a friend now then came the real object of her visiti saw it coming i hear youre to have a houseparty at castle raa jimmys in his room writing piles of invitations he has asked me and i should love to go but of course i cannot do so without you wish it do you what could i say what i did say i scarcely know i only know that at the next minute almas arms were round my neck and she was saying you dear sweet unselfish little soul come let me kiss you it was done i had committed myself after all what right had i to raise myself on a moral pinnacle now and what did it matter anyway i was flying from the danger of my own infidelities not to save my husband from his price had been in the room during this interview and when it was over i was ashamed to look at her i cant understand you my lady i really cant she said next day i wrote a little letter to martin on the scotia telling him of our change of plans but forbidding him to trouble to come up to say goodbye yet half hoping he would disregard my injunction he did before i left my bedroom next morning i heard his voice in the sittingroom talking to price who with considerable emphasis was giving her views of alma when i joined him i thought his face which had grown to be very powerful looked hard and strained but his voice was as soft as ever while he said i was doing right in going home and that my native air must be good for me but whats this price tells methat madame is going with you i tried to make light of that but i broke down badly for his eyes were on me and i could see that he thought i was concealing the truth for some minutes he looked perplexed as if trying to understand how it came to pass that sickening as he believed i was at the sight of my husbands infidelities i was yet carrying the provocative cause of them away with me and then he said again i hate that woman shes like a snake i feel as if i want to put my foot on it i will too one of these daysbet your life i will it hurt me to hide anything from him but how could i tell him that it was not from alma i was flying but from himself when the day came for our departure i hoped i might get away without seeing martin again we did get out of the hotel and into the railway station yet no sooner was i seated in the carriage than in the cruel war that was going on within me i felt dreadfully down that he was not there to see me off but at the very last moment just as alma with her spaniel under her arm and my husband with his terrier on a strap were about to step into the train up came martin like a gust of mountain wind helloa he cried i shall be seeing you soon everythings settled about the expedition were to sail the first week in september so as to get the summer months in the antarctic but before that i must go over to the island to say goodbye to the old folks and ill see you at your fathers i suppose then alma gave my husband a significant glance and said but mary my love wouldnt it be better for mr conrad to come to castle raa you wont be able to go about very much remember your delicate condition you know of course why of course said my husband thats quite true and if mr conrad will do me the honour to accept my hospitality for a few days it was what i wanted above everything on earth and yet i said no no it wouldnt be fair martin will be too busy at the last moment but martin himself jumped in eagerly with certainly delighted greatest pleasure in the world and then while alma gave my husband a look of arch triumph to which he replied with a painful smile martin leaned over to me and whispered hush i want to i must though what he meant by that i never knew he continued to look at me with a tender expression until we said goodbye but after the carriage door had been closed and the engine had throbbed and the guard had whistled i thought i had never seen his strong face so stern as when the train moved from the platform fiftysixth chapter we reached ellan towards the close of the following day it was the height of the holiday season and the island seemed to be ablaze with lights two motorcars were waiting for us at the pier and in a little while we were driving out of blackwater through congested masses of people who were rambling aimlessly through the principal streets our way was across a stone bridge that crossed the harbour at its inner end and then up a hill that led to a headland overlooking the sea within half an hour we drew up at a pair of large gate posts which were much decayed and leaning heavily out of the perpendicular the chauffeur of the first of our ears got down to open the gate and after it had clashed to behind us we began to ascend a very steep drive that was bordered by tall elm trees it was now almost dark and the rooks which had not yet gone off to the mountains were making their evening clamour well my dear youre at home at last and much good may it do you said my husband i made no answer to this ungracious speech but alma was all excitement so this is castle raa what a fascinating old place she said and as we drove through the park she reached out of the car to catch a first glimpse of the broad terraces and winding ways to the sea which had been reflected in her memory since she was a child i felt no such anxiety never did a young bride approach the home of her husband with less curiosity but as our motorcar toiled up the drive i could not help seeing the neglected condition of the land with boughs of trees lying where they had fallen in the storms as well as broken gates half off their hinges and swinging to the wind the house itself when we came in sight of it was a large castellated building with many lesser turrets and one lofty octagonal tower covered entirely with ivy which being apparently unshorn for years hung in long trailers down the walls and gave the whole pile the appearance of a huge mosscovered rock of the sea planted on a promontory of the land as our car went thundering up to the great hall door nearly the whole of the servants and some of the tenant farmers under the direction of the tall sallow man who had been my husbands guardian in former days and was now his steward were waiting to welcome us as well as lady margaret anselm who was still reserved and haughty in her manner though pleasant enough with me my husband nodded to all shook hands with some presented alma to his aunt as one of marys old school friends a designation which as i could see had gone ahead of her and then we passed into the house i found the inside corresponded with the outside in its appearance of neglect and decay the big square hall having rusty and disjointed armour on its wainscotted walls and the mark of water on the floor which had come from a glass dome over the well of the stairs for it had rained while we were on the sea the drawingroom had faded curtains over the windows faded velvet on the square sofa and stiff chairs faded carpets faded samplers and faded embroidery on faded screens the diningroom the sedate original of my fathers rather garish copy was a panelled chamber hung round with rubicund portraits of the male oneills from the early ones of the family who had been lords of ellan down to the bad lord raa who had sworn at my grandmother on the high road i felt as if no woman could have made her home here for at least a hundred years and i thought the general atmosphere of the house was that of the days when spendthrift noblemen making the island a refuge from debt spent their days in gambling and their nights in drinking bumpers from bowls of whiskey punch to the nameless beauties they had left in town they were all gone all dead as the wood of the wormeaten wainscotting but the sound of their noisy merrymaking seemed to cling to the rafters still and as i went up to my rooms the broad oaken staircase seemed to be creaking under their drunken footsteps my own apartments to which lady margaret conducted me were on the southern side of the housea rather stuffy bedroom with walls covered by a kind of pleated chintz and a boudoir with a stone balcony that had a flight of steps going down to a terrace of the garden which overlooked a glen and had a far view of the sea on the opposite side of the landing outside which was not immediately off the great staircase though open to the view of it there was a similar suite of rooms which i thought might be my husbands but i was told they were kept for a guest being left alone i had taken off my outer things and was standing on my balcony listening to the dull hum of the water in the glen the rustle of the trees above it the surge of the sea on the rocks below the creaking of a rusty weathercock and the striking of a courtyard clock when i also heard the toot and throb of another motorcar and as soon as it came up i saw that it contained aunt bridget in the halfmoon bonnet and betsy beauty who was looking more than ever like a country belle when i went down to the drawingroom lady margaret was pouring out tea for them and at sight of me aunt bridget cried sakes alive here she is herself but how pale and pinched and thin said betsy beauty nonsense girl thats only natural said my aunt bridget with something like a wink and then she went on to say that she had just been telling her ladyship that if i felt lonely and a little helpless on first coming home betsy would be pleased to visit me before i could reply my husband came in followed shortly by alma who was presented as before as marys old schoolfellow and then while betsy talked to alma and my husband to his kinswoman aunt bridget in an undertone addressed herself to me youre that way arent you no goodness me girl your father will be disappointed just then a third motorcar came throbbing up to the house and betsy who was standing by the window cried its uncle daniel with mr curphy and nessy nessy of course said aunt bridget grumpily and then she told me in a confidential whisper that she was a muchinjured woman in regard to that ungrateful stepdaughter who was making her understand the words of scripture about the pang that was sharper than a serpents tooth as the newcomers entered i saw that nessy had developed an old maids idea of smartness and that my fathers lawyer was more than ever like an overfatted fish but my father himself except that his hair was whiter was the same man still with the same heavy step the same loud voice and the same tempestuous gaiety all here good glad to be home i guess strong and well and hearty i suppose yes sir yes im middling myself sir middling sir middling during these rugged salutations i saw that alma with the bad manners of a certain type of society woman looked on with a slightly impertinent air of amused superiority until she encountered my fathers masterful eyes which nobody in the world could withstand after a moment my father addressed himself to me well gel he said taking me by the shoulders as he did in rome you must have cut a dash in egypt i guess made the money fly didnt you no matter my gold was as good as anybody elses and i didnt grudge it youll clear me of that anyway then there was some general talk about our travels about affairs on the island mr curphy saying with a laugh and a glance in my direction that things were going so well with my father that if all his schemes matured he would have no need to wait for a descendant to become the uncrowned king of ellan and finally about martin conrad whose great exploits had become known even in his native country extraordinary extraordinary said my father i wouldnt have believed it of him i wouldnt really just a neighbour lad without a penny at him and now the worlds trusting him with fifty thousand pounds theyre telling me well many are called but few are chosen said mr curphy with another laugh after that and some broken conversation aunt bridget expressed a desire to see the house as the evening was closing in and they must soon be going back lady margaret thereupon took her followed by the rest of us over the principal rooms of the castle and it was interesting to see the awe with which she looked upon everythingher voice dropping to a whisper in the diningroom i remember as if the scene of carousing of the old roysterers had been a sort of sanctuary my father less impressed saw nothing but a house in bad repair and turning to my husband who had been obviously ill at ease he said go on like this much longer soninlaw and youll be charging twopence a head to look at your ruins guess i must send my architect over to see what he can do for you then taking me aside he made his loud voice as low as he could and said whats this your aunt bridget tells me nine months married and no sign yet tut tut that wont do gel that wont do i tried to tell him not to spend money on the castle if he intended to do so in expectation of an heir but my heart was in my mouth and what i really said i do not know i only know that my father looked at me for a moment as if perplexed and then burst into laughter i see i see he said its a doctor you want i must send conrad to put a sight on you itll be all right gel itll be all right your mother was like that when you were coming as we returned to the hall betsy beauty whispered that she was surprised mr eastcliff had married but she heard from madame that we were to have a houseparty soon and she hoped i would not forget her then aunt bridget who had been eyeing alma darkly asked me who and what she was and where she came from whereupon i trying to put the best face on things explained that she was the daughter of a rich new york banker after that aunt bridgets countenance cleared perceptibly and she said ah yes of course i thought she had a quality toss with her the two motorcars had been drawn up to the door and the two parties had taken their seats in them when my father looking about him said to my husband your garden is as rough as a thornbush soninlaw i must send tommy the mate to smarten it up a bit so long so long at the next moment they were gone and i was looking longingly after them god knows my fathers house had never been more than a stepmothers home to me but at that moment i yearned to return to it and felt like a child who was being left behind at school what had i gained by running away from london nothing at all already i knew i had brought my hopeless passion with me and now i was alone fiftyseventh chapter next day lady margaret came to my room to say goodbye telling me she had only stayed at castle raa to keep house and make ready for me and must now return to her own home which was in london i was sorry for my heart had warmed to her and when i stood at the door and saw her drive off with my husband to catch the afternoon steamer i felt i had lost both sympathy and protection almas feelings were less troubled and as we turned back into the house i could see that she was saying to herself thank goodness shes gone away a day or two later doctor conrad came according to my fathers instructions and i was glad to see his closecropped irongrey head coming up the stairs towards my room naturally our first conversation was about martin who had written to tell his parents of our meeting in london and to announce his intended visit it was all very exciting and now his mother was working morning and night at the old cottage to prepare for the arrival of her son such scrubbing and scouring such taking up of carpets and laying them down again as if the darling old thing were expecting a prince it ought to be sunny lodge indeed before shes done with it said the doctor im sure it will i said it always was and it always will be and how are we ourselves said the doctor a little below par eh any sickness no nausea no headache and a feeling of lassitude then no after other questions and tests the old doctor was looking puzzled when not finding it in my heart to keep him in the dark any longer i told him there was nothing amiss with my health but i was unhappy and had been so since the time of my marriage i see he said its your mind and not your body that is sick yes ill speak to father dan he said goodbye god bless you less than half an hour after he had gone alma came to me in her softest mode saying the doctor had said i was suffering from extreme nervous exhaustion and ought to be kept from worries and anxieties of every kind so if theres anything i can do while im here dearest such as looking after the house and the servants no no dont deny me it will be a pleasure i assure you so well say thats settled shall we you dear sweet darling creature i was too much out of heart to care what happened but inside two days i realised that alma had taken possession of the house and was ordering and controlling everything apparently this pleased such of the servants as had anything to gain by itthe housekeeper in particularfor alma was no skinflint and she was making my husbands money flow like water but it was less agreeable to my maid who said this is a nice place to be sure where the mistress takes no interest in anything and the guest walks over everybody shell walk over the mistress herself before longmark my word but she will it would be about a week after our arrival at castle raa that price came to my room to say that a priest was asking for me and he was such a strangelooking thing that she was puzzled to know if his face was that of a child a woman or a dear old man i knew in a moment it must be father dan so i went flying downstairs and found him in the hall wearing the same sack coat or so it seemed as when i was a child and made cupboards of its vertical pockets carrying the same funny little bag which he had taken to rome and used for his surplice at funerals and mopping his forehead and flicking his boots with a red print handkerchief for the day was hot and the roads were dusty he was as glad to see me as i to see him and when i asked if he would have tea he said yes for he had walked all the way from the presbytery after fasting the day before and when i asked if he would not stay overnight he said yes to that too if it would not be troublesome and inconvenient so i took his bag and gave it to a maid telling her to take it to the guests room on my landing and to bring tea to my boudoir immediately but hardly had i taken him upstairs and we had got seated in my private room when the maid knocked at the door to say that the housekeeper wished to speak with me and on going out and closing the door behind me i found her on the landing a prim little flinty person with quick eyes thin lips and an upward lift of her head sorry my lady but it wont be convenient for his reverence to stay in the house tonight she said why so i said because madame has ordered all the rooms to be got ready for the houseparty and this one pointing to the guests room opposite is prepared for mr and mrs eastcliff and we dont know how soon they may arrive i felt myself flushing up to the eyes at the womans impudence and it added to my anger that alma herself was standing at the head of the stairs looking on and listening so with a little spurt of injured pride i turned severely on the one while really speaking to the other and said be good enough to make this room ready for his reverence without one moments delay and please remember for the future that i am mistress in this house and your duty is to obey me and nobody else whatever as i said this and turned back to my boudoir i saw that almas deep eyes had a sullen look and i felt that she meant to square accounts with me some day but what she did was done at once for going downstairs as i afterwards heard from price she met my husband in the hall where womanlike she opened her battery upon him at his weakest spot saying oh i didnt know your wife was priestridden priestridden precisely and then followed an explanation of what had happened with astonishing embellishments which made my husband pale with fury meantime i was alone with father dan in my room and while i poured out his tea and served him with bread and butter he talked first about martin as everybody seemed to do when speaking to me saying he was always my goldenheaded boy and its a mighty proud man i am entirely to hear the good news of him more of the same kind there was all music to my ears and then father dan came to closer quarters saying doctor conrad had dropped a hint that i was not very happy tell your old priest everything my child and if there is anything he can do without waiting for more words i sank to my knees at his feet and poured out all my troublestelling him my marriage had been a failure that the sanctifying grace which he had foretold as the result of the sacrament of holy wedlock had not come to pass that not only did i not love my husband but my husband loved another woman who was living here with us in this very house father dan was dreadfully distressed more than once while i was speaking he crossed himself and said lord and his holy mother love us and when i came to an end he began to reproach himself for everything saying that he ought to have known that our lad meaning martin did not write those terrible letters without being certain they were true and that from the first day my husband came to our parish the sun had been darkened by his shadow but take care he said ive told nobody about the compact we made with your husbandnobody but our blessed lady herselfand you mustnt think of that as a way out of your marriage no nor of any other way no matter what which the world and the children of the world may talk about but i cant bear it i cant bear it i cried hush hush dont say that my daughter think of it as one of the misfortunes of life which we all have to suffer how many poor women have to bear the sickness and poverty not to speak of the drunkenness and death of their husbands do they think they have a right to run away from all thatto break the sacred vows of their marriage on account of it no my child no and neither must you some day it will all come right youll see it will and meantime by the memory of your motherthat blessed saint whom the lord has made one of his own then what can i do pray my child pray for strength to bear your trials and to resist all temptation say a rosary for the blessed virgin every morning before breaking your fast ill say a rosary too youll see yet this is only gods love for you and youll welcome his holy will while my dear father and friend was counselling me so i heard my husband speaking in his loud grating tones on the landing outside and before i could rise from my knees he had burst open the door and entered the room his face was deadly white and he was like a man out of his right mind mary he said looking down at me where i knelt with my hands crossed on my bosom when did i give you permission to introduce a priest into my house isnt it enough for a man to have a wife who is a catholic without having the church and its ministers shunted into his home without his permission i was so taken aback by this furious assault that at first i could not speak but father dan interposed to defend me saying with beautiful patience that his visit had been quite unexpected on my part and that i had asked him to stay overnight only because he was an old man and had had a long walk from his parish im much obliged to your reverence said my husband who was quivering with fury but my wife is perfectly capable of answering for herself without your assistance and as for your parish you would have done better to stay there instead of coming to meddle in this one arent you measuring me by your own yard sir said father dan and at that straight thrust my husband broke into ungovernable rage everybody knows what a popish priest is he said a meddlesome busybody who pokes his nose into other mens secrets but priest or no priest ill have no man coming to my house to make mischief between husband and wife are you sure said father dan that some woman isnt in your house already making mischief between wife and husband that thrust too went home my husband looked at me with flashing eyes and then said as i thought youve been sent for to help my wife to make a great todo of her imaginary grievances youre to stay in the house too and before long well have you setting up as master here and giving orders to my servants but not if i know it your reverence if you have any respect for your penitent youll please be good enough to leave my wife to my protection i saw that father dan had to gulp down his gathering anger but he only said say no more my lord no true priest ever comes between a man and the wife whom god has given him its his business to unite people not to put them apart as for this dear child i have loved her since she was an infant in arms and never so much as at the present speaking so i dont need to learn my duty from one who appears to care no more for her than for the rind of a lemon ill go sir said the old man drawing himself up like a wounded lion but its not to your protection i leave herits to that of gods blessed and holy love and will my husband had gone before the last words were spoken but i think they must have followed him as he went lunging down the stairs during this humiliating scene a hot flush of shame had come to my cheeks and i wanted to tell father dan not to let it grieve him but i could do nothing but stoop and kiss his hand meantime two or three of the servants had gathered on the landing at the sound of my husbands voice and among them was the flinty housekeeper holding the fathers little bag and she gave it back to him as he passed her then all being over the woman came into my room with an expression of victorious mischief in her eyes and said your ladyship had better have listened to them as knows you see i was too benumbed by that cruel stroke to reply but price said enough for both of us if them as knows she said dont get out of this room inside two seconds theyll get their ugly faces slapped i thought i had reached the end of my power of endurance and that night before going to bed while my maid was taking down my hair and i was thinking of martin and asking myself if i should put up with my husbands brutalities any longer i heard her say if i were a lady married to the wrong man id have the right one if i had to go through the divorce court for him now that was so exactly the thought that was running riot in my own tormented mind that i flew at her like a wild cat asking her how she dared to say anything so abominably wicked and telling her to take her notice there and then but hardly had she left the room when my heart was in my mouth again and i was trembling with fear lest she should take me at my word and then the last of my friends would be gone fiftyeighth chapter within the next few days the houseparty arrived there would be twenty of them at least not counting valets and ladies maids so that large as castle raa was the house was full they were about equally divided as to sex and belonged chiefly to my husbands class but they included mr eastcliffs beautiful wife camilla and almas mother who much to almas chagrin had insisted upon being invited my husband required me to receive them and i did so though i was only their nominal hostess and they knew it and treated me accordingly i should be ashamed to speak of the petty slights they put upon me how they consulted alma in my presence and otherwise wounded my pride as a woman by showing me that i had lost my own place in my husbands house i know there are people of the same class who are kind and considerate guileless and pure the true nobility of their countrywomen who are devoted to their homes and children and men who spend their wealth and strength for the public goodbut my husbands friends were not of that kind they were vain and proud selfish selfindulgent thoroughly insincere utterly illmannered shockingly illinformed astonishingly illeducated capable of speaking several languages but incapable of saying a sensible word in any of them living and flourishing in the world without religion without morality and if it is not a cant phrase to use without god what their conduct was when out shooting picnicking driving riding motoring and yachting for mr eastcliff had arrived in his yacht which was lying at anchor in the port below the glen i do not know for doctors orders were almas excuse for not asking me to accompany them but at night they played bridge their most innocent amusement gambled and drank banged the piano danced grizzly bears sang duets from the latest musical comedies and then ransacked the empty houses of their idle heads for other means of killing the one enemy of their existencetime sometimes they would give entertainments in honour of their dogs when all the animals of all the guests there seemed to be a whole kennel of them would be dressed up in coats of silk and satin with pockets and pockethandkerchiefs and then led downstairs to the drawingroom where almas wheezy spaniel and my husbands peevish terrier were supposed to receive them sometimes they would give freak dinners when the guests themselves would be dressed up the men in womens clothes the women in mens the male imitating the piping treble of the female voices and the female the overvowelled slang of the male until tiring of this foolishness they would end up by flinging the food at the pictures on the walls the usual pellet being softened bread and the favourite target the noses in the family portraits which hit and covered with a sprawling mess looked so ridiculous as to provoke screams of laughter the talk at table was generally of horses and dogs but sometimes it was of love courtship and marriage including conjugal fidelity which was a favourite subject of ridicule with both the women and the men thus my husband would begin by saying he often said it in my hearing that once upon a time men took their wives as they took their horses on trial for a year and a day and really with some women there was something to say for the old custom then mr vivian would remark that it was a jolly good idea by jove and if he ever married by the lord thats just what he would do then mr eastcliff would say that it was a ridiculous superstition that a woman should have her husband all to herself as if he were a kind of toothbrush which she could not share with anybody else and somebody would add that she might as reasonably want her dentist or her hairdresser to be kept for her own use only after that the ladies not to be left behind would join in the offhand rattle and one of them would give it as her opinion that a wife might have an incorrigibly unfaithful husband and yet be well off ugh said alma one night shrugging her shoulders think of a poor woman being tied for life to an entirely faithful husband i adore the kind of man who goes to the deuce for a womanparnell and gambetta and boulanger and that sort said a smart girl of three or fourandtwenty whereupon camilla eastcliff she was a russian cried thats vhy the corespondents in your divorce courts are so sharming theyre like the villayns in the playsalways so deelightfully vicked oh the sickening horror of it all whether it was really moral corruption or only affectation and pose it seemed equally shocking and though i bore as much of it as i could with a cheerful face i escaped as often as possible to the clean atmosphere of my own room but even there i was not always allowed to be alone for almas mother frequently followed me she was a plump little person in a profuse ornamentation of diamond rings and brooches with little or no education and a reputation for saying risky things in blundering french whereof the principal humour lay in the uncertainty as to whether she knew their meaning or not nevertheless she was the only goodhearted woman in the house and i really believe she thought she was doing a kind act in keeping me company but oh how i suffered from her long accounts of her former visits to my house whereby i learned without wishing to what her origin had been the daughter of a london postman what position she had held in castle raa in her winsome and reckless youth one that need not be defined how she had met her husband in new york and he had married her to save the reputation of his child and finally how the american ladies of society had refused to receive her and she had vowed to be revenged on them by marrying alma to the highest title in europe that could be bought with money i was just like your father my dear i never did no manner of harm to those people they used to think i thought myself better blood nor they were but i never thought no such thing i assure you only when they turned nasty after my marriage i made up my mindjust as your father didas alma should marry a bigger husband nor any of them even if he wasnt worth a dime and adnt a air on is ead but even these revelations about herself were less humiliating than her sympathy with me which implied that i was not fitted to be mistress of a noble househow could it be expected of mewhereas alma was just as if she had been born to it and therefore it was lucky for me that i had her there to show me how to do things almas gotten such ton such distangy manners she would say the effect of all this was to make me feel as i had never felt before the intolerable nature of the yoke i was living under when i looked into the future and saw nothing before me but years of this ignoble bondage i told myself that nothingno sacrament or contract no law of church or statecould make me endure it from day to day my maid came to me with insidious hints about alma and my husband i found myself listening to them i also found myself refreshing my memory of the hideous scene in paris and wondering why i had condoned the offence by staying an hour longer under my husbands protection and then there was always another force at work within memy own secret passion though sometimes i felt myself to be a wretched sinner and thought the burden i had to bear was heavens punishment for my guilty love at other times my whole soul rose in revolt and i cried out not merely for separation from my husband but for absolute sundering twice during the painful period of the houseparty i heard from martin his first letter was full of accounts of the farreaching work of his expeditionthe engaging of engineers electricians geologists and masons and the shipping of great stores of wireless apparatusfor his spirits seemed to be high and life was full of good things for him his second letter told me that everything was finished and he was to visit the island the next week going first to the old folks and coming to me for a few days immediately before setting sail that brought matters to a head and compelled me to take action it may have been weak of me but not wanting a repetition of the scene with father dan knowing well that martin would not bear it with the same patience i sent the second letter to alma asking if the arrangement would be agreeable she returned it with the endorsement scribbled in pencil across the face certainly anything to please you dear i submitted even to that perhaps i was a poorspirited thing wanting in proper pride but i had a feeling that it was not worth while to waste myself in little squibs of temper because an eruption was coming i was sure of that in which martin would be concerned on my side and then everybody and everything would be swept out of the path of my life for ever martin came in due course i read in the insular newspapers of his arrival on the islandhow the people had turned out in crowds to cheer him at the pier and how on reaching our own village the neighbours i knew the names of all of them had met him at the railway station and taken him to his mothers house and then lighted fires on the mountains for his welcome home it cut me to the hearts core to think of martin amid thrilling scenes like those while i was here among degrading scenes like these my love for martin was now like a wound and i resolved that come what might before he reached castle raa i should liberate myself from the thraldom of my false position father dans counsels had faded away by this time though i had prayed for strength to bear my burden there had been no result and one morning standing before the figure of the virgin in my bedroom i felt an impulse to blow out her lamp and never to light it again the end of it all was that i determined to see the bishop and my fathers advocate mr curphy and perhaps my father himself that i might know one way or the other where i was and what was to become of me but how to do this i could not see having a houseful of people who were nominally my guests fortuneillfortunefavoured me news came that my father had suddenly fallen ill of some ailment that puzzled the doctors and making this my reason and excuse i spoke to my husband asking if i might go home for two or three days why not he said in the tone of one who meant whos keeping you then in my weakness i spoke to alma who answered certainly my sweet girl we shall miss you dreadfully but its your duty and then youll see that dear mr what dye callum finally feeling myself a poor pitiful hypocrite i apologised for my going away to the guests also and they looked as if they might say well survive it perhaps the night before my departure my maid said perhaps your ladyship has forgotten that my times up but ill stay until you return if you want me to i asked her if she would like to stay with me altogether and she said indeed i should my lady any woman would like to stay with a good mistress if she is a little quick sometimes and if you dont want me to go to your fathers i may be of some use to you here before you come back again i saw that her mind was still running on divorce but i did not reprove her now for mine was turning in the same direction next morning most of the guests came to the hail door to see me off and they gave me a shower of indulgent smiles as the motorcar moved away fiftyninth chapter before going to my fathers house i went to the bishops bishops court is at the other side of the island and it was noon before i drove under its tall elm trees in which a vast concourse of crows seemed to be holding a sort of general congress the bishop was then at his luncheon and after luncheon so his liveried servant told me he usually took a siesta i have always thought it was unfortunate for my interview that it came between his food and his sleep the little receptionroom into which i was shown was luxuriously not to say gorgeously appointed with easy chairs and sofas a large portrait of the pope signed by the holy father himself and a number of pictures of great people of all kindsdukes marquises lords countsas well as photographs of fashionable ladies in low dress inscribed in several languages to my dear father in god the lord bishop of ellan the bishop came to me after a few minutes smiling and apparently at peace with all the world except that he wore a biretta he was dressedas in romein his long black soutane with its innumerable buttons his silverbuckled shoes his heavy gold chain and jewelled cross he welcomed me in his smooth and suave manner asking if he could offer me a little refreshment but too full of my mission to think of eating and drinking i plunged immediately into the object of my visit monsignor i said i am in great trouble it is about my marriage the smile was smitten away from the bishops face by this announcement i am sorry he said nothing serious i trust i told him it was very serious and straightway i began on the spiritual part of my grievancethat my husband did not love me that he loved another woman that the sacred sacrament of my marriage wait said the bishop and he rose to close the window for the clamour of the crows was deafeninga trial must have been going on in the trees returning to his seat he said dear lady you must understand that there is one offence and only one which in all christian countries and civilised communities is considered sufficient to constitute a real and tangible grievance have you any evidence of that i knew what he meant and i felt myself colouring to the roots of my hair but gulping down my shame i recounted the story of the scene in paris and gave a report of my maids charges and surmises humph said the bishop and i saw in a moment that he was going to belittle my proofs little or no evidence of your own apparently chiefly that of your maid and ladies maids are notorious mischiefmakers but its true i said my husband will not deny it he cannot so far as i am able to observe what passes in the world said the bishop men in such circumstances always can and do deny it i felt my hands growing moist under my gloves i thought the bishop was trying to be blind to what he did not wish to see but im right im sure im right i said well assuming you are right what is it dear lady that you wish me to do for some minutes i felt like a fool but i stammered out at length that i had come for his direction and to learn what relief the church could give me hm said the bishop and then crossing one leg over the other and fumbling the silver buckle of his shoe he said the church dear lady does indeed provide alleviation in cases of dire necessity it provides the relief of separationalways deploring the necessity and hoping for ultimate reconciliation but to sanction the separation of a wife from her husband becausepardon me i do not say this is your caseshe finds that he does not please her or becauseagain i do not say this is your caseshe fancies that somebody else pleases her better monsignor i said feeling hot and dizzy we need not discuss separation i am thinking of something much more serious never shall i forget the expression of the bishops face he looked aghast my good lady surely you are not thinking of divorce i think my head must have dropped as in silent assent for in a peremptory and condemnatory manner the bishop took me to task asking if i did not know that the catholic church did not recognise divorce under any circumstances and if i had forgotten what the holy father himself pointing up to the portrait had said to methat when i entered into the solemn contract of holy matrimony i was to do so in the full consciousness that it could not be broken but by death the love in which husband and wife contract to hold each other in holy wedlock is typified by the love of christ for his church and as the one can never be broken neither can the other but my husband does not love me i said neither do i love him and therefore the contract between us is broken already the bishop was very severe with me for this telling me that as a good child of the church i must never never say that again for though marriage was a contract it differed from all other contracts whatsoever when you married your husband dear lady you were bound to him not by your own act alone but by a mysterious power from which neither of you can ever free yourself the power that united you was god and whom god has joined together no man may put asunder i felt my head drooping the bishop was saying what i had always been taught though in the torment of my trouble and the fierce fire of my temptation i had forgotten it the civil law might divorce you continued the bishop i dont knowi can say nothing about that but it would have no right to do so because the law can have no right to undo what god himself has done oh it was cruel i felt as if the future of my life were darkening before meas if the iron bars of a prison were closing upon me and fetters were being fixed on every limb but even if the civil law could and would divorce you said the bishop think of the injury you would be inflicting on the church yours was what is called a mixed marriage and the church does not favour such marriages but it consented in this case and why because it hoped to bring back an erring family in a second generation to the fold of the faith yet what would you be doing without waiting for a second generation you would he defeating its purpose a cold chill seemed to creep to my heart at these words was it the lost opportunity the bishop was thinking of instead of the suffering woman with her bruised and bleeding soul i rose to go the bishop rose with me and began to counsel forgiveness even if you have suffered injury dear lady he saidi dont say you haventisnt it possible to forgive remember forgiveness is a divine virtue enjoined on us all and especially on a woman towards the man she has married only think how many women have to practise itevery day all the world over ah well i said and walked to the door the bishop walked with me urging me as a good daughter of the church to live at peace with my husband whatever his faults and when my children came as please god they would to instil into them the true faith with all a mothers art a mothers tenderness so that the object of my marriage might be fulfilled and a good catholic become the heir to castle raa so the church can do nothing for me i said nothing but pray dear lady said the bishop when i left him my heart was in fierce rebellion and since the church could do nothing i determined to see if the law could do anything so i ordered my chauffeur to drive to the house of my fathers advocate at holmtown the trial in the trees was over by this time and a dead crow tumbled from one of the tall elms as we passed out of the grounds holmtown is a little city on the face of our bleak west coast dominated by a broad stretch of sea and having the sound of the waves always rumbling over it mr curphys house faced the shore and his office was an upper room plainly furnished with a writing desk a deal table laden with law books and foolscap papers a stiff armchair covered with american leather three or four coloured engravings of judges in red and ermine a photograph of the lawyer himself in wig and gown an illuminated certificate of his membership of a legal society and a number of lacquered tin boxes each inscribed with the name of a clientthe largest box bearing the name of daniel oneill my fathers advocate received me with his usual bland smile gave me his clammy fat hand put me to sit in the armchair hoped my unexpected visit did not presage worse news from the big house and finally asked me what he could do i told my story over again omitting my sentimental grievances and coming quickly and with less delicacy to the grosser facts of my husbands infidelity the lawyer listened with his head aside his eyes looking out on the sea and his white fingers combing his long brown beard and before i had finished i could see that he too like the bishop had determined to see nothing you may be right he began i am right i answered but even if you are i am bound to tell you that adultery is not enough of itself as a ground for divorce not enough if you were a man it would be but being a woman you must establish cruelty as well cruelty isnt it all cruelty i asked in the human sense yes in the legal sense no answered the lawyer and then he proceeded to explain to me that in this country unlike some others before a woman could obtain a divorce from her husband she had to prove that he had not only been unfaithful to her but that he had used violence to her struck her in the face perhaps threatened her or endangered her life or health your husband hasnt done that has he no i thought not after all hes a gentleman therefore there is only one other ground on which you could establish a right to divorce namely desertion and your husband is not likely to run away in fact he couldnt it isnt to his interest weve seen to all thathere and smiling again the lawyer patted the top of the lacquered box that bore my fathers name i was dumbfounded even more degrading than the fetters whereby the church bound me to my marriage were the terms on which the law would release me but assuming that you could obtain a divorce said the lawyer what good would it do you you would have to relinquish your title i care nothing about my title i replied and your position i care nothing about that either come come said the lawyer patting my arm as if i had been an angry child on the verge of tears dont let a fit of pique or spleen break up a marriage that is so suitable from the points of property and position and then think of your good father why did he spend all that money in setting a ruined house on its legs again that he might carry on his name in a noble family and through your children and your childrens children then the law can do nothing for me i said feeling sick and sore sorry very sorry but under present conditions as far as i can yet see nothing said the lawyer goodday sir i said and before he could have known what i was doing i had leapt up left the room and was hurrying downstairs my heart was in still fiercer rebellion now i would go home i would appeal to my father hard as he had always been with me he was at least a man not a cold abstraction like the church and the law without bowels of compassion or sense of human suffering sixtieth chapter although i had sent word that i was coming home there was no one to welcome me when i arrived aunt bridget was out shopping and betsy beauty in the sulks with me as i afterwards heard for not asking her to the houseparty had run upstairs on hearing our horn so i went direct to my fathers room nessy macleod answered my knock but instead of opening the door to let me in she slid out like a cat and closed it behind her never had her ungainly figure her irregular features and her red head seemed to me so repugnant i saw at once that she was giving herself the airs of housekeeper and i noticed that she was wearing the bunch of keys which used to dangle from aunt bridgets waist when i was a child your father is ill she said i told her i knew that and it was one of the reasons i was there seriously ill she said standing with her back to the door the doctor says he is to be kept perfectly quiet indignant at the effrontery of the woman who was trying to keep me out of my fathers room i said let me pass please ssh he has a temperature and i dont choose that anybody shall disturb him today let me pass i repeated and i must have pitched my voice so high that my father heard it is that mary came from the other side of the door whereupon nessy beat a retreat and at the next moment i was in my fathers room his massive and powerful head was propped up with pillows in the campbed which was all he ever slept on and he was looking so ill and changed in so short a time that i was shocked as well as ashamed at the selfishness of having thought only of myself all the morning but he would listen to no sympathy protesting there was little or nothing the matter with him that conrad was croaking about cancer but the doctor was a fool what about yourself though he said great doings at the castle theyre telling me i thought this a favourable opportunity to speak about my own affairs so i began on my story again and though i found it harder to tell now that my listener was my father i struggled on and on as well as i could for the emotion that was choking me i thought he would pity me i expected him to be angry although he was showing me some of the contemptuous tenderness which he had always assumed towards my mother yet i was his daughter and i felt sure that he would want to leap out of bed that he might take my husband by the throat and shake him as a terrier shakes a rat but what happened was something quite different hardly had i begun when he burst out laughing god bless my soul he cried youre never going to lose your stomach over a thing like that i thought he had not understood me so i tried to speak plainer i see he said sweethearting some other woman is he well what of it he isnt the first husband who has done the like and i guess he wont be the last still i thought i had not made myself clear so i said my husband had been untrue to me that his infidelities under my own roof had degraded me in my own eyes and everybody elses that i could not bear to live such a life any longer and consequently consequently said my father you come to me to fight your battles for you no no fight them yourself gel no fatherinlaw ought to interfere it was a mans point of view i suppose but i was ready to cry with vexation and disappointment and though i conquered the impulse to do that i could go no farther whos the woman he asked i told him it was one of our houseparty then cut her out i guess youre clever enough to do it whoever she is youve got the looks too and i dont grudge you the money cut her outthats the best advice i can give you make your husband see youre the better woman of the two cut her out im saying and dont come whining here like a crybaby who runs to her grandmothers apronstrings at the first scratch she gets outside he had been reaching forward but he now fell back on his pillows saying i see how it is though women without children are always vapouring about their husbands as if married life ought to be a garden of eden one woman one man and all the rest of the balderdash i sot your aunt bridget on you before gel and ill have to do it again im thinking but go away now if im to get better i must have rest nessy calling ive a mort o things to do and most everything is on my shoulders nessy my medicine nessy nessy where in the world has that girl gone to im here daniel said nessy macleod coming back to the room and as i went out and passed down the corridor with a crushed and broken spirit and the tears ready to gush from my eyes i heard her coaxing him in her submissive and insincere tones while he blamed and scolded her half an hour afterwards aunt bridget came to me in my mothers room never in my life before had i been pleased to see her she at least would see my situation with a womans eyes but i was doomed to another disappointment goodness me girl she cried whats this your father tells me one of your own guests is it that one with the big eyes ill go bail well serve you right i say for bringing a woman like that into the house with your husbandso smart and such a quality toss with her if you were lonely coming home why didnt you ask your aunt or your first cousin there would have been no trouble with your husband thennot about me at all events but what are you thinking of doing getting a divorce i answered firmly for my heart was now aflame if i had held a revolver in aunt bridgets face she could not have looked more shocked mary oneill are you mad she cried divorce indeed no woman of our family has ever disgraced herself like that what will your father say whats to happen to betsy beauty what are people going to think about me i answered that i had not made my marriage and those who had made it must take the consequences what does that matter now hundreds of thousands of women have married the wrong man of their own free will but if every woman who has made a ruebargain were to try to get out of it your way where would the world be i wonder perhaps you think you could marry somebody else but you couldnt what decent man wants to marry a divorced woman even if she is the injured party then you think i ought to submittamely submit to such infidelities i asked sakes alive said aunt bridget what else can you do men are polygamous animals and we women have to make up our minds to it goodness knows i had to when the old colonel used to go hanging around those english barmaids at the cock and hen be a little blind girlthats what nine wives out of ten have to be every day and every night and all the world over will that make my husband any better i asked i dont say it will said aunt bridget it will make you better though what the eye doesnt see the heart doesnt grieve for thats something isnt it when i went to bed that night my whole soul was in revolt the church the law society parental power all the conventions and respectabilities seemed to be in a conspiracy to condone my husbands offence and to make me his scapegoat doomed to a life of hypocrisy and therefore immorality and shame i would die rather than endure it yes i would die that very day rather than return to my husbands house and go through the same ordeal again but next morning when i thought of martin as i always did on first awakening i told myself that i would live and be a clean woman in my own eyes whatever the world might think of me martin was now my only refuge so i would tell him everything it would be hard to do that but no matter i would crush down my modesty and tell him everything and then whatever he told me to do i should do it i knew quite well what my resolution meant what it implied and involved but still i thought whatever he tells me to do i will do it i remembered what the countess in rome had said about a life of complete emancipation as an escape from unhappy marriage and even yet i thought whatever he tells me to do i will do it after coming to that conclusion i felt more at ease and got up to dress it was a beautiful morning and i looked down into the orchard where the apples were reddening under the sunshine and the gooseberries were ripening under their hanging boughs when in the quiet summer air i heard a footstep approaching an elderly woman in an oldfashioned quakerish bonnet was coming up the drive she carried a little bunch of red and white roses and her face which was very sweet and simple wore the pathetic expression of a child in trouble it was martins mother she was coming to see me and at the first sight of her something told me that my brave resolution was about to be broken and i was going to be shaken to the depths of my being i heard the bell of the front door ringing after a moment a maid came up and said mrs doctor conrad has called to see your ladyship bring her here i answered my heart was in my mouth already sixtyfirst chapter when martins mother came into the room she looked nervous and almost frightened as if she had charged herself with a mission which she was afraid to fulfil but i put her to sit in my mothers easy chair and sat on the arm of it myself and then she seemed calmer and more comfortable in spite of the silver threads in the smooth hair under her poke bonnet her dear face was still the face of a child and never before had it seemed to me so helpless and childlike after a moment we began to talk of martin i said it must be a great happiness to her to have him back after his long and perilous voyage and she answered that it was but his visit was so short only four days altogether although the doctor and she had looked forward to it so long thats not martins fault though she said hes such a good son i really really think no mother ever had such a good son but when children grow up they cant always be thinking of the old people can they thats why i say to the doctor doctor i say perhaps we were the same ourselves when we were young and first loved each other already i thought i saw vaguely what the dear soul had come to tell me but i only said i supposed martin was still with them she told me no he had gone to king georges that was his old school and being prizegiving day the masters had asked him to the sports and to the dinner that was to be given that night before the breakingup for the holidays the boys will give him a cheer i know they will she said i said of course he would be back tomorrow but again she said no he had gone for good and they had said goodbye to him when he left king georges he was to go on to castle raa didnt i know that he had said he would telegraph to me but being from home perhaps i had not yet received his message oh yes he was going on to the castle tomorrow night and would stay there until it was time to leave the island im so glad i said hardly knowing with what fervour i had said it until i saw the same expression of fear come back to the sweet old face martin will be glad too she said and thats why ive come to see you that you wont be cross with me will you but martin is so fond of you he always has been fond of you ever since he was a boy but this time yes this time i thought i really really thought he was too fond of you i had to hold my breast to keep down the cry of joy that was rising to my throat but the dear soul saw nothing not that he said sonot to say said so but its a mother to see things isnt it and he was talking and talking so much about mary oneill that i was frightenedreally frightened frightened hes so tenderhearted you see and then you youre such a wonderful woman grown tommy the mate says there hasnt been the like of you on this island since they laid your mother under the sod its truth enough toogospel truth and martinmartin says there isnt your equal no not in london itself neither so so she said trembling and stammering i was thinking i was thinking he was only flesh and blood like the rest of us poor boy and if he got to be too fond of you now that youre married and have a husband you know the trembling and stammering stopped her for a moment theyre saying you are not very happy in your marriage neither times and times ive heard people saying he isnt kind to you and they married you against your will so i was telling myself if thats so and martin and you came together now and you encouraged him and let him go on and anything came of it any trouble or disgrace or the like of that it would be such a terrible cruel shocking thing for the boy just when everybodys talking about him and speaking so well too it was out at last her poor brokenhearted story was told being a married woman unhappily married too i was a danger to her beloved son and she had come to me in her sweet unmindful motherly selfishness to ask me to protect him against myself whiles and whiles ive been thinking of it she said what will i do ive been asking myself and sometimes ive been thinking i would speak to martin i didnt dare do it though but when i heard last night that you had come home to see your father i said doctor ill go over and speak to herself youll never do that christian ann said the doctor yes i will i said ill speak to the young mistress herself she may be a great lady now but havent i nursed her on my knee shell never do anything to harm my boy if i ask her not to no indeed she wont not mary oneill ill never believe it of her never in this world the sweet old face was beaming but it was wet with tears too and while trying to get out her pockethandkerchief she was fumbling with the flowers which she was still holding and passing from hand to hand let me take the roses i said as well as i could for i could scarcely say anything i brought them for you she said and then she laughed a little confusedly at her own forgetfulness to be sure theyre nothing to the greenhouse ones youll have at the castle but i thought youd like them for all that theyre from the tree outside the window of your own little room we call it your room stillthe one you slept in when you came in your little velvet frock and pinnie singing carols to my door mary oneills room martin called it then and its been the same to us ever since this touched me so deeply that before i knew what i was doing i was putting my arm about her waist and asking her to tell me what she wished me to do and i would do it will you though she said and then one by one she propounded the artless little schemes she had concocted to cure martin of what she conceived to be his love for me her first thought was that i might make excuse of my fathers illness to remain where i was until the time came for martin to leave the island but she repented of this almost immediately remembering that martin was set on seeing me i must see her he had said and if he did not see me he would be so downhearted then she thought i might praise up my husband to martin saying what a fine man he was to be sure and how good he had been to me and what a proud woman i was to be married to him but she was ashamed of that almost as soon as she had said it for it might not be true and martin might see i was pretending finally she suggested that in order to create a coolness between martin and myself i might try not to be so nice to him speaking short to him sometimes and even harsh and angry but no that would be too cruel especially from me after all these years just when he was going so far away too and only the lord and the blessed saints knew what was to become of him it was martin martin always martin still in her sweet motherly selfishness she could think of nobody else fondly as she loved me it never occurred to her for a moment that if i did what she wished and sent martin away from me i too would suffer but a harder heart than mine would have melted at the sight of her perplexity and distress and when with a helpless look she said i dont know what you are to doi really really dont i comforted her needing comfort so much myself and told her i would find a way of my own to do what she desired will you though she said indeed i will and you wont send him away sorehearted either indeed i wont i knew you would say that may the lord and his holy mother bless you she was weeping tender copious blessed tears by this time but there were smiles behind them not that theres another woman in the world i would rather give him to if things were as they used to be but theyre different now are they not she asked yes theyre different now i answered but are you sure youre not cross with me for coming oh no no i said and it was all i could say for my voice was failing me she gave a sigh of inexpressible relief and then rose to go i must be going now the doctor is digging in the garden and he hasnt had his breakfast but i put the pot on the slouree to boil and it will be ready for the porridge she got as far as the door and then turned and said i wish i had a photo of youa right one just as you are at this very minute id hang it in your own room and times and times in the day id be running upstairs to look at it but its all as one ive got a photo of you here touching her breast and sometimes i can see it as plain as plain i could not speak after that but i kissed her as she was going out and she said thats nice now goodbye my chree youll not be going home until tomorrow its like so perhaps ill be putting another sight on you goodbye i went to the window to watch her as she walked down the drive she was wiping her eyes but her head was up and i thought her step was light and i was sure her face was shining god bless her the dear sweet woman such women as she is and my mother wasso humble and loving so guileless and pure never saying an unkind word or thinking an unkind thoughtare the flowers of the world that make the earth smell sweet when she was gone and i remembered the promise i had made to her i asked myself what was to become of me if i could neither divorce my husband under any circumstances without breaking a sacrament of the church nor love martin and be loved by him without breaking the heart of his mother where was i i intended to go home the following morning i was to meet martin the following night what was i to say what was i to do all day long these questions haunted me and i could find no answers but towards evening i took my troubles where i had often taken themto father dan sixtysecond chapter the door of the presbytery was opened by father dans irish housekeeper a good old soul whose attitude to her master was that of a moithered mother to a wilful child all the way up the narrow staircase to his room she grumbled about his reverence unless he was sickening for the scarlet fever she didnt know in her seven sinses what was amatter with him these days he was as white as a ghost and as thin as a shadder and no wonder neither for he didnt eat enough to keep body and soul together yesterday itself she had cooked him a chicken as good as i could get at the big house done to a turn too with a nice bit of irish bacon on top and a bowl of praties biled in their jackets and a basin of beautiful new buttermilk but no never a taste nor a sup did he take of it its just timpting providence his reverence is and itll be glory to god if youll tell him so whats that youre saying about his reverence mrs cassidy cried father dan from the upper landing im saying youre destroying yourself with your fasting and praying and your midnight calls at mountain cabins and never a haporth of anything in your stomach to do it on whisht then mrs cassidy its taytime isnt it so just step back to your kitchen and put on your kittle and bring up two of your best china cups and saucers and a nice piece of buttered toast not forgetting a thimbleful of something neat and then its the mighty proud woman yell be entoirely to be waiting for once on the first lady in the island come in my daughter come in he was laughing as he let loose his irish tongue but i could see that his housekeeper had not been wrong and that he looked worn and troubled as soon as he had taken me into his cosy study and put me to sit in the big chair before the peat and wood fire i would have begun on my errand but not a word would he hear until the tea had come up and i had taken a cup of it then stirring the peats for light as well as warmth for the room was dark with its lining of books and the evening was closing in he said now what is it something seriousi can see that much it is serious father dan tell me then he said and as well as i could i told him my story i told him that since i had seen him last during that violent scene at castle raa my relations with my husband had become still more painful i told him that seeing i could not endure any longer the degradation of the life i was living i had thought about divorce i told him that going first to the bishop and afterwards to my fathers advocate i had learned that neither the church nor the law for their different reasons could grant me the relief i required and finally in a faint voice almost afraid to hear myself speak it i told him my solemn and sacred secretthat whatever happened i could not continue to live where i was now living because i loved somebody else than my husband while i was speaking father dan was shuffling his feet and plucking at his shabby cassock and as soon as i had finished he flashed out on me with an anger i had never seen in his face or heard in his voice before i know who it is he said its martin conrad i was so startled by this that i was beginning to ask how he knew when he cried never mind how i know perhaps you think an old priest has no eyes for anything but his breviary eh its young martin isnt it yes the wretch the rascal the scoundrel if he ever dares to come to this house again ill slam the door in his face i knew he loved martin almost as much as i did so i paid no heed to the names he was calling him but i tried to say that i alone had been to blame and that martin had done nothing dont tell me he has done nothing cried father dan i know what he has done he has told you he loves you hasnt he no he has been colloguing with you then and getting you to say things never pitying and sympathising with you anyway in your relations with your husband not for one moment he had better not big man as he is in england now ill warm his jacket for him if he comes here making mischief with a child of mine but thank the lord and the holy saints hes going away soon so youll see no more of him but he is coming to castle raa i said and i am to see him tomorrow night that too the young scoundrel i explained that my husband had invited him being prompted to do so by the other woman worse and worse cried father dan dont you see that theyre laying a trap for you and like two young fools youre walking directly into it but no matter you mustnt go i told him that i should be compelled to do so for martin was coming on my account only and i could neither tell him the truth nor make an excuse that would not be a falsehood well well perhaps youre right there its not the best way to meet temptation to be always running away from it thats irish but its true enough though you must conquer this temptation my child you must fight it and overcome it but ive tried and tried and i cannot i said and then i told him the story of my strugglehow love had been no happiness to me but only a cruel warfare how i had suffered and prayed and gone to mass and confession yet all to no purpose for my affection for martin was like a blazing fire which nothing could put out father dans hands and lips were trembling while i spoke and i could see that he was shuddering with pity for me so i went on to say that if god had put this pure and holy love into my heart could it be wrong stop a minute cried father dan who says god put it there and who informed you it was pure and holy let us see where we are come now you say the bishop told you that you could never be divorced under any circumstances yes yet you wish to leave your husband how can i help it the life i have been living is too horrible never mind that now you wish to leave your husband dont you i i must and you want to go to this this young in short you want to go to martin conrad thats the plain truth isnt it dont deny it very well let us call things by their proper names what is the fact you are asking meme your spiritual fatherto allow you to live a life of open adultery thats what it comes to you know it is and god and his holy mother have mercy on your soul i was so startled and shocked by his fierce assault and by the cruel climax it had come to that i flung up my hands to my face and kept them there for i felt as if my brain had been stunned and my heart was bursting how long i sat like this with my hidden face to the fire i do not know but after a long silence in which i heard nothing but my own heaving breath i became aware that father dan had drawn one of my hands down to his knee and was smoothing it with his own dont be angry with your old priest for telling you the truth he said its hard to bear i know its hard but its as hard for him as for you my child thinkonly think what he is trying to save you from if you do what you wish to do you will put yourself out of communion if you put yourself out of communion you will cease to be a catholic what will become of you then my daughter what will be left to replace the consolations of the churchin sorrow in suffering in the hour of death have you never thought of that i never had it was thrilling through and through me you say you cannot live any longer with your husband because he has broken the vow he made to you at your marriage but think how many many thousands of poor women all the world over are doing it every dayliving with adulterous husbands for the sake of their homes and children and not for the sake of their homes and children only but for the sake of their souls and their religion blessed blessed martyrs though we know nothing about them holding society and the church and the human family together i was trembling all over i felt as if father dan were trying to take away from me the only sweet and precious thing in my life that was left then you think you cannot live without the one you love because all your heart is full of him but think of the holy women the holy saints who have gone through the same temptationfighting against it with all the strength of their souls until the very wounds of our blessed lord have been marked on their bodies he was creeping closer to my side his voice was quivering at my ear i was struggling hard and still trembling all over hold fast by the church my child it is your only refuge remember that god made your marriage and you cannot break it without forsaking your faith can anything be good that is bought at such a price nothing in this world when you meet tomorrow nightyou two childrentell him that tell him i told you to say so i love you both dont break your old priests heart hes in trouble enough for you already dont let him think that he must lose you altogether and then remember your mother toothat saint in heaven who suffered so long and was patient everything will depend upon you my child in matters of this kind the woman is the stronger vessel be strong for him also renounce your guilty love my daughter but i cannot i cannot i said i love him and i cannot give him up let us ask god to help you said father dan and still holding my hand he drew me down to my knees and knelt beside me the room was dark by this time and only the sullen glow from the peat fire was on our faces then in a low voice so low that it was like his throbbing whisper before the altar when he raised the sacred host father dan prayed for me calling me his dear child whom god had committed to his care that i might keep my marriage vow and be saved from the temptation to break it his beautiful prayer or his throbbing voice or both together had a great effect upon me and when i rose to my feet i felt stronger although martin was as dear to me as ever i thought i saw my way at last if he loved me as i loved him i had to be brave for both of us i had to oppose to the carnal instinct of love the spiritual impulse of renunciation yes yes that was what i had to do father dan saw me to the door give my love to my boy he said and dont forget what i told you to tell him ill tell him i replied for though i knew my heart was bleeding i felt calm and more courageous it was milking time and the cows were lowing in the byre when i crossed the fields and the farmyard on my way back to my fathers house early next morning i left it for castle raa sixtythird chapter although it was midday before i reached the castle the gate to the park had not been opened the drive was deserted and even the great door to the house itself was closed and when in answer to my ringing one of the maids came after a certain delay wearing neither apron nor cap i found the hall empty and no sign of life in the house except a shrill chorus of laughter which came from the servants quarters whats the meaning of this i asked but before the girl could reply price who had come down to take my wraps said ill tell your ladyship presently as we were going upstairs she told me that the entire houseparty had that morning gone off on a cruise in mr eastcliffs yacht that they would be away several days and that madame had left a letter for me which was supposed to explain everything i found it on the mantelpiece in my boudoir under an open telegram which had been stuck into the edge of the bevelled glass the telegram which was addressed to me was from martin expect to arrive tomorrow evening staying until wednesday afternoon if not convenient wire principals house king georges college tomorrow that means today said price the telegram came yesterday madame opened it and she told me to say let me read her letter first i said the letter ran as follows my dearest mary you will be astonished to find the house empty and all your racketty guests gone let me explain and if you are angry about what has happened you must lay all the blame on me well you see my dear it was arranged nearly a month ago that before we left your delightful house we should make a little cruise round your charming island but we had not expected that this would come off so soon when suddenly and unexpectedly that silly mr eastcliff who has no more brains than a spring chicken remembered that he had promised to visit a friend who has taken a shoot in skye resultwe had to make the cruise immediately or not at all and yet behold our hostess was away on an urgent call of sickness and what in the world were we to do without her everybody was in a quandarythat wise mr vivian saying it would be jolly bad form by jove to go without you while mr eastcliffs deelightfully vicked little camilla declared it would be vilaynous and your husband vowed that his margaret mary could not possibly be left behind it was then that a certain friend of yours took the liberty of remembering that you did not like the sea and that even if you had been here and had consented to go with us it would have been only out of the sweetness of your heart which ive always known to be the tenderest and most unselfish in the world this seemed to satisfy the whole house and everybody was at ease when lo down on us like a thunderbolt came the telegram from mr conrad thinking it might require to be repeated i took the liberty of opening it and then we were in a plight i assure you what on earth was he to think of our leaving the house when he was on the point of arriving and above all how were we to support the disappointment of missing himsome of us the women especially and myself in particular being just crazy to see him again this nearly broke down our plans altogether but once more i came to the rescue by remembering that mr conrad was not coming to see us but you and that the very kindest thing we could do for a serious person of his kind would be to take our racketty presence out of the way that contented everybody except my mother whowould you believe ithad gotten some prudish notions into her head about the impropriety of leaving you alone and declared her intention of staying behind to keep you in countenance we soon laughed her out of that though and now to relieve you of her company we are carrying her away with uswhich will be lots of fun for shes as fond of water as a cat and will fancy she is seasick all the time goodbye dearest were just off i envy you you happy happy girl i am sure you will have such a good time what a man as natural as nature i see by the insular paper that your islanders adore him hope you found your father better another wonderful man such an original type too goodbye my dearest dear alma ps have missed you so much darling castle raa wasnt the same place without youi assure you it wasnt while i was turning this letter over in my hand wondering what the beautiful fiend had meant by it my maid who was standing by was visibly burning with a desire to know its contents and give me the benefit of her own interpretation i told her in general what alma had said and she burst into little screams of indignation well the huzzy the wicked huzzy thats all she is my lady begging your pardon and theres no other name for her arranged a month ago indeed it was never thought of until last night after mr conrads telegram came then what does it mean i can tell your ladyship what it means if youll promise not to fly out at me again it means that madame wants to stand in your shoes and wouldnt mind going through the divorce court to do so and seeing that you cant be tempted to divorce your husband because you are a catholic she thinks your husband who isnt might be tempted to divorce you so shes setting a trap for you and she expects you to fall into it while shes away and if you do impossible oh trust me your ladyship i havent been keeping my ears closed while your ladyship has been away and if that chatterbox of a maid of hers hadnt been such a fool i suppose she would have been left behind to watch but theres somebody else in the house who thinks she has a grievance against you and if listening at keyholes will do anything hush price stopped suddenly with her finger to her lip and then going on tiptoe to the door she opened it with a jerk when the little housekeeper was to be seen rising to an upright position while pretending that she had slipped i only came to ask if her ladyship had lunched she said i answered that i had not and then told her so as to give her no further excuse for hanging about me that in future she was to take her orders from pricean announcement which caused my maid to stand several inches taller in her shoes and sent the housekeeper hopping downstairs with her beak in the air like an injured cockatoo all the afternoon i was in a state of the utmost agitation sometimes wondering what martin would think of the bad manners of my husband who after inviting him had gone away just as he was about to arrive sometimes asking myself with a quiver of shame if he would imagine that this was a scheme of my own contriving but oftenest remembering my resolution of renunciation and thinking of the much fiercer fight that was before me now that i had to receive and part with him alone more than once i had half a mind to telegraph to martin putting him off and though i told myself that to do so would not be renunciation but merely flight from temptation i always knew at the bottom of my heart that i really wanted him to come nevertheless i vowed to my very soul that i should be strongstrong in every word and lookand if alma was daring me i should defy her and she would see that i should neither yield nor run away thus i entrenched myself at last in a sort of bright strong faith in my power to resist temptation but i must leave it to those who know better than i the way to read a womans heart to say how it came to pass that towards five oclock when i heard the sound of wheels and going on to my balcony saw a jauntingcar at the front entrance and then opening my door heard martins great voice in the hall i flew downstairsliterally flewin my eagerness to welcome him there he was in his brown harris tweeds and soft slouch hat with such an atmosphere of health and sweep of winds about him as almost took away my breath helloa he cried and i am sure his eyes brightened at the sight of me for they were like the sea when the sun shines on it youre better arent you he said no need to ask that thoughthe colour in your face is wonderful in spite of my resolution and the attempt i made to show him only a kind of glad seriousness i could not help it if i blushed also i could not help it if while going upstairs and telling him what had happened to the houseparty i said he was doomed to the disappointment of having nobody except myself for company and then womanlike waited eagerly for what he would say so theyre all gone except yourself are they he said im afraid they are i answered well if it had been the other way about and you had gone and they had stayed by the stars of god i should have been disappointed but things being as they are well muddle through shant we not all the vows in the world could prevent me from finding that answer delightful and when on entering my boudoir he said sorry to miss madame though i wanted a word with that lady before i went down to the antarctic i could not resist the mischievous impulse to show him almas letter while he read it his bright face darkened for all the world like a jewellers window when the shutter comes down on it and when he had finished it he said once more i hate that woman shes like a snake id like to put my foot on it and then she may run away as much as she likes but i will yet you go bail i will he was covered with dust and wanted to wash so i rang for a maid who told me that mr and mrs eastcliffs rooms had been prepared for mr conrad this announcement though i tried to seem unmoved overwhelmed me with confusion seeing that the rooms in question almost communicated with my own but martin only laughed and said stunning well live in this wing of the house and leave the rest of the old barracks to the cats should we i was tingling with joy but all the same i knew that a grim battle was before me sixtyfourth chapter by the time he returned from his room i had tea served in my boudoir and while we sat facing the open door to the balcony he told me about his visit to his old school how at the dinner on the previous night the principal had proposed his health and after the lads had sung forty years on he had told them yarns about his late expedition until they made the long hiss of indrawn breath which is peculiar to boys when they are excited how they had followed him to his bedroom as if he had been the pied piper of hamelin and questioned him and clambered over him until driven off by the housemaster and how finally before he was out of bed this morning the smallest scholar in the junior house a tiny little cherub with the face of his mother had come knocking at his door to ask if he wanted a cabin boy martin laughed as if he had been a boy himself which he always was and always will be while telling me these stories and i laughed too though with a certain tremor for i was constantly remembering my resolution and feeling afraid to be too happy after tea we went out on to the balcony and leaned side by side over the crumbling stone balustrade to look at the lovely landscapeloveliest when the sun is setting on itwith the flowergarden below and the headland beyond covered with heather and gorse and with a winding white path lying over it like the lash of a whip until it dipped down to the sea its a beautiful old world though isnt it said martin isnt it i answered and we looked into each others eyes and smiled then we heard the light shsh of a garden hose and looking down saw an old man watering the geraniums sakes alive its tommy the mate cried martin and leaving me on the balcony he went leaping down the stone stairway to greet his old comrade god bless me said tommy let me have a right look at ye yes yes its himself for sure a little gale of tender memories floated up to me from my childhood at seeing those two together again with martin now standing head and shoulders above the old mans glengarry cap youve been over the highways of the sea farther than franklin himself theyre telling me said tommy and when martin laughing merrily admitted that he had been farther south at all events the old sailor said well well think of that now but wasnt i always telling the omadhauns what youd be doing some day then with a glime of his starboard eye in my direction he said you havent got a woman yet though no i thought not youre like myself boytheres not many of them sorts in for you after that and a more undisguised look my way the old man talked about me still calling me the lil misthress and saying they were putting a power of gold on my fingers but he would be burning candles to the miracles of god to see the colour of it in my cheeks too shes a plant that doesnt take kindly to a hothouse same as this indicating the house and shell not be thriving until somebodys bedding her out im thinking it was saturday and after dinner martin proposed that we should walk to the head of the cliff to see blackwater by night which was a wonderful spectacle people said at the height of the season so i put a silk wrap over my head and we set out together there was no moon and few stars were visible but it was one of those luminous nights in summer which never forget the day therefore we walked without difficulty along the white winding path with its nutty odour of the heather and gorse until we came near the edge of the cliff and then suddenly the town burst upon our view with its promenades theatres and dancing palaces ablaze with electric light which was reflected with almost equal brilliance in the smooth water of the bay we were five miles from blackwater but listening hard we thought we could hear through the boom of the sea on the dark cliffs below us the thin sounds of the bands that were playing in the openair pavilions and looking steadfastly we thought we could see in the black patches under the white light the movement of the thousands of persons who were promenading along the front this led martin to talk of my father saying as we walked back with the dark outlines of the sleeping mountains confronting us what a marvellous man he had been to transform in twenty years the little fishing and trading port into a great resort for hundreds of thousands of pleasureseekers but is he any better or happier for the wealth it has brought him and for the connections he has bought with it is anybody any better said martin i know one who isnt i answered i had not meant to say that it had slipped out unawares and in my confusion at the selfrevelation which it seemed to make i tripped in the darkness and would have fallen if martin had not caught me up in doing this he had to put his arms about me and to hold me until i was steady on my feet and having done so he took my hand and drew it through his arm and in this way we walked the rest of the way back it would be impossible and perhaps foolish to say what that incident meant to me i felt a thrill of joy a quivering flood of delight which with all the raptures of my spiritual love had never come to me before every woman who loves her husband must know what it is but to me it was a great revelation it was just as if some new passion had sprung into life in me at a single moment and it hadthe mighty passion that lies at the root of our being the overwhelming instinct of sex which taking no account of religion and resolutions sweeps everything before it like a flood i think martin must have felt it too for all at once he ceased to speak and i was trembling so much with this new feeling of tenderness that i could not utter a word so i heard nothing as we walked on but the crackle of our footsteps on the gravel path and the measured boom of the sea which we were leaving behind usnothing but that and the quick beating in my own breast when we came to the garden the frowning face of the old house was in front of us and it was all in darkness save for the light in my room which came out on to the balcony everything was quiet the air was breathless there was not a rustle in the trees we took two or three turns on the lawn in front of my windows saying nothing but feeling terribly fearfully happy after a few moments or they seemed few a cuckoo clock on my desk struck eleven and we went up the stone stairway into my boudoir and parted for the night even then we did not speak but martin took my hand and lifted my fingers to his lips and the quivering delight i had been feeling ever since i slipped on the headland rushed through me again at the next moment i was in my room i did not turn on the light i undressed in the darkness and when my maid came i was in bed she wanted to tell me about a scene with the housekeeper in the kitchen but i said i dont want to talk tonight price i did not know what was happening to me i only knew for the first time that night that above everything else i was a woman and that my renunciation if it was ever to come to pass would be a still more tragic thing than i had expected my grim battle had begun sixtyfifth chapter when i awoke in the morning i took myself severely to task was this how i was fulfilling the promise i had made to martins mother or preparing to carry out the counsel of father dan i must be more careful i told myself i must keep a stronger hold of myself the church bells began to ring and i determined to go to mass i wanted to go alone and much as i grudged every minute of martins company which i lost i was almost glad when on going into the boudoir with my missal in my hand i found him at a table covered with papers and heard him say helloa see these letters and telegrams sunday as it is ive got to answer them our church was a little chapelofease on the edge of my husbands estate opened after centuries of neglect by the bad lord raa in his regenerate days for the benefit of the people of his own village it was very sweet to see their homely faces as they reverently bowed and rose and even to hear their creachy voices when they joined in the singing of the gloria following the gospel there was a sermon on the words lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil the preacher was a young curate the brother of my husbands coachman and it occurred to me that he could know very little of temptation for himself but the instruction he gave us was according to the doctrine of our church as i had received it from the reverend mother and the cardinals who used to hold retreats at the convent beware of the temptations of the flesh my children said the priest the evil one is very subtle and not only in our moments of pride and prosperity but also in our hours of sorrow and affliction he is for ever waiting and watching to betray us to our downfall and damnation in the rustling that followed the sermon a poor woman who sat next to me with a print handkerchief over her head whispered in my ear that she was sorry she had not brought her husband for he had given way to drink poor fellow since the island had had such good times and wages had been so high but the message came closer home to me remembering the emotions of the night before i prayed fervently to be strengthened against all temptation and preserved from all sin and when the mass was resumed i recalled some of the good words with which i had been taught to assist at the holy sacrificepraying at the credo that as i had become a child in the bosom of the church i might live and die in it when the service was over i felt more at ease and i emptied my purse i remember partly into the plate and partly to the poor people at the church door it was in this spirit that i returned home in the broad sunshine of noonday but half way up the drive i met martin walking briskly down to meet me he was bareheaded and in flannels and i could not help it if he looked to me so good so strong and so well able to protect a woman against every danger that the instructions i had received in church and the resolutions i had formed there seemed to run out of my heart as rapidly as the dry sand of the seashore runs through ones fingers helloa he cried as usual the way ive been wasting this wonderful morning over letters and telegrams but not another minute will i give to anything under the stars of god but you if there was any woman in the world who could have resisted that greeting i was not she and though i was a little confused i was very happy as we walked back to the house we talked of my father and his sudden illness then of his mother and my glimpse of her and finally of indifferent things such as the weather which had been a long drought and might end in a deluge by a sort of mutual consent we never once spoke of the central subject of our thoughtsmy marriage and its fatal consequencesbut i noticed that martins voice was soft and caressing that he was walking close to my side and that as often as i looked up at him he was looking down at me and smiling it was the same after luncheon when we went out into the garden and sat on a seat in the shrubbery almost immediately facing my windows and he spread a chart on a rustic table and pointing to a red line on it said look this is the course of our new cruise please god he talked for a long time about his captain and crew the scientific experts who had volunteered to accompany him his aeronautic outfit his sledges and his skis but whatever he talked aboutif it was only his dogs and the food he had found for themit was always in that soft caressing voice which made me feel as if though he never said one word of love he were making love to me and saying the sweetest things a man could say to a woman after a time i found myself answering in the same tones and even when speaking on the most matteroffact subjects i felt as if i were saying the sweetest things a woman could say to a man we sat a long time so and every moment we were together seemed to make our relation more perilous until at length the sweet seductive twilight of the shortening autumn day began to frighten me and making excuse of a headache i said i must go indoors he walked with me up the stonestairway and into my boudoir until we got to the very door of my room and then suddenly he took up both my hands and kissed them passionately i felt the colour rushing to my cheeks and i had an almost irresistible impulse to do something in return but conquering it with a great effort i turned quickly into my bedroom shut the door pulled down the blinds and then sat and covered my face and asked myself with many bitter pangs if it could possibly be true as i had been taught to believe that our nature was evil and our senses were always tempting us to our destruction several hours passed while i sat in the darkness with this warfare going on between my love and my religion and then price came to dress me for dinner and she was full of cheerful gossip men are such children she said they cant help giving themselves away can they it turned out that after i had left the lawn she had had some conversation with martin and i could see that she was eager to tell me what he had said about myself the talk began about your health and altered looks my lady dont you think your mistress is looking ill said he a little i said but her body is not so ill as her heart if you ask me said i you never said that price well i could not help saying it if i thought so could i and what did he say he didnt say anything then my lady but when i said you see sir my lady is tied to a husband she doesnt love he said how can she poor thing worse than that i said her husband loves another woman the fool where does he keep his eyes said he worse still said i he flaunts his infidelities in her very face the brute he said and his face looked so fierce that you would have thought he wanted to take his lordship by the throat and choke him why doesnt she leave the man said he thats what i say sir but i think its her religion i said then god help her for theres no remedy for that said he and then seeing him so down i said but we women are always ruled by our hearts in the long run do you think so said he im sure of it said i only we must have somebody to help us i said theres her father said he a father is of no use in a case like this i said especially such a one as my ladys is according to all reports no said i it must be somebody elsesomebody who cares enough for a woman to risk everything for her and just take her and make her do whats best for herself whether she likes it or not now if somebody like that were to come to my lady and get her out of her trouble i said somebody will said he make your mind easy about that somebody will he said and then he went on walking to and fro price told this story as if she thought she was bringing me the gladdest of glad tidings but the idea that martin had come back into my life to master me to take possession of me to claim me as his own just as he did when i was a child and thereby compel me to do what i had promised his mother and father dan not to dothis was terrifying but there was a secret joy in it too and every woman will know what i mean if i say that my heart was beating high with the fierce delight of belonging to somebody when i returned to the boudoir where martin was waiting to sit down to dinner then came a great surprise martin was standing with his back to the fireplace and i saw in a moment that the few hours which had intervened had changed him as much as they had changed me helloa better arent we he cried but he was now cold almost distant and even his hearty voice seemed to have sunk to a kind of nervous treble i could not at first understand this but after a while i began to see that we two had reached the point beyond which it was impossible to go without encountering the most tremendous fact of our livesmy marriage and all that was involved by it during dinner we spoke very little he seemed intentionally not to look at me the warm glances of his seablue eyes which all the afternoon had been making the colour mount to my cheeks had gone and it sent a cold chill to my heart to look across the table at his clouded face but sometimes when he thought my own face was down i was conscious that his eyes were fixed on me with a questioning almost an imploring gaze his nervousness communicated itself to me it was almost as if we had begun to be afraid of each other and were hovering on the brink of fatal revelations when dinner was over the table cleared and the servants gone i could bear the strain no longer so making excuse of a letter i had to write to the reverend mother i sat down at my desk whereupon martin lit a cigar and said he would stroll over the headland i heard his footsteps going down the stone stairway from the balcony i heard their soft thud on the grass of the lawn i heard their sharper crackle on the gravel of the white path and then they mingled with the surge and wash of the flowing tide and died away in the distance i rose from the desk and going over to the balcony door looked out into the darkness it was a beautiful pathetic heartbreaking night no moon but a perfect canopy of stars in a deep blue sky the fragrance of unseen flowerssweetbriar and rose as well as ripening fruitcame up from the garden there was no wind either not even the rustle of a leaf and the last bird of evening was silent all the great orchestra of nature was still save for the light churning of the water running in the glen and the deep organ song of the everlasting sea what can i do i asked myself now that martin was gone i had begun to understand him his silence had betrayed his heart to me even more than his speech could have done towering above him like a frowning mountain was the fact that i was a married woman and he was trying to stand erect in his honour as a man he must be suffering too i told myself that was a new thought to me and it cut me to the quick when it came to me first i wanted to run after him and throw myself into his arms and then i wanted to run away from him altogether i felt as if i were on the brink of two madnessesthe madness of breaking my marriage vows and the madness of breaking the heart of the man who loved me oh what can i do i asked myself again i wanted him to go i wanted him to stay i did not know what i wanted at length i remembered that in ordinary course he would be going in two days more and i said to myself surely i can hold out that long but when i put this thought to my breast thinking it would comfort me i found that it burnt like hot iron only two days and then he would be gone lost to me perhaps for ever did my renunciation require that it was terrible there was a piano in the room and to strengthen and console myself in my trouble i sat down to it and played and sang i sang ave maria stella i was singing to myself so i know i began softlyso softly that my voice must have been a whisper scarcely audible outside the room hail thou star of ocean portal of the sky but my heart was full and when i came to the verses which always moved me most virgin of all virgins to thy shelter take us my voice without my knowing it may have swelled out into the breathless night until it reached martin where he walked on the dark headland and sounded to him like a cry that called him back i cannot say i only know that when with a thickening throat i had come to an end and my forehead had fallen on to the keyboard and there was no other sound in the air but the faroff surging of the sea i heard somebody calling me in a soft and tremulous whisper mary it was he i went out to the balcony and there he was on the lawn below the light of the room was on him and never before had i seen his strong face so full of agitation come down he said i have something to say to you i could not resist him he was my master i had to obey when i reached the bottom of the stairway he took my hand and i did not know whether it was his hand or mine that was trembling he led me across the lawn to the seat in the shrubbery that almost faced my windows in the soft and soundless night i could hear his footsteps on the turf and the rustle of my dress over the grass we sat and for a moment he did not speak then with a passionate rush of words he said mary i hadnt meant to say what im going to say now but i cant do anything else you are in trouble and i cant stand by and see you so illused i cant and i wont i tried to answer him but my throat was fluttering and i could not speak its only a few days before i ought to sail but they may be enough in which to do something and if theyre not ill postpone the expedition or put it off or send somebody in my place for go away i cannot and leave you like this i tried to say that he should not do that whatever happened to me but still i could not speak mary i want to help you but i can only do so if you give me the right to do it nobody must tell me im a meddler butting in where i have no business there are people enough about you who would be only too ready to do thatpeople related to you by blood and by law i knew what he was coming to for his voice was quivering in my ears like the string of a bow there is only one sort of right mary that is above the right of blood and you know what that is my eyes were growing so dim that i could hardly see the face which was so close to mine mary he said i have always cared for you surely you know that by the saints of god i swear there has never been any other girl for me and now there never will he perhaps i ought to have told you this before and i wanted to do so when i met you in rome but it didnt seem fair and i couldnt bring myself to do it his passionate voice was breaking i thought my heart was breaking also all i could do i did but it came to nothing and now you are here and you are unhappy and though it is so late i want to help you to rescue you to drag you out of this horrible situation before i go away let me do it give me the right of one you care enough for to allow him to speak on your behalf i knew what that meant i knew that i was tottering on the very edge of a precipice and to save myself i tried to think of father dan of martins mother of my own mother and since i could not speak i struggled to pray dont say you cant if you do i shall go away a sorrowful man i shall go at once tootonight or tomorrow morning at latest for my heart bleeds to look at you and i cant stay here any longer to see you suffer it is not torture to meits hell and then the irrepressible overwhelming inevitable moment came martin laid hold of my right hand and said in his tremulous voice mary mary i i love you i could hear no more i could not think or pray or resist any longer the bitter struggle was at an end before i knew what i was doing i was dropping my head on to his breast and he with a cry of joy was gathering me in his arms i was his he had taken his own nothing counted in the presence of our love to be only we two togetherthat was everything the world and the worlds laws the church and the canons of the church were blotted out forgotten lost for some moments i hardly breathed i was only conscious that over my head martin was saying something that seemed to come to me with all the deep and wonderful whispers of his heart then its true its true that you love me yes its true its true no one shall hurt you again never again no by the lord god and then suddenlyas suddenly as the moment of intoxication had come to mei awoke from my delirium some little thing awakened me i hardly know what it was perhaps it was only the striking of the cuckoo clock in my room what are we doing i said everything had rolled back on memy marriage father dans warning my promise to martins mother where are we i said hush dont speak said martin let us think of nothing tonightnothing except our love dont say that i answered we are not free to love each other and then trying to liberate myself from his encircling arms i cried god help me god forgive me wait said martin holding me a moment longer i know what you feel and im not the man to want a girl to wrong her conscience but theres one question i must ask you if you were free could you love me then dont ask me that i must not answer it you must and shall said martin could you yes thats enough for meenough for tonight anyway have no fear all shall be well go to your room now he raised me to my feet and led me back to the foot of the balcony and there he kissed my hand and let me go good night he said softly good night i answered god bless you my pure sweet girl at the next moment i was in my room lying face down on my bedseeing no hope on any side and sobbing my heart out for what might have been but for the hard law of my religion and the cruel tangle of my fate sixtysixth chapter next morning monday morning while i was breakfasting in my bedroom price came with a message from martin to say that he was going into the glen and wished to know if i would go with him i knew perfectly what that meant he wished to tell me what steps he intended to take towards my divorce and my heart trembled with the thought of the answer i had to give himthat divorce for me under any circumstances was quite impossible sorry as i was for myself i was still more sorry for martin i felt like a judge who had to pronounce sentence upon himdooming his dearest hopes to painful and instant death i could hear him on the lawn with tommy the mate laughing like a boy let loose from school and when i went down to him he greeted me with a cry of joy that was almost heartbreaking our way to the glen was through a field of grass where the dew was thick and my boots being thin martin in his high spirits wished to carry me across and it was only with an effort that i prevented him from doing so the glen itself when we reached it it was called glen raa was almost cruelly beautiful that day and remembering what i had to do in it i thought i should never be able to get it out of my sightwith its slumberous gloom like that of a vast cathedral its thick arch of overhanging boughs through which the morning sunlight was streaming slantwards like the light through the windows of a clerestory its running water below its rustling leaves above and the chirping of its birds on every side making a sound that was like the chanting of a choir in some faroff apse and the rumbling of their voices in the roof two or three times as we walked down the glen towards a port port raa which lay at the seaward end of it martin rallied me on the settled gravity of my face and then i had to smile though how i did so i do not know for every other minute my heart was in my mouth and never more so than when to make me laugh he rattled away in the language of his boyhood saying isnt this stunning splendiferous eh when we came out at the mouth of the port where a line of little stunted oaks leaned landward as with the memory of many a winters storm martin said let us sit down here we sat on the sloping bank with the insects ticking in the grass the bees humming in the air the sea fowl screaming in the sky the broad sea in front and the little bay below where the tide which was going out had left behind it a sharp reef of black rocks covered with seaweed a pleasuresteamer passed at that moment with its flags flying its awnings spread its decks crowded with excursionists and a brass hand playing one of sousas marches and as soon as it had gone martin said ive been thinking about our affair mary how to go to work and all that and of course the first thing weve got to do is to get a divorce i made no answer and i tried not to look at him by fixing my eyes upon the sea you have evidence enough you know and if you havent theres priceshe has plenty so since youve given me the right to speak for you dear im going to speak to your father first i must have made some halfarticulate response for not understanding me he said oh i know hell be a hard nut to crack he wont want to hear what ive got to say but he has got to hear it and after all youre his daughter and if he has any bowels of compassion again i must have made some effort to speak for he said yes hes ill but he has only to set curphy to work and the lawyer will do the rest i could not allow him to go any further so i blurted out somehow that i had seen my father already on this subject yes and what did he say i told him as well as i could what my father had said being ashamed to repeat it that was only bluff though said martin the real truth is that you would cease to be lady raa and that would be a blow to his pride then there would no longer be any possibility of establishing a family and that would disturb his plans no matter we can set curphy to work ourselves but i have seen mr curphy also i said and what did he say i told him what the lawyer had said and he was aghast good heavens what an iniquity in england too but never mind there are other countries where this relic of the barbaric ages doesnt exist well go there we must get you a divorce somehow my time had come i could keep back the truth no longer but martin i said divorce is impossible for mequite impossible and then i told him that i had been to see the bishop also and he had said what i had known before though in the pain of my temptation i had forgotten it that the catholic church did not countenance divorce under any circumstances because god made marriages and therefore no man could dissolve them martin listened intently and in his eagerness to catch every word he raised himself to a kneeling position by my side so that he was looking into my face but mary my dear mary he said you dont mean to say you will allow such considerations to influence you i am a catholicwhat else can i do i said but thinkmy dear dear girl think how unreasonable how untrue how preposterous it all is in a case like yours god made your marriage yours god married you to that notorious profligate can you believe it his eyes were flaming i dared not look at them then think again they say theres no divorce in the catholic church do they but what are they talking about morally speaking you are a divorced woman already anybody with an ounce of brains can see that when you were married to this man he made a contract with you and he has broken the terms of it hasnt he then wheres the contract now it doesnt any longer exist your husband has destroyed it but isnt marriage different i asked and then i tried to tell him what the bishop had said of the contract of marriage being unlike any other contract because god himself had become a party to it what he cried god become a party to a marriage like yours my dear girl only think think of what your marriage has beenthe pride and vanity and selfseeking that conceived it the compulsion that was put upon you to carry it through and then the shame and the suffering and the wickedness and the sin of it was god a party to the making of a marriage like that in his agitation he rose walked two or three paces in front and came back to me then think what it means if your marriage may not be dissolved it means that you must go on living with this man whose life is so degrading year in year out as long as your life lasts you must let him humiliate and corrupt you with his company his companions and his example until you are dragged down down down to the filth he lives in himself and your very soul is contaminated is that what the church asks of you i answered no and tried to tell him what the bishop had told me about separation but he interrupted me with a shout separation did he say that if the church has no right to divorce you what right has it to separate you oh i see what it will sayhope of reconciliation but if you were separated from your husband would you ever go back to him never in this world then what would your separation be only divorce under another name i was utterly shaken perhaps i wanted to believe what martin was saying perhaps i did not know enough to answer him but i could not help it if i thought martins clear mind was making dust and ashes of everything that father dan and the bishop had said to me then what can i do i asked i thought his face quivered at that question he got up again and stood before me for a moment without speaking then he said with an obvious effort if your church will not allow you to divorce your husband and if you and i cannot marry without that then yes i didnt mean to propose it god knows i didnt but when a woman when a woman has been forced into a loveless marriage and it is crushing the very soul out of her and the iron law of her church will not permit her to escape from it what crime does she commit if she well i asked though i saw what he was going to say mary he said breathing hard and fast you must come to me i made a sudden cry though i tried not to oh i know he said its not what we could wish but well be open about it well face it out why shouldnt we i shall anyway and if your father and the bishop say anything to me ill tell them what i think of the abominable marriage they forced you into as for you dear i know youll have to bear something all the conventional canting hypocrisies every man who has bought his wife and every woman who has sold herself into concubinagethere are thousands and thousands of them all the world over and theyll try perhaps theyll try but let them try if they want to trample the life out of you theyll have to walk over me firstyes by god they will but martin well do you mean that i i am to to live with you without marriage its the only thing possible isnt it he said and then he tried to show me that love was everything and if people loved each other nothing else matteredreligious ceremonies were nothing the morality of society was nothing the world and its backbiting was nothing the great moment had come for me at last and though i felt torn between love and pity i had to face it martin i i cant do it i said he looked steadfastly into my face for a moment but i dare not look back for i knew he was suffering you think it would be wrong yes a sin i tried to say yes again but my reply died in my throat there was another moment of silence and then in a faltering voice that nearly broke me down he said in that case there is nothing more to say there isnt is there i made an effort to speak but my voice would not come i thought as there was no other way of escape from this terrible marriage but if you think he stopped and then coming closer he said i suppose you know what this means for you marythat after all the degradation you have gone through you are shutting the door to a worthier purer life and that i could bear no more my heart was yearning for him yet i was compelled to speak but would it be a purer life martin if it began in sin no no it wouldnt it couldnt oh you cant think how hard it is to deny myself the happiness you offer me its harder than all the miseries my husband has inflicted upon me but it wouldnt be happiness because our sin would stand between us that would always be there martinevery day every night as long as ever we lived we should never know one really happy hour im sure we should not i should be unhappy myself and i should make you unhappy oh i darent i darent dont ask me i begi beseech you i burst into tears after this and there was a long silence between us then martin touched my arm and said with a gentleness that nearly broke my heart dont cry mary i give in i find i have no will but yours dear if you can bear the present condition of things i ought to be able to let us go back to the house he raised me to my feet and we turned our faces homeward all the brightness of the day had gone for both of us by this time the tide was now far out its moaning was only a distant murmur the shore was a stretch of jagged black rocks covered with seaweed sixtyseventh chapter notwithstanding martins tenderness i had a vague fear that he had only pretended to submit to my will and before the day was over i had proof of it during dinner we spoke very little and after it was over we went out to the balcony to sit on a big oak seat which stood there it was another soft and soundless night without stars very dark and with an empty echoing air which seemed to say that thunder was not far off for the churning of the nightjar vibrated from the glen and the distant roar of the tide now rising was like the rumble of drums at a soldiers funeral just as we sat down the pleasuresteamer we had seen in the morning recrossed our breadth of sea on its way back to blackwater and lit up on deck and in all its portholes it looked like a floating cafe chantant full of happy people for they were singing in chorus a rugged song which martin and i had known all our lives ramsey town ramsey town smiling by the sea heres a health to my true love wheresoeer she be when the steamer had passed into darkness martin said i dont want to hurt you again mary but before i go theres something i want to know if you cannot divorce your husband and if if you cannot come to me what what is left to us i tried to tell him there was only one thing left to us and as much for myself as for him i did my best to picture the spiritual heights and beauties of renunciation does that mean that we are to to part he said you going your way and i going mine never to meet again that cut me to the quick so i saidit was all i could trust myself to saythat the utmost that was expected of us was that we should govern our affectionscontrol and conquer them do you mean that we are to stamp them out altogether he said that cut me to the quick too and i felt like a torn bird that is struggling in the lime but i contrived to say that if our love was guilty love it was our duty to destroy it is that possible he said we must ask god to help us i answered and then while his head was down and i was looking out into the darkness i tried to say that though he was suffering now he would soon get over this disappointment do you wish me to get over it he asked this confused me terribly for in spite of all i was saying i knew at the bottom of my heart that in the sense he intended i did not and could not wish it we have known and cared for each other all our lives maryisnt that so it seems as if there never was a time when we didnt know and care for each other are we to pray to god as you say that a time may come when we shall feel as if we had never known and cared for each other at all my throat was flutteringi could not answer him i cant he said i never shallnever as long as i live no prayers will ever help me to forget you i could not speak i dared not look at him after a moment he said in a thicker voice and you will you be able to forget me by praying to god will you be able to wipe me out of your mind i felt as if something were strangling me a woman lives in her heart doesnt she he said love is everything to her everything except her religion will it be possiblethis renunciation will it be possible for you either i felt as if all the blood in my body were running away from me it will not you know it will not you will never be able to renounce your love neither of us will he able to renounce it it isnt possible it isnt human well what then if we continue to love each otheryou here and i down therewe shall be just as guilty in the eyes of the church shant we i did not answer him and after a moment he came closer to me on the seat and said almost in a whisper then think again mary only give one glance to the horrible life that is before you when i am gone you have been married a year only a year and you have suffered terribly but there is worse to come your husbands coarse infidelity has been shocking but there will be something more shocking than his infidelityhis affection have you never thought of that i started and shuddered feeling as if somebody must have told him the most intimate secret of my life coming still closer he said forgive me dear im bound to speak plainly now if i didnt i should never forgive myself in the future listen your husband will get over his fancy for this this woman hell throw her off as he has thrown off women of the same kind before what will happen then hell remember that you belong to him that he has rights in you that you are his wife and he is your husband that the infernal law which denies you the position of an equal human being gives him a righta legal rightto compel your obedience have you never thought of that for one moment we looked into each others eyes then he took hold of my hand and speaking very rapidly said thats the life that is before you when i am goneto live with this man whom you loathe year after year as long as life lasts occupying the same house the same room the same i uttered an involuntary cry and he stopped martin i said there is something you dont know and then i told himit was forced out of memy modesty went down in the fierce battle with a higher pain and i do not know whether it was my pride or my shame or my love that compelled me to tell him but i did tell himgod knows howthat i could not run the risk he referred to because i was not in that sense my husbands wife and never had been the light was behind me and my face was in the darkness but still i covered it with my hands while i stammered out the story of my marriage day and the day after and of the compact i had entered into with my husband that only when and if i came to love him should he claim my submission as a wife while i was speaking i knew that martins eyes were fixed on me for i could feel his breath on the back of my hands but before i had finished he leapt up and cried excitedly and that compact has been kept yes then its all right dont be afraid you shall be free come in and let me tell you how come in come in he took me back into the boudoir i had no power to resist him his face was as pale as death but his eyes were shining he made me sit down and then sat on the table in front of me listen he said when i bought my ship from the lieutenant we signed a deed a contract as a witness before all men that he would give me his ship and i would give him some money but if after all he hadnt given me his ship what would our deed have been only so much waste paper it was the same with my marriage if it had been an honest contract the marriage service would have been a witness before god that we meant to live together as man and wife but i never had therefore what was the marriage service only an empty ceremony thats the plain sense of the matter isnt it he cried i defy any priest in the world to prove the contrary well well dont you see what it comes to you are freemorally free at all events you can come to me you must too i darent leave you in this house any longer i shall take you to london and fix you up there and then when i tome back from the antarctic he was glowing with joy but a cold hand suddenly seized me for i had remembered all the terrors of excommunication as father dan had described them but martin i said would the church accept that what matter whether it would or wouldnt our consciences would be clear there would be no sin and what you were saying this morning would not apply but if i left my husband i couldnt marry you could i perhaps not then the church would say that i was a sinful woman living a sinful life wouldnt it but you wouldnt be all the same the church would say so and if it did i should be cut out of communion and if i were cut out of communion i should be cast out of the church and if i were cast out of the church what would become of me then but my dear dear girl said martin dont you see that this is not the same thing at all it is only a case of a ceremony and why should a mere ceremonyeven if we cannot do away with itdarken a womans life for ever my heart was yearning for love but my soul was crying out for salvation and not being able to answer him for myself i told him what father dan had said i was to say father dan is a saint and i love him he said but what can he knowwhat can any priest know of a situation like this the law of man has tied you to this brute but the law of god has given you to me why should a marriage service stand between us but it does i said and we cant alter it no no i dare not break the law of the church i am a weak wretched girl but i cannot give up my religion after that martin did not speak for a moment then he said you mean that mary yes and then my heart accused me so terribly of the crime of resisting him that i took his hand and held his fingers in a tight lock while i told himwhat i had never meant to tellhow long and how deeply i had loved him but nevertheless i dared not face the thought of living and dying without the consolations of the church i dare not i dare not i said i should be a brokenhearted woman if i did and you dont want that do you he listened in silence though the irregular lines in his face showed the disordered state of his soul and when i had finished a wild look came into his eyes and he said i am disappointed in you mary i thought you were brave and fearless and that when i showed you a way out of your miserable entanglement you would take it in spite of everything his voice was growing thick again i could scarcely bear to listen to it do you suppose i wanted to take up the position i proposed to you not i no decent man ever does but i love you so dearly that i was willing to make that sacrifice and count it as nothing if only i could rescue you from the misery of your abominable marriage then he broke into a kind of fierce laughter and said it seems i wasnt wanted though you say in effect that my love is sinful and criminal and that it will imperil your soul so im only making mischief here and the sooner i get away the better for everybody he threw off my hand stepped to the door to the balcony and looking out into the darkness said between choking laughter and sobs ellan you are no place for me i cant bear the sight of you any longer i used to think you were the dearest spot on earth because you were the home of her who would follow me to the ends of the earth if i wanted her but i was wrong she loves me less than a wretched ceremony and would sacrifice my happiness to a miserable bit of parchment my heart was clamouring loud never had i loved him so much as now i had to struggle with myself not to throw myself into his arms no matter he said i should be a poorspirited fool to stay where im not wanted i must get back to my work the sooner the better too i thought i should be counting the days down there until i could come home again but why should i and why should i care what happens to me its all as one now he stepped back from the balcony with a resolute expression on his gloomy face and i thought for a moment half hoping and half fearing it that he was going to lay hold of me and tell me i must do what he wished because i belonged to him but he only looked at me for a moment in silence and then burst into a flood of tears and turned and ran out of the house let who will say his tears were unmanly to me they were the bitter cry of a great heart and i wanted to follow him and say take me do what you like with me i am yours i did not do so i sat a long time where he had left me and then i went into my room and locked the door i did not cry unjust and cruel as his reproaches had been i began to have a strange wild joy in them i knew that he would not have insulted me like that if he had not loved me to the very verge of madness itself hours passed price came tapping at my door to ask if she should lock up the housemeaning the balcony i answered no go to bed i heard the deadened thud of martins footsteps on the lawn passing to and fro sometimes they paused under my window and then i had a feeling amounting to certainty that he was listening to hear if i was sobbing and that if i had been he would have broken down my bedroom door to get to me at length i heard him come up the stone stairway shut and bolt the balcony door and walk heavily across the corridor to his own room the day was then dawning it was four oclock sixtyeighth chapter i awoke on wednesday morning in a kind of spiritual and physical fever every conflicting emotion which a woman can experience in the cruel battle between her religion and her love seemed to flood body and souljoy pain pride shame fear raptureso that i determined not without cause to make excuse of a headache to stay in bed although it was the last day of martins visit and i charged myself with the discourtesy of neglecting him as well as the folly of losing the few remaining hours of his company i thought i could not without danger meet him again i was afraid of him but i was still more afraid of myself recalling my last sight of his face as he ran out of the house and knowing well the desire of my own heart i felt that if i spent another day in his company it would be impossible to say what might happen as a result of this riot of emotions i resolved to remain all day in my room and towards evening to send out a letter bidding him goodbye and goodluck it would be a cold end to a long friendship and my heart was almost frozen at the thought of it but it was all i dared do and i saw no help for it but how little did i know what was written in the book of fate for me first came price on pretence of bathing my forehead and she bombarded me with accounts of martins anxiety when he had heard that i was ill he had turned as white as if sixteen ounces of blood had been taken out of him it nearly broke me up to hear that but price who was artful only laughed and said men are such funny things bless them to think of that fine young man who is big enough to fell an ox and brave enough to face a lion being scared to death because a little lady has a headache all morning she was in and out of my room with similar stories and towards noon she brought me a bunch of roses wet with the dew saying that tommy the mate had sent them are you sure it was tommy the mate i asked whereupon the sly thing who was only waiting to tell the truth though she pretended that i was forcing it out of her admitted that the flowers were from martin and that he had told her not to say so whats he doing now i asked writing a letter said price and judging by the times he has torn it up and started again and wiped his forehead it must be a tough job i can tell you i thought i knew whom the letter was meant for and before luncheon it came up to me it was the first love letter i had ever had from martin and it melted me like wax over a candle i have it still and though martin is such a great man now i am tempted to copy it out just as it was written with all its appearance of irreverence none i am sure was intended and even its bad spelling for without that it would not be martinmy boy who could never learn his lessons dear maryi am destroyed to here how ill you are and when i think its all my fault i am ready to kick myself dont worry about what i was saying last night i was mad to think what might happen to you while i should be down there but ive been thinking it over since and ive come to the conclusion that if their is anything to god he can be trusted to look after you without any help from me so when we meet again before i go away well never say another word on the subjectthats a promice i cant go until your better though so im just sending the jaunting car into town with a telegram to london telling them to postpone the expedision on account of illness and if they think its mine it wont matter because its something worse but if you are realy a bit better as your maid says you might come to the window and wave your hand to me and i shall be as happy as a sandboy yours mart to this letter forgetting my former fears i returned an immediate verbal reply saying i was getting better rapidly and hoped to be up to dinner so he must not send that telegram to london on any account seeing that nobody knew what was going to happen and everything was in the hands of god price took my message with a knowing smile at the corner of her mouth and a few minutes afterwards i heard martin laughing with tommy the mate at the other end of the lawn i dont know why i took so much pains with my dress that night i did not expect to see martin again i was sending him away from me yet never before had i dressed myself with so much care i put on the soft white satin gown which was made for me in cairo a string of pearls over my hair and another a tight one about my neck martin was waiting for me in the boudoir and to my surprise he had dressed too but except that he wore a soft silk shirt i did not know what he was wearing or whether he looked handsome or not because it was martin and that was all that mattered to me i am sure my footstep was light as i entered the room for i was shod in white satin slippers but martin heard it and i saw his eyes fluttering as he looked at me and said something sweet about a silvery fir tree with its little dark head against the sky its to be a truce isnt it he asked yes a truce i answered which meant that as this was to be our last evening together all painful subjects were to be put aside before we sat down to eat he took me out on to the balcony to look at the sea for though there was no rain flashes of sheet lightning with low rumbling of distant thunder lit up the water for a moment with visions of heavenly beauty and then were devoured by the grim and greedy darkness during dinner we kept faith with each other in order to avoid the one subject that was uppermost in both our minds we played at being children and pretended it was the day we sailed to st marys rock thinking back to that time and all the incidents which he had thought so heroic and i so tragic we dropped into the vernacular and i called him boy and he called me bogh millish and at every racy word that came up from the forgotten cells of our brains we shrieked with laughter when martin spoke of his skipper i asked is he a stunner when he mentioned one of his scientific experts i inquired is he any good and after he had told me that he hoped to take possession of some island in the name of the english crown and raise the union jack on it i said do or die we allus does that when were out asploring how we laughed he laughed because i laughed and i laughed because he was laughing i had some delicious moments of femininity too such as no woman can resist until it struck me suddenly that in all this makebelieve we were making love to each other again that frightened me for a time but i told myself that everything was safe as long as we could carry on the game it was not always easy to do so though for some of our laughter had tears behind it and some of our memories had an unexpected sting because things had a meaning for us now which they never had before and we were compelled to realise what life had done for us thus i found my throat throbbing when i recalled the loss of our boat leaving us alone together on that cruel rock with the rising tide threatening to submerge us and i nearly choked when i repeated my last despairing cry im not a stunner and youll have to give me up and leave me here and save yourself it was like walking over a solfataro with the thin hot earth ready to break up under our feet to escape from it i sat down at the piano and began to sing i dared not sing the music i loved bestthe solemn music of the conventso i sang some of the nonsense songs i had heard in the streets at one moment i twisted round on the piano stool and said ill bet you anythingi always caught martins tone in martins company you cant remember the song i sang sitting in the boat with william rufus on my lap ill bet you anything i can said martin oh no you cant i said have it as you like bogh but sing it for all said martin and then i sang oh sallys the gel for me our sallys the gel for me ill marry the gel that i love best when i come back from sea but that arrow of memory had been sharpened on times grindstone and it seemed to pierce through us so martin proposed that we should try the rollicking chorus which the excursionists had sung on the pleasuresteamer the night before he did not know a note of music and he had no more voice than a corncrake but crushing up on to the musicstool by my side he banged away with his left hand while i played with my right and we sang together in a wild delightful discord ramsey town ramsey town smiling by the sea heres a health to my true love wheresoeer she be we laughed again when that was over but i knew i could not keep it up much longer and every now and then i forgot that i was in my boudoir and seemed to see that lonesome plateau twelve thousand feet above the icy barrier that guards the pole and martin toiling through blizzards over rolling waves of snow towards midnight we went out on to the balcony to look at the lightning for the last time the thunder was shaking the cliffs and rolling along them like cannonballs and martin said it sounds like the breaking of the ice down there when we returned to the room he told me he would have to be off early in the morning before i was out of bed having something to do in blackwater where the boys were getting up a spree of some sort in this way he rattled on for some minutes obviously talking himself down and trying to prevent me from thinking but the grim moment came at last and it was like the empty gap of time when you are waiting for the whirring of the clock that is to tell the end of the old year and the beginning of the new my cuckoo clock struck twelve martin looked at me i looked at him our eyes fell he took my hand it was cold and moist his own was hot and trembling so this is the end he said yes the end i answered well weve had a jolly evening to finish up with anyway he said i shall always remember it i tried to say he would soon have other evenings to think about that would make him forget this one never in this world he answered i tried to wish him good luck and great success and a happy return to fame and fortune he looked at me with his great liquid eyes and said aw well thats all as one now i tried to tell him it would always be a joy to me to remember that he and i had been such great great friends he looked at me again and answered thats all as one also i reproached myself for the pain i was causing him and to keep myself in countenance i began to talk of the beauty and nobility of renunciationeach sacrificing for the others sake all sinful thoughts and desires yes im doing what you wish he said i cant deny you anything that cut me deep so i went on to say that if i had acted otherwise i should always have had behind me the memory of the vows i had broken the sacrament i had violated and the faith i had abandoned all the same we might have been very happy he said and then my throat became so thick that i could not say any more after a few moments he said it breaks my heart to leave you but i suppose i must though i dont know what is going to happen all that is in gods hands i said yes said martin its up to him now it made my heart ache to look at his desolate face so struggling hard with my voice i tried to tell him he must not despair you are so young i said surely the future holds much happiness for you and then though i knew that the bare idea of another woman taking the love i was turning away would have made the world a blank for me i actually said something about the purest joys of love falling to his lot some day no by the lord god said martin therell be no other woman for me if im not to have you ill wear the willow for you the same as if you were dead there was a certain pain in that but there was a thrill of secret joy in it too he was still holding my hand we held each others hands a long time in spite of my affected resignation i could not let his hand go i felt as if i were a drowning woman and his hand were my only safety nevertheless i said we must say goodnight and goodbye now and if it is for ever dont say that but if it is well then for ever at least give me something to take away with me he said better not i answered but even as i spoke i dropped the handkerchief which i had been holding in my other hand and he picked it up i knew that my tears though i was trying to keep them back were trickling down my cheeks i saw that his face was all broken up as it had been the night before there was a moment of silence in which i was conscious of nothing but the fierce beating of my pulse and then he raised my hand to his lips dropped it gently and walked over to the door but after he had opened it he turned and looked at me i looked at him longing craving hungering for his love as for a flame at which my heart could warm itself then came a blinding moment it seemed as if in an instant he lost all control of himself and his love came rushing upon him like a mighty surging river flinging the door back he returned to me with long strides and snatching me up in his great arms he lifted me off my feet clasped me tightly to him kissed me passionately on the mouth and cried in a quivering husky voice you are my wife i am your real husband i am not leaving you because you are married to this brute but for the sake of your soul we love each other we shall continue to love each other no matter where you are or what they do with you you are mine and always will be my blood was boiling the world was reeling round me there was a roaring in my brain all my spiritual impulses had gone i was a woman and it was the same to me as if the primordial man had taken possession of me by sheer force yet i was not afraid of that i rejoiced in it i wanted to give myself up to it but the next moment martin had dropped me and fled from the room clashing the door behind him i felt as if a part of myself had been torn from my breast and had gone out with him the room seemed to become dark sixtyninth chapter for a moment i stood where martin had left me throbbing through and through like an open wound telling myself that he had gone that i should never see him again and that i had driven him away from me those passionate kisses had deprived me of the power of consecutive thought i could only feel and the one thing i felt above everything else was that the remedy i had proposed to myself for my unhappy situationrenunciationwas impossible because martin was a part of my own being and without him i could not live martin martin my love my love cried the voice of my heart in fear lest i had spoken the words aloud and in terror of what i might do under the power of them i hurried into my bedroom and locked and bolted the door but the heart knows nothing of locks and bolts and a moment afterwards my spirit was following martin to his room i was seeing him as i had seen him last with his face full of despair and i was accusing myself of the pain i had caused him i had conquered martin but i had conquered myself also i had compelled him to submit but his submission had vanquished me even if i had a right to impose renunciation on myself what right had i to impose it upon him who did not desire it did not think it necessary was not reconciled to it and only accepted it out of obedience to my will he loved me no man ever loved a woman more dearly he deserved to be loved in return he had done nothing to forfeit love he was bound by no ties and yet i was driving him away from me what right had i to do so i began to see that i had acted throughout with the most abominable selfishness in his great love he had said little or nothing about himself but why had i not thought of him in the struggles of my religious conscience i had been thinking of myself alone but martin had been suffering too and i had never once really thought of that what right had i to make him suffer after a while i began to prepare for bed but it took me long to undress for i stopped every moment to think i thought of the long years martin had been waiting for me and while i was telling myself that he had kept pure for my sake my heart was beating so fast that i could hardly bear the strain of it it cut me still deeper to think that even as there had been no other woman for him in the past so there would be no other in the future never as long as he lived i was as sure of that as of the breath i breathed and when i remembered what he had said about wearing the willow for me as if i were dead i was almost distracted his despairing words kept ringing mercilessly in my earsits all as one now how happy we might have been i wanted to go to him and tell him that though i was sending him away still i loved him and it was because i loved him that i was sending him away i had made one step towards the door before i remembered that it was too late to carry out my purpose the opportunity had passed martin had gone to his room he might even be in bed by this time but there are spiritual influences which control our bodies independently of our will i put on my dressinggown being partly undressed and went back to the boudoir i hardly knew what impulse impelled me to do so and neither do i know why i went from the boudoir to the balcony unless it was in hope of the melancholy joy of standing once more where martin and i had stood together a little while ago i was alone now the low thunder was still rolling along the cliffs but i hardly heard it the white sheet lightning was still pulsing in the sky and rising as it seemed out of the sea but i hardly saw it at one moment i caught a glimpse of a solitary fishing boat under its brown lugger sails heading towards blackwater at the next moment my eyes were dazzled as by a flashlight from some unseen battleship leaning over the balcony and gazing into the intermittent darkness i pictured to myself the barren desolation of martins life after he had left me loving me so much he might fall into some excess perhaps some vice and if that happened what would be the measure of my responsibility losing me he might lose his faith in god i had read of men becoming spiritual castaways after they had lost their anchorage in some great love and i asked myself what should i do if martin became an infidel and when i told myself that i could only save martins soul by sacrificing my own i was overwhelmed by a love so great that i thought i could do even that martin martin forgive me forgive me i cried i felt so hot that i opened my dressinggown to cool my bare breast after a while i began to shiver and then fearing i might take cold i went back to the boudoir and sat down i looked at my cuckoo clock it was halfpast twelve only half an hour since martin had left me it seemed like hours and hours what of the years and years of my life that i had still to spend without him the room was so terribly silent yet it seemed to be full of our dead laughter the ghost of our happiness seemed to haunt it i was sure i could never live in it again i wondered what martin would be doing now would he be in bed and asleep or sitting up like this and thinking of me as i was thinking of him at one moment i thought i heard his footsteps i listened but the sound stopped at another moment covering my face with my hands i thought i saw him in his room as plainly as if there were no walls dividing us he was holding out his hands to me and his face had the yearning loving despairing expression which it had worn when he looked back at me from the door at yet another moment i thought i heard him calling me mary i listened again but again all was still and when i told myself that if in actual fact he had spoken my name it was perhaps only to himself as i was speaking his my heart throbbed up to my throat once more i heard his voice mary i could bear no more martin wanted me i must go to him though body and soul were torn asunder i must go before i knew what i was doing i had opened the door and was walking across the corridor in the direction of martins room the house was dark everybody had gone to bed light as my footsteps were the landing was creaking under me i knew that the floors of the grim old castle sometimes made noises when nobody walked on them but none the less i felt afraid half way to martins door i stopped a ghostly hand seemed to be laid on my shoulder and a ghostly voice seemed to say in my ear wait reflect if you do what you are thinking of doing what will happen you will become an outcast the whole body of your own sex will turn against you you will be a bad woman i knew what it was it was my conscience speaking to me in the voice of my churchmy church the mighty irresistible power that was separating me from martin i was its child born in its bosom but if i broke its laws it would roll over me like a relentless juggernaut it was not at first that i could understand why the church should set itself up against my womanhood my womanhood was crying out for life and love and liberty but the church in its inexorable relentless voice was saying thou shalt not after a moment of impenetrable darkness within and without i thought i saw things more plainly the church was the soul of the world it stood for purity which alone could hold the human family together if all women who had made unhappy marriages were to do as i was thinking of doing no matter under what temptation the world would fall to wreck and ruin feeling crushed and ashamed and oh so little and weak i groped my way back to the boudoir and closed the door then a strange thing happenedone of those little accidents of life which seem to be thrown off by the mighty hand of fate a shaft of light from my bedroom crossing the end of my writingdesk showed me a copy of a little insular newspaper the paper which must have come by the evening post had probably been opened by martin and for that reason only i took it up and glanced at it the first thing that caught my eye was a short report headed charity performance it ran the english ladies and gentlemen from castle raa who are cruising round the island in the handsome steam yacht the cleopatra gave a variety entertainment last night in aid of the catholic mission at the palace ravenstown at the end of the performance the lord bishop who was present in person and watched every item of the programme with obvious enjoyment proposed a vote of thanks in his usual felicitous terms thanking lord raa for this further proof of his great liberality of mind in helping a catholic charity and particularly mentioning the beautiful and accomplished madame lier who had charmed all eyes and won all hearts by her serpentine dances and to whom the church in ellan would always be indebted for the handsome sum which had been the result of her disinterested efforts in promoting the entertainment it is understood that the cleopatra will leave ravenstown harbour tomorrow morning on her way back to port raa that was the end of everything it came upon me like a torrent and swept all my scruples away such was the purity of the churchthreatening me with its censures for wishing to follow the purest dictates of my heart yet taking money from a woman like alma who was bribing it to be blind to her misconduct and to cover her with its goodwill my husband toohis infidelities were flagrant and notorious yet the church through its minister was flattering his vanity and condoning his offences he was coming back to me toothis adulterous husband and when he came the church would require that i should keep true faith with him whatever his conduct and deny myself the pure love that was now awake within me but no no no never again it would be a living death accursed be the power that could doom a woman to a living death perhaps i was no longer sanemorally saneand if so god and the church will forgive me but seeing that neither the church nor the law could liberate me from this bond which i did not make that both were shielding the evil man and tolerating the bad woman my whole soul rose in revolt i told myself now that to leave my husband and go to martin would be to escape from shame to honour i saw martins despairing face again as i had seen it at the moment of our parting and my brain rang with his passionate words you are my wife i am your real husband we love each other we shall continue to love each other no matter where you are or what they do with you you are mine and always will be something was crying out within me love him tell him you love him now now he is going away tomorrow will be too late go to him this will be your true marriage the other was only legalised and sanctified prostitution i leapt up and tearing the door open i walked with strong steps across the corridor towards martins room my hair was down my arms were bare in the ample sleeves of my dressinggown and my breast was as open as it had been on the balcony but i thought nothing of all that i did not knock at martins door i took hold of the handle as one who had a right it turned of itself and the door opened my mind was in a whirl black rings were circling round my eyes but i heard my trembling quivering throbbing voice as if it had been the voice of somebody else saying martin i am coming in then my heart which had been beating violently seemed to stop my limbs gave way i was about to fall at the next moment strong arms were around me i had no fear but there was a roaring in my brain such as the ice makes when it is breaking up oh you good women who are happy in the love that guards you shields you shelters you wraps you round and keeps you pure and true tread lightly over the prostrate soul of your sister in her hour of trial and fierce temptation and you blessed and holy saints who kneel before the mother of all mothers take the transgression of her guilty child to him wholong ago in the house of the selfrighteous phariseesaid to the woman who was a sinner and yet loved muchthe woman who had washed his feet with her tears and dried them with the hair of her headthy sins are forgiven thee fifth part i become a mother seventieth chapter next morning at halfpast eight my martin left me we were standing together in the boudoir between the table and the fire which was burning briskly for the sultry weather had gone in the night and the autumn air was keen though the early sun was shining at the last moment he was unwilling to go and it was as much as i could do to persuade him perhaps it is one of the mysteries which god alone can read that our positions seemed to have been reversed since the day before he was confused agitated and full of self reproaches while i felt no fear and no remorse but only an indescribable joy as if a new and gracious life had suddenly dawned on me i dont feel that i can leave england now he said you can and you must i answered and then i spoke of his expedition as a great work which it was impossible to put off somebody else must do it then he said nobody else can or shall i replied but our lives are for ever joined together now and everything else must go by the board nothing shall go by the board for my sake martin i refuse and forbid it everything had been arranged everything settled great sums of money had been subscribed out of faith in him and him only and a large company was ready and waiting to sail under his command he was the man of destiny therefore nothingnothing whatevermust keep him back then if i must go you must go too he said i mean you must go with me to london and wait there until i return that is impossible i answered the eyes of the world were on him now and the heart of the world was with him if i did what he desired it would reflect dishonour on his name and he should not suffer for my sake under any circumstances but think what may happen to you while i am away he said nothing will happen while you are away martin but how can you be so sure of the future when god alone knows what it is to be then god will provide for it i said and with that last answer he had to be satisfied you must take a letter from me at all events said martin and sitting at my desk he began to write one it is amazing to me now when i come to think of it that i could have been so confident of myself and so indifferent to consequences but i was thinking of one thing onlythat martin must go on his great errand finish his great work and win his great reward without making any sacrifice for me after a few minutes he rose from the desk and handed me his letter here it is he said if the worst comes to the worst you may find it of some use some day i took it and doubled it and continued to hold it in my hand arent you going to look at it he said no not even to see whom it is written to that is unnecessary i thought i knew it was written to my husband or my father and it did not matter to me which for i had determined not to use it it is openwont you see what it says that is unnecessary also i thought i knew that martin had tried to take everything upon himself and i was resolved that he should not do so he looked at me with that worshipful expression which seen in the eyes of the man who loves her makes a woman proud to be alive i feel as if i want to kiss the hem of your dress mary he said and after that there was a moment of heavenly silence it was now halfpast eightthe hour when the motorcar had been ordered round to take him to the townand though i felt as if i could shed drops of my blood to keep back the finger of my cuckoo clock i pointed it out and said it was time for him to go i think our parting was the most beautiful moment of all my life we were standing a little apart for though i wanted to throw my arms about his neck at that last instant i would not allow myself to do so because i knew that that would make it the harder for him to go i could see too that he was trying not to make it harder for me so we stood in silence for a moment while my bosom heaved and his breath came quick then he took my right hand in both of his hands and said there is a bond between us now which can never be broken never i answered whatever happens to either of us we belong to each other for ever for ever and ever i replied i felt his hands tighten at that and after another moment of silence he said i may be a long time away mary i can wait down there a man has to meet many dangers you will come back providence will take care of you i think it will i feel i shall but if i dont i knew what he was trying to say a shadow seemed to pass between us my throat grew thick and for a moment i could not speak but then i heard myself say love is stronger than death many waters cannot quench it his hands quivered his whole body trembled and i thought he was going to clasp me to his breast as before but he only drew down my forehead with his hot hand and kissed it that was all but a blinding mist seemed to pass before my eyes and when it cleared the door of the room was open and my martin was gone i stood where he had left me and listened i heard his strong step on the stone flags of the hallhe was going out at the porch i heard the metallic clashing of the door of the automobilehe was already in the car i heard the throb of the motor and ruckling of the gravel of the pathhe was moving away i heard the dying down of the engine and the soft roll of the rubber wheelsi was alone for some moments after that the world seemed empty and void but the feeling passed and when i recovered my strength i found martins letter in my moist left hand then i knelt before the fire and putting the letter into the flames i burnt it seventyfirst chapter within two hours of martins departure i had regained complete possession of myself and was feeling more happy than i had ever felt before the tormenting compunctions of the past months were gone it was just as if i had obeyed some higher law of my being and had become a freer and purer woman my heart leapt within me and to give free rein to the riot of my joy i put on my hat and cloak to go into the glen crossing the garden i came upon tommy the mate who told me there had been a terrific thunderstorm during the night with torrential rain which had torn up all the foreign plants in his flowerbeds it will do good though said the old man clane out some of their dirty ould drains im thinkin then he spoke of martin whom he had seen off saying he would surely come back deed he will though a boy like yander wasnt born to lave his bark in the ice and snow not if his anchors at home anywaywith a glime in my direction how the glen sang to me that morning the great cathedral of nature seemed to ring with musicthe rustling of the leaves overhead the ticking of the insects underfoot the bleating of the sheep the lowing of the cattle the light chanting of the stream the deep organsong of the sea and then the swelling and soaring gloria in my own bosom which shot up out of my heart like a lark out of the grass in the morning i wanted to run i wanted to shout and when i came to the paths where martin and i had walked together i wantedsilly as it sounds to say soto go down on my knees and kiss the very turf which his feet had trod i took lunch in the boudoir as before but i did not feel as if i were alone for i had only to close my eyes and martin from the other side of the table seemed to be looking across at me and neither did i feel that the room was full of dead laughter for our living voices seemed to be ringing in it still after tea i read again my only loveletter revelling in the dear delightful errors in spelling which made it martins and nobody elses and then i observed for the first time what was said about the boys of blackwater and their intention of getting up a spree this suggested that perhaps martin had not yet left the island but was remaining for the evening steamer in order to be present at some sort of celebrations to be given in his honour so at seven oclockit was dark by that timei was down at the quay sitting in our covered automobile which had been drawn up in a sheltered and hidden part of the pier almost opposite the outgoing steamer shall i ever forget the scene that followed first came a band of music playing one of our native songs which was about a lamb that had been lost in the snow and how the big man of the farm went out in search of it and found it and brought it home in his arms then came a double row of young men carrying flags and bannersfine cleanlimbed lads such as make a womans heart leap to look at them then came martin in a jaunting car with a cheering crowd alongside of him trying to look cheerful but finding it fearfully hard to do so and thenand this touched me most of alla double line of girls in knitted woollen caps such as men wear in frozen regions over their heads and down the sides of their comely faces i was crying like a child at the sight of it all but none the less i was supremely happy when the procession reached the gangway martin disappeared into the steamer and then the bandsmen ranged themselves in front of it and struck up another song come back to erin mavourneen mavourneen come back aroon to the land of your birth in another moment every voice in the crowd seemed to take up the refrain that brought martin on to the captains bridge where he stood bareheaded struggling to smile by this time the last of the ships bells had rung the funnels were belching and the captains voice was calling on the piermen to clear away at last the hawsers were thrown off and the steamer started but with martin still standing bareheaded on the bridge the people rushed to the end of the pier to see the last of him there they sang again louder than ever the girls clear voices above all the rest as the ship sailed out into the dark sea come back to erin mavourneen mavourneen come back aroon to the land of your birth as well as i could for the mist in my eyes was blinding me i watched the steamer until she slid behind the headland of the bay round the revolving light that stands on the point of itstretching my neck through the window of the car while the fresh wind from the sea smote my hot face and the salt air licked my parched lips and then i fell back in my seat and cried for sheer joy of the love that was shown to martin the crowd was returning down the pier by this time like a black river running in the darkness and rumbling over rugged stones and i heard their voices as they passed the car one voicea female voicesaid well what do you think of our martin conrad and then another voicea male voiceanswered by god hes a man within a few minutes the pier was deserted and the chauffeur was saying home my lady home i answered seeing martin off had been too much like watching the lifeboat on a dark and stormy night when the lights dip behind a monstrous wave and for some breathless moments you fear they will never rise but as we drove up the head i caught the lights of the steamer again now far out at sea and well i knew that as surely as my martin was there he was thinking of me and looking back towards the house in which he had left me behind him when we reached the castle i found to my surprise that every window was ablaze the thrum of the automobile brought price into the hall she told me that the yachting party had come back and were now in their bedrooms dressing for dinner as i went upstairs to my own apartments i heard trills of laughter from behind several of the closed doors mingled with the muffled humming of various musichall ditties and then suddenly a new spirit seemed to take possession of me and i knew that i had become another woman memorandum by martin conrad my darling was right for a long hour after leaving blackwater i continued to stand on the captains bridge looking back at the lighted windows of the house above port raa and asking myself the question which for sixteen months thereafter was to haunt me day and nightwhy had i left her behind me in spite of all her importunities all her sweet unselfish thought of my own aims and interests all her confidence in herself all her brave determination to share responsibility for whatever the future might have in store for uswhy had i left her behind me the woman god gave me was minewhy had i left her in the house of a man who notwithstanding his infidelities and brutalities had a right in the eyes of the law the church and the world to call her his wife and to treat her accordingly let me make no pretence of a penitence i did not feel never for one moment did i reproach myself for what had happened never for the shadow of a moment did i reproach her she had given herself to me of her queenly right and sovereign grace as every good woman in the world must give herself to the man she loves if their union is to be pure and true but why did i not see then as i see now that it is the law of naturethe cruel and at the same time the glorious law of naturethat the woman shall bear the burden the woman shall pay the price it is over now and though many a time since my sweet girl has said out of her stainless heart that everything has worked out for the best and suffering is gods salt for keeping our souls alive when i think of what she went through for me while i was out of all reach and sight i know i shall never forgive myself for leaving her behindnever never never mc end of martin conrads memorandum seventysecond chapter as this will be the last time i shall have to speak of my husbands guests i wish to repeat that i am trying to describe them without malice exactly as they wereselfish cruel illmannered and insincere the dinnerbell rang while i was dressing and on going downstairs a few minutes afterwards i found that there had been no attempt to wait for me already the whole party were assembled at the table my husband being at the foot of it and alma incredible as it may seem in the place of the hostess at the head this in my altered mood was more than i could bear so while the company made some attempt to welcome me with rather crude salutations and old mrs lier cried come along here my pore dear and tell me how youve gotten on while weve been away indicating an empty seat by her side i walked boldly up to alma put my hand on the back of her chair and said if you please alma looked surprised but after a moment she carried off the difficult situation by taking the seat which had been reserved for me beside her mother by congratulating me on my improved appearance and herself on relief from the necessity of filling my place and discharging my responsible duties my husband with the rest of the company had looked up at the awkward incident and i thought i saw by his curious grimace that he supposed my father of whom he was always in fear had told me to assert myself but alma with surer instinct was clearly thinking of martin and almost immediately she began to speak of him so your great friend has just gone dearest the servants are crazy about him weve missed him again you see too bad i hope you gave him our regrets and excusesdid you the evil one must have taken hold of me by this time for i said i certainly did not alma why not my love because we have a saying in our island that its only the ass that eats the cushaga bitter weed that grows in barren places alma joined in the general laughter which followed this rather intemperate reply and then led off the conversation on the incidents of the cruise i gathered that encouraged by her success in capturing the bishop by her entertainment she had set herself to capture the aristocracy of our island by inviting them to a dance on the yacht while it lay at anchor off holmtown and the humour of the moment was to play battledore and shuttlecock with the grotesque efforts of our great people the same that had figured at my wedding to grovel before my husband and his guests i say jimmy cried mr vivian in his shrill treble do you remember the old gal in the gauze whoetc but do you remember cried mr eastcliff the high bailiff or bum bailiff with the bottlenose whoetc killing wasnt it vivian said one of the ladies perfectly killing said everybody this shocking exhibition of bad manners had not gone on very long before i became aware that it was being improvised for my benefit after alma had admitted that the bishop was a great flirt of hers and mr vivian amid shouts of laughter had christened him her crush she turned to me and said with her smiling face slightly drawn down on one side mary my love you will certainly agree that your islanders who do not eat cushags poor dears are the funniest people alive as guests not funnier i answered than the people who laugh at them as hosts it was not easy to laugh at that so to cover almas confusion the men turned the talk to their usual topic horses and dogs and i heard a great deal about laying on the hounds which culminated in a rather vulgar story of how a beater who wasnt nippy on his pins had been peppered from behind whereupon he had bellowed like a bull until soothed down by a sov i cannot say how long the talk would have continued in this manner if old mrs lier addressing herself to me had not struck a serious subject it was about almas dog which was dead the poor wheezy spaniel had died in the course of the cruise though what the cause of its death was nobody knew unless it had been fretting for its mistress during the period of quarantine which the absurd regulations of government had required on our return from abroad the dog having died at sea i presumed it had been buried there but no that seemed to shock the company as an unfeeling supposition the ships carpenter had made a coffin for ita beautiful one of mahogany with a plateglass inset at the head and a giltlettered inscription below giving the dogs name prue and its age three in this condition it had been brought ashore and was now lying in a kind of state in almas dressingroom but tomorrow it was to be buried in the grounds probably in the glen to which the company all dressed in black were to follow in procession as at a human funeral i was choking with anger and horror at the recital of these incredible arrangements and at the close of it i said in a clear emphatic voice i must ask you to be good enough not to do that please why not my dear said alma because i do not wish and cannot permit it i answered there was an awkward pause after this unexpected pronouncement and when the conversation was resumed my quick ears which have not always added to my happiness caught the halfsmothered words getting a bit sidey isnt she nevertheless when i rose to leave the diningroom alma wound her arm round my waist called me her dear little nun and carried me off to the hall there we sat about the big open fire and after a while the talk became as free as it often is among fashionable ladies of a certain class mr eastcliffs camilla told a slightly indelicate anecdote of a dresser she had had at the theatre and then another young woman the same who adored the men who went to the deuce for a woman repeated the terms of an advertisement she had seen in a church newspaper a parlourmaid wants a situation in a family where a footman is kept the laughter which followed this story was loud enough but it was redoubled when almas mother from the depths of an armchair said with her usual solemnity that she didnt see nothing to laugh at in that and the pore girl hadnt no such thought as they had again i was choking with indignation and in order to assert myself once for all i said ladies i will ask you to discontinue this kind of conversation i dont like it at last the climax came about ten days after martin left me i received a telegram which had been put ashore at southampton saying goodbye god bless you and next day there came a newspaper containing an account of his last night at tilbury he had given a dinner to a number of his friends including his old commander and his wife several other explorers who happened to be in london a cabinet minister and the proprietor of the journal which had promoted his expedition they had dined in the saloon of the scotia how vividly i remembered it finishing up the evening with a dance on deck in the moonlight and when the time came to break up martin had made one of his sentimental little speeches all heart and not too much grammar in which he said that in starting out for another siege of the south pole he couldnt help thinking with a bit of a pain under the third button of his doublebreasted waistcoat of the dear ones they were leaving behind and of the unknown regions whither they were tending where dancing would be forgotten i need not say how this moved me being where i was in that uncongenial company but by some mischance i left the paper which contained it on the table in the drawingroom and on going downstairs after breakfast next morning i found alma stretched out in a rockingchair before the fire in the hail smoking a cigarette and reading the report aloud in a mock heroic tone to a number of the men including my husband whose fat body he was growing corpulent was shaking with laughter it was as much as i could do to control an impulse to jump down and flare out at them but being lightly shod i was standing quietly in their midst before they were aware of my presence ah said alma with the sweetest and most insincere of her smiles we were just enjoying the beautiful account of your friends last night in england so i see i said and boiling with anger underneath i quietly took the paper out of her hand between the tips of my thumb and first finger as if the contamination of her touch had made it unclean and carried it to the fire and burnt it this seemed to be the end of all things the tall mr eastcliff went over to the open door and said deuced fine day for a motor drive isnt it that gentleman had hitherto shown no alacrity in establishing the truth of almas excuse for the cruise on the ground of his visit to his friend who had taken a shoot in skye but now he found himself too deeply interested in the inverness meeting to remain longer while the rest of the party became so absorbed in the perth and ayr races salmonfishing on the tay and stagshooting in the deerforests of invercauld that within a week thereafter i had said goodbye to all of them all save alma i was returning from the hall after the departure of a group of my guests when alma followed me to my room and said my dear sweet girl i want you to do me the greatest kindness she had to take her mother to new york shortly but as that dear old dunce was the worst of all possible sailors it would be necessary to wait for the largest of all possible steamers and as the largest steamers sailed from liverpool and ellan was so near to that port perhaps i would not mind just for a week or two longer what could i say what i did say was what i had said before with equal weakness and indiscretion but less than equal danger a word half a word and almost before it was spoken almas arms were about my neck and she was calling me her dearest sweetest kindest friend in the world my maid price was present at this interview and hardly had alma left the boudoir when she was twitching at my arm and whispering in my ear my lady my lady dont you see what the woman wants shes watching you seventythird chapter my husband was the next to go he made excuse of his parliamentary duties he might be three or four weeks away but meantime alma would be with me and in any case i was not the sort of person to feel lonely never having heard before of any devotion to his duty as a peer i asked if that was all that was taking him to london perhaps not all he answered and then with a twang of voice and a twitch of feature he said im getting sick of this godforsaken place and then to tell you the truth your own behaviour is beginning to raw me with my husbands departure my triumphal course seemed to come to a close left alone with alma i became as weak and irresolute as before and began to brood upon prices warning my maid had found a fierce delight in my efforts to assert myself as mistress in my husbands house but now taking her former advantage she was for ever harping upon my foolishness in allowing alma to remain in it shes deceiving you my lady said price her waiting for a steamer indeed not a bit of her if your ladyship will not fly out at me again and pack me off bag and baggage ill tell you whats shes waiting for what shes waiting for she thinks she fancies well to tell you the honest truth my lady the badminded thing suspects that something is going to happen to your ladyship and shes just waiting for the chance of telling his lordship i began to feel ill a dim vague uneasy presentiment of coming trouble took frequent possession of my mind i tried to suppress it i struggled to strangle it as an ugly monster created by the nervous strain i had been going through and for a time i succeeded in doing so i had told martin that nothing would happen during his absence and i compelled myself to believe that nothing would or could weeks passed the weather changed the golden hue of autumn gave place to a chilly greyness the sky became sad with winterly clouds the land became soggy with frequent rains the trees showed their bare black boughs the withered leaves drifted along the roads before blustering winds that came up from the sea the evenings grew long and the mornings dreary but still alma with her mother remained at castle raa i began to be afraid of her something of the halfhypnotic spell which she had exercised over me when i was a child asserted itself again but now it seemed to me to be always evil and sometimes almost demoniacal i had a feeling that she was watching me day and night occasionally when she thought i was looking down i caught the vivid gaze of her coalblack eyes looking across at me through her long sablecoloured eyelashes her conversation was as sweet and suave as ever but i found myself creeping away from her and even shrinking from her touch more than once i remembered what martin in his blunt way had said of her i hate that woman shes like a snake i want to put my foot on it the feeling that i was alone in this great gaunt house with a woman who was waiting and watching to do me a mischief that she might step into my shoes was preying upon my health and spirits sometimes i had sensations of faintness and exhaustion for which i could not account looking into my glass in the morning i saw that my nose was becoming pinched my cheeks thin and my whole face not merely pale but grey alma saw these changes in my appearance and in the oversweet tones of her succulent voice she constantly offered me her sympathy i always declined it protesting that i was perfectly well but none the less i shrank within myself and became more and more unhappy so fierce a strain could not last very long and the climax came about three weeks after my husband had left for london i was rising from breakfast with alma and her mother when i was suddenly seized with giddiness and after staggering for a moment i fainted right away on recovering consciousness i found myself stretched out on the floor with alma and her mother leaning over me never to the last hour of my life shall i forget the look in almas eyes as i opened my own with her upper lip sucked in and her lower one slightly set forward she was giving her mother a quick sideglance of evil triumph i was overwhelmed with confusion i thought i might have been speaking as i was coming to mentioning a name perhaps out of that dim and sacred chamber of the unconscious soul into which god alone should see i noticed too that my bodice had been unhooked at the back so as to leave it loose over my bosom as soon as alma saw that my eyes were open she put her arm under my head and began to pour out a flood of honeyed words into my ears my dear sweet darling she said you scared us to death we must send for a doctor immediatelyyour own doctor you know i tried to say there was no necessity but she would not listen such a seizure may be of no consequence my love i trust it isnt but on the other hand it may be a serious matter and it is my duty dearest my duty to your husband to discover the cause of it i knew quite well what alma was thinking of yet i could not say more without strengthening her suspicions so i asked for price who helped me up to my room where i sat on the edge of the bed while she gave me brandy and other restoratives that was the beginning of the end i needed no doctor to say what had befallen me it was something more stupendous for me than the removal of mountains or the stopping of the everlasting coming and going of the sea the greatest of the mysteries of womanhood the most sacred the most divine the mighty mystery of a new life had come to me as it comes to other women yet how had it come like a lowering thunderstorm that golden hour of her sex which ought to be the sweetest and most joyful in a womans lifethe hour when she goes with a proud and swelling heart to the one she loves the one who loves her and with her arms about his neck and her face hidden in his breast whispers her great new secret and he clasps her more fondly than ever to his heart because another and closer union has bound them togetherthat golden hour had come to me and there was none to share it o god o god how proudly i had been holding up my head how i had been trampling on the conventions of morality the canons of law and even the sacraments of religion thinking nature which had made our hearts what they are did not mean a woman to be ashamed of her purest instincts and now nature herself had risen up to condemn me and before long the whole world would be joining in her cry if martin had been there at that moment i do not think i should have cared what people might think or say of a woman in my condition but he was separated from me by this time by thousands of miles of sea and was going deeper and deeper every day into the dark antarctic night how weak i felt how little how helpless never for a moment did i blame martin but i was alone with my responsibility i was still living in my husbands house andworst of allanother woman knew my secret seventyfourth chapter early next day doctor conrad came to see me i thought it significant that he came in my fathers big motorcara car of great speed and power i was in my dressinggown before the fire in the boudoir and at the first glance of his cheerful face under his irongrey head i knew what alma had said in the letter which had summoned him in his soft voice he asked me a few questions and though i could have wished to conceal the truth i dared not i noticed that his face brightened at each of my replies and at the end of them he said there is nothing to be alarmed at we shall be better than ever byandby then in his sweet and delicate way as if he were saying something that would be very grateful he told me what i knew already and i listened with my head down and my face towards the fire he must have been disappointed at the sad way i received his news for he proceeded to talk of my general health saying the great thing in such a case as mine was to be cheerful to keep a good heart and to look hopefully to the future you must have pleasant surroundings and the society of agreeable peopleold friends old schoolfellows familiar and happy faces i said yes and yes knowing only too well how impossible it all was and then his talk turned on general topicsmy father whose condition made his face very grave and then his wife christian ann whose name caused his gentle old eyes to gleam with sunshine she had charged him with a message to me tell her she had said i shall never forget what she did for me in the autumn and whiles and whiles im thanking god for her that cut me to the quick but i was nearly torn to pieces by what came next christian ann told me to say too that sunny lodge is longing for you shes a great lady now said she but maybe great ladies have their troubles same as ourselves poor things and if she ever wants to rest her sweet head in a poor womans bed mary oneills little room is always waiting for her god bless her i saidit was all i could sayand then to my great relief he talked on other subjects the one thing i was afraid of was that he might speak of martin heaven alone which looks into the deep places of a womans heart in her hour of sorest trial knows why i was in such dread that he might do so but sure i am that if he had mentioned martin at that moment i should have screamed when he rose to go he repeated his warnings youll remember what i said about being bright and cheerful ill try and keeping happy and agreeable faces about you yes hardly had he left the room when alma came sweeping into it full of i her warmest and insincerest congratulations there she cried with all the bitter honey of her tongue wasnt i right in sending for the doctor such news too oh happy happy you but i must not keep you now dearest youll be just crazy to write to your husband and tell him all about it almas mother was the next to visit me the comfortable old soul redolent of perfume and glittering with diamonds began by congratulating herself on her perspicacity i knew it she said when i saw as how you were so and so i said to alma as i was sure you were that way impossible said alma but its us married women to know isnt it after that and some homely counsel out of her own experienceto take my breakfast in bed in future avoiding tea cshe told me how fortunate i was to have alma in the house at such a moment the doctor says youre to be kept bright and cheerful and shes such a happy heart is alma so crazy about you too you wouldnt believe it but shes actually talking of staying with you until the december sailing at all events the prospect of having alma two months longer to probe my secret soul as with a redhot iron seemed enough to destroy me but my martyrdom had only begun next day aunt bridget came and the bright glitter of the usually cold grey eyes behind her goldrimmed spectacles told me at a glance that her visit was not an unselfish one there now she said youve got to thank me for this didnt i give you good advice when i told you to be a little blind its the only way with husbands when conrad came home with the news i said betsy i must get away to the poor girl straight to be sure i had enough on my hands already but i couldnt leave you to strangers could i hearing no response to this question aunt bridget went on to say that what was coming would be a bond between me and my husband it always is it was in my case anyway the old colonel didnt behave very well after our marriage and times and times i was telling myself i had made a rue bargain but when betsy came i thought i might have done better but i might have done worse and hes the father of my offspring anyway hearing no response to this either aunt bridget went on to talk of alma and her mother was not this the woman i suspected with my husbandthe young one with the big eyes and the quality toss with her then why did i have a person like that about the house if you need bright and cheerful company whats amiss with your aunt and your first cousin some people are selfish but i thank the saints i dont know what selfishness is im willing to do for you what i did for your poor mother and i cant say more than that can i i must have made some kind of response for aunt bridget went on to say it might be a sacrifice but then she wouldnt be sorry to leave the big house either im twenty years there and now im to be a servant to my own stepchild dear heart knows if i can bear it much longer the way that nessy is carrying on with your father is something shocking i do believe shell marry the man some day to escape from a painful topic i asked after my fathers health worse and worse but conrads news was like laughinggas to the man he would have come with me today but the doctor wouldnt hear of it hell come soon though and meantime hes talking and talking about a great entertainment entertainment to celebrate the forthcoming event of course though nobody is to know that except ourselves it seems just a housewarming in honour of your coming home after your marriagethats all its to be on the outside anyway i made some cry of pain and aunt bridget said oh i know what youre going to saywhy doesnt he wait ill tell you why if youll promise not to whisper a word to any one your father is a sick man my dear let him say what he likes when conrad talks about cancer he knows deaths hand is over him and thinking it may fall before your time has come he wants to take time by the forelock and see a sort of fulfilment of the hope of his lifeand you know what that is it was terrible the position in which i stood towards my father was now so tragic that wicked as it was i prayed with all my heart that i might never look upon his face again i was compelled to do so three days after aunt bridgets visit my father came to see me the day was fine and i was walking on the lawn when his big car came rolling up the drive i was shocked to see the change in him his face was ghastly white his lips were blue his massive and powerful head seemed to have sunk into his shoulders and his limbs were so thin that his clothes seemed to hang on them but the stern mouth was there still and so was the masterful lift of the eyebrows coming over to meet me with an uncertain step he said old conrad was for keeping me in bed but i couldnt take rest without putting a sight on you after that and some plain speech out of the primitive man he always was and will be about its being good for a woman to have children because it saved her from losing her stomach over imaginary grievances he led me with the same halfcontemptuous tenderness which he used to show to my mother back to the house and into the drawingroom alma and her mother were there the one writing at a desk the other knitting on the sofa and they rose as my father entered but he waved them back to their places set down maam take your seat mother im only here for a minute to talk to my gel about her great reception reception said alma hasnt she told you about it he said and being answered that i had not he gave a rough outline of his project whereupon alma whose former attitude towards my father had changed to one of flattery and subservience lifted her hands and cried how splendid such an inspiration only think my love you were to be kept bright and cheerful and what could be better for that purpose in the torment of my soul i urged one objection after anotherit would be expensive we could not afford it who asks you to afford it its my affair isnt it said my father i was unwell and therefore unable to undertake the hard work of such an entertainmentbut that was the worst of excuses for alma jumped in with an offer of assistance my dearest child she said you know how happy i shall be to help you in fact ill do all the work and you shall have all the glory there you are then cried my father slapping me on the shoulder and then turning to alma he told her to set to work without a days delay let everything be done correct even if it costs me a bit of money yes sir a rael big thing maam such as nobody has ever seen before yes indeed sir ask all the big people on the islandnessy macleod shall send you a list of them i will sir thatll do for the presenti guess i must be going now or old conrad will be agate of me so long gel so long i was silenced i was helpless i was ashamed i did not know then what now i know that besides the desire of celebrating the forthcoming birth of an heir my father had another and still more secret objectthat of throwing dust in the eyes of his advocates bankers and insular councillors who having expected him to make money for them by magic were beginning to whisper that all was not well with his financial schemes i did not know then what now i know that my father was at that moment the most tragic figure in ellan except myself and that shattered in health and shaken in fortune he was indulging in this wild extravagance equally to assert his solvency and to gratify his lifelong passion under the very wing of death but oh my wild woe my frantic prayers it was almost as if satan himself were torturing me the one terror of the next few days was that my husband might return home for i knew that at the first moment of his arrival the whole world of makebelieve which my father and alma were setting up around me would tumble about my head like a pack of cards he did not come but he wrote after saying that his political duties would keep him in london a little longer he said i hear that your father is getting you to give a great reception in honour of our homecoming but why now instead of three months ago do you know the reason as i read these last words i felt an icy numbness creeping up from my feet to my heart my position was becoming intolerable the conviction was being forced upon me that i had no right in my husbands house it made no difference that my husbands house was mine also in the sense that it could not exist without mei had no right to be there it made no difference that my marriage had been no marriagei had no right to be there it made no difference that the man i had married was an utterly bad husbandi had no right to be there it made no difference that i was not really an adulterous wifei had no right to be there meanwhile price my maid but my only real friend in castle raa with the liberty i allowed her was unconsciously increasing my torture every night as she combed out my hair she gave me her opinion of my attitude towards alma and one night she said didnt i tell you she was only watching you my lady the nastyminded thing is making mischief with his lordship shes writing to him every day how do i know oh i dont keep my eyes and my ears open downstairs for nothing youll have no peace of your life my lady until you turn that woman out of the house then in a fit of despair hardly knowing what i was doing i covered my face with my hands and said i had better turn myself out instead perhaps the combing of my hair suddenly stopped and at the next moment i heard price saying in a voice which seemed to come from a long way off goodness gracious me is it like that my lady seventyfifth chapter alma was as good as her word she did everything without consulting mefixed the date of the reception for a month after the day of my fathers visit and sent out invitations to all the insular gentry included in the lists which came from nessy macleod in her stiff and formal handwriting these lists came morning after morning until the invitations issued reached the grand total of five hundred as the rooms of the castle were not large enough to accommodate so many guests alma proposed to erect a temporary pavilion my father agreed and within a week hundreds of workmen from blackwater were setting up a vast wooden structure in the form of the colosseum on the headlands beyond the garden where martin and i had walked together while the work went on my fathers feverish pride seemed to increase i heard of messages to alma saying that no money was to be spared the reception was to surpass in grandeur any fete ever held in ellan not knowing what high stakes my father was playing for i was frightened by this extravagance and from that cause alone i wished to escape from the sight of it i could not escape i felt sure that alma hated me with an implacable hatred and that she was trying to drive me away thinking that would be the easiest means to gain her own ends for this reason among others the woman in me would not let me fly so i remained and went through a purgatory of suffering price too who had reconciled herself to my revelation was always urging me to remain saying why should you go my lady you are your husbands wife arent you fight it out i say ladies do so every day why shouldnt you before long the whole island seemed to be astir about our reception every day the insular newspapers devoted columns to the event giving elaborate accounts of what limitless wealth could accomplish for a single nights entertainment in these descriptions there was much eulogy of my father as the uncrowned king of ellan as well as praise of alma who was displaying such daring originality but little or no mention of myself nevertheless everybody seemed to understand the inner meaning of the forthcoming reception and in the primitive candour of our insular manners some of the visits i received were painfully embarrassing one of the first to come was my fathers advocate mr curphy who smiled his usual bland smile and combed his long beard while he thanked me for acting on his advice not to allow a fit of pique to break up a marriage which was so suitable from points of property and position how happy your father must be to see the fulfilment of his hopes he said just when his health is failing him too how good how gratifying the next to come was the bishop who smooth and suave as ever congratulated me on putting aside all thoughts of divorce so that the object of my marriage might be fulfilled and a good catholic become the heir of castle raa more delicate but also more distressing was a letter from father dan saying he had been forbidden my husbands house and therefore could not visit me but having heard an angels whisper of the sweet joy that was coming to me he prayed the lord and his holy mother to carry me safely through i have said a rosary for you every day since you were here my dear child that you might be saved from a great temptation and now i know you have been and the sacrament of your holy marriage has fulfilled its mission as i always knew it would so god bless you my daughter and keep you pure and fit for eternal union with that blessed saint your mother whom the lord has made his own more than ever after this letter i felt that i must fly from my husbands house but thinking of alma my wounded pride my outraged vanity as i say the woman in me would not let me go three weeks passed the pavilion had been built and was being hung with gaily painted bannerets to give the effect of the colosseum as seen at sunset a covered corridor connecting the theatre with the house was being lined with immense hydrangeas and lit from the roof by lamps that resembled stars a few days before the day fixed for the event alma who had been too much occupied to see me every day in the boudoir to which i confined myself came up to give me my instructions the entertainment was to begin at ten oclock i was to be dressed as cleopatra and to receive my guests in the drawingroom at the sound of a fanfare of trumpets i was to go into the theatre preceded by a line of pages and accompanied by my husband after we had taken our places in a private box a great ballet brought specially from a london musichall was to give a performance lasting until midnight then there was to be a cotillon led by alma herself with my husband and after supper the dancing was to be resumed and kept up until sunrise when a basketful of butterflies and doves sent from the south of france were to be liberated from cages and to rise in a multicoloured cloud through the sunlit space i was sick and ashamed when i thought of this vain and gaudy scene and the object which i supposed it was intended to serve the end of it all was that i wrote to my father concealing the real cause of my suffering but telling him he could not possibly be aware of what was being done in his name and with his money and begging him to put an end to the entertainment altogether the only answer i received was a visit from nessy macleod i can see her still as she came into my room the tall gaunt figure with red hair and irregular features cousin mary she said seating herself stiffly on the only stiffbacked chair and speaking in an impassive tone your letter has been received but your father has not seen it his health being such as makes it highly undesirable that he should be disturbed by unnecessary worries i answered with some warmth that my letter had not been unnecessary but urgent and important and if she persisted in withholding it from my father i should deliver it myself cousin mary said nessy i know perfectly what your letter is having opened and read it and while i am as little as yourself in sympathy with what is going on here i happen to know that your father has set his heart on this entertainment and therefore i do not choose that it shall be put off i replied hotly that in opening my letter to my father she had taken an unwarrantable liberty and then losing myself a little i asked her by what right did she who had entered my fathers house as a dependent dare to keep his daughters letter from him cousin mary said nessy in the same impassive tone you were always selfwilled selfish and most insulting as a child and i am sorry to see that neither marriage nor education at a convent has chastened your ungovernable temper but i have told you that i do not choose that you shall injure your fathers health by disturbing his plans and you shall certainly not do so then take care i answered that in protecting my fathers health you do not destroy it altogether in spite of her cold and savourless nature she understood my meaning for after a moment of silence she said cousin mary you may do exactly as you please your conduct in the future whatever it may be will be no affair of mine and i shall not consider that i am in any way responsible for it at last i began to receive anonymous letters they came from various parts of ellan and appeared to be in different handwritings some of them advised me to fly from the island and others enclosed a list of steamers sailings only a woman who has been the victim of this species of cowardly torture can have any idea of the shame of it and again and again i asked myself if i ought not to escape from my husbands house before he returned but price seemed to find a secret joy in the anonymous letters saying she believed she knew the source of them and one evening towards the end she came running into my room with a shawl over her head a look of triumph in her face and an unopened letter in her hand there she said its all up with madame now youve got the game in your own hands my lady and can send them all packing the letter was addressed to my husband in london price had seized the arm of almas maid in the act of posting it and under threat of the law not to speak of instant personal chastisement the girl had confessed that both this letter and others had been written by our housekeeper under the inspiration of her mistress without any compunction price broke the seal of the intercepted letter and read it aloud to me it was a shocking thing accusing me with martin and taunting my husband with the falseness of the forthcoming entertainment feeling too degraded to speak i took the letter in silence out of my maids hands and while i was in the act of locking it away in a drawer alma came up with a telegram from my husband saying he was leaving london by the early train the following morning and would arrive at blackwater at halfpast three in the afternoon dear old jimmy she said what a surprise you have in store for him but of course youve told him already havent you no ah i see youve been saving it all up to tell him face to face oh happy happy you it was too late to leave now the hour of my trial had come there was no possibility of escape it was just as if satan had been holding me in the net of my sin so that i could not fly away at three oclock next day which was the day before the day fixed for the reception i heard the motorcar going off to meet my husband at blackwater at four oclock i heard it return a few minutes afterwards i heard my husbands voice in the hall i thought he would come up to me directly but he did not do so and i did not attempt to go down when after a while i asked what had become of him i was told that he was in the library with alma and that they were alone two hours passed to justify and fortify myself i thought how badly my husband had behaved to me i remembered that he had married me from the most mercenary motives that he had paid off his mistress with the money that came through me that he had killed by cruelty the efforts i had made to love him that he had humiliated me by gross infidelities committed on my honeymoon i recalled the scenes in rome the scenes in paris and the insults i had received under my own roof it was all in vain whether god means it that the womans fault in breaking her marriage vows whatever her sufferings and excuse shall be greater than that of the man i do not know i only know that i was trembling like a prisoner before her judge when being dressed for dinner and waiting for the sound of the bell i heard my husbands footsteps approach my door i was standing by the fire at that moment and i held on to the mantelpiece as my husband came into the room seventysixth chapter he was very pale the look of hardness almost of brutality which pierced his manner at normal moments had deepened and i could see at a glance that he was nervous his monocle dropped of itself from his slow grey eyes and the white fat fingers which replaced it trembled without shaking hands or offering any other sort of salutation he plunged immediately into the matter that was uppermost in his mind i am still at a loss to account for this affair of your fathers he said of course i know what it is supposed to bea reception in honour of our homecoming that explanation may or may not be sufficient for these stupid islanders but its rather too thin for me can you tell me what your father means by it i knew he knew what my father meant so i said trembling like a sheep that walks up to a barking dog hadnt you better ask that question of my father himself perhaps i should if he were here but he isnt so i ask you your father is a strange man theres no knowing what crude things he will not do to gratify his primitive instincts but he does not spend five or ten thousand pounds for nothing he isnt a fool exactly thank you i said i could not help it it was forced out of me my husband flinched and looked at me then the bully in him which always lay underneath came uppermost look here mary he said i came for an explanation and i intend to have one your father may give this affair what gloss he pleases but you must know as well as i do what rumour and report are saying so we might as well speak plainly is it the fact that the doctor has made certain statements about your own condition and that your father is giving this entertainment because well because he is expecting an heir to my husbands astonishment i answered yes so you admit it then perhaps youll be good enough to tell me how that condition came about knowing he needed no explanation i made no answer cant you speak he said but still i remained silent you know what our relations have been since our marriage so i ask you again how does that condition come about i was now trembling more than ever but a kind of forced courage came to me and i said why do you ask you seem to know already i know what anonymous letters have told me if thats what you mean but im your husband and have a right to know from you how does your condition come about i ask you i cannot say what impulse moved me at that moment unless it was the desire to make a clean breast and an end of everything but stepping to my desk i took out of a drawer the letter which price had intercepted and threw it on the table he took it up and read it with the air of one to whom the contents were not news and then asked how i came by it it was taken out of the hands of a woman who was in the act of posting it i said she confessed that it was one of a number of such letters which had been inspired if not written by your friend alma my friend alma yes your friend alma his face assumed a frightful expression and he said so thats how it is to be is it in spite of the admission you have just made you wish to imply that this holding out the letter is a trumpedup affair and that alma is at the bottom of it youre going to brazen it out are you and shelter your condition under your position as a married woman i was so taken by surprise by this infamous suggestion that i could not speak to deny it and my husband went on to say but it doesnt matter a rush to me who is at the bottom of the accusation contained in this letter theres only one thing of any consequenceis it true my head was reeling my eyes were dim my palms were moist i felt as if i were throwing myself over a precipice but i answered it is perfectly true i think that was the last thing he expected after a moment he said then you have broken your marriage vowsis that it yes if you call it so call it so call it so good heavens what do you call it i did not reply and after another moment he said but perhaps you wish me to understand that this man whom i was so foolish as to invite to my house abused my hospitality and betrayed my wife is that what you mean no i said he observed the laws of hospitality much better than you did and if i am betrayed i betrayed myself i shall never forget the look with which my husband received this confession he drew himself up with the air of an injured man and said what you mean that you yourself deliberately good god he stopped for a moment and then said with a rush i suppose youve not forgotten what happened at the time of our marriage your resistance and the ridiculous compact i submitted to why did i submit because i thought your innocence your conventbred ideas and your ignorance of the first conditions of matrimony but ive been fooled for you now tell me after all my complacency that you have deliberately in the name of god do you know what you are theres only one name for a woman who does what youve done do you want me to tell you what that name is i was quivering with shame but my mind which was going at lightning speed was thinking of london of cairo of rome and of paris why dont you speak he cried lifting his voice in his rage dont you understand what a letter like this is calling you my heart choked but the thought that came to methat bad as his own life had been he considered he had a right to treat me in this way because he was a man and i was a womanbrought strength out of my weakness so that when he went on to curse my church and my religion saying this was all that had come of the mummery of my masses i fired up for a moment and said you can spare yourself these blasphemies if i have done wrong it is i and not my church that is to blame for it if you have done wrong he cried damn it have you lost all sense of a womans duty to her husband while you have been married to me and i have been fool enough not to claim you as a wife because i thought you were only fit company for the saints and angels you have been prostituting yourself to this blusterer this that is a lie i said stepping up to him in the middle of the floor its true that i am married to you but he is my real husband and you you are nothing to me at all my husband stood for a moment with his mouth agape then he began to laughloudly derisively mockingly nothing to you am i you dont mind bearing my name though and when your time comes youll expect it to cover your disgrace his face had become shockingly distorted he was quivering with fury thats not the worst either he cried its not enough that you should tell me to my face that somebody else is your real husband but you must shunt your spurious offspring into my house isnt that what it all comes to all this damnable fuss of your fathers that you are going to palm off on me and my name and family your own and this mans bastard and with the last word in the drunkenness of his rage he lifted his arm and struck me with the back of his hand across the cheek the physical shock was fearful but the moral infamy was a hundredfold worse i can truly say that not alone for myself did i suffer when my mind still going at lightning speed thought of martin who loved me so tenderly i felt crushed by my husbands blow to the lowest depths of shame i must have screamed though i did not know it for at the next moment price was in the room and i saw that the housekeeper drawn perhaps as before by my husbands loud voice was on the landing outside the door but even that did not serve to restrain him no matter he said after what has passed you may not enjoy tomorrows ceremony but you shall go through it by heaven you shall and when it is over i shall have something to say to your father and with that he swung out of the room and went lunging down the stairs i was still standing in the middle of the floor with the blow from my husbands hand tingling on my cheek when price after clashing the door in the face of the housekeeper said with her black eyes ablaze well if ever i wanted to be a man before today news of the scene went like wildfire through the house and almas mother came to comfort me in her crude and blundering way she told me of a similar insult she had suffered at the hands of the bad lord raa and how it had been the real reason of her going to america us married ladies have much to put up with but cheer up dearie i guess youll have gotten over it by tomorrow morning when she was gone i sat down before the fire i did not cry i felt as if i had reached a depth of suffering that was a thousand fathoms too deep for tears i do not think i wept again for many months afterwards and then it was a great joy not a great grief that brought me a burst of blessed tears but i could hear my dear good price crying behind me and when i said now you see for yourself that i cannot remain in this house any longer she answered in a low voice yes my lady i must go at oncetonight if possible you shall leave everything to me my lady seventyseventh chapter the bell rang but of course i did not go down to dinner as soon as price had gone off to make the necessary arrangements i turned the key in the lock of my door removed my evening gown and began to dress for my flight my brain was numb but i did my best to confront the new situation that was before me hitherto i had been occupied with the problem of whether i should or should not leave my husbands house now i had to settle the question of where i was to go to i dared not think of home for nessy macleod and aunt bridget apart the house of my father was the last place i could fly to at a moment when i was making dust and ashes of his lifelong expectations neither dared i think of sunny lodge although i remembered with a tug of tenderness christian anns last message about mary oneills little room that was always waiting for mefor i thought of how i had broken my pledge to her the only place i could think of was that which martin had mentioned when he wished to carry me awaylondon in the mighty world of london i might hide myself from observation and wait until martin returned from his expedition yes yes london i told myself in my breathless excitement little knowing what london meant i began to select the clothes i was to carry with me and to wear on my journey they must be plain for i had to escape from a house in which unfriendly eyes would be watching me they must be durable for during my time of waiting i expected to be poor i hunted out some of the quakerlike costumes which had been made for me before my marriage and when i had put them on i saw that they made a certain deduction from my appearance but that did not matter to me nowthe only eyes i wished to look well in being down in the antarctic seas then i tried to think of practical mattershow i was to live in london and how in particular i was to meet the situation that was before me surely never did a more helpless innocent confront such a serious problem i was a woman and for more than a year i had been a wife but i had no more experience of the hard facts of material existence than a child i thought first of the bankbook which my father had sent me with authority to draw on his account but it was then nine oclock the banks were closed for the day and i knew enough of the world to see that if i attempted to cash a cheque in the morning my whereabouts would he traced that must never happen i must hide myself from everybody therefore my bankbook was useless quite useless i thought throwing it aside like so much waste paper i thought next of my jewels but there i encountered a similar difficulty the jewels which were really mine having been bought by myself had been gambled away by my husband at monte carlo what remained were the family jewels which had come to me as lady raa but that was a name i was never more to bear a person i was never more to think about so i could not permit myself to take anything that belonged to her the only thing left to me was my money i had always kept a good deal of it about me although the only use i had had for it was to put it in the plate at church and to scatter it with foolish prodigality to the boys who tossed somersaults behind the carriage in the road now i found it all over my roomin my purse in various drawers and on the toilettray under my dressingglass gathered together it counted up to twentyeight pounds i owed four pounds to price and having set them aside i saw that i had twentyfour pounds left in notes gold and silver being in the literal and unconventional sense utterly ignorant of the value of sixpence i thought this a great sum amply sufficient for all my needs or at least until i secured employmentfor i had from the first some vague idea of earning my own living martin would like that i told myself lifting my head with a thrill of pride then i began to gather up the treasures which were inexpressibly more dear to me than all my other possessions one of them was a little miniature of my mother which father dan had given me for a weddingpresent when as i know now he would rather have parted with his hearts blood another was a pearl rosary which the reverend mother had dropped over my arm the last time she kissed me on the forehead and the last was my martins misspelt loveletter which was more precious to me than rubies not for worlds i thought would i leave these behind me or ever part with them under any circumstances several times while i was busy with such preparations growing more and more nervous every moment price came on tiptoe and tapped softly at my door once it was to bring me some food and to tell me with many winks for the good soul herself was trembling with excitement that everything was as right as ninepence i should get away without difficulty in a couple of hours and until tomorrow morning nobody would be a penny the wiser fortunately it was thursday when a combined passenger and cargo steamer sailed to liverpool of course the motorcar would not be available to take me to the pier but tommy the mate who had a stiff cart in which he took his surplus products to market would be waiting for me at eleven oclock by the gate to the high road the people downstairs meaning my husband and alma and her mother were going off to the pavilion where hundreds of decorators were to work late and the orchestra and ballet were to have a rehearsal and they had been heard to say that they would not be back until way round about midnight but the servants i asked theyre going too bless them said price so eat your dinner in peace my lady and dont worry about a thing until i come back to fetch you another hour passed i was in a fever of apprehension i felt like a prisoner who was about to escape from a dungeon a shrill wind was coming up from the sea and whistling about the house i could hear the hammering of the workmen in the pavilion as well as the music of the orchestra practising their scores a few minutes before eleven price returned carrying one of the smaller of the travellingtrunks i had taken to cairo i noticed that it bore no name and no initials its all right she said theyve gone off every mothers son and daughter of themall except the housekeeper and ive caught her out the cat that lynxeyed person had begun to suspect she had seen tommy harnessing his horse and had not been satisfied with his explanationthat he was taking tomatoes to blackwater to be sent off by the liverpool steamer so to watch events without seeming to watch them the housekeeper when the other servants had gone off to the rehearsal had stolen upstairs to her room in the west tower overlooking the back courtyard but price had been more than a match for her creeping up behind she had locked the door of the top landing and now the little cat might scream her head off through the window and over the noises of the wind and the workmen it would be only like tom shrieking on the tiles we must be quick though said price tumbling into my travellingtrunk as many of my clothes as it would hold when it was full and locked and corded she said wait and stepped out on the landing to listen after a moment she returned saying not a sound now for it my lady and then tying her handkerchief over her head to keep down her hair in the wind she picked up the trunk in her arms and crept out of the room on tiptoe the moment had come to go yet eager as i had been all evening to escape from my husbands house i could scarcely tear myself away for i was feeling a little of that regret which comes to us all when we are doing something for the last time passing through the boudoir this feeling took complete possession of me only a few hours before it had been the scene of my deepest degradation but many a time before it had been the place of my greatest happiness you are my wife i am your real husband no matter where you are or what they do with you you are mine and always will be halfclosing the door i took a last look roundat the piano the desk the table the fireplace all the simple things associated with my dearest memories so strong was the yearning of my own soul that i felt as if the soul of martin were in the room with me at that moment i believe it was quick my lady or youll lose your steamer whispered price and then we crossed the landing which was creaking again and crept noiselessly down a back staircase we were near the bottom when i was startled by a loud knocking which seemed to come from a distant part of the house my heart temporarily stopped its beating but price only laughed and whispered there she is weve fairly caught her out the cat at the next moment price opened an outer door and after we had passed through she closed and locked it behind us we were then in the courtyard behind the house stumbling in the blinding darkness over cobblestones keep close to me my lady said price after a few moments we reached the drive i think i was more nervous than i had ever been before i heard the withered leaves behind me rustling along the ground before the wind from the sea and thought they were the footsteps of people pursuing us i heard the hammering of the workmen and the music of the orchestra and thought they were voices screaming to us to come back price who was forging ahead carried the trunk in her arms as if it had been a child but every few minutes she waited for me to come up to her and encouraged me when i stumbled in the darkness only a little further my lady she said and i did my best to struggle on we reached the gate to the high road at last tommy the mate was there with his stiff cart and price who was breathless after her great exertion tumbled my trunk over the tailboard the time had come to part from her and remembering how faithful and true she had been to me i hardly knew what to say i told her i had left her wages in an envelope on the dressingtable and then i stammered something about being too poor to make her a present to remember me by it doesnt need a present to help me to remember a good mistress my lady she said god bless you for being so good to me i answered and then i kissed her ill remember you by that though she said and she began to cry i climbed over the wheel of the stiff cart and seated myself on my trunk and then tommy who had been sitting on the frontboard with his feet on the outer shaft whipped up his horse and we started away during the next halfhour the springless cart bobbed along the dark road at its slow monotonous pace tommy never once looked round or spoke except to his horse but i understood my old friend perfectly i was in a fever of anxiety lest i should be overtaken and carried back again and again i looked behind at one moment when a big motorcar with its two great white eyes came rolling up after us my stormy heart stood still but it was not my husbands car and in a little while its red taillight disappeared in the darkness ahead we reached blackwater in time for the midnight steamer and drew up at the landward end of the pier it was cold the salt wind from the sea was very chill men who looked like commercial travellers were hurrying along with their coatcollars turned up and porters with heavy trunks on their shoulders were striving to keep pace with them i gave my own trunk to a porter who came up to the cart and then turned to tommy to say goodbye the old man had got down from the shaft and was smoothing his smoking horse and snuffling as if he had caught a cold goodbye tommy i saidand then something more which i do not wish to write down goodbye lil missie he answered that cut me deep i never believed ould tom dug would live to see ye laving home like this but wait only wait till himself is after coming back and ill go bail itll be the divil sit up for some of them seventyeighth chapter it was very dark no more than three or four lamps on the pier were burning but nevertheless i was afraid that the piermaster would recognise me i thought he did so as i approached the gangway to the saloon for he said private cabin on main deck aft nervous as i was i had just enough presence of mind to say steerage please which threw him off the scent entirely so that he cried in quite a different voice steerage passengers forward i found my way to the steerage end of the steamer and in order to escape observation from the few persons on the pier i went down to the steerage cabin which was a little triangular place in the bow with an open stove in the middle of the floor and a bleary oillamp swinging from a rafter overhead the porter found me there and in my foolish ignorance of the value of money i gave him half a crown for his trouble he first looked at the coin then tested it between his teeth then spat on it and finally went off chuckling the first and second bells rang i grudged every moment of delay before the steamer sailed for i still felt like a prisoner who was running away and might even yet be brought back seating myself in the darkest corner of the cabin i waited and watched there were only two other steerage passengers and they were women judging by their conversation i concluded that they were cooks from lodginghouses on the front returning after a long season to their homes in liverpool both were very tired and they were spreading their blankets on the bare bunks so as to settle themselves for the night at last the third bell rang i heard the engine whistle the funnel belch out its smoke the hawsers being thrown off the gangways being taken in and then looking through the porthole i saw the grey pier gliding behind us after a few moments with a feeling of safety and a sense of danger passed i went up on deck but oh how little i knew what bitter pain i was putting myself to we were just then swinging round the lighthouse which stands on the southeast headland of the bay and the flash of its revolving light in my face as i reached the top of the cabin stairs brought back the memory of the joyous and tumultuous scenes of martins last departure that coupled and contrasted with the circumstances of my own flight stealthily shamefully and in the dead of night gave me a pang that was almost more than i could bear but my cup was not yet full a few minutes afterwards we sailed in the dark past the two headlands of port raa and looking up i saw the lights in the windows of my husbands house and the glow over the glass roof of the pavilion what would happen there tomorrow morning when it was discovered that i was gone what would happen tomorrow night when my father arrived ignorant of my flight as i felt sure the malice of my husband would keep him little as i knew then of my fathers real motives in giving that bizarre and rather vulgar entertainment i thought i saw and heard everything that would occur i saw the dazzling spectacle i saw the five hundred guests i saw alma and my husband and above all i saw my father the old man stricken with mortal maladies the wounded lion whom the shadow of death itself could not subdue degraded to the dust in his hour of pride by the act of his own child i heard his shouts of rage his cries of fury his imprecations on me as one who should never touch a farthing of his fortune and then i heard the whispering of his friends who were telling the true story of my disappearance the tale of my treacheries to my husbandjust as if satan had willed it that the only result of the foolish fete on which my father had wasted his wealth like water should be the publication of my shame but the bitterest part of my experience was still to come in a few minutes we sailed past the headlands of port raa the lights of my husbands house shot out of view like meteors on a murky night and the steamer turned her head to the open sea i was standing by a rope which crossed the bow and holding on to it to save myself from falling for being alone with nature at last i was seeing my flight for the first time in full light i was telling myself that as surely as my flight became known martins name would be linked with mine and the honour that was dearer to me than my own would be buried in disgrace o god o god why should nature be so hard and cruel to a woman why should it be permitted that having done no worse than obey the purest impulses of my heart the iron law of my sex should rise up to condemn both me and the one who was dearer to my soul than life itself i hardly know how long i stood there holding on to that rope there was no sound now except the tread of a sailor in his heavy boots an inarticulate call from the bridge an answering shout from the wheel the rattling of the wind in the rigging the throbbing of the engine in the bowels of the ship and the monotonous wash of the waves against her side oh how little i felt how weak how helpless i looked up towards the sky but there seemed to be no sky no moon and no stars only a vaporous blackness that came down and closed about me i looked out to the sea but there seemed to be no sea only a hissing splash of green spray where the steamers forward light fell on the water which her bow was pitching up and beyond that nothing but a threatening and thundering void i did not weep but i felt as other women had felt before me as other women have felt since as women must always feel after they have sinned against the world and the worlds law that there was nothing before me but the blackness of night out of the depths i cry unto thee o lord lord hear my cry but all at once a blessed thought came to me we were travelling eastward and dark as the night was now in a few hours the day would dawn the sun would shine in our faces and the sky would smile over our heads it would be like that with me martin would come back i was only going to meet him it was dark midnight with me now but i was sailing into the sunrise perhaps i was like a child but i think that comforted me at all events i went down to the little triangular cabin with a cheerful heart forgetting that i was a runaway a homeless wanderer an outcast with nothing before me but the wilderness of london where i should be friendless and alone the fire had gone out by this time the oillamp was swinging to the motion of the ship the timbers were creaking and the liverpool women were asleep seventyninth chapter at eight oclock next morning i was in the train leaving liverpool for london i had selected a secondclass compartment labelled for ladies and my only travelling companion was a tall fair woman in a sealskin coat and a very large black hat she had filled the carriage with the warm odour of eaudecologne and the racks on both sides with her luggage which chiefly consisted of ladies hat boxes of various shapes and sizes hardly had we started when i realised that she was a very loquacious and expansive person was i going all the way yes did i live in liverpool no in london perhaps no probably i lived in the country yes that was charming the country being so lovely i saw in a moment that if my flight was to be carried out to any purpose i should have to conceal my identity but how to do so i did not know my conscience never before having had to accuse me of deliberate untruth accident helped me my companion asked me what was my husbands profession and being now accustomed to think of martin as my real husband i answered that he was a commander you mean the commander of a ship yes ah yes youve been staying in liverpool to see him off on a voyage how sweet just what i should do myself if my husband were a sailor then followed a further battery of perplexing questions had my husband gone on a long voyage yes where to the south did i mean india australia new zealand yes and still farther ah i see she said again hes probably the captain of a tramp steamer and will go from port to port as long as he can find a cargo hardly understanding what my companion meant by this i half agreed to it and then followed a volley of more personal inquiries i was young to be married wasnt i probably i hadnt been married very long had i and not having settled myself in a home perhaps i was going up to london to wait for my husband yes how wisetown being so much more cheerful than the country any friends there no none whatever none whatever but wont you be lonely by yourself in london a little lonely perhaps being satisfied that she had found out everything about me my travelling companion probably from the mere love of talking told me something about herself she was a fashionable milliner and had a shop in the west end of london occasionally she made personal visits to the provinces to take orders from the leading shopkeepers but during the season she found it more profitable to remain in town where her connection was large among people who could pay the highest prices by this time we had reached crewe and as there was some delay in getting into the station my travelling companion put her head out of the window to inquire the cause she was told that a night train from scotland was in front of us and we should have to be coupled on to it before we could proceed to london this threw her into the wildest state of excitement i see what it is she said the shooting season is over and the society people are coming down from the moors i know lots and lots of them they are my best customersthe gentlemen at all events the gentlemen why yes she said with a little laugh after some shunting our liverpool carriages were coupled to the scotch train and run into the station where a number of gentlemen in knickerbockers and cloth caps were strolling about the platform my companion seemed to know them all and gave them their names generally their christian names and often their familiar ones suddenly i had a shock a tall man whose figure i recognised passed close by our carriage and i had only time to conceal myself from observation behind the curtain of the window helloa cried my companion theres teddy eastcliff he married camilla the russian dancer they first met in my shop i may tell you i was feeling hot and cold by turns but a thick veil must have hidden my confusion for after we left crewe my companion becoming still more confidential talked for a long time about her aristocratic customers and i caught a glimpse of a life that was on the verge of a kind of fashionable bohemia more than once i recognised my husbands friends among the number of her clients and trembling lest my husband himself should become a subject of discussion i made the excuse of a headache to close my eyes and be silent my companion thereupon slept very soundly and rather audibly from rugby to willesden where awakening with a start while the tickets were being collected she first powdered her face by her fashionglass and then interested herself afresh in my affairs did you say my dear that you have no friends in london i repeated that i had none then you will go to an hotel i suppose i answered that i should have to look for something less expensive in that case she said i think i know something that will suit you exactly it was a quiet boarding establishment in bloomsburycomfortable house reasonable terms and above all perfectly respectable in fact it was kept by her own sister and if i liked she would take me along in her cab and drop me at the door should she looking back at that moment i cannot but wonder that after what i had heard i did not fear discovery but during the silence of the last hour i had been feeling more than ever weak and helpless so that when my companion offered me a shelter in that great noisy bewildering city in which i had intended to hide myself but now feared i might be submerged and lost with a willing if not a cheerful heart i accepted half an hour afterwards our cab drew up in a street off russell square at a rather grimylooking house which stood at the corner of another and smaller square that was shut off by an iron railing the door was opened by a young waiter of sixteen or seventeen years who was wearing a greasy dresssuit and a soiled shirt front my companion pushed into the hall i followed her and almost at the same moment a still larger and perhaps grosser woman than my friend with the same features and complexion came out of a room to the left with a serviette in her hand sophie jane cried my companion and pointing to me she said ive brought you a new boarder then followed a rapid account of where she had met me who and what i was and why i had come up to london ive promised youll take her in and not charge her too much you know why no certainly not said the sister at the next moment the boy waiter was bringing my trunk into the house on his shoulder and my travelling companion was bidding me goodbye and saying she would look me up later when the door was closed i found the house full of the smell of hot food chiefly roast beef and green vegetables and i could hear the clink of knives and forks and the clatter of dishes in the room the landlady had come from youd like to go up to your bedroom at once wouldnt you she said we went up two flights of stairs covered with rather dirty druggeting along a corridor that had a thin strip of linoleum and finally up a third flight that was bare to the boards until we came to a room which seemed to be at the top of the house and situated in its remotest corner it was a very small apartment hardly larger than the room over the hall at home in which aunt bridget had made me sleep when i was a child and it was nearly as cold and cheerless the wallpaper which had once been a flowery pink was now pale and patternless the venetian blind over the window which looked out on the smaller square had lost one of its cords and hung at an irregular angle there was a mirror over the mantelpiece with the silvering much mottled and a leathercovered easy chair whereof the spring was broken and the seat heavily indented i dare say this will do for the present said my landlady and though my heart was in my mouth i compelled myself to agree my terms including meals and all extras will be a pound a week she added and to that also with a lump in my throat i assented whereupon my landlady left me saying luncheon was on and i could come downstairs when i was ready a talkative cockney chambermaid with a good little face brought me a fat blue jug of hot water and after i had washed and combed i found my way down to the diningroom what i expected to find there i hardly know what i did find was a large chamber as dingy as the rest of the house and as much in need of refreshing with a long table down the middle at which some twenty persons sat eating with the landlady presiding at the top the company who were of both sexes and chiefly elderly seemed to me at that first sight to be dressed in every variety of outofdate clothes many of them rather shabby and some almost grotesque raising their faces from their plates they looked at me as i entered and i was so confused that i stood hesitating near the door until the landlady called to me come up here she said and when i had done so and taken the seat by her side which had evidently been reserved for me she whispered i dont think my sister mentioned your name my dear what is it i had no time to deliberate oneill i whispered back and thereupon my landlady raising her voice and addressing the company as if they had been members of her family said mrs oneill my dears then the ladies at the table inclined their heads at me and smiled while the men especially those who were the most strangely dressed rose from their seats and bowed deeply eightieth chapter of all houses in london this i thought was the least suitable to me looking down the table i told myself that it must be the very home of idle gossip and the hotbed of tittletattle i was wrong hardly had i been in the house a day when i realised that my fellowguests were the most reserved and selfcentred of all possible people one old gentleman who wore a heavy moustache and had been a colonel in the indian army was understood to be a student of biblical prophecy having collected some thousands of texts which established the identity of the british nation with the lost tribes of israel another old gentleman who wore a patriarchal beard and had taken orders without securing a living was believed to be writing a history of the world and after forty years of continuous labour to have reached the century before christ an elderly lady with a benign expression was said to be a tragic actress who was studying in secret for a season at the national theatre such and of such kind were my housemates and i have since been told that every great city has many such groups of people the great prophets the great historians the great authors the great actors whom the world does not knowthe odds and ends of humanity thrown aside by the rushing river of life into the gulleyways that line its banks the odd brothers the odd sisters the odd uncles the odd aunts for whom there is no place in the family in society or in the business of the world it was all very curious and pathetic yet i think i should have been safe for a time at all events in this little corner of london into which chance had so strangely thrown me but for one unfortunate happening that was the arrival of the daily newspaper there was never more than a single copy it came at eight in the morning and was laid on the diningroom mantelpiece from which by an unwritten law of the house it was the duty as well as the honour of the person who had first finished breakfast to take it up and read the most startling part of the news to the rest of the company thus it occurred that on the third morning after my arrival i was startled by the voice of the old colonel who standing back to the fire with the newspaper in his hand cried mysterious disappearance of a peeress read it said the old clergyman the teacup which i was raising to my mouth trembled in my hand and when i set it down it rattled against the saucer i knew what was coming and it came the old colonel read a telegram from blackwater announces the mysterious disappearance of the young wife of lord raa which appears to have taken place late on thursday night or in the early hours of friday morning it will be remembered that the missing lady was married a little more than a year ago and her disappearance is the more unaccountable from the fact that during the past month she has been actively occupied in preparing for a fete in honour of her return home after a long and happy honeymoon the pavilion in which the fete was to have been held had been erected on a headland between castle raa and a precipitous declivity to the sea and the only reasonable conjecture is that the unhappy lady going out on thursday night to superintend the final preparations lost her way in the darkness and fell over the cliffs the fact that the hostess was missing was not generally known in ellan until the guests had begun to arrive for the reception on friday evening when the large assembly broke up in great confusion naturally much sympathy is felt for the griefstricken husband after the colonel had finished reading i had an almost irresistible impulse to scream feeling sure that the moment my housemates looked into my face they must see that i was the person indicated they did not look and after a chorus of exclamations most mysterious what can have become of her on the eve of her fete too they began to discuss disappearances in general each illustrating his point by reference to the subject of his own study perfectly extraordinary how people disappear nowadays said one extraordinary sir said the old colonel looking over his spectacles why should it be extraordinary that one person should disappear when whole nationsthe ten tribes for example but thats a different thing altogether said the old clergyman now if you had quoted biblical exampleselisha or perhaps jonah after the discussion had gone on for several minutes in this way i rose from the table on my trembling limbs and slipped out of the room it would take long to tell of the feverish days that followedhow newspaper correspondents were sent from london to ellan to inquire into the circumstances of my disappearance how the theory of accident gave place to the theory of suicide and the theory of suicide to the theory of flight how a porter on the pier at blackwater said he had carried my trunk to the steamer that sailed on thursday midnight thinking i was a maid from the great house until i had given him halfacrown his proper fee being threepence how two female passengers had declared that a person answering to my description had sailed with them to liverpool how these clues had been followed up and had led to nothing and how finally the correspondents had concluded the whole incident of my disappearance could not be more mysterious if i had been dropped from midair into the middle of the irish sea but then came another development my father who was reported to have received the news of my departure in a way that suggested he had lost control of his senses raging and storming at my husband like a man demented having come to the conclusion that i being in a physical condition peculiar to women had received a serious shock resulting in a loss of memory offered five hundred pounds reward for information that would lead to my discovery which was not only desirable to allay the distress of my heartbroken family but urgently necessary to settle important questions of title and inheritance with this offer of a reward came a description of my personal appearance age a little under medium height slight very black hair lustrous dark eyes regular features pale face grave expression unusually sunny smile it would be impossible for me to say with what perturbation i heard these reports read out by the old colonel and the old clergyman even the nervous stirring of my spoon and the agitated clatter of my knife and fork made me wonder that my housemates did not realise the truth which must i thought be plainly evident to all eyes they never did being so utterly immersed in their own theories but all the same i sometimes felt as if my fellow guests in that dingy house in bloomsbury were my judges and jury and more than once in my great agitation when the reports came near to the truth i wanted to cry stop stop dont you see it is i that i never did so was due to the fact that not knowing what legal powers my father might have to compel my return to ellan the terror that sat on me like a nightmare was that of being made the subject of a public quarrel between my father and my husband concerning the legitimacy of my unborn child with the shame and disgrace which that would bring not only upon me but upon martin i had some reason for this fear after my fathers offer of a reward there came various spiteful paragraphs inspired as i thought by alma and written by the clumsier hand of my husband saying it was reported in ellan that if my disappearance was to be accounted for on the basis of flight the only shock i could have experienced must be a shock of conscience rumour having for some time associated my name with that of a person who was not unknown in connection with antarctic exploration it was terrible day by day the motive of my disappearance became the sole topic of conversation in our boardinghouse i think the landlady must have provided an evening as well as a morning paper for at tea in the drawingroom upstairs the most recent reports were always being discussed after a while i realised that not only my housemates but all london was discussing my disappearance it was a rule of our boardinghouse that during certain hours of the day everybody should go out as if he had business to go to and having nothing else to do i used to walk up and down the streets in doing so i was compelled to pass certain newsvendors stalls and i saw for several days that nearly every placard had something about the missing peeress when this occurred i would walk quickly along the thoroughfare with a sense of being pursued and the feeling which a nervous woman has when she is going down a dark corridor at nightthat noiseless footsteps are coming behind and a hand may at any moment be laid on her shoulder but nobody troubled me in the streets and the only person in our boardinghouse who seemed to suspect me was our landlady she said nothing but when my lip was quivering while the old colonel read that cruel word about martin i caught her little grey eyes looking aslant at me one afternoon her sister the milliner came to see me according to her promise and though she too said nothing i saw that while the old colonel and the old clergyman were disputing on the hearthrug about some disappearance which occurred thousands of years ago she was looking fixedly at the fingers with which in my nervousness i was ruckling up the discoloured chintz of my chair then in a momenti dont know whyit flashed upon me that my travelling companion was in correspondence with my father that idea became so insistent towards dinnertime that i made pretence of being ill which was not very difficult to retire to my room where the cockney chambermaid wrung handkerchiefs out of vinegar and laid them on my forehead to relieve my headachethough she increased it poor thing by talking perpetually next morning the landlady came up to say that if as she assumed from my name i was irish and a catholic i might like to receive a visit from a sister of mercy who called at the house at intervals to attend to the sick i thought i saw in a moment that this was a subterfuge but feeling that my identity was suspected i dared not give cause for further suspicion so i compelled myself to agree a few minutes later having got up and dressed i was standing with my back to the window feeling like one who would soon have to face an attack when a soft footstep came up my corridor and a gentle hand knocked at my door come in i cried trembling like the last leaf at the end of a swinging bough and then an astonishing thing happened a young woman stepped quietly into the room and closed the door behind her she was wearing the black and white habit of the little sisters of the poor but i knew her long pale plainfeatured face in an instant a flood of shame and at the same time a flood of joy swept over me at the sight of her it was mildred bankes eightyfirst chapter mary said mildred speak low and tell me everything she sat in my chair i knelt by her side took one of her hands in both of mine and told her i told her that i had fled from my husbands house because i could not bear to remain there any longer i told her that my father had married me against my will in spite of my protests when i was a child and did not know that i had any right to resist him i told her that my fathergod forgive me if i did him a wrongdid not love me that he had sacrificed my happiness to his lust of power and that if he were searching for me now it was only because my absence disturbed his plans and hurt his pride i told her that my husband did not love me either and that he had married me from the basest motives merely to pay his debts and secure an income i told her too that not only did my husband not love me but he loved somebody else that he had been cruel and brutal to me and therefore for these and other reasons i could not return to him under any circumstances while i was speaking i felt mildreds hand twitching between mine and when i had finished she said but my dear child they told me your friends were brokenhearted about you that you had lost your memory and perhaps your reason and therefore it would be a good act to help them to send you home its not true its not true i said and then in a low voice as if afraid of being overheard she told me how she came to be therethat the woman who had travelled with me in the train from liverpool seeing my fathers offer of a reward had written to him to say that she knew where i was and only needed somebody to establish my identity that my father wished to come to london for this purpose but had been forbidden by his doctor that our parish priest father donovan had volunteered to come instead but had been prohibited by his bishop and finally that my father had written to his lawyers in london and father dan to her knowing that she and i had been together at the sacred heart in rome and that it was her work now to look after lost ones and send them safely back to their people and now the lawyer and the doctors are downstairs she said in a whisper and they are only waiting for me to say who you are that they may apply for an order to send you home this terrified me so much that i made a fervent appeal to mildred to save me oh mildred save me save me i cried but how can i how can i she asked i saw what she meant and thinking to touch her still more deeply i told her the rest of my story i told her that if i had fled from my husbands house it was not merely because he had been cruel and brutal to me but because i too loved somebody elsesomebody who was far away but was coming back and there was nothing i could not bear for him in the meantime no pain or suffering or loneliness and when he returned he would protect me from every danger and we should love each other eternally if i had not been so wildly agitated i should have known that this was the wrong way with mildred and it was not until i had said it all in a rush of whispered words that i saw her eyes fixed on me as if they were about to start from their sockets but my dear dear child she said this is worse and worse your father and your husband may have done wrong but you have done wrong too dont you see you have i did not tell her that i had thought of all that before and did not believe any longer that god would punish me for breaking a bond i had been forced to make but when she was about to rise saying that after all it would be a good thing to send me home before i had time to join my life to hiswhoever he waswho had led me to forget my duty as a wife i held her trembling hands and whispered wait mildred there is something i have not told you even yet what is it she asked but already i could see that she knew what i was going to say mildred i said if i ran away from my husband it was not merely because i loved somebody else but because i could not say it do what i would i could not but holy women like mildred who spend their lives among the lost ones have a way of reading a womans heart when it is in trouble and mildred read mine do you mean that that there are consequences going to be she whispered yes does your husband know yes and your father no mildred drew her hand away from me and crossed herself saying beneath her breath oh mother of my god i felt more humbled than i had ever been before but after a while i said now you see why i can never go back and you will save me will you not there was silence for some moments mildred had drawn back in her chair as if an evil spirit had passed between us but at length she said it is not for me to judge you mary but the gentlemen will come up soon to know if you are the mary oneill whom i knew at the sacred heart and what am i to say to them say no i cried why shouldnt you theyll never know anything to the contrary nobody will know nobody i knew what mildred meant and in my shame and confusion i tried to excuse myself by telling her who the other woman was it is alma i said alma alma lier yes and then i told her how alma had come back into my life how she had tortured and tempted me and was now trying to persuade my husband who was a protestant to divorce me that she might take my place and then i spoke of martin againi could not help itsaying that the shame which alma would bring on him would be a greater grief to me than anything else that could befall me in this world if you only knew who he is i said and the honour he is held in you would know that i would rather die a thousand deaths than that any disgrace should fall on him through me i could see that mildred was deeply moved at this and though i did not intend to play upon her feelings yet in the selfishness of my great love i could not help doing so you were the first of my girl friends mildredthe very first dont you remember the morning after i arrived at school they had torn me away from my mother and i was so little and lonely but you were so sweet and kind you took me into church for my first visitation and then into the garden for my first rosarydont you remember it mildred had closed her eyes her face was becoming very white and then dont you remember the day the news came that my mother was very ill and i was to go home you came to see me off at the station and dont you remember what you said when we were sitting in the train you said we might never meet again because our circumstances would be so different you didnt think we should meet like this did you mildreds face was growing deadly white my darling mother died she was all i had in the world and i was all she had and when she was gone there was no place for me in my fathers house so i was sent back to school but the reverend mother was very kind to me and the end of it was that i wished to become a nun yes indeed and never so much as on the day you took your vows mildreds eyes were still closed but her eyelids were fluttering and she was breathing audibly how well i remember it the sweet summer morning and the snowwhite sunshine and the white flowers and the white chapel of the little sisters and then you dressed as a bride in your white gown and long white veil i cried all through the ceremony and if my father had not come for me then perhaps i should have been a nun like you now mildreds lips were moving i was sure she was praying to our lady for strength to resist my pleading yet that only made me plead the harder but god knows best what our hearts are made for i said he knows that mine was made for love and though you may not think it i know god knows that he who is away is my real husbandnot the one they married me to you will not separate us will you all our happinesshis and mineis in your hands you will save us will you not some time passed before mildred spoke it may have been only a few moments but to me it seemed like an eternity i did not know then that mildred was reluctant to extinguish the last spark of hope in me at length she said mary you dont know what you are asking me to do when i took my vows i promised to speak the truth under all circumstances no matter what the consequences as surely as i should answer to god at the great day of judgment yet you wish me to lie how can i how can i remember my vows my duty i think the next few minutes must have been the most evil of all my life when i saw or thought i saw that though one word would save me one little word mildred intended to give me away to the men downstairs i leapt to my feet and burst out on her with the bitterest reproaches you religious women are always talking about your duty i cried you never think about love love is kind and merciful but no duty always duty love indeed what do you cold creatures out of the convent with your crosses and rosaries know about lovereal lovethe blazing fire in a womans heart when she loves somebody so much that she would give her hearts blood for himyes and her soul itself if need be what else i said i cannot remember for i did not know what i was doing until i found myself looking out of the window and panting for breath then i became aware that mildred was making no reply to my reproaches and looking over my shoulder i saw that she was still sitting in my chair with both her hands covering her face and the tears trickling through her fingers on to the linen of her habit that conquered me in a moment i was seized with such remorse that i wished to throw my arms about her neck and kiss her i dared not do that now but i knelt by her side again and asked her to forgive me forgive me sister i said i see now that god has brought us to this pass and there is no way out of it you must do what you think is right i shall always know you couldnt have done otherwise he will know too and if it must be that disgrace is to fall on him through me and that when he comes home he will find but i could not bear to speak about that so i dropped my head on mildreds lap during the silence that followed we heard the sound of footsteps coming up the stairs listen theyre here said mildred get up say nothing leave everything to me i rose quickly and returned to the window mildred dried her eyes got up from the chair and stood with her back to the fireplace there was a knock at my door i do not know which of us answered it but my landlady came into the room followed by three men in tall silk hats excuse us my dear she said in an insincere voice these gentlemen are making an examination of the house and they wish to see your room may they i do not think i made any reply i was holding my breath and watching intently the men made a pretence of glancing round but i could see they were looking at mildred their looks seemed to say as plainly as words could speak is it she mildred hesitated for a moment there was a dreadful silence and thenmay the holy virgin bless hershe shook her head i could bear no more i turned back to the window the men who had looked at each other with expressions of surprise tried to talk together in ordinary tones as if on common place subjects so theres nothing to do here apparently apparently not lets go then good day sister sorry to have troubled you i heard the door close behind them i heard their low voices as they passed along the corridor i heard their slow footsteps as they went down the stairs and then feeling as if my heart would burst i turned to throw myself at sister mildreds feet but sister mildred was on her knees with her face buried in my bed praying fervently eightysecond chapter i did not know then and it seems unnecessary to say now why my father gave up the search for me in london he did so and from the day the milliners clue failed him i moved about freely then from the sense of being watched i passed into that of being lost sister mildred was my only friend in london but she was practically cut off from me the little sisters had fixed her up in the interests of her work among the lost ones in a tiny flat at the top of a lofty building near piccadilly where her lighted window always reminded me of a lighthouse on the edge of a dangerous reef but in giving me her address she warned me not to come to her except in case of urgent need partly because further intercourse might discredit her denial and partly because it would not be good for me to be called one of sister veronicas girlsthat being mildreds name as a nun oh the awful loneliness of london others just as friendless have wandered in the streets of the big city i knew i was not the first and i am sure i have not been the last to find london the most solitary place in the world but i really and truly think there was one day of the week when from causes peculiar to my situation my loneliness must have been deeper than that of the most friendless refugee nearly every boarder in our boardinghouse used to receive once a week or once a month a letter containing a remittance from some unknown source with which he paid his landlady and discharged his other obligations i had no such letter to receive so to keep up the character i had not made but allowed myself to maintain of being a commanders wife i used to go out once a week under pretence of calling at a shipping office to draw part of my husbands pay in my childish ignorance of the habits of business people i selected saturday afternoon for this purpose and in my fear of encountering my husband or my husbands friends in the west end streets i chose the less conspicuous thoroughfares at the other side of the river oh the wearisome walks i had on saturday afternoons wet or dry down the seven dials across trafalgar square along whitehall round the eastern end of the houses of parliament and past westminster pier dear to me from one poignant memory and so on and on into the monotonous and inconspicuous streets beyond towards nightfall i would return generally by the footway across hungerford bridge which is thereby associated with the most painful moments of my life for nowhere else did i feel quite so helpless and so lonely the trains out of charing cross shrieking past me the dark river flowing beneath the steamers whistling under the bridge the automobiles tooting along the embankment the clanging of the electric cars the arc lamps burning over the hotels and the open flares blazing over the theatresall the neverresting life of londonand myself in the midst of the tumultuous solitude a friendless and homeless girl but god in his mercy saved me from all thatsaved me too in ways in which it was only possible to save a woman the first way was through my vanity glancing at myself in my mottled mirror one morning i was shocked to see that what with my loneliness and my weary walks i was losing my looks for my cheeks were hollow my nose was pinched my eyes were heavy with dark rings underneath them and i was plainer than martin had ever seen me this frightened me it would be ridiculous to tell all the foolish things i did after that to improve and preserve my appearance for martins sake because every girl whose sweetheart is away knows quite well and it is not important that anybody else should there was a florists shop in southampton row and i went there every morning for a little flower which i wore in the breast of my bodice making believe to myself that martin had given it to me there was a jewellers shop there too and i sold my wedding ring having long felt as if it burnt my finger and bought another wedding ring with an inscription on the inside from martin to mary as a result of all this caressing of myself i saw after a while to my great joy that my good looks were coming back and it would be silly to say what a thrill of delight i had when going into the drawingroom of our boardinghouse one day the old actress called me beauty instead of the name i had hitherto been known by the second way in which god saved me from my loneliness was through my condition i did not yet know what angel was whispering to me out of the physical phase i was passing through when suddenly i became possessed by a passion for children it was just as if a whole new world of humanity sprang into life for me by magic when i went out for my walks in the streets i ceased to be conscious of the faces of men and women and it seemed as if london were peopled by children only i saw no more of the crowds going their different ways like ants on an anthill but i could not let a perambulator pass without peering under the lace of the hood at the little cherub face whose angel eyes looked up at me there was an asylum for children suffering from incurable diseases in the smaller square beside our boardinghouse and every morning after breakfast no matter how cold the day might be i would open my window to hear the cheerful voices of the suffering darlings singing their hymn theres a friend for little children above the bright blue sky thus six weeks passed christmas approached and the sad old city began to look glad and young and gay since a certain night at castle raa i had had a vague feeling that i had thrown myself out of the pale of the church therefore i had never gone to service since i came to london and had almost forgotten that confession and the mass used to be sweet to me but going home one evening in the deepening london fog for the weather had begun to be frosty i saw through the open doors of a catholic church a great many lights in a side chapel and found they were from a little illuminated model of the nativity with the virgin and child in the stable among the straw a group of untidy children were looking at it with bright beady eyes and chattering under their breath while a blackrobed janitor was rattling his keys to make them behave this brought back the memory of rome and of sister angela but it also made me think of martin and remember his speech at the public dinner about saying the prayers for the day with his comrades that they might feel that they were not cut off from the company of christian men so telling myself he must be back by this time on that lonely plateau that guards the pole i resolved without thinking of the difference of time to go to mass on christmas morning in order to be doing the same thing as martin at the same moment with this in my mind i returned to our boardinghouse and found christmas there too for on looking into the drawingroom on my way upstairs i saw the old actress standing on a chair hanging holly which the old colonel with oldfashioned courtesy was handing up to her they were cackling away like two old hens when they caught sight of me whereupon the old actress cried ah heres beauty then she asked me if i would like a ticket for a dress rehearsal on christmas eve of a christmas pantomime the audience will be chiefly children out of the lanes and alleys round about but perhaps you wont mind that she said i told her i should be overjoyed and at two oclock the following afternoon i was in my seat at the corner of the dresscircle of the great theatre from which i could see both the stage and the auditorium the vast place was packed with children from ceiling to floor and i could see the invisible hands of thousands of mothers who had put the girls into clean pinafores and brushed and oiled the tousled heads of the boys how their eager faces glistened how sad they looked when the wicked sisters left cinderella alone in the kitchen how bright when the glittering fairy godmother came to visit her how their little dangling feet clapped together with joy when the pretty maid went off to the ball behind six little ponies which pranced along under the magical moonlight in the falling snow but the part of the performance which they liked best was their own part when in the interval the band struck up one of the songs they sang in their lanes and alleys yew aw the enny oi em ther bee oid like ter sip ther enny from those red lips yew see that was so loaded with the memory of one of the happiest days of my life the day i went with martin to see the scotia that in the yearning of the motherhood still unborn in me i felt as if i should like to gather the whole screaming houseful of happy children to my breast but oh why why why does not providence warn us when we are on the edge of tragic things the pantomime rehearsal being over i was hurrying home for the evening was cold though i was so warm within when i became aware of a number of newsmen who were flying up from the direction of the strand crying their papers at the top of their voice i did not usually listen to such people but i was compelled to do so now for they were all around me paperthird eshenloss of the scosha the cry fell on me like a thunderbolt an indescribable terror seized me i felt paralysed and stood dead still people were buying copies of the papers and at first i made a feeble effort to do the same but my voice was faint the newsman did not hear me and he went flying past paperthird eshenreported loss of the scosha after that i dared not ask for a paper literally i dared not i dared not know the truth i dared not see the dreadful fact in print so i began to hurry home but as i passed through the streets stunned stupefied perspiring feeling as if i were running away from some malignant curse the newsmen seemed to be pursuing me for they were darting out from every street paperthird eshenloss of the scosha faster and faster i hurried along but the awful cry was always ringing in my ears behind before and on either side when i reached our boardinghouse my limbs could scarcely support me i had hardly strength enough to pull the bell and before our young waiter had opened the door two news men crossing the square were crying paperthird editionreported loss of the scotia eightythird chapter as i passed through the hall the old colonel and the old clergyman were standing by the diningroom door they were talking excitedly and while i was going upstairs panting hard and holding on by the handrail i heard part of their conversation scotia was the name of the south pole ship wasnt it certainly it was we must send young john out for a paper reaching my room i dropped into my chair my faculties had so failed me that for some minutes i was unable to think presently my tired brain recalled the word reported and to that my last hope began to cling as a drowning sailor clings to a drifting spar after a while i heard some of our boarders talking on the floor below opening my door and listening eagerly i heard one of them say in such a casual tone rather sadthis south pole business isnt it yes if its true doesnt seem much doubt about thatunless there are two ships of the same name you know at that my heart leapt up i had now two rafts to cling to just then the gong sounded and my anxiety compelled me to go down to tea as i entered the drawingroom the old colonel was unfolding a newspaper here we are he was saying reported loss of the scotiaappalling antarctic calamity i tried to slide into the seat nearest to the door but the old actress made room for me on the sofa close to the teatable you enjoyed the rehearsal yes she whispered hush said our landlady handing me a cup of tea and then the old colonel standing back to the fire began to read telegrams from new zealand report the picking up of large fragments of a ship which were floating from the antarctic seas among them were the bulwarks some portions of the deck cargo and the stern of a boat bearing the name scotia grave fears are entertained that these fragments belong to the schooner of the south pole expedition which left akaroa a few weeks ago and the character of some of the remnants being vital parts of a ships structure lead to the inference that the vessel herself must have foundered well well said the old clergyman with his mouth full of buttered toast the walls of the room seemed to be moving around me i could scarcely see i could scarcely hear naturally there can be no absolute certainty that the scotia may not be still afloat or that the members of the expedition may not have reached a place of safety but the presence of large pieces of ice attached to some of the fragments seem to the best authorities to favour the theory that the unfortunate vessel was struck by one of the huge icebergs which have lately been floating up from the direction of the admiralty mountains and in that case her fate will probably remain one of the many insoluble mysteries of the ocean now thats what one might call the irony of fate said the old clergyman seeing that the object of the expedition hush while the sympathy of the public will be extended to the families of all the explorers who have apparently perished in a brave effort to protect mankind from one of the worst dangers of the great deep the entire world will mourn the loss as we fear it may be of the heroic young commander doctor martin conrad who certainly belonged to the everdiminishing race of dauntless and intrepid souls who seem to be born will that sacred courage which leads men to render up their lives at the lure of the unknown and the call of a great idea i felt as if i were drowning at one moment there was the shrieking of waves about my face at the next the rolling of billows over my head though it seems only too certain this sacred courage quenched let us not think such lives as his are wasted only wasted lives lives given up inglorious ease pursuit of idle amusements therefore let loved ones left behind take comfort inspiring thought if lost not died in vain never pleasure but death the lure that draws true hearts i heard no more the old colonels voice which had been beating on my brain like a hammer seemed to die away in the distance how hard you are breathing what is amiss said our landlady i made no reply rising to my feet i became giddy and held on to the table cloth to prevent myself from falling the landlady jumped up to protect her crockery and at the same moment the old actress led me from the room i excused myself on the ground of faintness and the heat of the house after my quick walk home from the theatre back in my bedroom my limbs gave way and i sank to the floor with my head on the chair there was no uncertainty for me now it was all over the great love which had engrossed my life had gone in the overwhelming shock of that moment i could not think of the worlds loss i could not even think of martins i could only think of my own and once more i felt as if something of myself had been torn out of my breast why why i was crying in the depths of my heartwhy when i was so utterly alone so helpless and so friendless had the light by which i lived been quenched after a while the gong sounded for dinner i got up and lay on the bed the young waiter brought up some dishes on a tray i sent them down again then time passed and again i heard voices on the floor below rough on that young peeress if conrad has gone down eh what peeress dont you rememberthe one who ran away from that reprobate raa ah yes certainly i remember now of course conrad was the man pointed at and perhaps if he had lived to come back he might have stood up for the poor thing but now ah well thats the way you see the long night passed sometimes it seemed to go with feet of lead sometimes with galloping footsteps i remember that the clocks outside seemed to strike every few minutes and then not to strike at all at one moment i heard the bells of a neighbouring church ringing merrily and by that i knew it was christmas morning i did not sleep during the first hours of night but somewhere in the blank reaches of that short space between night and day like the slackwater between ebb and flow which is the only time when london rests i fell into a troubled doze i wish i had not done so for at the first moment of returning consciousness i had that sense so familiar to bereaved ones of memory rushing over me like a surging tide i did not cry but i felt as if my heart were bleeding the morning dawned dark and foggy in the thick air of my room the window looked at me like a human eye scaled with cataract it was my first experience of a real london fog and i was glad of it if there had been one ray of sunshine that morning i think my heart would have broken the cockney chambermaid came with her jug of hot water and wished me a merry christmas i did my best to answer her the young waiter came with my breakfast i told him to set it down but i did not touch it then the cockney chambermaid came back to make up my room and finding me still in bed asked if i would like a fire i answered yes and while she was lighting a handful between the two bars of my little grate she talked of the news in the newspaper it dont do to speak no harm of the dead but as to them men as ad a collusion with a iceberg in the australier sea serve em jolly well right i say what was they adoing down there risking their lives for nothing when they ought to have been athinking of their wives and children my tom wanted to go for a sailor but i wouldnt let him not me if youre married to a sailor says i alf your time you never knows whether you as a usband or asnt talk sense says tom i am atalking sense says i and then think of the kiddies i says after a while i got up and dressed and sat long hours before the fire i tried to think of others beside myself who must be suffering from the same disasterespecially of martins mother and the good old doctor i pictured the sweet kitchenparlour in sunny lodge with the bright silver bowls on the high mantelpiece there was no fire under the slouree now the light of that house was out and two old people were sitting on either side of a cold hearth i passed in review my maidenhood my marriage and my love and told myself that the darkest days of my loneliness in london had hitherto been relieved by one bright hope i had only to live on and martin would come back to me but now i was utterly alone i was in the presence of nothingness the sanctuary within me where martin had lived was only a cemetery of the soul why why why i cried again but there was no answer thus i passed my christmas day for which i had formed such different plans and i hardly knew if it was for punishment or warning that i was at last compelled to think of something besides my own loss my unborn child no man on earth can know anything about that tragic prospect though millions of women must have had to face it to have a child coming that is doomed before its birth to be fatherlessthere is nothing in the world like that i think the bitterest part of my grief was that nobody could ever know if martin had lived he would have leapt to acknowledge his offspring in spite of all the laws and conventions of life but being dead he could not be charged with it therefore the name of the father of my unborn child must never never never be disclosed the thickening of the fog told me that the day was passing it passed the houses on the opposite side of the square vanished in a vaporous yellow haze and their lighted windows were like rows of bloodshot eyes looking out of the blackness except the young waiter and the chambermaid nobody visited me until a little before dinner time then the old actress came up rather fantastically dressed with a kind of laurel crown on her head to say that the boarders were going to have a dance and wished me to join them i excused myself on the ground of headache and she said young women often suffer from it its a pity though christmas night too not long after she had gone i heard through the frequent tooting of the taxis in the street the sound of oldfashioned waltzes being played on the piano and then a dull thudding noise on the floor below mingled with laughter which told me that the old boarders were dancing i dare say my head was becoming light i had eaten nothing for nearly forty hours and perhaps the great shock which chance had given me had brought me near to the blank shadowland which is death i remember that in some vague way there arose before me a desire to die it was not to be suicidemy religion saved me from thatbut death by exhaustion by continuing to abstain from food having no desire for it martin was gonewhat was there to live for had i not better die before my child came to life and if i could go where martin was i should be with him eternally still i did not weep butwhether audibly or only in the unconscious depths of my soulmore than once i cried to martin by name martin martin i am coming to you i was in this mood sitting in my chair as i had done all day and staring into the small slow fire which was slipping to the bottom of the grate when i heard a soft step in the corridor outside at the next moment my door was opened noiselessly and somebody stepped into the room it was mildred and she knelt by my side and said in a low voice you are in still deeper trouble marytell me i tried to pour out my heart to her as to a mother but i could not do so and indeed there was no necessity the thought that must have rushed into my eyes was instantly reflected in hers it is he isnt it she whispered and i could only bow my head i thought so from the first she said and now you are thinking of of what is to come again i could only bow but mildred put her arms about me and said dont lose heart dear our blessed lady sent me to take care of you and i willi will memorandum by martin conrad surely chance must be the damnedest conspirator against human happiness or my darling could never have been allowed to suffer so much from the report that my ship was lost what actually happened is easily told two days after we left akaroa nz which was the last we saw of the world before we set our faces towards the unknown we ran into a heavy lumpy sea and made bad weather of it for fortyeight hours going at good speed however we proceeded south on meridian degrees e latitude when just as we were sighting the admiralty mountains our first glimpse of the regions of the pole we encountered a southwesterly gale which with our cumbersome deck cargo made the handling of the ship difficult nevertheless the scotia rode bravely for several hours over the mountainous seas though sometimes she rolled fifty degrees from side to side towards nightfall we shipped a good deal of water the sea smashed in part of our starboard bulwarks destroyed the upper deck washed out the galley carried off two of our life boats and sent other large fragments of the vessel floating away to leeward at last the pumps became choked and the water found its way to the engineroom so to prevent further disaster we put out the fires and then started all hands to bale out with buckets it was a sight to see every manjack at work on that job scientific staff included and you would not have thought our spirits were much damped whatever our bodies may have been if you had been there when i cried are we downhearted shipmates and heard the shout that came up from fifty men some of them waist deep in the water no we had a stiff tussle until after midnight but we stuck hard and before we turned into our bunks we had fought the sea and beaten it next morning broke fine and clear with that fresh crisp air of the antarctic which is the same to the explorer as the sniff of battle to the warhorse and no sign of the storm except the sight of some leadwhite icebergs which had been torn from the islands southwest of us everybody was in high spirits at breakfast and when one of the company started sweethearts and wives all hands joined in the chorus and voice or no voice i had a bit of a go at it myself it is not the most solemn music ever slung together but perhaps no anthem sung in a cathedral has ascended to heaven with a heartier spirit of thanksgiving when i went up on deck again though i saw that enough of our wooden walls had gone overboard to give scarey people the impression if things were ever picked up as i knew they would be for the set of the current was to the northeast that we had foundered and that made me think of my dear one we had no wireless aboard and the ship would not be going back to new zealand until march so i was helpless to correct the error but i determined that the very first message from the very first station i set up on the antarctic continent should be sent to her to say that i was safe and everything going splendid what happened on christmas day is a longer story on the eighteenth of december having landed some of my deck cargo and provisions and sent up my ship to winter quarters i was on my way with ponies dogs and sledges and a large company of men all in a condition to the lower summit of mount erebus for i intended to set up my first electricpowerwave station therethat being high enough we thought to permit of a message reaching the plateau of the polar zone and low enough allowing for the curvature of the earth to cover the maximum distance in a northerly direction it was a long reach but we chose the rocky ridges and moraines trying to avoid the crevassed glaciers and all went well until the twentieth when just as we were reaching the steeper gradients a strong wind sprang up blowing straight down the course before us all day long we toiled against it but the weather grew worse with gusts of sleet and snow until the wind reached the force of a hurricane and the temperature fell to degrees below zero there was nothing to do but to wait for the blizzard to blow itself out so we plugged down our tents in the shelter of the rocky side of a ravine that had an immense snowfield behind it the first night was bad enough for the canvas of one tent flew into ribbons and the poor chaps in it had to lie uncovered in their halffrozen sleepingbags until morning all through the twentyfirst twentysecond and twentythird the storm continued sweeping with terrific force down the ravine and whirling the snow in dense masses from the snowfield overhead christmas eve was worse with the temperature down to degrees below zero and the wind up to eighty miles an hour in gusts and during the greater part of christmas day we were all confined to our sleepingbags and half buried in the snow that had drifted in on us as a consequence we had no religious service and if anybody said a de profundis it was between his crackling lips under his frozen beard we had no christmas dinner either except a few plasmon biscuits and a nip of brandy and water which were served out by good old osullivan who had come with me as doctor to the expedition on st stephens day i made a round of the camp and found the ponies suffering terribly and the dogs badly hit the storm was telling on the men too for some of them were down with dysentery and the toes of one poor chap were black from frostbite i was fit enough myself thank god but suffering from want of sleep or rather from a restless feeling which broken sleep brought with it the real truth is that never since i sailed had i been able to shake off the backward thought that i ought not to have left my dear one behind me in active work like the gale i could dismiss the idea of her danger but now that i had nothing to do but to lie like a log in a sleepingbag i suffered terribly from my recollection of her selfsacrifice and my fear of the consequences that might come of it this was not so bad in the daytime for even in the midst of the whirling snow and roaring wind i had only to close my eyes and i could see her as she came up the road in the sunshine that sunday morning when she was returning from church in her drooping hat and fluttering veil or as she looked at me with her great seeing eyes at the last moment of all when she compelled me to come away but the night was the devil no sooner did i drop off to sleep than i awoke with a start at the sound of her voice calling me by my name martin martin it was always a voice of distress and though i am no dreamer and i think no crank i could not get away from the idea that she was crying to me to come back that was about the one thing in the world that was impossible to me now and yet i knew that getting assurance from somewhere that my dear one was being cared for was the only way to set my mind at rest for the job that was before me it may seem ridiculous that i should have thought of that but everybody who has ever been with nature in her mighty solitudes aloof from the tides of life knows that the soul of man is susceptible down there to signs which would seem childish amid the noise and bustle of the world it was like that with me i shared my tent with osullivan the chief of our scientific staff and treacle who thought it his duty to take care of me though the work was generally the other way about the old salt had been badly battered and i had not liked the way he had been mumbling about mother which is not a good sign in a stalwart chap when his strength is getting low so while buttoning up the tent on the night after christmas day i was a bit touched up to see old treacle who had lived the life of a rip fumbling at his breast and hauling something out with an effort it was a wooden image of the virgin about the length of my hand daubed over with gilt and blue paint and when he stuck it up in front of his face as he lay in his sleepingbag i knew that he expected to go out before morning and wished that to be the last thing his old eyes should rest on i am not much of a man for saints myself having found that we get out of tight places middling well without them but perhaps what treacle did got down into some secret place of my soul for i felt calmer as i fell asleep and when i awoke it was not from the sound of my darlings voice but from a sort of deafening silence the roaring of the wind had ceased the blizzard was over the lamp that hung from the staff of the tent had gone out and there was a sheet of light coming in from an aperture in the canvas it was the midnight sun of the antarctic and when i raised my head i saw that it fell full on the little gilded image of the virgin anybody who has never been where i was then may laugh if he likes and welcome but that was enough for me it was all right somebody was looking after my dear one i shouted to my shipmates to get up and make ready and at dawn when we started afresh on our journey there may have been dark clouds over our heads but the sun was shining inside of us mc end of martin conrads memorandum eightyfourth chapter sister mildred was right our blessed lady must have interceded for me because help came immediately i awoke on st stephens morning with that thrilling emotion which every mother knows to be the first real and certain consciousness of motherhood it is not for me to describe the physical effects of that great change but the spiritual effect is another matter it was like that of a miracle god in his great mercy looking down on me in my sorrow had sent one of his ministering angels to comfort me it seemed to say dont be afraid he who went away is not lost to you something of himself is about to return i felt no longer that i was to be left alone in my prisonhouse of london because martins child was to bear me companyto be a link between us an everlasting bond so that he and i should be together to the end i tremble to say what interpretation i put upon all thishow it seemed to be a justification of what i did on the night before martin left ellan as if god knowing he would not return had prompted me so that when my dark hour came i might have this great hope for my comforter and oh how wonderful it was how strange how mysterious how joyful every day and all day and always i was conscious of my unborn child as a fluttering bird held captive in the hand the mystery and the joy of the coming life soothed away my sorrow and if i had shed any tears they would have dried them and then the future i seemed to know from the first that it was to be a girl and already i could see her face and look into her seablue eyes as she grew up i would talk to her of her fatherthe brave explorer the man of destiny who laid down his life in a great work for the world we should always be talking of himwe two alone together because he belonged to us and nobody else in the world besides everything i have written here i should tell herat least the beautiful part of it the part about our love which nothing in life and not even death itself could quench oh the joy of those days it may seem strange that i should have been so happy so soon after my bereavement but i cannot help it if it was so and it was so perhaps it was a sort of hysteria due to the great change in my physical condition i do not know i do not think i want to know but one thing is surethat hope and prayer and the desire of life awoke in me again as by the touch of gods own hand and i became another and a happier woman such was the condition in which mildred found me when she returned a few days later then she brought me down plump to material matters we had first to consider the questions of ways and means in order to find out how to face the future it was the beginning of january my appointed time was in june and i had only some sixteen pounds of my money left so it was clear that i could not stay in the boardinghouse much longer happily mildred knew of homes where women could live inexpensively during their period of waiting they were partly philanthropic and therefore subject to certain regulations which my resolute determination not to mention martins name or permit it to be mentioned might make it difficult for me to observe but mildred hoped to find one that would take me on her recommendation without asking further question in this expectation we set out in search of a maternity home what a day of trial we had i shall never forget it the first home we called at was a catholic one in the neighbourhood of our boardinghouse it had the appearance of a convent and that pleased me exceedingly after we had passed the broad street door with its large brass plate and small brass grille we were shown into a little waitingroom with tiled floor distempered walls and coloured pictures of the saints the porteress told us the mother was at prayers with the inmates but would come downstairs presently and while we waited we heard the dull hum of voices the playing of an organ and the singing of the sweet music i knew so well closing my eyes i felt myself back in rome and began to pray that i might be permitted to remain there but the desire was damped when the mother entered the room she was a stout woman wearing heavy outdoor boots and carrying her arms interlaced before her with the hands hidden in the ample sleeves of her habit and her face was so white and expressionless that it might have been cast in plaster of paris in a rather nervous voice mildred explained our errand mother she said i cannot tell you anything about this young lady and i have come to ask if you will take her on my recommendation my dear child said the mother that would be utterly against our rule not to know who the young lady is where she comes from why she is here and whether she is married or single or a widowit is quite impossible mildred looking confused and ashamed said she can afford to pay a little that makes no difference but i thought that in exceptional cases there can be no exceptional cases sister if the young lady is married and can say that her husband consents or single and can give us assurance that her father or guardian agrees or a widow and can offer satisfactory references mildred looked across at me but i shook my head in that case there seems to be nothing more to say said the mother and rising without ceremony she walked with us to the door our next call was at the headquarters of a home which was neither catholic nor protestant but belonged mildred said to a kind of universal church admitting inmates of all denominations it was in a busy thoroughfare and had the appearance of a business office after mildred had written her name and the object of our visit on a slip of paper we were taken up in a lift to another office with an open safe where a man in a kind of uniform called a commissioner was signing letters and cheques the commissioner was at first very courteous especially to me and i had an uncomfortable feeling that he was mistaking me for something quite other than i was until mildred explained our errand and then his manner changed painfully what you ask is against all our regulations he said secrecy implies something to hide and we neither hide anything nor permit anything to be hidden in fact our system requires that we should not only help the woman but punish the man by making him realise his legal moral and religious liability for his wrongdoing naturally we can only do this by help of the girl and if she does not tell us at the outset who and what the partner of her sin has been and where he is to be found i was choking with shame and indignation and rising to my feet i said to mildred let us go please ah yes i know said the commissioner with a superior smile i have seen all this before the girl nearly always tries to shield the guilty man but why should she it may seem generous but it is really wicked it is a direct means of increasing immorality the girl who protects the author of her downfall is really promoting the ruin of another woman and if thinking of martin i wanted to strike the smug pharisee in the face and in order to conquer that unwomanly impulse i hurried out of the office and into the street leaving poor mildred to follow me our last call was at the home of a private society in a little brick house that seemed to lean against the wall of a large lyingin hospital in the west end of london at the moment of our arrival the matron was presiding in the drawingroom over a meeting of a missionary league for the conversion of the jews so we were taken through a narrow lobby into a little backparlour which overlooked through a glass screen a large apartment wherein a number of young women who had the appearance of dressmakers ladies maids and governesses were sewing tiny pieces of linen and flannel that were obviously babyclothes there were no carpets on the floors and the house had a slight smell of carbolic the ticktick of sewing machines on the other side of the screen mingled with the deadened sound of the clapping of hands in the room overhead after a while there was rustle of dresses coming down the bare stairs followed by the opening and closing of the front door and then the matron came into the parlour she was a very tall flatbosomed woman in a plain black dress and she seemed to take in our situation instantly without waiting for mildreds explanation she began to ask my name my age and where i came from mildred fenced these questions as well as she could and then with even more nervousness than ever made the same request as before the matron seemed aghast most certainly not she said my committee would never dream of such a thing in the interests of the unfortunate girls who have fallen from the path of virtue as well as their still more unfortunate offspring we always make the most searching inquiries in fact we keep a record of every detail of every case listen to this she added and opening a large leatherbound hook like a ledger she began to read one of its entries hj aged eighteen years born of very respectable parents was led astray that was not the word in a lonely road very late at night by a sailor who was never afterwards heard of but i could bear no more and rising from my seat i fled from the room and the house into the noisy street outside all day long my whole soul had been in revolt it seemed to me that while god in his gracious mercy was giving me my child to comfort and console me to uplift and purify me and make me a better woman than i had been before man with his false and cruel morality with his machinemade philanthropy was trying to use it as a whip to punish not only me but martin but that it should never do never as long as i lived i would die in the streets first perhaps i was wrong and did not understand myself and certainly mildred did not understand me when she rejoined me in the street we turned our faces homeward and were half way back to the boardinghouse before we spoke again then she said i am afraid the other institutions will be the same theyll all want references i answered that they should never get them but your money will be done soon my child and then what is to become of you no matter i said for i had already determined to face the world myself without help from anybody there was a silence again until we reached the door of our boardinghouse and then mildred said mary your father is a rich man and however much you may have displeased him he cannot wish you to be left to the mercy of the worldespecially when your time comes let me write to him that terrified me for i saw only one resultan open quarrel between my father and my husband about the legitimacy of my child who would probably be taken away from me as soon as it was born so taking mildred by the arm regardless of the observation of passersby i begged and prayed and implored of her not to write to my father she promised not to do so and we parted on good terms but i was not satisfied and the only result of our days journeying was that i became possessed of the idea that the whole world was conspiring to rob me of my unborn child a few days later mildred called again and then she said i had another letter from father donovan this morning mary your poor priest is brokenhearted about you he is sure you are in london and certain you are in distress and says that with or without his bishops consent he is coming up to london to look for you and will never go back until you are found i began to suspect mildred in the fever of my dread of losing my child i convinced myself that with the best intentions in the world merely out of love for me and pity for my position she would give me upperhaps in the very hour of my peril to make this impossible i determined to cut myself off from her and everybody else by leaving the boardinghouse and taking another and cheaper lodging far enough away i was encouraged in this course by the thought of my diminishing resources and though heaven knows i had not too many comforts where i was i reproached myself for spending so much on my own needs when i ought to be economising for the coming of my child the end of it all was that one morning early i went down to the corner of oxford street where the motoromnibuses seem to come and go from all parts of london north south east and west were all one to me leading to labyrinths of confused and interminable streets and i knew as little as a child which of them was best for my purpose but chance seems to play the greatest part in our lives and at that moment it was so with me i was standing on the edge of the pavement when a motorbus labelled bayswater road stopped immediately in front of me and i stepped into it not knowing in the least why i did so late that evening having found what i wanted i returned in the mingled mist and darkness to the boardinghouse to pack up my belongings that was not difficult to do and after settling my account and sending young john for a cab i was making for the door when the landlady came up to me will you not leave your new address my dear lest anybody should call she said nobody will call i answered but in case there should he letters there will be no letters i said and whispering to the driver to drive up oxford street i got into the cab it was then quite dark the streets and shops were alight and i remembered that as i crossed the top of the charing cross road i looked down in the direction of the lofty building in which mildreds window would be shining like a lighthouse over piccadilly poor dear illrequited mildred she has long ago forgiven me she knows now that when i ran away from the only friend i had in london it was because i could not help it she knows too that i was not thinking of myself and that in diving still deeper into the dungeon of the great city in hiding and burying myself away in it i was asking nothing of god but that he would let me live the rest of my lifeno matter how poor and lonelywith the child that he was sending to be a living link between my lost one and me in the light of what happened afterwards that was all so strange and oh so wonderful and miraculous eightyfifth chapter my new quarters were in the poorer district which stands at the back of bayswater the street was a culdesac of some ten small houses on either side which was blocked up at the further end by the high wall of a factory for the humanization of milk and opened out of a busy thoroughfare of interior shops like a gullyway off a noisy coast my home in this street was in number one and i had been attracted to it by a printed card in the semicircular fanlight over the front door saying a room to let furnished my room which was of fair size was on the first floor and had two windows to the street with yellow holland blinds and white muslin curtains the furniture consisted of a large bed a horsehair sofa three canebottomed chairs a chest of drawers which stood between the windows and a mirror over the mantelpiece which had pink paper cut into fanciful patterns over the gilt frame to keep off the flies the floor was covered with linoleum but there were two strips of carpet one before the fire and the other by the bed the walls were papered with a bright red paper representing peonies in bloom and there were three picturesa portrait of a great welsh preacher with a bardic name dyfed an engraving entitled feed my sheep showing jesus carrying a lamb and a memorial card of some member of the family of the house in the form of a tomb with a weeping angel on either side i paid five shilling a week for my room and as this included the use of kettle cooking utensils and crockery i found to my great delight at the end of the first week that providing for myself tea bread and butter and eggs being my principal food i had only spent ten shillings altogether which according to my present needs left me enough for my time of waiting and several weeks beyond every morning i went out with a little handbag to buy my provisions in the front street and every afternoon i took a walk in the better part of bayswater and even into the park hyde park which was not far off but never near piccadilly or so far east as bloomsbury lest i should meet sister mildred or be recognized by the old boarders i had no key to my lodgings but when i returned home i knocked at the front door which was at the top of a short flight of steps from the pavement and then a string was pulled in the cellarkitchen in which the family of my landlady lived whereupon the bolt was shot back and the door opened of itself finding it necessary to account for myself here as at the boardinghouse i had adhered to my former name but said i was the widow of a commander lately lost at sea which was as near to the truth as i dared venture i had also made no disguise of the fact that i was expecting a child a circumstance which secured me much sympathy from the kindhearted souls who were now my neighbours they were all womanly women generally the wives of men working in the milk factory and therefore the life of our street was very regular at five in the morning you heard the halting step of the old knocker up who went up and down the street tapping at the bedroom windows with a long pole like a fishingrod a little before six you heard the clashing of many front doors and the echoing footsteps of the men going to their work at halfpast seven you heard the whoop of the milkman and the rattling of his cans at halfpast eight you heard the little feet of the children like the pattering of rain going off to the board school round the corner and a little after four in the afternoon you heard the wild cries of the juvenile community let loose from lessons the boys trundling iron hoops and the girls skipping to a measured tune over a rope stretched from parapet to parapet after that our street hummed like a beehive with the women washed and combed standing knitting at their open doors or exchanging confidences across the areas until darkness fell and each of the mothers called her children into bed as an old hen in the farmyard clucks up her chickens these good creatures were very kind to me having satisfied themselves from observation of my habits that i was respectable they called me our lady and i could not help hearing that i was a nice young thing though it was a little against me that i did not go to church or chapel and had confessed to being a catholicfor several of our families including that of my landlady were members of the welsh zion chapel not far away such was the life of the little human cage to which i had confined myself but i had an inner life that was all my own and very sweet to me during the long hours of every day in which i was alone i occupied myself in the making of clothes for my babybuying linen and flannel and worsted and borrowing patterns from my welsh landlady this stimulated my tenderness towards the child that was to come for the heart of a young mother is almost infantile and i hardly know whether to laugh or cry when i think of the childish things i did and thought and said to myself in those first days when i was alone in my room in that back street in bayswater thus long before baby was born i had christened her at first i wished to call her mary not because i cared for that name myself but because martin had said it was the most beautiful in the world in the end however i called her isabel mary because isabel was my mothers name and she had been a far better woman than i was and as i finished my babys garments one by one i used to put them away in their drawer saying to myself thats isabel marys binder or isabel marys christeningrobe as the case might be i dare say it was all very foolish there are tears in my eyes when i think of it now but there were none then for though there were moments when remembering martin i felt as if life were for ever blank i was almost happy in my poor surroundings and if it was a cage i had fixed myself in there was always a bird singing inside of itthe bird that sang in my own bosom when isabel mary comes everything will he all right i used to think this went on for many weeks and perhaps it might have gone on until my time was full but for something which occurring under my eyes made me tremble with the fear that the life i was living and the hope i was cherishing were really very wrong and selfish of my landlady mrs williams i saw little she was a rather hard but no doubt heavilyladen woman who had to do for a swarm of children besides two young men lodgers who lived in the kitchen and slept in the room behind mine her husband was a quiet man a carter at the dairy whom i never saw at all except on the staircase at ten oclock at night when after winding the tall clock on the landing he went upstairs to bed in his stocking feet but the outstanding member of the family for me was a shockheaded girl of fourteen called emmerjane which was a running version of emma jane i understood that emmerjane was the illegitimate daughter of mrs williamss dead sister and that she had been born in carnarvon which still shimmered in her memory in purple and gold emmerjane was the drudge of the family and i first saw her in the street at dusk mothering a brood of her little cousins taking hughie by one hand and katie by the other and telling gwennie to lay hold of davie lest he should be run over by the milk vans afterwards she became my drudge alsowashing my floor bringing up my coals and cleaning my grate for sixpence a week and giving me a great deal of information about my neighbours for nothing thus she told me speaking broad cockney with a welsh accent that the people opposite were named wagstaffe and that the creaking noise i heard was that of a mangle which mrs wagstaffe had to keep because her husband was a drunkard who stole her money and came home asaturday nights when the publichouses turned out and beat her somethink shockin though she always forgave him the next day and then the creaking went on as before but the greatest interest of this weird little woman who had a premature knowledge of things a child ought not to know was in a house halfway down the street on the other side where steam was always coming from the open door to the front kitchen the people who lived there were named jones mrs jones washed and had a bedridden old mother with two shillings from the guardians and a daughter named maggie maggie jones who was eighteen and very pretty used to work in the dairy but the foreman had tiken advantage of her and she had just had a baby this foreman was named owen owens and he lived at the last number on our side where two unmarried sisters kept house for him and sat in the singing seat at zion maggie thought it was the sisters fault that owen owens did not marry her so she conceived a great scheme for besting them and this was the tragedy which through emmerjanes quick little eyes and her cockneywelsh tongue came to me in instalments day by day when her baby was a month old maggie dressed it up fine and took it to the photographers for its card di visit the photographs were a long time coming but when they came they were heavenly lovely and maggie cried to look at them then she put one in an envelope and addressed it to owen owens and though it had only to cross the street she went out after dark to a pillarbox a long way off lest anybody should see her posting it next day she said hell have it now for he always comes home to dinner hell take it up to his bedroom look you and stand it on the washstand and if either of those sisters touch it hell give them whats what after that she waited anxiously for an acknowledgment and every time the postman passed down our street her pretty pale face would be at the door saying anything for me today or are you sure theres nothing for me postman at length a letter came and maggie jones trembled so much that she dared not open it but at last she tripped up to her room to be all of herself and then then there was a wild screech and when emmerjane ran upstairs maggie was stretched out on the floor in a dead faint clutching in her tight hand the photograph which owen owens had returned with the words written in his heavy scrawl across the facemaggie joness bastard it would be impossible to say how this incident affected me i felt as if a moral earthquake had opened under my feet what had i been doing in looking forward to the child that was to come to me i had been thinking only of my own comfortmy own consolation but what about the child itself if my identity ever became knownand it might at any moment by the casual recognition of a person in the streethow should the position of my child differ from that of this poor girl a being born out of the pale of the law as my husband would say it must be an outcast a thing of shame without a father to recognise it and with its mothers sin to lash its back for ever when i thought of that much as i had longed for the child that was to be a living link between martin and me i asked myself if i had any right to wish for it i felt i had no right and that considering my helpless position the only true motherly love was to pray that my baby might be stillborn but that was too hard it was too terrible it was like a second bereavement i could not and would not do it never never never i told myself eightysixth chapter thinking matters out in the light of maggie joness story i concluded that poverty was at the root of nearly everything if i could stave off poverty no real harm could come to my child i determined to do so but there was only one way open to me at presentand that was to retrench my expenses i did retrench them persuading myself that i had no real need of this and that i reduced my weekly outlay this gave me immense pleasure and even when i saw after a while that i was growing thin and pale i felt no selfpity of any sort remembering that i had nobody to look well for now and only the sweet and glorious duty before me of providing for my child i convinced myself too that my altered appearance was natural to my condition and that all i needed was fresh air and exercise therefore i determined to walk every day in the park i did so once only it was one of those lovely mornings in early spring when the air and the sky of london after the long fog and grime of winter seem to be washed by showers of sunshine i had entered by a gate to a broad avenue and was resting for i was rather tired on a seat under a chestnut tree whose glistening sheaths were swelling and breaking into leaf when i saw a number of ladies and gentlemen on horseback coming in my direction i recognised one of them instantly it was mr vivian and a beautiful girl was riding beside him my heart stood still for i thought he would see me but he was too much occupied with his companion to do so yes by jove its killing isnt it he said in his shrill voice and with his monocle in his molelike eye he rode past me laughing after that i took my walks in the poorer streets behind bayswater but there i was forced back on my old problem for i seemed to be always seeing the sufferings of children thank god children as a whole are happy they seem to live in their hearts alone and i really and truly believe that if all the doors of the rich houses of the west end of london were thrown open to the poor children of the east end they would stay in their slums and alleys but some of them suffer there for all that especially the unfortunate ones who enter the world without any legal right to be here and i seemed to be coming upon that kind everywhere one evening i saw a tiny boy of five sheltering from the rain under a dripping and draughty railway arch and crying as if his little heart would break i tried to comfort him and could not but when a rather shamefaced young woman came along as if returning from her work he burst out on her and cried oh muvver shes been abeating of me awrful never mind johnny said the young woman kneeling on the wet pavement to dry the childs eyes dont cry thats a good boy it needed no second sight to look into the heart of that tragedy and the effect of it upon me was to make me curtail my expenditure still further looking back on those days i cannot but wonder that i never tried to find employment but there was one delicate impediment thenmy condition which was becoming visible i thought to people in the street and causing some of them especially women to look round at me when this became painful i discontinued my walks altogether and sent emmerjane on my few errands then my room became my world i do not think i ever saw a newspaper and knowing nothing of what was going on beyond the surge and swell of the life of london as it came to me when i opened my window i had now more than ever the sense of living in a dungeon on a rock in the middle of the sea having no exercise i ate less and less but i found a certain joy in that for i was becoming a miser for my childs sake and the only pain i suffered was when i went to my drawer as i did every day and looked at my rapidly diminishing store i knew that my welsh landlady was beginning to call me close meaning mean but that did not trouble me in the least because i told myself that every penny i saved out of my own expenses was for my child to keep her from poverty and all the evils and injustices that followed in its train as my appointed time drew near my sleep was much broken and sometimes in the middle of the night when i heard a solitary footstep going down the street i would get up draw aside one of my blinds and see a light burning in some bedroom window opposite and afterwards hear the muffled cry of the small new being who had come as another immigrant into our chill little world but i made no arrangements for myself until my welsh landlady came up to my room one day and asked if i had settled with a doctor when i answered no she held up her hands and cried good gracious just as i thought theest got to lose no time though happily there was a doctor in our street nearly every day and if i wished it she would call him up to me i agreed and the doctor came next morning he was a tall elderly man with cold eyes compressed lips and a sour expression and neither his manner nor his speech gave any hint of a consciousness which i am sure every true doctor must have that in coming to a woman in my condition he was entering one of the sacred chambers of human life he asked me a few abrupt questions told me when he would come again and then spoke about his fee my fee is a guinea and i usually get it in advance he said whereupon i went to my drawer and took out a sovereign and a shilling not without a certain pang at seeing so much go in a moment after i had been saving so long the doctor had dropped the money into his waistcoat pocket with oh such a casual air and was turning to go when my welsh landlady said hers not doing herself justice in the matter of food doctor why what do you eat asked the doctor and as well as i could out of my dry and parched throat i told him tut tut this will never do he said its your duty to your child to have better food than that something light and nourishing every day such as poultry fish chicken broth beeftea and farinaceous foods generally i gasped what was the doctor thinking about remember he said with his finger up the health of the child is intimately dependent on the health of the mother when the mother is in a morbid state it affects the composition of the blood and does great harm to the health of the offspring both immediately and in after life dont forget now good day that was a terrible shock to me in my great ignorance and great love i had been depriving myself for the sake of my child and now i learned that i had all the time been doing it a grave and perhaps lifelong injury trying to make amends i sent out for some of the expensive foods the doctor had ordered me but when they were cooked i found to my dismay that i had lost the power of digesting them my pain at this discovery was not lessened next day when my welsh landlady brought up a nurse whom i had asked her to engage for me the woman was a human dumpling with a discordant voice and her first interest like that of the doctor seemed to centre in her fee she told me that her usual terms were a guinea for the fortnight but when she saw my face fall for i could not help thinking how little i had left she said some ladies dont need a fortnight though mrs wagstaffe for instance she never has no more than five days and on the sixth shes back at her mangle so if five will do maam perhaps ten and six wont hurt you i agreed and the nurse was rolling her ample person out of my room when my welsh landlady said but hers not eating enough to keep a linnet look you and then my nurse who was what the doctor calls a croaker began on a long series of stories of ladies who having let themselves down had died either at childbirth or soon afterwards its after a lady feels it if she has to nurse her baby said the nurse and i couldnt be responsible neither for you nor the child if you dont do yourself justice this was a still more terrible possibilitythe possibility that i might die and leave my child behind me the thought haunted me all that day and the following night but the climax came next morning when emmerjane while blackleading my grate gave me the last news of maggie jones maggies mother had been anaggin of her to get work asking if she had not enough mouths to feed without her bringin another maggie had at first been afraid to look for employment thinking everybody knew of her trouble but after her mother had put the young minister from zion on to her to tell her to be obejent she had gone out every day whether the weather was good or bad or mejum this had gone on for three months during which maggie used to stay out late because she was afraid to meet her mothers face until one wet night less than a week ago she had come home drenched to the skin taken to her bed sickened for somethink and died three days after emmerjane told me this story a great solemnity fell on our street it was saturday when the children do not go to school but playing no games they gathered in whispering groups round the house with the drawn blinds while their mothers stood bareheaded at the doors with their arms under their aprons and their hidden hands over their mouths i tried not to know what was going on but looking out at the last moment i saw maggie joness mother dressed in black coming down her steps with her eyes very red and her hard face which was seamed with labour all wet and broken up the young minister followed a beardless boy who could have known nothing of the tragedy of a womans life and stepping into the midst of the group of the congregation from zion who had gathered there with their warm welsh hearts full of pity for the dead girl he gave out a welsh hymn and they sang it in the london street just as they had been used to do at the cottage doors in the midst of their native mountains bydd myrdd o ryfeddodau ar doriad boreu wawr i could look no longer so i turned back into my room but at the next moment i heard the rumble of wheels and knew that maggie jones was on her way to her last mother of allthe earth during the rest of that day i could think of nothing but maggies child and what was to become of it and next morning when emmerjane came up she told me that the young minister was agettin it into the ouse i think that was the last straw of my burden for my mind came back with a swift rebound from maggie joness child to my own the thought of leaving my baby behind now terrified and appalled me it brought me no comfort to think that though i was poor my father was rich for i knew that if he ever came to know of my childs existence he would hate it and cast it off as the central cause of the downfall of his plans yet martins child alone and at the mercy of the world it could not and must not be then came a fearful thought i fought against it i said many hail marys to protect myself from it but i could not put it away perhaps my physical condition was partly to blame others must judge of that it is only for me to say in all truth and sincerity what i felt and thought when i stood as every woman who is to be a mother must at the door of that dark chamber which is lifes greatest mystery i thought of how martin had been taken from me as fate perhaps for some good purpose still unrevealed had led me to believe i thought of how i had comforted myself with the hope of the child that was coming to be a link between us i thought of the sweet hours i had spent in making my babys clothes in choosing her name in whispering it to myself yes and to god too every night and every morning i thought of how day by day i had trimmed the little lamp i kept burning in the sanctuary within my breast where my baby and i lived together i thought of how this had taken the sting out of death and victory out of the grave and after that i told myself that however sweet and beautiful all this had been selfishness and i must put it away then i thought of the child itself whoconceived in sin as my church would say disinherited by the law outlawed by society inheriting my physical weaknesses having lost one of its parents and being liable to lose the otherwas now in danger of being left to the mercies of the world banned from its birth penniless and without a protector to become a drudge and an outcast or even a thief a gambler or a harlot this was what i thought and felt and when at last i knew that i had come to the end of my appointed time i knelt down in my sad room and if ever i prayed a fervent prayer if ever my soul went up to god in passionate supplication it was that the child i had longed for and looked forward to as a living link with my lost one might be born dead oh god whatever happens to me let my baby be born deadi pray i beseech thee perhaps it was a wicked prayer god knows he will be just eightyseventh chapter it was saturday the seventh of june the summer had been a cold one thus far the night was chill and heavy rain was beating against the windowpane there was a warm fire in my room for the first time for several months the single gas jet on the window side of the mantelpiece had been turned low and the nurse in list slippers was taking my little flannel and linen garments out of the chest of drawers and laying them on the flat steel fender i think i must have had intervals of insensibility for the moments of consciousness came and went with me like the diving and rising of a seabird in the midst of swelling waves at one such moment i became aware that the doctor and my welsh landlady as well as my nurse were in the room and that they were waiting for the crisis and fearing for my life i heard them talking in low voices which made a drumming noise in my ears like that which the sea makes when it is rolling into a cave shes let herself down so low pore thing that i dont know in the world whats to happen to her as god is my witness look you i never saw anybody live on so little im not afraid of the mother im more afraid of the child if you ask me then the drumming noise would die out and i would only hear something within myself saying oh god oh god that my child may be born dead at another moment i heard above the rattle of the rain the creaking of the mangle in the cellarkitchen on the other side of the street at still another moment i heard the sound of quarrelling in the house opposite a woman was screaming children were shrieking and a man was swearing in a thick hoarse voice i knew what had happenedit was midnight the publichouses had turned out and mr wagstaffe had came home drunk the night passed heavily i heard myself as i had done before calling on martin in a voice of wild entreaty martin martin then remembering that he was gone i began again to pray i heard myself praying to the blessed virgin oh mother of my god let my child but a voice which seemed to come from far away interrupted me hush bach hush it will make it harder for thee at length peace came it seemed to me that i was running out of a tempestuous sea with its unlimited loneliness and cruel depth into a quiet harbour there was a heavenly calm in which i could hear the doctor and the nurse and my welsh landlady talking together in cheerful whispers i knew that everything was over and with the memory of the storm i had passed through still in my heart and brain i said is it dead dead cried the nurse in a voice several octaves higher than usual dear heart no but alive and well a beautiful little girl yes your baby is all right maam said the doctor and then my welsh landlady cried why didst think it would be dead bach as i am a christian woman theest got the beautifullest baby that ever breathed i could bear no more the dark thoughts of the days before were over me still and with a groan i turned to the wall then everything was wiped out as by an angels wing and i fell into a deep sleep when i awoke my dark thoughts were vanishing away like a bad dream in the morning the rain had ceased the gas had been put out and i could see by the glow on the peonies of the wallpaper that the sun was shining with a soft red light through the holland blinds of my windows i heard the sparrows chirping on the sills outside i heard the milkman rattling his cans i heard the bells of a neighbouring church ringing for early communion i closed my eyes and held my breath and listened to the sounds in my own room i heard the kettle singing over the fire i heard somebody humming softly and beating a foot on the floor in time to the tune and then i heard a low voice it was emmerjanes saying from somewhere near my bed i dunno but what shes awake her breathing aint agoin now then i turned and saw the nurse sitting before the fire with something on her lap i knew what it was it was my child and it was asleep in spite of my dark thoughts my heart yearned for it and then came the great miracle my child awoke and began to cry it was a faint cry oh so thin and weak but it went thundering and thundering through me there was a moment of awful struggle and then a mighty torrent of love swept over me it was motherhood my child mine flesh of my flesh oh god oh god all my desire for my babys death to save it from the pains of life was gone and my heart starved so long throbbed with tenderness i raised myself in bed in spite of my nurses protest and cried to her to give me my baby give her to me give her to me byandby byandby said the nurse now now i can wait no longer but you must take some food first emmerjane give her that glass of milk and water i drank the milk just to satisfy them and then held out my arms for my child give her to mequick quick here she is then the jewel oh the joy of that moment when i first took my baby in my arms and looked into her face and saw my own features and the seablue eyes of martin oh the rapture of my first eager kiss i suppose i must have been rough with my little cherub in the fervour of my love for she began to cry again there there said the nurse be good now or i must take baby away but heaven had taught me another lesson and instantly instinctively i put my baby to my breast instantly and instinctively too my baby turned to it with its little mouth open and its little fingers feeling for the place oh god my god oh mother of my god and then in that happiness that is beyond all earthly blissthe happiness of a mother when she first clasps her baby to her breasti began to cry i had not cried for monthsnot since that night in ellan which i did not wish to remember any morebut now my tears gushed out and ran down my face like rain i cried on martin once morei could not help it and looking down at the closed eyes of my child my soul gushed out in gratitude to god who had sent me this for all i had suffered hush hush you will do yourself a mischief and it will be bad for the milk said the nurse after that i tried to control myself but i found a fierce and feverish delight in suckling my child it seemed as if every drop my baby drew gave me a spiritual as well as a physical joycooling my blood and my brain and wiping out all my troubles oh mystery of mysteries oh miracle of miracles my baby was at my breast and my sufferings were at an end eightyeighth chapter that was a long long day of happiness it was both very long and very short for it passed like a dream what wonderful happenings were crowded into it first the nurse from the dizzy heights of her greater experience and superior knowledge indulged my infantile anxieties by allowing me to look on while baby was being bathed and rewarded me for being good by many praises of my babys beauty ive nursed amany in my time she said but i dont mind saying as ive never had a bonnier babby on my knee look at her legs now so white and plump and dimpled have you ever seen anythink so putty i confessed that i never had and when nurse showed me how to fix the binder and put on the barrowcoat without disturbing baby while asleep i thought her a wonderful woman emmerjane who had with difficulty been kept out of the room last night and was now rushing breathlessly up and down stairs wished to hold baby for a moment and at length out of the magnificence of my generosity i allowed her to do so only warning her as she loved her life to hold tight and not let baby fall howd you mean said the premature little mother me let her fall not much every hour according to the doctors orders i gave baby the breast i do not know which was my greatest joyto feast my eyes on her while she sucked and to see her little head fall back with her little mouth open when she had had enough or to watch her when she stretched herself and hiccoughed and then grasped my thumb with her little tight fingers oh the wild inexpressible delight of it every hour had its surprise every few minutes had their cause of wonder it rather hurt me when baby cried and i dare say my own foolish lip would drop at such moments but when i saw that there were no tears in her eyes and she was only calling for her food i pleaded with nurse to let me give her the breast again the sun shone all day long and though the holland window blinds were kept down to subdue the light for my sake and perhaps for babys i thought my room looked perfectly beautiful it might be poor and shabby but flights of angels could not have made it more heavenly than it was in my eyes then in the afternoon nurse told me i must take some sleep myself but i would not sleep until baby slept so she had to give me my cherub again and i sat up and rocked her and for a while i sangas softly as i coulda little lullaby it was a lullaby i had learned at nemi from the italian women in embroidered outside stays who so love their children and though i knew quite well that it had been written for the mother of all mothers who after she had been turned away from every door had been forced to take refuge in a stable in bethlehem i was in such an ecstasy of spiritual happiness that i thought it no irreverence to change it a little and to sing it in my london lodging to my human child sleep little baby i love thee i love thee sleep little queen i am bending above thee i dare say my voice was sweet that daya mothers voice is always sweetfor when emmerjane who had been out of the room came back to it with a look of awed solemnity she said well i never did i thought as ow there was a angel acome into this room so there is and here she is i said beaming down on my sleeping child but the long short blissful day came to an end at last and when night fell and i dropped asleep there were two names of my dear ones on my lips and if one of them was the name of him who as i thought was in heaven the other was the name of her who was now lying in my arms i may have been poor but i felt like a queen with all the riches of life in my little room i may have sinned against the world and the church but i felt as if god had justified me by his own triumphant law the whole feminine soul in me seemed to swell and throb and with my baby at my breast i wanted no more of earth or heaven i was still bleeding from the bruises of fate but i felt healed of all my wounds loaded with benefits crowned with rewards four days passed like this varied by visits from the doctor and my welsh landlady then my nurse began to talk of leaving me i did not care in my ignorance of my condition and the greed of my motherly love i was not sorry she was going so soon indeed i was beginning to be jealous of her and was looking forward to having my baby all to myself but nurse as i remember was a little ashamed and tried to excuse herself if i hadnt promised to nurse another lady i wouldnt leave you money or no money she said but the girl meaning emmerjane is always here and if she isnt like a nurse shes andy yes yes i shall be all right i answered on the fifth day my nurse left me and shocking as that fact seems to me now i thought little of it then i was entirely happy i had nothing in the world except my baby and my baby had nothing in the world except me i was still in the dungeon that had seemed so dreadful to me beforethe great dungeon of london to one who is poor and friendless but no matter i was no longer alone for there was one more inmate in my prisonhousemy child sixth part i am lost is it nothing to you ye that pass by memorandum by martin conrad i hate to butt in where i may not be wanted but if the remainder of my darlings story is to be understood i must say what was happening in the meantime to me god knows there was never a day on which i did not think of my dear one at home wondering what was happening to her and whether a certain dark fact which always lay at the back of my mind as a possibility was actually coming to pass but she would be bravei know that quite welland i saw plainly that if i had to get through the stiff job that was before me i must put my shadowy fears away and think only of the dangers i was sure about the first of these was that she might suppose our ship was lost so as soon as we had set up on old erebus the wooden lattice towers which contained our longdistance electric apparatus i tried to send her that first message from the antarctic which was to say we had not been shipwrecked it was a thrilling moment exactly at the stroke of midnight on january while the midnight sun was shining with its dull sullen glow the whole of our company having gathered round the wireless man prepared to despatch my message as we were not sure of our machinery i had drawn up the words to suit any place into which they might fall if they missed their intended destination south pole expedition safe all well send greetings to dear ones at home for some forty seconds the sparks crackled out their snappy signals into the crisp night air and then the settled calm returned and we stood in breathless silence like beings on the edge of a world waiting for the answer to come as from another planet it came after a few minutes we heard from our magnetic detector the faint sound of the s signals and then we broke into a great cheer it was not much but it was enough and while our scientific staff were congratulating themselves that electricwave telegraphy was not inhibited by long distance or by the earths curvature over an arc of a great circle i was thinking of my dear onethat one way or another my message would reach her and she would be relieved then in splendid health and spiritsdogs ponies and men all awe started on our journey making a beeline for the pole owing to the heavy weights we had to transport our progress was slow much slower than we had expected and though the going was fair and we kept a steady pace travelling a good deal by night it was not until the end of march that we reached mount darwin which i had fixed on for the second of our electric power stations by this time winter was approaching the nights were beginning to be dark and cold and the altitude ft was telling on some of us nevertheless our second installation got finished about the last week in april and again we gathered round not quite such a hearty company as before while the wireless man spoke to the operator we had left on erebus again the electrical radiations went crackling into space and again we gave a cheer when the answer came backall well and instruments in perfect order then late as it was we began on the last stage of our journey which we knew would be a hard one three hundred geographical miles in front temperature down to minus deg the sun several weeks gone and nothing before us but thickening twilight cold winds snow the rare aurora and the frequent moon but the worst fact was that our spirits were low and do what i would to keep a good heart and cheer up the splendid fellows who had come with me i could not help feeling the deepening effect of that sunless gloom in spite of this i broke camp on april and started straight as a die for the south it was a stiff fight over the upper glacier in latitude with its razorshaped ice full of snowcovered crevasses and three days out two of our best men fell into one of the worst of them i saw the accident from a dozen yards away and running up i lay on my stomach and shouted down but it was a black bottomless gulf and not a sound or a sign came back to me this cast a still deeper gloom on our company who could not be cheered up though i kept telling them we should be on the great plateau soon please god and then we should have a clear road to the pole we were not much better on top though for the surface was much broken up and in that brewing place of the winds there seemed to be nothing but surging seas of cumulus cloud and rolling waves of snow the polar march was telling on us badly we were doing no more than seven miles at a stretch so to help my shipmates to keep up their spirits and perhaps to give a bit of a heise to my own i had to sing all day longthough my darling is right that i have no more voice than a corncrake sometimes i sang ramsey town because it did not want much music but generally sallys the gel for me because it had a rattling chorus the men all joined in scientific experts included and if the angels took any heed of us i think it must have touched them up to look down on our little company of puny men singing away as we trudged through that snowy wilderness which makes a man feel so small but man can only do his best and as father dan god bless his old heart used to say the angels can do no more we were making middling hard work of it in the th parallel with a temperature as low as degrees of frost when a shrieking blinding blizzard came sweeping down on us from the south i thought it might blow itself out but it didnt so we struck camp in a broad halfcircle building igloos snow huts with their backs like rainbeaten cattle to the storm there we lay nine daysand it is not worth while now to say how much some of our men suffered from frozen fingers and more from falling spirits sometimes i heard them saying in voices that were intended to be loud enough for me to hear it would have been better to have built winter quarters on the north of darwin and settle there until the return of summer and at other times i heard them counting the distance to the polea hundred geographical miles making twenty days march at this season with the heavy weights we had to carry and the dwindling of our dogs and ponies for we had killed a lot of them for food but i would not give in for i felt that to go back without finishing my job would break my heart and one day when old treacle said no use guvnor lets give it best i flew at him like a hunted tiger all the same i was more than a bit down myself for there were days when death was very near and one night it really broke me up to hear a big strapping chap saying to the man who shared his twoman sack i shouldnt care a whiff if it wasnt for the wife and the kiddies god knows i had my own anchor at home and sometimes it had a devil of a tug at me i fought myself hard though and at last in my desire to go on and my yearning to go back to my dear one i made an awful proposal such as a man does not much like to think of after a crisis is over shipmates i said it isnt exactly my fault that we are here in the middle of winter but here we are and we must make the best of it i am going forward and those who want to go with me can go but those who dont want to go can stay and so that no one may have it on his conscience that he has kept his comrades back whether by weakness or by will i have told the doctor to serve out a dose of something to every man that he may end it whenever he wants to to my surprise that awful proposal was joyfully received and never so long as i live shall i forget the sight o osullivan going round the broad circle of my shipmates in the blue gloom of that noonday twilight and handing something to every one of them while nobody spoke and death seemed to look us in the face and now i come to the incident for which i have told this story i could not get a wink of sleep that night for thinking of the brave fellows i had doomed to death by their own hands for that was what it came to because their souls were starving and they were thinking of home my soul was starving too and whether it was the altitude now ft that was getting into my head and giving me that draught in the brain which only travellers in frozen regions know or the power higher than nature which speaks to a man in great solitudes when life is low i cannot say but as god is my witness i was hearing again the voices of my dear ones so far away sometimes they were the voices of my old people in ellan but more frequently and most importunately it was marys voice calling me by my name and crying to me for help as if she were in the shadow of some threatening danger martin martin martin when this idea took clear possession of meit was about three am and the hurricane was yowling like a wounded dogthe answering thought came quick i must go back no matter at what cost or sacrificei must go back it was in vain i reflected that the trouble which threatened my darling whatever it was and i thought i knew might be all over before i reached her sidei must go back and even when i reminded myself that i was within twenty days march of that last point of my journey which was to be the crown and completion of it all i also remembered that my dear one was calling me and i had no choice but to obey next morning in the first light of the dim antarctic glow i crept out of my snow hut to look south with powerful glasses in order to make sure that there was no reason why i should change my mind there was none although the snow had ceased the blizzard was blowing a hundred miles an hour in cutting gusts so with a bleeding heart and yet a hot one i told treacle to call rip our company and when they stood round me in the shelter of my hut i said shipmates i have been thinking things over during the night and i see them differently now nature is stronger than man and the nature that is inside of us sometimes hits us harder than that which is without i think it is that way with us here and i believe there isnt a man of you who wouldnt go forward with me if he had nobody to think of except himself well perhaps i have somebody to think of too so well stick together shipmates and whatever regrets there may be or disappointments or heartbreakings well well go back home i think it says something for the mettle my men were made of that there was never a cheer after i said that for they could see what it cost me to say it but by god there was a shout when i added weve drawn a blank this time boys but well draw a winner yet and i ask you to swear that youll come back with me next year please god to finish the work weve begun then we gripped hands in that desolate place and took our solemn oath and god knows we meant to keep it it did not take long to strike camp i can tell you the men were bustling about like boys and we had nothing to think of now but the packing of the food and the harnessing of the dogs and ponies for we were leaving everything else behind us at the last moment before we turned northward i planted the union jack on the highest hummock of snow and when we were a hundred yards off i looked back through the gloom and saw it blowing stiffly in the wind i dont think i need tell how deeply that sight cut me but if life has another such moment coming for me all i have to say is that i hope i may die before i live to see itwhich is irish but most damnably true that was twelve oclock noon on the eighth day of june and anybody may make what he likes of what i say but as nearly as i can calculate the difference of time between london and where we were in the th latitude it was the very hour of my dear ones peril mc end of martin conrads memorandum eightyninth chapter two weeks passed and if i suffered from getting up too soon i was never conscious of it once or twice perhaps in the early days i felt a certain dizziness and had to hold on for a moment to the iron rail of my bedstead but i was too much occupied with the tender joys of motherhood to think much about myself bathing dressing undressing and feeding my baby were a perpetual delight to me what a joy it all was there must he something almost animal even voluptuous in mothers love for there was nothing i liked so much as having baby naked on my knee and devouring its sweet body all over with kissesputting its little fat hands and even its little fat feet into my mouth there must be something almost infantile too for sometimes after i had talked to my darling with a flood of joyous chatter i would even find myself scolding her a little and threatening what i would do if she did not behave oh mysterious laws of motherhood only god can fathom the depths of them it was just as if sixteen years of my life had rolled back and i was again a child in my mothers room playing with my dolls under the table only there was something so wonderful now in the sweet eyes that looked up at me that at certain moments i would fall into a long reverie and my heart would be full of adoration what lengths i went to it was the height of the london season when baby came and sometimes at night looking through my window i saw the tailend of the long queue of carriages and electric broughams which stretched to the end of the street i lived in from the great houses fronting the park where balls and receptions were being held until the early hours of morning but i never envied the society ladies they were waiting for on the contrary i pitied them remembering they were childless women for the most part and thinking their pleasures were hollow as death compared with mine i pitied the rich mothers toothe mothers who banish their babies to nurseries to be cared for by servants and i thought how much more blessed was the condition of poor mothers like myself who kept all that sweetness to themselves how happy i was no woman coming into a fortune was ever so happy i sang all day long sometimes it was the sacred music of the convent in which each note with its own glory of sound wraps ones heart round as with a rainbow but more frequently it was ramsey town or sallys the gel for me which were only noisy nonsense but dear to me by such delicious memories my neighbours would come to their doors to listen and when i had stopped i would hear them say our lady is a appy cart isnt she i suppose it was because i was so happy that my looks returned to me though i did not know it was so until one morning after standing a moment at the window i heard somebody say our lady seems to be prettier than ever now her baby has come i should not have been a woman if i could have resisted that so i ran to the glass to see if it was true and it was the ugly lines that used to be in my cheeks had gone my hair had regained its blueblack lustre and my eyes had suddenly become bright like a darkened room when the shutters are opened and the sunshine streams into it but the coming of baby did better for me than that it brought me back to god before whom i now felt so humble and so glad because he had transformed the world for me every catholic will know why i could not ask for the benediction of the church after childbirth but he will also know why i was in a fever of anxiety to have my baby baptized at the earliest possible moment it was not that i feared her death i never thought of that in those days but because i lived in dread of the dangers which had darkened my thoughts before she was born so when baby was nearly a fortnight old i wrote to the rector of a neighbouring catholic church asking when i might bring her to be baptized and he sent me a printed reply giving the day and hour and enclosing a card to be filled up with her name and all other particulars what a day of joy and rapture was that of my babys baptism i was up with the sun on the morning appointed to take her to church and spent hours and hours in dressing her how lovely she looked when i had finished i thought she was the sweetest thing in the world sweeter than a rosebud under its sparkling web of dew when the rising sun is glistening on it after i had put on all the pretty clothes i had prepared for her before she was bornthe christening robe and the pelisse and the knitted bonnet with its pink ribbons and the light woollen veili lifted her up to the glass to look at herself being such a child myself and so wildly foolishly happy that old rector wont see anything equal to her this summer morning anyway i thought and then the journey to church i have heard that unmarried mothers going out for the first time after their confinement feel ashamed and confused as if every passerby must know their shameful secret i was a kind of unmarried mother myself god help me but i had no such feeling indeed i felt proud and gay and when i sailed out with my baby in my arms i thought all the people in our street were looking at me and i am sure i wanted to say good morning to everybody i met on my way the church was not in a joyous quarter it stood on the edge of a poor and very populous district with a flaunting publichouse immediately opposite when i got to it i found a number of other mothers all working women with their babies and the godfathers and godmothers they had provided for them waiting at the door at this sight i felt very stupid for i had been thinking so much about other things some of them vain enough perhaps that i had forgotten the necessity for sponsors and i do not know what i should have done at that last moment if the sacristan had not come to my relieffinding me two old people who for a fee of a shilling each were willing to stand godmother and godfather to my darling then the priest came out of the church in his white surplice and stole and we all gathered in the porch for the preliminary part of the sacrament what an experience it was never since my marriage had i been in a state of such spiritual exaltation the sacristan showing me some preference had put me in the middle of the row immediately in front of the priest so what happened to the other children i do not know having eyes and ears for nothing but the baptism of my own baby there were some mistakes but they did not trouble me although one was a little important when the priest said what name give you this child i handed the rectors card to the sacristan and whispered isabel mary to the godmother but the next thing i heard was mary isabel what dost thou ask of the church of god but what did it matter nothing mattered except one thingthat my darling should be saved by the power of the holy sacrament from the dark terrors which threatened her oh it is a fearful and awful thing the baptism of a child if you really and truly believe in it and i didfrom the bottom of my heart and soul i believed in it and trusted it in my sacred joy i must have cried nearly all the time for i had taken babys bonnet off i remember and holding it to my mouth i found after a while that i was wetting it with my tears when the exorcisms were over the priest laid the end of his stole over babys shoulder and led her as our prayer books say into the church and we all followed to the baptistery where i knelt immediately in front of the font with the old godmother before me the other mothers on either side and a group of whispering children behind the church was empty save for two charwomen who were sweeping the floor of the nave somewhere up by the dark and silent altar and when the sacristan closed the outer door there was a solemn hush which was broken only by the priests voice and the godparents muttered responses mary isabel dost thou renounce satan i do renounce him and all his works i do renounce them and all his pomps i do renounce them the actual baptism was like a prayer to me i am sure my whole soul went out to it and though i may have been a sinful woman unworthy to be churched i know and god knows that no chaste and holy nun ever prayed with a purer heart than i did then kneeling there with my babys bonnet to my mouth mary isabel i baptize thee in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost except that baby cried a little when the water was poured on her head as she had cried when the salt was put on her tongue i knew no more after that until i saw the candle in the godfathers hand which signified that my child had been made a child of light and heard the priest say go in peace and the lord be with thee then i awoke as from a trance there was a shuffling of feet the priest was going away the solemn rite was at an end i rose from my knees put a little money in the plate which the sacristan held out to me gave a shilling to each of the two old sponsors took baby back into my arms and sat down in a pew to put on her bonnet and veil the spiritual exaltation which had sustained me lasted until i reached the street where the other mothers and their friends were laughing and joking in voices that had to be pitched high over the rattle of the traffic about going to the house opposite to wet the babys head but i think something of the celestial light of the sacrament must have been on my face still when i reached home for i remember that as i knocked at the door and waited for the rope from the kitchen to open it i heard one of my neighbours say our lady has taken a new lease of life hasnt she i thought i hada great new lease of physical and spiritual life but how little did i know what fate had in store for me ninetieth chapter i was taking off babys outdoor things when my welsh landlady came up to ask how i had got on and after i had told her she said and now theest got to get the jewel registered registered within three weeks its the law look you that was the first thing that frightened me i had filled up truthfully enough the card which the rector had sent me because i knew that the register of my church must be as sacred as its confessional but a public declaration of my babys birth and parentage seemed to be quite another mattercharged with all the dangers to me to martin and above all to my child which had overshadowed my life before she was born more than once i felt tempted to lie to make a false declaration to say that martin had been my husband and isabel was my legitimate child but at length i resolved to speak the truth the plain truth telling myself that gods law was above mans law and i had no right to be ashamed in this mood i set off for the registry office it was a long way from where i lived and carrying baby in my arms i was tired when i got there i found it to be a kind of private house with an open vestibule and a blackandwhite enamelled plate on the doorpost saying registry of births and deaths in the front parlour which reminded me of mr curphys office in holmtown there was a counter by the door and a large table covered with papers in the space within two men sat at this table an old one and a young one and i remember that i thought the old one must have been reading aloud from a newspaper which he held open in his hand for as i entered the young one was saying extraordinary perfectly extraordinary and everybody thought they were lost too in the space between the door and the counter two women were waiting both were poor and obviously agitated one had a baby in her arms and when it whimpered for its food she unbuttoned her dress and fed it openly the other woman whose eyes were red as if she had been crying wore a coloured straw hat over which in a pitiful effort to assume black she had stretched a pennyworth of cheap crepe in his own good time the young man got up to attend to them he was a very ordinary young clerk in a check suit looking frankly bored by the dull routine of his daily labour and palpably unconscious of the fact that every day and hour of his life he was standing on the verge of the stormiest places of the soul opening one of two registers which lay on the counter the register of births he turned first to the woman with the child her baby a boy was illegitimate and in her nervousness she stumbled and stammered and he corrected her sharply then opening the other register the register of deaths he attended to the woman in the crepe she had lost her little girl two years old and produced a doctors certificate while she gave the particulars she held a soiled handkerchief to her mouth as if to suppress a sob but the young clerks composure remained undisturbed i do not know if it was the agitation of the two poor women that made me nervous but when they were gone and my turn had come i was hot and trembling the young clerk however who was now looking at me for the first time had suddenly become respectful with a bow and a smile he asked me if i wished to register my child and when i answered yes he asked me to be good enough to step up to the counter and what is your babys name please he asked i told him he dipped his pen in his metal inkpot shook some drops back made various imaginary flourishes over his book and wrote mary isabel and now he said with another smile the full name profession and place of residence of the father i hesitated for a moment and then making a call on my resolution i said martin conrad seaman deceased the young clerk looked up quickly did you say martin conrad maam he asked and as well as i could for a click in my throat i answered yes he paused as if thinking then with the same flourish as before he wrote that name also and after he had done so he twisted his face about to the old man who was sitting behind him and said in a voice that was not meant to reach me extraordinary coincidence isnt it extraordinary said the old man who had lowered his newspaper and was looking across at me over the rims of his spectacles and now said the young clerk your own name and your maiden name if you please mary oneill the young clerk looked up at me again i was holding baby on my left arm and i could see that his eye caught my wedding ring mary conrad maiden name oneill i presume he said i hesitated once more the old temptation was surging back upon me but making a great pull on my determination to tell the truth or what i believed to be the truth i answered no mary oneill simply ah said the young clerk and i thought his manner changed instantly there was silence for some minutes while the young clerk filled up his form and made the copy i was to carry away i heard the scratching of the young clerks pen the crinkling of the old mans newspaper the hollow ticking of a round clock on the wall the dull hum of the traffic in the streets and the thudthudthudding in my own bosom then the entry was read out to me and i was asked to sign it sign here please said the young clerk in quite a different tone pointing to a vacant line at the bottom of the hook and i signed with a trembling hand and a feeling of only partial consciousness i hardly know what happened after that until i was standing in the open vestibule settling baby on my arm afresh for my return journey and telling myself that i had laid a stigma upon my child which would remain with her as long as she lived it was a long long way back i remember and when i reached home having looked neither to the right nor left nor at anything or anybody though i felt as if everybody had been looking at me i had a sense of dimness of sight and of aching in the eyeballs i did not sing very much that day and i thought baby was rather restless towards nightfall i had a startling experience i was preparing isabel for bed when i saw a red flush like a rash down the left side of her face at first i thought it would pass away but when it did not i called my welsh landlady upstairs to look at it do you see something like a stain on babys face i asked and then waited breathlessly for her answer no yes well she said now that theest saying so perhaps its a birthmark a birthmark didst strike thy face against anything when baby was coming i made some kind of reply i hardly know what but the truth or what i thought to be the truth flashed on me in a moment remembering my last night at castle raa and the violent scene which had occurred there i told myself that the flush on babys face was the mark of my husbands hand which making no impression upon me had been passed on to my child and would remain with her to the end of her life as the brand of her mothers shame and the sign of what had been called her bastardy how i suffered at the sight of it how time after time that night i leaned over my sleeping child to see if the mark had passed away how again and again i knelt by her side to pray that if sin of mine had to be punished the punishment might fall on me and not on my innocent babe at last i remembered babys baptism and told myself that if it meant anything it meant that the sin in which my child had been born the sin of those who had gone before her if sin it was had been cast out of her soul with the evil spirits which had inspired them this sign of the holy cross which we make upon her forehead do thou accursed devil never dare to violate gods law had washed my darling white what could mans lawhis proud but puny moralitydo to injure her it could do nothing that comforted me when i looked at baby again the flush had gone and i went to bed quite happy ninetyfirst chapter i think it must have been the morning of the next day when the nurse who had attended me in my confinement came to see how i was going along i told her of the dimness of my sight and the aching of my eyeballs whereupon she held up her hands and cried there now what did i tell you didnt i say it is after a lady feels it the moral of her prediction was that being in a delicate state of health and having let myself low before baby was born it was my duty to wean her immediately i could not do it although the nurses advice was supported by my welsh landlady with various prognostications of consumption and rickets i could not at first deny myself the wild joy of nursing my baby but a severer monitor soon came to say that i must i found that my money was now reduced to little more than two pounds and that i was confronted by the necessity which i had so long put off of looking for employment i could not look for employment until i had found a nurse for my child and i could not find a nurse until my baby could do without me so when isabel was three weeks old i began to wean her at first i contented myself with the hours of night keeping a feedingbottle in bed with the cows milk warmed to the heat of my own body but when baby cried for the breast during the day i could not find it in my heart to deny her that made the time of weaning somewhat longer than it should have been but i compromised with my conscience by reducing still further my meagre expenses must i tell how i did so although it was the month of july there was a snap of cold weather such as sometimes comes in the middle of our english summer and yet i gave up having a fire in my room and for the cooking of my food i bought a small spirit stove which cost me a shilling this tempted me to conduct which has since had consequences and i am half ashamed and half afraid to speak of it my baby linen being little i had to wash it frequently and having no fire i dried it on my own body oh i see now it was reckless foolishness almost wilful madness but i thought nothing of it then i was poor and perhaps i was proud and i could not afford a fire and then a mothers love is as deep as the sea and there was nothing in the wide world i would not have done to keep my darling a little longer beside me baby being weaned at last i had next to think of a nurse and that was a still more painful ordeal to give my child to another woman who was to be the same as a second mother to her was almost more than i could bear to think about i had to think of it but i could only do so by telling myself that when i put baby out to nurse i might arrange to see her every morning and evening and as often as my employment permitted this idea partly reconciled me to my sacrifice and i was in the act of drawing up a newspaper advertisement in these terms when my landlady came to say that the nurse knew of somebody who would suit me exactly nurse called the same evening and told me a long story about her friend she was a mrs oliver and she lived at ilford which was at the other end of london and quite on the edge of the country the poor woman who was not too happily married had lost a child of her own lately and was now very lonely being devoted to children this pleased me extremely especially god forgive me the fact that mrs oliver was a bereaved mother and lived on the edge of the country already in my minds eye i saw her sitting on sunny days under a tree perhaps in an orchard with isabel in her arms rocking her gently and singing to her softly and almost forgetting that she was not her own baby whom she had lost though that was a twoedged sword which cut me both ways being a sort of wild joy with tears lurking behind it so i took a note of mrs olivers address lennards row lennards green ilford and wrote to her the same night asking her terms and stating my own conditions a reply came the following day it was a badlywritten and misspelt letter which showed me that mrs oliver must be a working woman perhaps the wife of a gardener or farmlabourer i thought though that did not trouble me in the least knowing by this time how poor people loved their children the terms is fore shillins a weke she wrote but i am that lonelie sins my own littel one lef me i wood tike your swete darling for nothin if i cud afford it and you can cum to see her as offen as you pleas in my ignorance and simplicity this captured me completely so i replied at once saying i would take baby to ilford the next day i did all this in a rush but when it came to the last moment i could scarcely part with my letter and i remember that i passed three pillarboxes in the front street before i could bring myself to post it i suppose my eyes must have been red when i returned home for my welsh landlady whom i had taken into my confidence about my means took me to task for crying telling me that i ought to thank god for what had happened which was like a message from heaven look you and a dispensation of providence i tried to see things in that light though it was difficult to do so for the darker my prospects grew the more radiant shone the light of the little angel by whose life i lived and the harder it seemed to live without her but it isnt like losing my child altogether is it i said deed no and twill he better for both of you said my landlady although ilford is a long way off i can go there every day cant i deed thee can if theest not minding a journey of nine miles or more and if i can get a good situation and earn a little money i may be able to have baby back and hire somebody to nurse her and so keep her all to myself and why shouldnt thee said my welsh landlady thee reading print like the young minister and writing letters like a copybook so in the fierce bravery of motherly love i dried my eyes and forced back my sobs and began to pack up my babys clothes and to persuade myself that i was still quite happy my purse was very low by this time after paying my rent and some other expenses i had only one pound and a few shillings left ninetysecond chapter at half past seven next morning i was ready to start on my journey i took a hasty glance at myself in the glass before going out and i thought my eyes were too much like the sky at daybreakall joyful beams with a veil of mist in front of them but i made myself believe that never since baby was born had i been so happy i was sure i was doing the best for her i was also sure i was doing the best for myself for what could be so sweet to a mother as providing for her child my welsh landlady had told me it was nine miles to ilford and i had gathered that i could ride all the way in successive omnibuses for less than a shilling but shillings were scarce with me then so i determined to walk all the way emmerjane by her own urgent entreaty carried baby as far as the corner of the bayswater road and there the premature little woman left me after nearly smothering baby with kisses keep straight as a arrow and you cant lose your wye she said it was one of those beautiful mornings in late july when the air is fresh and the sun is soft and the summer even in london has not yet had time to grow tired and dusty i felt as light as the air itself i had put babys feedingbottle in my pocket and hung her surplus linen in a parcel about my wrist so i had nothing to carry in my arms except baby herself and at first i did not feel her weight there were not many people in the westend streets at that early hour yet a few were riding in the park and when i came to the large houses in lancaster gate i saw that though the sun was shining on the windows most of the blinds were down i must have been walking slowly for it was half past eight when i reached the marble arch there i encountered the first crosstide of traffic but somebody seeing baby took me by the arm and led me safely over the great mediterranean of oxford street was by this time running at full tide people were pouring out of the tube and underground stations and clambering on to the motorbuses but in the rush nobody hustled or jostled me a woman with a child in her arms was like a queeneverybody made way for her once or twice i stopped to look at the shops some of the dressmakers windows were full of beautiful costumes i did not covet any of them i remembered the costly ones i had bought in cairo and how little happiness they had brought me and then i felt as if the wealth of the world were in my arms nevertheless the whole feminine soul in me awoke when i came upon a shop for the sale of babies clothes already i foresaw a time when baby dressed in pretty things like these would be running about lennards green and plucking up the flowers in mrs olivers garden the great street was very long and i thought it would never end but i think i must have been still fresh and happy while we passed through the foreign quarter of soho for i remember that when two young italian waiters standing at the door of their cafe asked each other in their own language which of us baby or i was the bambino i turned to them and smiled before i came to chancery lane however baby began to cry for her food and i was glad to slip down a narrow alley into lincolns inn fields and sit on a seat in the garden while i gave her the bottle it was then ten oclock the sun was high and the day was becoming hot the languid stillness of the garden after the noise and stir of the streets tempted me to stay longer than i had intended and when i resumed my journey i thought the rest must have done me good but before i reached the holborn viaduct fatigue was beginning to gain on me i saw that i must be approaching some great hospital for hospital nurses were now passing me constantly and one of them who was going my way stepped up and asked me to allow her to carry baby she looked so sweet and motherly that i let her do so and as we walked along we talked she asked me if i was going far and i said no only to the other end of london the edge of the country to ilford ilford she cried why thats miles and miles away youll have to bus it to aldgate then change for bow and then tram it through stratford market i told her i preferred to walk being such a good walker and she gave me a searching look but said no more on that subject then she asked me how old baby was and whether i was nursing her myself and i answered that baby was six weeks and i had been forced to wean her being supposed to be delicate and besides ah perhaps you are putting her out to nurse she said and i answered yes and that was the reason i was going to ilford i see she said with another searching look and then it flashed upon me that she had formed her own conclusions about what had befallen me when we came to a great building in a side street on the left with ambulance vans passing in and out of a wide gateway she said she was sorry she could not carry baby any further because she was due in the hospital where the housedoctor would be waiting for her but i hope babys nurse will be a good one theyre not always that you know i was not quite so happy when the hospital nurse left me the parcel on my wrist was feeling heavier than before and my feet were beginning to drag but i tried to keep a good heart as i faced the crowded thoroughfaresnewgate with its cruel old prison the edge of st pauls and the corner of st martinslegrand and so on into cheapside cheapside itself was almost impassable merchants brokers clerks and city men generally in tall silk hats were hurrying and sometimes running along the pavement making me think of the river by my fathers house whose myriad little waves seemed to my fancy as a child to be always struggling to find out which could get to murphys mouth the first and so drown itself in the sea people were still very kind to me though and if anybody brushed me in passing he raised his hat and if any one pushed me accidentally he stopped to say he was sorry of course baby was the talisman that protected me from harm and what i should have done without her when i got to the mansion house i do not know for that seemed to be the central heart of all the london traffic with its motorbuses and taxicabs going in different directions and its tremendous tides of human life flowing every way but just as i was standing dazed and deafened on the edge of a triangle of streets looking up at a great building that was like a rock on the edge of a noisy sea and bore on its face the startling inscription the earth is the lords and the fulness thereof a big policeman seeing me with baby in my arms held up his hand to the drivers and shouted to the pedestrians stand aone side please and then led me safely across as if the red sea had parted to let us pass it was then twelve oclock and baby was once more crying for her food so i looked for a place in which i might rest while i gave her the bottle again suddenly i came upon what i wanted it seemed to be a garden but it was a graveyardone of the graveyards of the old london churches enclosed by high buildings now and overlooked by office windows such a restful place so green so calm so beautiful lying there in the midst of the tumultuous london traffic it reminded me of one of the little islands in the middle of our ellan glens on which the fuchsia and wild rose grow while the river rolls and boils about it i had just sat down on a seat that had been built about a gnarled and blackened old tree and was giving baby her food when i saw that a young girl was sitting beside me she was about nineteen years of age and was eating scones out of a confectioners bag while she read a papercovered novel presently she looked at baby with her little eyes which were like a pair of shiny boot buttons and said that your child i answered her and then she asked do you like children i answered her again and asked her if she did not like them also cant say im particularly gone on them she said whereupon i replied that that was probably because she had not yet had much experience oh havent i perhaps i havent she said and then with a hard little laugh she added mothers had nine though i asked if she was a shop assistant and with a toss of her head she told me she was a typist better screw and your evenings off she said and then she returned to the subject of children one of her chums in the office who used to go out with her every night to the musichalls got into trouble a year or two ago as a consequence she had to marry and what was the result never had her nose out of the washtub now the story was crude enough yet it touched me closely but couldnt she have put her baby out to nurse and get another situation somewhere i asked matter o luck said the girl some can some cant thats their look out firms dont like it if they find youve got a child they genrlly chuck you in spite of myself i was a little down when i started on my journey again i thought the parcel was cutting my wrist and i felt my feet growing heavier at every step was maggie joness story the universal one if a child were born beyond the legal limits was it a thing to hide away and be ashamed of and could it be possible that mans law was stronger than gods law after all ninetythird chapter i had walked so slowly and stopped so often that it was two oclock in the afternoon when i passed through aldgate i was then faint for want of food so i looked out for a teashop or restaurant i passed several such places before i found the modest house i wanted then i stepped into it rather nervously and took the seat nearest the door it was an oblong room with red plush seats along the walls behind a line of marbletopped tables the customers were all men chiefly clerks and warehousemen i thought and the attendants were girls in black frocks and white aprons there seemed to be a constant fire of freeandeasy flirtation going on between them at one table a man in a cloth cap was saying to the girl who had served him whats the damage dearie one roast one veg two breadslevenpence and no liberties mister sunday off emly said a youth in a red tie at another table and being told it was he said then what do you say to oppin up to endon and aving a day in a boat i had to wait some time before anybody came to attend to me but at length a girl from the other end of the room who had taken no part in these amatory exchanges stepped up and asked what i wanted i ordered a glass of cold milk and a scone for myself and a pint of hot milk to replenish babys bottle the girl served me immediately and after rinsing and refilling the feedingbottle she stood near while the baby used it she had quiet eyes and that indefinable expression of yearning tenderness which we sometimes see in the eyes of a dear old maid who has missed her motherhood the shop had been clearing rapidly and as soon as the men were gone and while the other girls were sitting in corners to read penny novelettes my waitress leaned over and asked me if i did not wish to go into the private room to attend to baby a moment afterwards i followed her into a small apartment at the end of the shop and there a curious thing occurred she closed the door behind us and asked me in an eager whisper to allow her to see to baby i tried to excuse myself but she whispered hush i have a baby of my own though they know nothing about it here so you can safely trust me i did so and it was beautiful to see the joy she had in doing what was wanted saying all sorts of sweet and gentle things to my baby though i knew they were meant for her own as if the starved motherheart in her were stealing a moment of maternal tenderness there she said shell be comfortable now bless her i asked about her own child and coming close and speaking in a whisper she told me all about it it was a girl and it would be a year old at christmas at first she had put it out to nurse in town where she could see it every evening but the fostermother had neglected it and the inspector had complained so she had been compelled to take it away now it was in a home in the country ten miles from liverpool street and it was as bonny as a peach and as happy as the day is long see she whispered taking a card from her breast after a furtive glance towards the door i sent two shillings to have her photograph taken and the matron has just sent it it was the picture of a beautiful baby girl and i found it easy to praise her i suppose you see her constantly dont you i said the girls face dropped only on visiting days once a month and not always that she answered but how can you live without seeing her oftener i asked matter o means she said sadly i pay five shillings a week for her board and the train is oneandeight return so i have to be careful you see and if i lost my place what would happen to baby i was very low and tired and down when i resumed my walk but when i thought for a moment of taking omnibuses for the rest of my journey i remembered the waitresss story and told myself that the little i had belonged to my child and so i struggled on but what a weary march it was during the next two hours i was in the east end now and remembering the splendour of the west i could scarcely believe i was still in london long mean monotonous streets running off to right and left miles on miles of them without form or feature or any trace of nature except the blue strips of sky overhead such multitudes of people often badly dressed and generally with set and anxious faces hasting to and fro hustling elbowing jostling each other along as if driven by some invisible power that was swinging an unseen scourge no gracious courtesy here a woman with a child in her arms was no longer a queen children were cheap and sometimes it was as much as i could do to save myself from being pushed off the pavement the air seemed to smell of nothing but ale and coarse tobacco and then the noise the ceaseless clatter of carts the clang of electric cars the piercing shrieks of the underground railway coming at intervals out of the bowels of the earth like explosions out of a volcano and above all the raucous rasping highpitched voices of the people often foulmouthed sometimes profane too frequently obscene a cold grey joyless outcast city cut off from the rest of london by an invisible barrier more formidable than a wall a city in which the inhabitants seemed to live cold grey joyless lives all the same that they joked and laughed a city under perpetual siege the siege of poverty in the constant throes of civil war the war of want the daily and hourly fight for food if there were other parts of the east end and i am sure there must be where people live simple natural human lives i did not see them that day for my course was down the principal thoroughfares only those thoroughfares telescoping each other one after another seemed as if they would never come to an end how tired i was even baby was no longer light and the parcel on my wrist had become as heavy as lead towards four oclock i came to a broad parapet which had strips of garden enclosed by railings and iron seats in front of them utterly exhausted my arms aching and my legs limp i sank into one of these seats feeling that i could walk no farther but after a while i felt better and then i became aware that another woman was sitting beside me when i looked at her first i thought i had never in my life seen anything so repulsive she was asleep and having that expressionless look which sleep gives i found it impossible to know whether she was young or old she was not merely coarse she was gross the womanhood in her seemed to be effaced and i thought she was utterly brutalised and degraded presently baby who had also been asleep awoke and cried and then the woman opened her eyes and looked at the child while i hushed her to sleep again there must be something in a babys face that has a miraculous effect on every woman as if these sweet angels fresh from god make us all young and all beautiful and it was even so at that moment never shall i forget the transfiguration in the womans face when she looked into the face of my baby the expression of brutality and degradation disappeared and through the bleared eyes and over the coarsened features there came the light of an almost celestial smile after a while the woman spoke to me she spoke in a husky voice which seemed to be compounded of the effects of rum and raw night air that yourn she said i answered her boy or gel i told her ow old i told her that too the woman was silent for a moment and then with a thickening of the husky voice she said spose youll say im a bleedin liar but i ad a kid as putty as that onctputtier it was a boy the nobbiest little b as you ever come acrost yourn is putty but it aint in it with my billie not by a long chalk i asked her what had become of her child lawst im she said used to give sixpence a week to the woman what ad alf the ouse with me to look after im while i was workin at the factry but what did the bleedin b do blimey if she didnt let im get run over by the dray from the brewery killed i said clutching at baby the woman nodded without speaking i asked her how old her child had been moren four she said just old enough to run a arrand it was crool hit me out i can tell you that kid was all i had apple o my eye in a manner of speakin when it was gone there wasnt much encouragement was there the favver from the mission came jawin as ow jesus ad taken im to imself rot when they put im down in old bow i didnt care no more for nothin monse and monse i walked about night and day and the bleedin coppers was allus on to me they got their own way at last i took the pneumonier and was laid up at the london and when i got out i didnt go back to the factry neither what did you do i asked the woman laughedbitterly terribly do dont you know i shook my head the woman looked hard at me and then at the child look hereare you a good gel she said hardly knowing what she meant i answered that i hoped so ope dont you know that neither then i caught her meaning and answered faintly yes she looked searchingly into my eyes and said i blieve you some gels is selp me gawd i dont know how they done it though i was shuddering and trembling for i was catching glimpses as if by broken lights from hell of the life behindthe wrecked hope the shattered faith the human being hunted like a beast and at last turned into one just at that moment baby awoke and cried again the woman looked at her with the same look as beforenot so much a smile as a sort of haggard radiance then leaning over me she blew puffs of alcoholic breath into babys face and stretching out a coarse fat finger she tickled her under the chin baby ceased to cry and began to smile seeing this the womans eyes sparkled like sunshine see that she cried selp me jesus i blieve i could ave been good meself if id ony ad somethink like this to keer for i am not ashamed to say that more than once there had been tears in my eyes while the woman spoke though her blasphemies had corrupted the air like the gases that rise from a dustheap but when she touched my child i shuddered as if something out of the lowest depths had tainted her then a strange thing happened i had risen to go although my limbs could scarcely support me and was folding my little angel closely in my arms when the woman rose too and said you wouldnt let me carry your kiddie a bit would you i tried to excuse myself saying something i know not what the woman looked at me again and after a moment she said spose not ony i thought it might make me think as ow i was carryin billie that swept down everything the one remaining window of the womans soul was open and i dared not close it i looked down at my childso pure so sweet so stainless i looked up at the womanso foul so gross so degraded there was a moment of awful struggle and then the woman and i were walking side by side and the harlot was carrying my baby down the street ninetyfourth chapter at five oclock i was once more alone i was then standing with baby in my own arms now under the statue which is at the back of bow church i thought i could walk no farther and although every penny i had in my pocket belonged to isabel being all that yet stood between her and want i must borrow a little of it if she was to reach mrs olivers that night i waited for the first tram that was going in my direction and when it came up i signalled to it but it did not stopit was full i waited for a second tram but that was still more crowded i reproached myself for having come so far i told myself how illadvised i had been in seeking for a nurse for my child at the farthest end of the city i reminded myself that i could not hope to visit her every day if my employment was to be in the west as i had always thought it would be i asked myself if in all this vast london with its myriads of homes there had been no house nearer that could have sheltered my child against all this i had to set something or i think my very heart would have died there and then i set the thought of ilford on the edge of the country with its green fields and its flowers i set the thought of mrs oliver who would love my child as tenderly as if she were her own little lost one i dare say it was all very weak and childish but it is just when we are done and down and do not know what we are doing that providence seems to be directing us and it was so with me at that moment the trams being full i had concluded that fate had set itself against my spending any of isabels money and had made up my mind to make a fierce fight over the last stage of my journey when i saw that a little ahead of where i was standing the road divided into two branches at an acute angle one branch going to the right and the other to the left not all emmerjanes instructions about keeping as straight as a arrow sufficed to show me which of the two roads to take and i looked about for somebody to tell me it was then that i became aware of a shabby old fourwheeled cab which stood in the triangular space in front of the statue and of the driver an old man in a long coachmans coat much worn and discoloured and a dilapidated tall hat very shiny in patches looking at me while he took the nosebag off his horsea bony old thing with its head hanging down i stepped up to him and asked my way and he pointed it out to meto the right over the bridge and through stratford market i asked how far it was to ilford better nor two mile i call it he answered after that being so tired in brain as well as body i asked a foolish questionhow long it would take me to get there the old driver looked at me again and said bout a our and a alf i should say by the looks of youand you carryin the biby i dare say my face dropped sadly as i turned away feeling very tired yet determined to struggle through but hardly had i walked twenty paces when i heard the cab coming up behind and the old driver crying old on missie i stopped and to my surprise he drew up by my side got down from his box opened the door of his cab and said ger in i told him i could not afford to ride ger in he said again more loudly and as if angry with himself for having to say it again i made some demur and then the old man said speaking fiercely through his grizzly beard look ere missie i ave a gel o my own lost somewheres and i wouldnt be ansrable to my ole woman if i let you walk with a face like that i dont know what i said to him i only know that my tears gushed out and that at the next moment i was sitting in the cab what happened then i do not remember except that the dull rumble of the wheels told me we were passing over a bridge and that i saw through the mist before my eyes a sluggish river a muddy canal and patches of marshy fields i think my weariness and perhaps my emotion added to the heavy monotonous trotting of the old horse must have put me to sleep for after a while i was conscious of a great deal of noise and of the old driver twisting about and shouting in a cheerful voice through the open window at the back of his seat stratford market after a while we came to a broad road full of good houses and then the old driver cried ilford and asked what part of it i wished to go to i reached forward and told him lennards row lennards green and then sat back with a lighter heart but after another little while i saw a great many funeral cars passing us with the hearses empty as if returning from a cemetery this made me think of the woman and her story and i found myself unconsciously clasping my baby closer the corteges became so numerous at last that to shut out painful sights i closed my eyes and tried to think of pleasanter things i thought above all of mrs olivers house as i had always seen it in my minds eyenot a pretentious place at all only a little humble cottage but very sweet and clean covered with creepers and perhaps with roses i was still occupied with these visions when i felt the cab turn sharply to the left then opening my eyes i saw that we were running down a kind of alleyway with a row of very mean little twostorey houses on the one side and on the other a kind of waste ground strewn with broken bottles broken iron pans broken earthenware and other refuse interspersed with tufts of long scraggy grass which looked the more wretched because the sinking sun was glistening over it suddenly the cab slowed down and stopped then the old man jumped from his box and opening his cab door said here you are missie this is your destingnation there must have been a moment of semiconsciousness in which i got out of the cab for when i came to full possession of myself i was standing on a narrow pavement in front of a closed door which bore the number at first i was stunned then my heart was in my mouth and it was as much as i could do not to burst out crying finally i wanted to fly and i turned back to the cab but it had gone and was already passing round the corner it was six oclock i was very tired i was nine miles from bayswater i could not possibly carry baby back what could i do then my brain being unable to think a mystic feeling born perhaps of my life in the convent came over mea feeling that all that had happened on my long journey all i had seen and everything that had been said to me had been intended to prepare me for and perhaps to save me from the dangers that were to come i think that gave me a certain courage for with what strength of body and spirit i had left though my heart was in my mouth still i stepped across the pavement and knocked at the door memorandum by martin conrad my greathearted heroic little woman all this time i in my vain belief that our expedition was of some consequence to the world was trying to comfort myself with the thought that my darling must have heard of my safety but how could i imagine that she had hidden herself away in a mass of humanitywhich appears to be the most impenetrable depths into which a human being can disappear how could i dream that to the exclusion of all such interests as mine she was occupied day and night night and day with the joys and sorrows the raptures and fears of the mighty passion of motherhood which seems to be the only thing in life that is really great and eternal above all how could i believe that in london itself in the heart of the civilised and religious world she was going through trials which make mine in the grim darkness of the polar night seem trivial and easy it is all over now and though thank god i did not know at the time what was happening to my dear one at home it is some comfort to me to remember that i was acting exactly as if i did from the day we turned hack i heard my darlings voice no more but i had a still more perplexing and tormenting experience and that was a dream about her in which she was walking on a crevassed glacier towards a precipice which she could not see because the brilliant rays of the aurora were in her eyes anybody may make what he likes of that on grounds of natural law and certainly it was not surprising that my dreams should speak to me in pictures drawn from the perils of my daily life but only one thing matters nowthat these experiences of my sleeping hours increased my eagerness to get back to my dear one my comrades were no impediment to that i can tell you with their faces turned homewards and the wind at their backs they were showing tremendous staying power although we had thirty and forty below zero pretty constantly with rough going all the time for the snow had been ruckled up by the blizzard to almost impassable heaps and hummocks on reaching our second installation at mount darwin i sent a message to the men at the foot of mount erebus telling them to get into communication through macquarie island with the captain of our ship in new zealand asking him to return for us as soon as the ice conditions would permit and this was the last of our jobs except packing our instruments tight and warm before we started down the long white gateway for our quarters at the cape with all the heart in the world though our going had to be slow it was the middle of the antarctic winter when absolute night reigned for weeks and we had nothing to alleviate the darkness but the light of the scudding moon and sometimes the glory of the aurora as it encircled the region of the unrisen sun nevertheless my comrades sang their way home through the sullen gloom sometimes i wakened the echoes of those desolate old hills myself with a stave of sallys the gel although i was suffering a good deal from my darker thoughts of what the damnable hypocrisies of life might be doing with my darling and my desire to take my share of her trouble whatever it might be the sun returned the second week in august nobody can know what relief that brought us except those who have lived for months without it to see the divine and wonderful thing rise up like a god over those lone white regions is to know what a puny thing man is in the scheme of the world i think all of us felt like that at sight of the sun though some myself among the rest were thinking more of it as a kind of message from friends at home but old treacle i remember who had stood looking at it in awed solemnity said well im d after that we got on famously until we reached winter quarters where we found everybody well and everything in order but received one piece of alarming intelligencethat the attempt to get into wireless communication with our ship had failed with the result that we should have to wait for her until the time originally appointed for her return that did not seem to matter much to my shipmates who being snugly housed from blinding blizzards settled down to amuse themselves with singsongs and storytellings and readings but do what i would to me the delay was dreadful and every day in the fever of my anxiety to get away as soon as the ice permitted i climbed the slopes of old erebus with osullivan to look through powerful glasses for what the good chap called the open wather thank god our wooden house was large enough to admit of my having a cabin to myself for i should have been ashamed of my comrades hearing the cries that sometimes burst from me in the night it is hard for civilised men at home accustomed to hold themselves under control to realise how a mans mind can run away from him when he is thousands of miles separated from his dear ones and has a kind of spiritual certainty that evil is befalling them i dont think i am a bigger fool than most men in that way but i shiver even yet at the memory of all the torment i went through during those days of waiting for my whole life seemed to revolve before me and i accused myself of a thousand offences which i had thought dead and buried and forgotten some of these were trivial in themselves such as hot and intemperate words spoken in childhood to my good old people at home disobedience or ingratitude shown to them with all the usual actions of a naughty boy who ought to have been spanked and never was but the worst of them concerned my darling and came with the thought of my responsibility for the situation in which i felt sure she found herself a thousand times i took myself to task for that thinking what i ought and ought not to have done and then giving myself every bad name and my conduct every damning epithet up and down my cabin i would walk with hands buried in my pockets revolving these thoughts and working myself up against my will to a fever of regret and selfaccusation talk about purgatorythe purgatory of dear old father dan that was to come after deathmine came before and by the holy saints i had enough of it two months passed like this and when the water of the sound was open and our ship did not appear mine was not the only heart that was eating itself out for the spirits of my shipmates had also begun to sink in the early part of the antarctic spring there had been a fearful hurricane lasting three days on the sea with a shrieking roaring chorus of fiends outside and the conviction now forced itself on my men that our ship must have gone down in the storm of course i fought this notion hard for my last hopes were based on not believing it but when after the lapse of weeks i could hold out no longer and we were confronted by the possibility of being held there another year for how were our friends to know before the ice formed again that it was necessary to send relief i faced the situation firmlymeasuring out our food and putting the men on shortened rations twentyeight ounces each and a thimbleful of brandy by the lord god it is a fearful thing to stand face to face with slow death some of my shipmates could scarcely bear it the utter solitude the sight of the same faces and the sound of the same voices with the prospect of nothing else seemed to drive most of them nearly mad there was no singsonging among them now and what speaking i overheard was generally about the great dinners they had eaten or about their dreams which were usually of green fields and flowerbeds and primroses and daisiesdaisies by heaven in a world that was like a waste as for me i did my best to play the game of never giving up it was a middling hard game god knows and after weeks of waiting a sense of helplessness settled down on me such as i had never known before i am not what is called a religious man but when i thought of my darlings danger for such i was sure it was and how i was cut off from her by thousands of miles of impassable sea there came an overwhelming longing to go with my troubles to somebody stronger than myself i found it hard to do that at first for a feeling of shame came over me and i thought you coward you forgot all about god when things were going well with you but now that they are tumbling down and death seems certain you whine and want to go where you never dreamt of going in your days of ease and strength i got over that thoughtheres nothing except death a man doesnt get over down thereand a dark night came when the ice breaking from the cliffs of the cape with a sound that made me think of my last evening at castle raa i found myself folding my hands and praying to the god of my childhood not for myself but for my dear one that he before whom the strongest of humanity were nothing at all would take her into his fatherly keeping help her help her i can do no more it was just when i was down to that extremity that it pleased providence to come to my relief the very next morning i was awakened out of my broken sleep by the sound of a gun followed by such a yell from treacle as was enough to make you think the seaserpent had got hold of his old buttocks the ship the ship commander commander the ship the ship and looking out of my little window i saw him with six or seven other members of our company half naked just as they had leapt out of their bunks running like savages to the edge of the sea where the scotia with all flags flying god bless and preserve her was steaming slowly up through a grinding pack of broken ice what a day that was what shouting what handshaking for osullivan it was donnybrook fair with the tail of his coat left out and for treacle it was whitechapel road with what cheer old cock and an unquenchable desire to stand treat all round but what i chiefly remember is that the moment i awoke and before the idea that we were saved and about to go home had been fully grasped by my hazy brain the thought flashed to my mind now youll hear of her mc end of martin conrads memorandum ninetyfifth chapter the door of no was opened by a rather uncomely woman of perhaps thirty years of age with a weak face and watery eyes this was mrs oliver and it occurred to me even at that first sight that she had the frightened and evasive look of a wife who lives under the intimidation of a tyrannical husband she welcomed me however with a warmth that partly dispelled my depression and i followed her into the kitchen it was the only room on the ground floor of her house except a scullery and it seemed sweet and clean and comfortable having a table in the middle of the floor a sofa under the window a rockingchair on one side of the fireplace a swinging babys cot on the other side and nothing about it that was not homelike and reassuring except two large photographs over the mantelpiece of men stripped to the waist and sparring weve been looking for you all day maam and had nearly give you up she said then she took baby out of my arms removed her bonnet and pelisse lifted her barrowcoat to examine her limbs asked her age kissed her on the arms the neck and the legs and praised her without measure and whats her name maam mary isabel but i wish her to be called isabel isabel a beautiful name too fit for a angel maam and she is a little angel bless her such rosy cheeks such a ducky little mouth such blue eyesblue as the bluebells in the cemetry shes as pretty as a waxwork she really is and any woman in the world might be proud to nurse her a young mother is such a weakling that praise of her child however crude acts like a charm on her and in spite of myself i was beginning to feel more at ease when mrs olivers husband came downstairs he was a short thickset man of about thirtyfive with a square chin a very thick neck and a closecropped red bullet head and he was in his stocking feet and shirtsleeves as if he had been dressing to go out for the evening i remember that it flashed upon mei dont know whythat he had seen me from the window of the room upstairs driving up in the old mans fourwheeler and had drawn from that innocent circumstance certain deductions about my character and my capacity to pay i must have been right for as soon as our introduction was over and i had interrupted mrs olivers praises of my babys beauty by speaking about material matters saying the terms were to be four shillings the man who had seated himself on the sofa to put on his boots said in a voice that was like a shot out of a blunderbus five howd you mean ted said mrs oliver timidly didnt we say four five said the man again with a still louder volume of voice i could see that the poor woman was trembling but assuming the sweet air of persons who live in a constant state of fear she said oh yes it was five now i remember i reminded her that her letter had said four but she insisted that i must be mistaken and when i told her i had the letter with me and she could see it if she wished she said then it must have been a slip of the pen in a manner of speaking maam we allus talked of five didnt we ted certainly said her husband who was still busy with his boots i saw what was going on and i felt hot and angry but there seemed to be nothing to do except submit very well well say five then i said paid in advance said the man and when i answered that that would suit me very well he added a month in advance you know by this time i felt myself trembling with indignation as well as quivering with fear for while i looked upon all the money i possessed as belonging to baby to part with almost the whole of it in one moment would reduce me to utter helplessness so i said turning to mrs oliver is that usual it did not escape me that the unhappy woman was constantly studying her husbands face and when he glanced up at her with a meaning look she answered hurriedly oh yes maam quite usual all the women in the row has it number five she has twins and gets a month in hand with both of them but well take four weeks and i cant say no fairer than that can i but why i asked well you see maam youre youre a stranger to us and if baby was left on our hands not as we think youd leave her chargeable as the saying is but if you were ever ill and got a bit back with your payments we being only pore people while the poor woman was floundering on in this way my blood was boiling and i was beginning to ask her if she supposed for one moment that i meant to desert my child when the man who had finished the lacing of his boots rose to his feet and said you dont want yer baiby to be give over to the guardians for the sake of a week or two do you that settled everything i took out my purse and with a trembling hand laid my last precious sovereign on the table a moment or two after this mr oliver who had put on his coat and a cloth cap made for the door evenin maam he said and with what grace i could muster i bade him goodbye you arent agoing to the sun tonight are you ted asked mrs oliver club said the man and the door clashed behind him i breathed more freely when he was gone and his wife from whose face the look of fear vanished instantly was like another woman goodness gracious she cried with a kind of haggard hilarity wheres my head me never offering you a cup of tea and you looking so white after your journey i took baby back into my arms while she put on the kettle set a black teapot on the hob to warm laid a piece of tablecloth and a thick cup and saucer on the end of the table and then knelt on the fender to toast a little bread talking meantime half apologetically and half proudly about her husband he was a bricklayer by trade and sometimes worked at the cemetery which i could see at the other side of the road behind the long railings and the tall trees but was more generally engaged as a sort of fighting lieutenant to a labour leader whose business it was to get up strikes before they were married he had been the light weight champion of whitechapel and those were photos of his fights which i could see over the mantelpiece but he never did no knocking of people about now being quiet and matrimonual in spite of myself my heart warmed to the woman i wonder it did not occur to me there and then that living in constant dread of her tyrannical husband she would always be guilty of the dissimulation i had seen an example of already and that the effect of it would be reflected upon my child it did not i only told myself that she was clearly fond of children and would be a kind nurse to my baby it even pleased me in my foolish motherly selfishness that she was a plainfeatured person whom baby could never come to love as she would i was sure love me i felt better after i had taken tea and as it was then seven oclock and the sun was setting horizontally through the cypresses of the cemetery i knew it was time to go i could not do that though without undressing baby and singing her to sleep and even then i sat for a while with an aching heart and isabel on my knee thinking of how i should have to go to bed that night for the first time without her mrs oliver in the meantime examining the surplus linen which i had brought in my parcel was bursting into whispered cries of delight over it and being told i had made the clothes myself was saying what a wonderful seamstress you might be if you liked maam at length the time came to leave baby and no woman knows the pain of that experience who has not gone through it though i really believed my darling would be loved and cared for and knew she would never miss me or yet know that i was gone there was a pang even in that thought and in every other kind of comforting i could not help it that as i was putting my cherub into her cot my tears rained down on her little face and awakened her so that i had to kneel by her side and rock her to sleep again youll be good to my child wont you mrs oliver i said deed i will maam the woman replied youll bath her every day will you not night and morning i allus does maam and rinse out her bottle and see that she has nice new milk fresh from the cow sure as sure maam but dont you fret no more about the child maam ive been a mother myself maam and ill be as good to your little angel as if she was my own come back to me god bless you i said in a burst of anguish and after remaining a moment longer on my knees by the cot speaking with all my heart and soul though neither to nurse nor to baby i rose to my feet dashed the tears from my eyes and ran out of the house ninetysixth chapter i knew that my eyes were not fit to be seen in the streets so i dropped my dark veil and hurried along being conscious of nothing for some time except the clang of electric cars and the bustle of passersby to whom my poor little sorrow was nothing at all but i had not gone fari think i had not though my senses were confused and vaguebefore i began to feel ashamed to take myself to task and to ask what i had to cry about if i had parted from my baby it was for her own good and if i had paid away my last sovereign i had provided for her for a month i had nothing to think of now except myself and how to get work i never doubted that i should get work or that i should get it immediately the only open question being what work and where hitherto i had thought that being quick with my pen i might perhaps become secretary to somebody but now remembering the typists story firms dont like it and wishing to run no risks in respect of my child i put that expectation away and began to soar to higher things how vain they were remembering some kind words the reverend mother had said about me at the convent where i had taken more prizes than alma though i had never mentioned it before i told myself that i too was an educated woman i knew italian french and german and having heard that some women could make a living by translating books for publishers i thought i might do the same nay i could even write books myself i was sure i couldone book at all events about friendless girls who have to face the world for themselves and all good women would read it some good men also because they would see that it must be true oh how vain were my thoughts yet in another sense they were not all vanity for i was not thinking of fame or what people would say about what i should write but only what i should get for it i should get money not a great deal perhaps yet enough for baby and me that we might have that cottage in the country covered with creepers and roses where isabel would run about the grass by and by and pluck the flowers in the garden so what have you got to cry about you ridiculous thing i thought while i hurried along with a high step now as if my soul had been in my feet but a mothers visions of the future are like a mirage always gleaming with the fairy palaces which her child is to inhabit some day and i am not the first to find her shadows fade away i must have been walking for some time feeling no weariness at all when i came to the bridge by bow church there i had intended to take a tram but not being tired i went on farther thinking every stage i could walk would be so much money to the good i was deep in the mile end road when a chilling thought came to me it was the thought of the distance that would divide me from my child making my visits to her difficult and putting it out of my power to reach her quickly perhaps even to know in time if as happened to children she became suddenly and dangerously ill i remembered the long line of telescoping thoroughfares i had passed through earlier in the day with their big hospitals their big breweries their big tabernacles their workmens lodginghouses their cinema picture palaces their jewish theatres and their numberless public houses and then the barrier of squalid space which would divide me from baby if i obtained employment in the west end seemed to be immeasurably greater and more frightening than the space that had divided me from martin when he was at the other end of the world not all the allurements of my dream were sufficient to reconcile me to such a dangerous separation its impossible i thought quite impossible insensibly my rapid footsteps slackened when i reached that part of the mile end road in which the jewish tailors live and found myself listening to a foreign language which i afterwards knew to be yiddish and looking at men with curls at each side of their sallow faces slithering along as if they were wearing eastern slippers without heels i stopped without knowing why at the corner of a street where an italian organman was playing while a number of brighteyed jewish children danced i was still looking on hardly thinking of what i saw when my eyes fell on an advertisement pasted on the window of a sausageandham shop at the corner in large written characters it ran seamstress wanted good wages apply no washington street how little are the things on which our destiny seems to hang in a moment i was remembering what mrs oliver had said about my being a good seamstress and almost before i knew what i was about i was hurrying up the side street and knocking with my knuckles at an open door a rather fat and elderly jewess covered with rings and gold chains and wearing a manifest black wig came from a room at one side of the lobby i explained my errand and after she had looked me over in a sort of surprise as if i had not been the kind of person she expected she said in a nasal and guttural voice vait my daughter she speaks very vell ainglish then turning her head over her shoulder she pitched her voice several octaves higher and cried miriam whereupon there came tripping downstairs a jewish girl of about eighteen with large black eyes thick black hair and such a dear good face i repeated my application and after the girl had interpreted my request to her mother i was asked into the lobby and put through a kind of catechism was i a seamstress no but i wished to become one had i aiver vorked on vaistcoats i hadnt but i could do anything with my needle perhaps the urgency of my appeal and more probably the pressure of her own need weighed with the jewess for after reflection and an eager whisper from her daughter who was looking at me with kindling eyes she said very vell vell see what she can do i was then taken into a close and stuffy room where a number of girls all jewish as i could see were working on sections of waistcoats which lying about on every side looked like patterns for legs of mutton one girl was basting another was pressing and a third was sewing buttonholes with a fine silk twist round bars of gimp this last was the work which was required of me and i was told to look and see if i could do it i watched the girl for a moment and then said let me try needle and twist and one of the half vests were then given to me and after ten minutes i had worked my first buttonhole and handed it back the daughter praised it warmly but the mother said very fair but a leedle slow let me try again i said and my trembling fingers were so eager to please that my next buttonhole was not only better but more quickly made beautiful said the daughter and mamma only think shes quicker than leah already i timed them i muz call your vader dough said the jewess and she disappeared through the doorway while i stood talking to the younger jewess who had i could see formed as quick an attachment for me as i for her i heard another nasal and guttural voice a mans coming towards us from the hall is she von of our people nein shes a skihoahmeaning as i afterwards learned a nonjewish girl then a tall thin jew entered the room behind the elderly jewess i had never before and have never since seen such a patriarchal figure with his long grey beard and solemn face he might have stood for moses in one of the pictures that used to hang on the walls of the conventexcept for his velvet skullcap and the black alpaca apron which was speckled over with fluffy bits of thread and scraps of cloth and silk he looked at me for a moment with his keen eyes and after his wife had shown him my work and he had taken a pinch of snuff and blown his nose on a coloured handkerchief with the sound of a trumpet he put me through another catechism i was trembling lest he should make intimate inquiries but beyond asking my name and whether i was a christian he did not concern himself with personal questions vat vages do you vant he asked i told him i should be pleased to take whatever was paid to other girls doing work of the same kind ach no dese girls are fulltimers you are only a greener meaning a beginner so you vill not expect anything like so much at that his daughter repeated her assurance that i was quicker than the girl she had called leah but the jew with an air of parental majesty told her to be silent and then said that as i was an improver he could only take me on piece naming the price a very small one per halfdozen buttons and buttonholes with the condition that i found my own twist and did the work in my own home seeing that i should be no match for the jew at a bargain and being so eager to get to work at any price i closed with his offer and then he left the room after telling me to come back the next day and vhere do you lif my dear said the jewess i told her bayswater making some excuse for being in the east end and getting as near to the truth as i dare venture but feeling instinctively after my sight of the master of the house that i dared say nothing about my child she told me i must live nearer to my work and i said that was exactly what i wished to doasking if she knew where i could find a room fortunately the jewess herself had two rooms vacant at that moment and we went upstairs to look at them both were at the top of the house and one of them i could have for two shillings a week but it was dark and cheerless being at the back and looking into the space over the yards in which the tenants dried their washing on lines stretched from pulleys the other which would cost a shilling a week more was a lean slit of a room very sparsely furnished but it was to the front and looked down into the varied life of the street so i took it instantly and asked when i could move in ven you like said the jewess everyding is ready so early next morning i bade farewell to my good welsh landlady who looked grave when i told her what i was going to do and to emmerjane who cried when i kissed her smudgy face and taking possession of my new home began work immediately in my first and only employment perhaps it was a deep decline after the splendours of my dreams but i did not allow myself to think about that i was near to ilford and i could go to see isabel every day isabel isabel isabel everything was isabel for now that martin was gone my hopes and my fears my love and my life revolved on one axis onlymy child ninetyseventh chapter my employer was a polish jew named israel abramovitch he had come to england at the time of the religious persecution in the holy cities of russia set himself up in his trade as a tailor in a garret in whitechapel hired a singer worked with green labour for slop warehouses and become in less than twenty years the richest foreign jew in the east end of london doing some of the best bespoke work for the large shops in the west and having the reputation as i afterwards found of being the greatest of jewish sweaters in spite of this however he was in his own way a deeply religious man strict severe almost superstitious in obeying the levitical laws and in practising the sad and rather gloomy symbolism of his faith a famous talmudist a pillar of the synagogue one of the two wardens of the chevra in brick lane and consequently a great upholder of moral rectitude his house seemed to be a solid mass of human beings chiefly jewish girls who worked all day and sometimes when regulations could be evaded or double gangs engaged all night for the jew drove everybody at high speed not excepting his wife who cooked the food and pressed the clothes at the same time in this hive of industry i needed no spur to make me work every morning mrs abramovitch brought up a thick pile of vests to my room and every evening she took them down again after counting my earnings with almost preternatural rapidity and paying me day by day with unfailing promptitude at the end of my first week i found i had made ten shillings i was delighted but after i had paid for my room and my food there was not enough for babys board so the second week i worked later in the evenings and earned fourteen shillings this was still insufficient therefore i determined to take something from the other end of the day morning will be better i thought remembering the painful noises at night especially about midnight when people were being thrown out of a publichouse higher up the street where there was a placard in the window saying the ale sold there could be guaranteed to make anybody drunk for fourpence unfortunately being a little weak i was always heavy in the mornings but by great luck my room faced the east so i conceived the idea of moving my bed up to the window and drawing my blinds to the top so that the earliest light might fall on my face and waken me this device succeeded splendidly and for many weeks of the late summer and early autumn i was up before the sun as soon as the dawn had broadened and while the leaden london daylight was filtering through the smoke of yesterday by this means i increased my earnings to sixteen shillings and as my fingers learned to fly over their work to seventeen and even eighteen that was my maximum and though it left a narrow margin for other needs it enabled me at the end of a month to pay another pound for babys board and to put away a little towards her shortening which mrs oliver was always saying must be soon i had to stick close to maintain this average and i grudged even the time occupied in buying and eating my food though that was not a long process in the mile end road which is full of shops where things can be bought ready cooked after the first week i did not even need to go out for them for they were brought round to my room every morning thus enabling me to live without leaving my work it was a stiff life perhaps but let nobody think i looked upon myself as a slave though i worked so hard i felt no selfpity the thought that i was working for my child sweetened all my labours it was such a joy to think that baby depended upon me for everything she wanted being so happy in those days i sang a great deal though naturally not in the middle of the day when our house was going like a millwheel but in the early mornings before the electric trams began to clang or the hawkers with their barrows to shout and when there was no sound even in the east end except that ceaseless tramp tramp tramp in the front street which always made me think of the children of israel in egypt drawing burdens for pharaoh throwing open my window i sang all sorts of things but being such a child myself and so fond of makebelieve i loved best to sing my lullaby and so pretend that baby was with me in my room lying asleep behind me in my bed sleep little baby i love thee i love thee sleep little queen i am bending above thee i never knew that i had any other audience than a lark in a cage on the other side of the street perhaps i was in a cage myself though i did not think of that then which always started singing when i sang except the washerwomen from a womens shelter going off at four to their work at the west end and two old widows opposite who sewed bibles and stitched cassocks which being so miriam told me the worstpaid of all sweated labour compelled them to be up as early as myself it was not a very hopeful environment yet for some time in my little top room i was really happy i saw baby every day between six and nine every night i broke off work to go to ilford saying nothing about my errand to anybody and leaving the family of the jew to think it was my time for recreation generally i trammed it from bow church because i was so eager to get to my journeys end but usually i returned on foot for though the distance was great i thought i slept better for the walk what joyful evenings those were perhaps i was not altogether satisfied about the olivers but that did not matter very much on closer acquaintance i found my babys nurse to be a heedless and feckless woman and though i told myself that all allowances must be made for her in having a bad husband i knew in my secret heart that i was deceiving myself and that i ought to listen to the voices that were saying your child is being neglected sometimes it seemed to me that baby had not been bathedbut that only gave me an excuse for bathing her myself sometimes i thought her clothes were not as clean as they might bebut that only gave me the joy of washing them sometimes i was sure that her feedingbottle had not been rinsed and her milk was not quite freshbut that only gave me the pleasure of scalding the one and boiling the other more than once it flashed upon me that i was paying mrs oliver to do all thisbut then what a deep delight it was to be mothering my own baby thus weeks and months passedit is only now i know how many for in those days time itself had nothing in it for me except my childand every new day brought the new joy of watching my babys development oh how wonderful it all was to see her little mind and soul coming out of the unknown out of the silence and darkness of the womb into the world of light and sound first her sense of sight with her neverending interest in her dear little toes then her senses of touch and hearing and the gift of speech beginning with a sort of crow and ending in the mamama which the first time i heard it went prancing through and through me and was more heavenly to my ears than the music of the spheres what evenings of joy i had with her the best of them god forgive me were the nights when the bricklayer had got into some trouble by knocking people about at the rising sun and his wife had to go off to rescue him from the police then baby being shortened i would prop her up in her cot while i sang sally to her or if that did not serve and her little lip continued to drop i both sang and danced spreading my skirts and waltzing to the tune of clementina while the kettle hummed over the fire and the bricklayers kitchen buzzed softly like a hive of bees oh dear oh dear i may have been down in the depths yet there is no place so dark that it may not be brightened by a sunbeam and my sunbeam was my child and then martinbaby was constantly making me think of him devouring her with my eyes i caught resemblances every dayin her eyes her voice her smile and above all in that gurgling laugh that was like water bubbling out of a bottle i used to talk to her about him pouring all my sentimental secrets into her ears just as if she understood telling her what a great man her father had been and how he loved both of uswould have done if he had lived longer i dare say it was very foolish yet i cannot think it was all foolishness many and many a time since i have wondered if the holy saints who knew what had really happened to martin were whispering all this in my ear as a means of keeping my love for him as much alive as if he had been constantly by my side the climax came when isabel was about five months old for then the feeling about baby and martin reached another and higher phase i hardly dare to speak of it lest it should seem silly when it was really so sacred and so exalted the idea i had had before baby was born that she was being sent to console me to be a link between my lost one and me developed into the startling and rapturous thought that the very soul of martin had passed into my child so martin is not dead at all i thought not really dead because he lives in baby it is impossible to say how this thought stirred me how it filled my heart with thankfulness how i prayed that the little body in which the soul of my martin had come to dwell might grow beautiful and strong and worthy of him how i felt charged with another and still greater responsibility to guard and protect her with my life itself if need be yes yes my very life itself i thought perhaps this was a sort of delirium born of my great love my hard work and my failing strength i did not know i did not care all that mattered to me then was one thing onlythat whereas hitherto i had thought martin was so far gone from me that not time but only eternity would bring us together now i felt that he was coming back and back to menearer and nearer and nearer every day memorandum by martin conrad my dear noble little woman was right in more ways than she knew at that very time i was in literal truth hurrying home to her as fast as the fastest available vessel could carry me as soon as we had boarded the scotia at the cape and greeted our old shipmates we shouted for our letters there were some for all of us and heaps for me so i scuttled down to my cabin where i sorted the envelopes like a pack of cards looking for the small delicate hand that used to write my letters and speeches to my dismay it was not there and realizing that fact i bundled the letters into a locker and never looked at them again until we were two days outwhen i found they were chiefly congratulations from my committee the proprietor of my newspaper and the royal geographical society all welcome enough in their way but dead sea fruit to a man with an empty heaving heart going up on deck i found every face about me shining like the aurora for the men had had good news all round one having come into a fortune and another into the fatherhood of twins and both being in a state of joy and excitement but all the good fellows were like boys some of them with laughter seasoned by a few tears read me funny bits out of their wives lettersbits too that were not funny about having a pretty fit of hysterics at reading bad news of us and wanting to kiss the newsboy when he brought the paper contradicting it i did my best to play the game of rejoicing pretending i had had good news also and everything was going splendid but i found it hard enough to keep it going especially while we were sailing back to the world as we called it and hearing from the crew the news of what had happened while we had been away first there was the reason for the delay in the arrival of the ship which had been due not to failure of the wireless at our end but to a breakdown on macquarie island and then there was the account of the report of the loss of the scotia in the gale going out which had been believed on insufficient evidence as i thought but recorded in generous words of regret that sent the blood boiling to a mans face and made him wish to heaven they could be true we were only five or six days sailing to new zealand but the strain to me was terrible for the thought was always uppermost why didnt she write a word of welcome to reach me on my return to civilisation when i was not talking to somebody that question was constantly haunting me to escape from it i joined the sports of my shipmates who with joyful news in their hearts and fresh food in their stomachs were feeling as good as new in spite of all they had suffered but the morning we smelt land the morning the cloud banks above the eastern horizon came out hard and fast and sure no dreamland this time i stood at the ships bow saying nothing to anybody only straining my eyes for the yet distant world we were coming back to out of that desolate white waste and thinking surely ill have news from her before nightfall there was a big warmhearted crowd on the pier at port lyttelton treacle said gawd i didnt know there was so many people in the world guvnor and osullivan catching sight of a pretty figure under a sunshade tugged at my arm and cried in the voice of an astronomer who has discovered a planet commanther commanther a girl almost before we had been brought to a company of scientific visitors came aboard but i was more concerned about the telegrams that had come at the same moment so hurrying down to my cabin i tore them open like a vulture riving its preyalways looking at the signatures first and never touching an envelope without thinking oh god what will be inside of it there was nothing from my dear one invitations to dine to lecture to write books to do this and that and heaven knows what but never a word from her who was more to me than all the world besides this made me more than ever sure of the voices that had called me back from the th latitude so i decided instantly to leave our ship in new zealand in readiness for our next effort and getting across to sydney to take the first fast steamer home the good people at port lyttelton were loath to let us go but after i had made my excuses crazy to get back to wives and sweethearts you know they sent a school of boys stunning little chaps in eton suits to sing us off with forty years onwhich brought more of my mother into my eyes than i knew to be left there at sydney we had the same experiencethe same hearty crowds the same welcome the same invitations to which we made the same replies and then got away by a fast liner which happened to be ready to sail on the way back to the world i had slung together a sort of a despatch for the newspaper which had promoted our expedition a lame limping thing for want of my darlings help to make it go saying something about the little we had been able to do but more about what we meant please god to do some day shell see that anyway and know were coming back i thought but to make doubly sure i sent two personal telegrams one to my dear one at castle raa and the other to my old people at home asking for answers to port said out on the sea again i was tormented by the old dream of the crevassed glacier and if anybody wonders why a hulking chap who had not been afraid of a ninetymile blizzard in the region of the pole allowed himself to be kept awake at night by a buzzing in the brain all i can say is that it was so and i know nothing more about it perhaps my recent experience with the wireless persuaded me that if two sticks stuck in the earth could be made to communicate with each other over hundreds of miles two hearts that loved each other knew no limitations of time or space in any case i was now so sure that my dear one had called me home from the antarctic that by the time we reached port said and telegrams were pouring in on me i had worked myself up to such a fear that i dared not open them from sheer dread of the joy or sorrow that might be enclosed in the yellow covers i got osullivan down in my cabin to read my telegrams while i scanned his face and nearly choked with my own tobacco smoke there was nothing from my dear one nothing from my people at home either osullivan got it into his head that i was worrying about my parents and tried to comfort me by saying that old folks never dreamt of telegraphing but by the holy immaculate mother hed go bail there would be a letter for me before long there was we stayed two eternal days at port said while the vessel was taking coal for the rest of the voyage and almost at the moment of sailing a letter arrived from ellan which falling into osullivans hands first sent him flying through the steamer and shouting at the top of his voice commanther commanther the passengers gave room for him and told me afterwards of his beaming face and when he burst into my cabin i too felt sure he had brought me good news which he had though it was not all that i wanted the way i was sure there would be a letter for you soon and by the holy st patrick and st thomas here it is he cried the letter was from my father and i had to brace myself before i could read it it was full of fatherly love motherly love too and the extravagant pride my dear good old people had of me everybodys talking of you my boy and theres nothing else in the newspapers but not a word about my maryor only one and that seemed worse than none at all you must have heard of the trouble at castle raa very sad but this happy hour is not the time to say anything about it nothing more only reams and reams of sweet parental chatter which god forgive me i would have gladly given over and over again for one plain sentence about my darling being now more than ever sure that some kind of catastrophe had overtaken my poor little woman i telegraphed to her again this time without knowing what mischief i was making at the house of daniel oneilltelling myself that though the man was a brute who had sacrificed his daughter to his lust of rank and power and all the rest of his rotten aspirations he was her father and if her reprobate of a husband had turned her out he must surely have taken her in cable reply to malta altogether too bad not hearing from you i said a blind hasty cruel telegram but thank god she never received it mc end of martin conrads memorandum ninetyeighth chapter day by day it became more and more difficult for me to throw dust in my own eyes about the olivers one evening on reaching their house a little after six as usual i found the front door open the kitchen empty save for baby who sitting up in her cot was holding quiet converse with her toes and the two olivers talking loudly probably by prearrangement in the room upstairs the talk was about baby which was a noosance interfering with a mans sleep by night and driving him out of his home by day and how much did they get for it nothing in a manner of speaking what did the woman meaning me think the bleedin place wasa philanthropic institooshun or a charity orginisation gime after this i heard the bricklayer thunder downstairs in his heavy boots and go out of the house without coming into the kitchen leaving his wife moral coward that he was to settle his account with me then mrs oliver came down with many sighs expressed surprise at seeing me and fear that i might have overheard what had been said in the room above sorry to say ive been having a few words with ted maam and tell you the truth it was about you ted had always been against her nursing and she must admit it wasnt wise of a woman to let her man go to the publichouse to get out of the way of a crying child but though she was arunning herself off her feet to attend to the pore dear and milk was up a penny she had growd that fond of my baby since she lost her own that she couldnt abear to part with the jewel and perhaps if i could pay a little moreted said seven but she said six and a shilling a week wouldnt hurt meshe could overpersuade him to let the dear precious stay i was trembling with indignation while i listened to the womans whining knowing well i was being imposed upon but i was helpless and so i agreed my complacency had a bad effect on the olivers who continued to make fresh extortions until their demands almost drove me to despair i thought a climax had been reached when one night a neighbour came to the door and calling mrs oliver into the lobby communicated some news in a whisper which brought her back with a frightened face for her cloak and hat saying something was a matter with ted and she must run away quick to him when she returned an hour or two later she was crying and with sobs between her words she told me that ted having taken a drop too much had knocked somebody about at the sun as a consequence he had fallen into the hands of the police and would be brought before the magistrate the following morning when being unable to pay the fine he would have to do timejust as a strike was acoming on too and he was expecting good pay from the strike committee and what is to happen to me and the baby while my usband is in prison she said i knew it was an act of weakness but thinking of my child and the danger of its being homeless i asked what the amount of the fine would probably be and being told tenandsix i gave the money though it was nearly all i had in the world i paid for my weakness though and have reason to remember it the extortions of the olivers had brought me to so narrow a margin between my earnings and expenses that i lay awake nearly all that night thinking what i could do to increase the one or reduce the other the only thing i found possible was to change to cheaper quarters so next morning with a rather heavy heart i asked mrs abramovitch if the room at the back of the house was still empty and hearing that it was i moved into it the same day that was a small and not a very wise economy my new room was cheerless as well as dark with no sights but the clothes that were drying from the pulleylines and no sounds but the whoops of the boys of the neighbourhood playing at red indians on the top of the yard walls but it was about the same as the other in size and furniture and after i had decorated it with my few treasuresthe reverend mothers rosary which i hung on the head of the bed and my darling mothers miniature which i pinned up over the firei thought it looked bright and homelike all this time too i was between the nether and the upper millstone my employer the jew though he must have seen that i was sweating myself much more than the law would have allowed him to sweat me could not forgive himself when he found that i was earning more by piece than he would have had to pay me by the day or resist the temptation to square accounts with me at the earliest possible opportunity unfortunately his opportunity came only too quickly and it led however indirectly to the most startling fact that has ever perhaps entered into a womans life i had not been more than three months at the jews house when the jewish festivals came roundnew years day the day of atonement and the feast of tabernacleswhich falling near together and occupying many days disturbed his own habits of work entirely one of the tasks he reserved for himself was that of taking the best paid of his bestbespoke back to the large shops in the west end and waiting for the return orders but finding that the festivals interfered with these journeys he decided that they should be made by me who was supposed to know the west end having lived in it and to present a respectable appearance i was reluctant to undertake the new duty for though the jew was to pay me a few shillings a week for it i saw i could earn more in the time with my needle but when he laid his long hairy forefinger on the side of his nose and said with a significant smile you vill be gradeful and convenience your employer mine child i agreed thus it came to pass that not only during the jewish festivals but for months after they were over i carried a rather large black bag by tram or rail to the district that lies at the back of piccadilly and along oxford street as far west as the marble arch i had to go whenever called upon and to wait as long as wanted so that in the height of the tailoring season i was out in the west end at all irregular hours of night and even returned to my lodgings on one or two occasions in the raw sunshine of the early mornings the one terror of my west end journeys was that i might meet sister mildred i never did in the multitude of faces which passed through the streets flashing and disappearing like waves under the moon at sea i never once caught a glimpse of a face i knew but what sights i saw for all that what piercing piteous proofs that between the rich and the poor there is a great gulf fixed the splendid carriages driving in and out of the park the sumptuously dressed ladies strolling through bond street the fashionable church paraders the white plumes and diamond stars which sometimes gleamed behind the glow of the electric broughams gliding down the mall i used to be atoffed up like that onct i heard an old woman who was selling matches say as a lady in an ermine coat stepped out of a theatre into an automobile and was wrapped round in a tigerskin rug sometimes it happened that returning to the east end after the motor buses had ceased to ply i had to slip through the silent leicester square and the empty strand to the underground railway on the embankment then i would see the wretched men and women who were huddled together in the darkness on the steps to the river whose everflowing waters must have witnessed so many generations of human wreckage and glancing up at the big hotels and palatial mansions full of ladies newly returned from theatres and restaurants in their satin slippers and silk stockings i would wonder how they could lie in their white beds at night in rooms whose windows looked down on such scenes but the sight that stirred me most though it did not awaken my charity which shows what a leansouled thing i was myself was that of the public women the streetwalkers as i used to call them whom i saw in piccadilly with their fine clothes and painted faces sauntering in front of the clubs or tripping along with a light step and trying to attract the attention of the men i found no pathos in the position of such women on the contrary i had an unspeakable horror and hatred and loathing of them feeling that no temptation no poverty no pressure that could ever be brought to bear upon a woman in life or in death excused her for committing so great a wrong on the sanctity of her sex as to give up her womanhood at any call but that of love nothing could make me do it i used to think nothing in this world but o god how little i knew then what is in a womans heart to do when she has a child to live for and is helpless and alone i cannot expect anybody to forgive me for what i did or attempted to do and now that the time has come to tell of it my hand trembles and body and soul seem to be quivering like a flame may god who has brought everything to such a glorious end have mercy on me and forgive me and help me to be true ninetyninth chapter the worst consequence of my west end journeys was that my nightly visits to ilford were fewer than before and that the constant narrowing of the margin between my income and my expenses made it impossible for me to go there during the day as a result my baby received less and less attention and i could not be blind to the fact that she was growing paler and thinner at length she developed a cough which troubled me a great deal mrs oliver made light of it saying a few pennyworths of paregoric would drive it away so i hurried off to a chemist who recommended a soothing syrup of his own saying it was safer and more effectual for a child the syrup seemed to stop the cough but to disturb the digestion for i saw the stain of curdled milk on babys bib and was conscious of her increasing weakness this alarmed me very much and little as i knew of childrens ailments i became convinced that she stood in need of more fresh air so i entreated mrs oliver to take her for a walk every day i doubt if she ever did so for as often as i would say has baby been out today nurse mrs oliver would make some lame excuse and pass quickly to another subject at last being unable to bear the strain any longer i burst out on the woman with bitter reproaches and then she broke down into tears and explained everything she was behind with her rent the landlord was threatening and she dared not leave the house for a moment lest he should lock her out altogether i dont mind telling you its all along of ted maam hes on strike wages but he spends it at the sun he has never been the man to menever once since i married him i could work and keep the house comfortable without him but he wouldnt let me abe because he knows i love him dear yes i do i love him dear she continued breaking into hysterical sobs and if he came home and killed me i could kiss him with my last breath this touched me more than i can say a sense of something tragic in the position of the poor woman who knew the character of the man she loved as well as the weakness which compelled her to love him made me sympathise with her for the first time and think with a shuddering memory of my own marriage how many millions of women there must be in the world who were in a worse position than myself on returning to my room that night i began to look about to see if i had anything i could sell in order to help mrs oliver and so put an end to the condition that kept my baby a prisoner in her house i had nothing or next to nothing except the reverend mothers rosary worth no more than three or four shillings i had only my mothers miniature which was framed in gold and set in pearls but that was the most precious of all my earthly possessions except my child again and again when i looked at it in my darkest hours i had found new strength and courage it had been like a shrine to mewhat the image of the virgin was in happier daysand thinking of all that my darling mother had done and suffered and sacrificed for my sake when i was myself a child i felt that i could never part with her picture under the pressure of any necessity whatever never i thought never under any circumstances it must have been about a week after this that i went to ilford on one of those chill clammy nights which seem peculiar to the east end of london where the atmosphere compounded of smoke and fog and thin drizzling rain penetrates to the bone and hangs on ones shoulders like a shroud thinking of this as i thought of everything in relation to baby i bought as i was passing a hosiers shop a pair of nice warm stockings and a little woollen jacket when i reached the olivers i found to my surprise two strange men stretched out at large in the kitchen one on the sofa and the other in the rockingchair both smoking strong tobacco and baby coughing constantly before i realised what had happened mrs oliver called me into the scullery and after closing the door on us she explained the position in whispers broken by sobs it was the rent these were the bailiffs men put into possession by the landlord and unless she could find two pounds ten by nine oclock tomorrow morning she and her husband would be sold up and turned into the street the home as ive been scraping and pinching to keep together she cried for the sake of two pound ten you couldnt lend us that much could you i told her i could not but she renewed her entreaties asking me to think if i had not something i could pawn for them and saying that ted and she would consider it a sacred dooty to repay again i told her i had nothingi was trying not to think of the miniaturebut just at that moment she caught sight of the childs jacket which i was still holding in my hand and she fell on me with bitter reproaches youve money enough to spend on baby though its crool her living in lukshry and getting new milk night and day and fine clothes being bought for her constant and my pore ted without a roof to cover him in weather same as this it breaks my heart it do indeed take your child away maam take her tonight afore were turned out of house and home tomorrow morning before the hysterical cries with which mrs oliver said this had come to an end i was on my way back to my room at the jews but it was baby i was thinking of in relation to that cold clammy nightthat it would be impossible to take her out in it even if i had somewhere to take her to which i had not without risk to her health and perhaps her life with trembling fingers and an awful pain at my heart i took my mothers miniature from the wall and wrapped it up in tissue paper a few minutes afterwards i was back in the damp streets walking fast and eagerly cutting over the lines of the electric trams without looking for the crossings i knew where i was going toi was going to a pawnbrokers in the mile end waste which i had seen on my west end journeys when i got there i stole in at a side door halfclosing my eyes as i did so by that strange impulse which causes us to see nothing when we do not wish to be seen i shall never forget the scene inside i think it must have left a scar on my brain for i see it now in every detailthe little dark compartment the high counter the shelves at the back full of parcels like those of a leftluggage room at a railway station the heavy baggy bigfaced man in shirtsleeves with a long cigar held between his teeth at the corner of his frothy mouth and then my own hurried breathing my thin fingers opening the tissue paper and holding out the miniature the mans coarse hands fumbling it his casual air as he looked at it and cheapened it as if it had been a common thing scarcely worthy of consideration whats this ere oldfashiond thing portrait of your greatgrandmother hum not arf badlooking fice neither i think my eyes must have been blazing like hot coals i am sure i bit my lips i felt them damp and knew they were bleeding to prevent myself from flinging out at the man in spite of my necessity but i did my best to control my trembling mouth and when he asked me how much i wanted on the miniature i answered with a gulp in my throat two pounds ten if you please sir couldnt do it said the pawnbroker i stood speechless for a moment not knowing what to say next and then the pawnbroker with apparent indifference said ill give you two ten for it out and out you mean i am to sell yus take it or leave it my dear it is no use saying what i suffered at that moment i think i became ten years older during the few minutes i stood at that counter but they came to an end somehow and the next thing i knew was that i was on my way back to ilford that the damp air had deepened into rain that miserable and perhaps homeless beings illclad and illfed were creeping along in the searching cold with that shuffling sound which bad boots make on a wet pavement and that i was telling myself with a fluttering heart that the sheltering wings of my beautiful mother in heaven had come to cover my child on reaching the olivers hot and breathless i put three gold coins two sovereigns and a halfsovereign on to the table to pay off the brokers men they had been settling themselves for the night and looked surprised and i thought chagrined but took up the money and went away as they were going off one of them called me to the door and in the little space at the foot of the stairs he said tipping his fingers towards the cot if thats your kiddie miss i recommend you to get it out o this ere place quicksee i stayed an hour or two longer because i was troubled about babys cough and before i left being still uneasy i did what i had never done beforewrote my address at the jews house so that i could be sent for if i was ever wanted one hundredth chapter when i awoke next morning the last word of the brokers man seemed to be ringing in my ears i knew it was true i knew i ought to remove baby from the house of the olivers without another days delay but i was at a loss to know what to do with her to bring her to my own room at the jews was obviously impossible and to advertise for a nurse for my child was to run the risk of falling into the toils of somebody who might do worse than neglect her in my great perplexity i recalled the waitress at the restaurant whose child had been moved to a home in the country and for some moments i thought how much better it would be that baby should be bonny and well instead of pale and thin as she was now but when i reflected that if i took her to a public institution i should see her only once a month i told myself that i could not and would not do so ill work my fingers to the bone first i thought yet life makes a fearful tug at a woman when it has once got hold of her and strangely enough it was in the jews house that i first came to see that for the childs own sake i must part with her somewhere about the time of my moving into the back room my employer made a kind of bower of branches and evergreens over the leadflat roof of an outhouse in his backyarda succah as miriam called it built in honour of the feast of tabernacles as a symbol of the time when the israelites in the wilderness dwelt in booths in this succah the jews family ate all their meals during the seven or eight days of the jewish feast and one morning as i sat at work by my open window i heard miriam after breakfast reading something from the books of moses it was the beautiful story of jacob parting with benjamin in the days of the famine when there was corn in egypt onlyhow the poor old father in his great love could not bring himself to give up his beloved son although death threatened him how judah pleaded with jacob to send the boy with him into the far country lest they should all die both we and thou and also our little ones and how at last jacob said if it must be so do this but if i be bereaved of my children i am bereaved it would be hard to say how deeply this story moved me while i listened from my room above and now that i thought of it again i saw that i was only sacrificing my child to my selfish love of her and therefore the duty of a true mother was to put her into a home it would not be for long the work i was doing was not the only kind i was capable of after i had liberated myself from the daily extortions of the olivers i should be free to look about for more congenial and profitable employment and then by and by baby and i might live together in that sweet cottage in the country i always pictured it as a kind of sunny lodge with roses looking in at the window of mary oneills little room which still shone through my dreams i spent some sleepless nights in reconciling myself to all this and perhaps wept a little too at the thought that after years of separation i might be a stranger to my own darling but at length i put my faith in the call of the blood to tell her she was mine and then nothing remained except to select the institution to which my only love and treasure was to be assigned accident helped me in this as in other things one day on my westward journey a woman who sat beside me in the tram and was constantly wiping her eyes though i could see a sort of sunshine through her tears could not help telling me out of the overflowing of her poor heart what had just been happening to her she was a widow and had been leaving her little girl three years old at an orphanage and though it had been hard to part with her and the little darling had looked so pitiful when she came away it would be the best for both of them in the long run i asked which orphanage it was and she mentioned the name of it telling me something about the foundera good doctor who had been a father to the fatherless of thousands of poor women like herself that brought me to a quick decision and the very next morning putting on my hat and coat i set off for the home which i knew where to find having walked round it on my way back from the west end and heard the merry voices of happy children who were playing behind a high wall i hardly know whether to laugh or cry when i think of the mood in which i entered the orphanage in spite of all that life had done to me i really and truly felt as if i were about to confer an immense favour upon the doctor by allowing him to take care of my little woman oh how well i remember that little point of time my first disappointment was to learn that the good doctor was dead and when i was shown into the office of his successor everything bore such a businesslike air i found an elderly man with a long threedecker neck and a glacial smile who pushing his spectacles up on to his forehead said in a freezing voice well maam what is your pleasure after a moment of giddiness i began to tell him my storyhow i had a child and her nurse was not taking proper care of her how i was in uncongenial employment myself but hoped soon to get better how i loved my little one and expected to be able to provide for her presently and how therefore if he would receive her for a while only a little while on the understanding the clear and definite understanding that i could take her away as soon as i wished to oh dear oh dear i do not know what there was in my appearance or speech which betrayed me but i had got no further than this when the old gentleman said sharply can you provide a copy of the register of your childs birth to show that it is legitimate what answer i made i cannot recollect except that i told the truth in a voice with a tremor in it for a memory of the registry office was rolling back on me and i could feel my blushes flushing into my face the result was instantaneous the old gentleman touched a bell drew his spectacles down on to his nose and said in his icy tones dont take illegitimate children if we can help it it was several days before i recovered from the deep humiliation of this experience then the exactions of the olivers quickening my memory and at the same time deadening my pride i remembered something which i had heard the old actress say during my time at the boardinghouse about a hospital in bloomsbury for unfortunate childrenhow the good man who founded it had been so firm in his determination that no poor mother in her sorrow should be put to further shame about her innocent child that he had hung out a basket at the gate at night in which she could lay her little one if she liked and then ring a bell and hide herself away it wasnt easy to reconcile oneself to such philanthropy but after a sleepless night and with rather a sickening pang of mingled hope and fear i set off for this hospital it was a fine sunday morning the workingmen in the east end were sitting at their doors smoking their pipes and reading their sunday papers but when i reached the west all the church bells were ringing and people wearing black clothes and shiny black gloves were walking with measured steps through the wide courtyard that led to the chapel i will not say that i did not feel some qualms at entering a protestant church yet as soon as i had taken my seat and looked up at the gallery of the organ where the children sat tier on tier so quaint and sweetthe boys like robins in their bright red waistcoats and the girls like rabbits in their mobcaps with fluted frillsand the service began and the fresh young voices rose in hymns of praise to the good father of us all i thought of nothing except the joy of seeing isabel there some day and hearing her singing in the choir when the service was over i asked for the secretary and was shown into his room i dare say he was a good man but oh why will so many good people wear such wintry weather in their faces that merely to look at them pierces a poor woman to the soul apologising for the day i told my story again my head a little down saying i understood that it was no barrier to a child in that orphanage that she had been born outside the pale of the law on the contrary said the secretary that is precisely the kind of child this house is intended for but when i went on to say that i assumed they still observed the wish of the founder that no questions of any kind should be asked about a childs birth or parentage he said no they had altered all that then he proceeded to explain that before a child could be received the mother must now go before a committee of gentlemen to satisfy them of her previous good character and that the father of her baby had deserted both of them more than that he told me that on being received the child was immediately reregistered and given a new name in order that it might be cut off from the sin of its parents and the contamination of their shame it would be impossible for me to describe the feelings with which i listened to the secretary while he said all this with the castmetal face of a man who was utterly unconscious of the enormity of the crime he was describing before a committee of gentlemen i asked that is so who are to ask her all those questions yes and then they are to change her babys name yes is she told what the new name is to be no but she is given a piece of parchment containing a number which corresponds with the name in our books i rose to my feet flushing up to the eyes i think trembling from head to foot i know and forgetting who and what i was and why i was therea poor helpless penniless being seeking shelter for her childi burst out on the man in all the mad wrath of outraged motherhood and you call this a christian institution i said you take a poor woman in her hour of trouble and torture her with an inquisition into the most secret facts of her life in public and before a committee of men and then you take her child and so far as she is concerned you bury it and give her a ticket to its grave a hospital this is no hospital it is a cemetery and yet you dare to write over your gates the words of our lordour holy and loving and blessed lordwho said suffer little children but what is the use of repeating what i said then perhaps unjustly or afterwards in the silence of my own room and the helpless intoxication of my rage it was soon stamped out of me by the end of another week i was driven to such despair by the continued extortions of the olivers that seeing an advertisement in the underground railway of a home for children in the country asking for subscriptions and showing a group of happy little people playing under a chestnuttree in bloom i decided to make one more effort they cant all be machines i thought with the founders hearts crushed out of them the day was friday when work was apt to heap up at the jews and mrs abramovitch had brought vests enough to my room to cover my bed but nevertheless i put on my hat and coat and set out for the orphanage it was fifteen miles on the north side of london so it cost me something to get there but i was encouraged by the homelike appearance of the place when i reached it and still more by finding that it was conducted by women for at last i thought the womansoul would speak to me but hardly had i told my story to the matron repeating my request very timidly this time and with such a humble humble heart that i might be allowed to recover my child as soon as i found myself able to provide for her than she stopped me and said my dear young person we could have half the orphan children in london on your terms before we accept such a child as yours we expect the parent to give us a legal undertaking that she relinquishes all rights in it until it is sixteen years of age sixteen isnt that rather severe on a mother i said justly severe said the matron such women should be made to maintain their children and thus realise that the way of transgressors is hard how i got back to london whether by rail or tram or on foot or what happened on the way except that darkness was settling down on me within and without i do not know i only know that very late that night as late as eleven oclock i was turning out of park lane into piccadilly where the poor public women with their painted faces dangling their little handbags from their wrists were promenading in front of the gentlemens clubs and smiling up at the windows these were the scenes which had formerly appalled me but now i was suddenly surprised by a different feeling and found myself thinking that among the women who sinned against their womanhood there might be some who sold themselves for bread to keep those they loved and who loved them this thought was passing through my mind when i heard a hollow ringing laugh from a woman who was standing at the foot of a flight of steps talking to a group of three gentlemen whose white shirt fronts beneath their overcoats showed that they were in evening dress her laughter was not natural it had no joy in it yet she laughed and laughed and feeling as if i knew because life had that day trampled on me also i said to myself that womans heart is dead this caused me to glance at her as i passed when catching a side glimpse of her face i was startled by a memory i could not fix where and when have i seen that womans face before i thought it seemed impossible that i could have seen it anywhere but the womans resemblance to somebody i had known coupled with her joyless laughter compelled me to stop at the next corner and look back by this time the gentlemen who had been treating her lightly o god how men treat such women had left her and coming arminarm in my direction with their silk hats tilted a little back were saying poor old aggie shes off completely off is it drink i wonder and then seeing me they said gad heres a nice little gal though no rouge neither by jove no her face is as white as a waterlily seeing that they were wheeling round and fearing they were going to speak to me i moved back and so came face to face with the woman who was standing where they had left her silent now and looking after the men with fierce eyes under the fair hair that curled over her forehead then in a moment a memory from the far past swept over me and i cried almost as if the name had been forced out of me sister angela the woman started and it seemed for a moment as if she were going to run away then she laid hold of me by the arm and looking searchingly into my face said who are you i know you are mary oneill arent you yes i knew you were i read about your marriage to that that man and now you are wondering why i am here well come home with me and see it was not until afterwards that i knew by what mistake about my presence in that place angela thought she must justify herself in my eyes mine but taking me by the hand just as she used to do when i was a child she led almost pulled me down piccadilly and my will was so broken that i did not attempt to resist her we crossed piccadilly circus with its white sheet of electric light and turning into the darker thoroughfares on the northern side of it walked on until in a narrow street of the italian quarter of soho we stopped at a private door by the side of a cafe that had an italian name on the window this is where we live come in said angela and i followed her through a long empty lobby and up three flights of bare stairs while we ascended there was the deadened sound as from the cafe of men singing in throbbing voices to mandolines and guitars one of the italian songs which i remembered to have heard from the piazza outside the convent on that night when sister angela left me in bed while she went off to visit the chaplain oh bella napoli oh suol beato onde sorridere volle il creato the italian club said angela only one flight more come one hundred and first chapter at length angela opened with a key from her satchel a door on the top landing and we entered a darkened room which was partly in the roof as we stepped in i heard rapid breathing which told me that we were in a sick chamber and then a mans voice very husky and weak saying is that you agnes its only me dear said angela after a moment she turned up the solitary gasjet which had been burning low and i saw the shadowy form of a man lying in a bed that stood in a corner he was wasted with consumption his long bony hands were lying on the counterpane his dark hair was matted over his forehead as from sweat but i could not mistake the large lively grey eyes that looked out of his long thin face it was father giovanni angela went up to him and kissed him and i could see that his eyes lighted with a smile as he saw her coming into the room theres somebody with you isnt there he said yes who do you think it is who dont you remember little margaret mary at the sacred heart is this she yes said angela and then in a hoarse angry voice the man said what has she come here for angela told him that i had seen her on piccadilly and being a great lady now i oh heaven was one of the people who came out into the streets at midnight to rescue lost ones she looked as if she wondered what had brought me down to that life so ive fetched her home to see i was shocked at angelas mistake but before i could gather strength or courage to correct her giovanni was raising himself in bed and saying with a defiant air his eyes blazing like watchfires she does it for me if you want to know ive been eleven months illshe does it all for me i tell you and then in one of those outbursts of animation which come to the victims of that fell disease he gave me a rapid account of what had happened to them since they ran away from romehow at first he had earned their living as a teacher of languages how it became known that he was an unfrocked and excommunicated priest who had broken his vows and then his pupils had left him how they had struggled on for some years longer though pursued by this character as by a malignant curse and how at length his health had quite broken down and he would have starved but for agnes angela being her nuns name who had stuck to him through everything while the sick man said this in his husky voice angela was sitting on the bed by his side with her arm about his waist listening to him with a sort of pride and looking at me with a kind of triumph i dare say you wonder why i didnt try to get work she said i could have got it if i had wanted to i could have got it at the italian laundry but what was two shillings a day to a man who was ordered new milk and fresh eggs five times every twentyfour hours not to speak of the house rent she ought to have let me die first said giovanni and then looking at me again with his large glittering fierce eyes he said you think she ought to have let me die dont you no no no i saidit was all i could say for their mistake about myself was choking me perhaps my emotion appeased both of them for after a moment angela beat out giovannis pillow and straightened his counterpane and then told him to lie down and be quiet while she brought a chair for me and took off her things in her own bedroom but hardly had she gone into an adjoining chamber when the sick man raised himself again and reaching over in my direction told me in a hoarse whisper the story of the first night of her present way of lifehow the doctor had said he must be removed to the hospital how agnes would not part with him how the landlord had threatened to turn them out and how at last after sitting with her head in her hands the whole evening aggie had got up and gone out and coming back at midnight had thrown two sovereigns on the table and said there you are giovannithats our rent and your eggs and milk for one week anyway by this time angela had returned to the room her paint and rouge washed off and her gay clothes replaced by a simple woollen jacket over a plain underskirt and she began to beat up an egg to boil some milk to pour out a dose of medicine and to do with all a good womans tact a good womans tenderness the little services of which an invalid stands in need oh heavens how beautiful it wasfearfully awfully tragically beautiful i was deeply moved as i sat in silence watching her and when at length giovanni who had been holding her hand in his own long bony ones and sometimes putting it to his lips dropped off to sleep tired out perhaps by talking to me and she drawing up to where i sat by the end of the bed resumed her selfdefence saying in a whisper that ladies like me could not possibly understand what a woman would do in spite of herself when the life of one she loved was threatened i could bear her mistake no longer but told her of my real conditionthat i was no longer a lady that i had run away from my husband that i had a child and was living as a poor seamstress in the east end of london angela listened to my story in astonishment and when i had come to an end she was holding my hand and looking into my eyes with just that look which she had when she put me to bed for the first time at school and making her voice very low told me to be a good child of the infant jesus its nearly one oclock you cant go back to the east end tonight she whispered oh i must i must i said getting up and making for the door but before i had reached it my limbs gave way whether from the strain of emotion or physical weakness and if it had not been for angela i should have dropped to the floor after that she would hear of no excuses i must stay until morning i could sleep in her own bed in the other room and she could lay a mattress for herself on the floor by the side of giovannis there would be no great sacrifice in that it was going to be one of giovannis bad nights and she was likely to be up and down all the time anyway half an hour later i was in bed in a little room that was separated by a thin papered partition from the room of the poor consumptive and angela who had brought me a cup of hot milk was saying in a whisper hes very bad the doctor says he cant last longer than a week sister veronica you remember her shes mildred bankes that used to be tried to get him into a home for the dying it was all arranged too but at the last moment he wouldnt go he told them that if they wanted to separate him from agnes they had better bring his coffin because he would be dead before they got him to the door when she had gone i lay a long time in the dark listening to the sounds on the other side of the partition giovanni awoke with an alarming fit of coughing and in the querulous plaintive fretful sometimes angry tones which invalids have he grumbled at angela and then cried over her saying what a burden he was to her while she moving about the room in her bare feet coaxed and caressed him and persuaded him to take his milk or his medicine through all this i would hear at intervals the drumming noises of the singing downstairs which sounded in my ears as the singers were becoming more and more intoxicated like the swirling and screeching of an ironical requiem for the dying man before he was dead oh bella napoli oh suol beato onde sorridere volle il creato but somewhere in those dead hours in which london sleeps everything became still and my mind which had been questioning the grim darkness on the worst of the worlds tragedies what a woman will do for those she loves fell back on myself and i thought of the christian institutions which had turned me from their doors and then of this streetwalker who had given up her own bed to me and was now lying in the next room on a mattress on the floor i could not help it if i felt a startling reverence for angela as a ministering angel faithful unto death and i remembered that as i fell asleep i was telling myself that we all needed gods mercy gods pardon and that god would forgive her because she had loved much but sleep was more tolerant still i dreamt that angela died and on reaching the gates of heaven all the saints of god met her and after they had clothed her in a spotless white robe one of themit was the blessed mary magdalenetook her hand and said here is another of the holy martyrs i awoke from that dream with beads of perspiration on my forehead but i dare not say what confused and terrible thoughts came next except that they were about babywhat i might do myself if driven to the last extremity when i slept and dreamt again it was i who was dead and it was my darling mother who met me and took me to the feet of the blessed virgin and said mother of all mothers who knows all that is in a mothers heart this is my little daughter she did not intend to do wrong it was all for the sake of her child when i awoke in the morning with the darkness shivering off through the gloom this last dream was sitting upon me like a nightmare it terrified me i felt as if i were standing on the edge of a precipice and some awful forces were trying to push me over it the london sparrows were chirping on the skylight over my head and i could faintly hear the italian criers in the front street latte spazzina erbaggi freschi in spite of myself hating myself for it after all the tenderness that had been shown me i could not overcome a feeling of shame at finding myself lying where i was and i got up to run away that i might cleanse my soul of the evil thoughts which had come to me while there as i dressed i listened for a sound from the adjoining room all was quiet now the poor restless ones were at last getting a little rest a few minutes afterwards i passed on tiptoe through their room without looking towards the bed and reaching the door to the staircase i opened it as noiselessly as i could then i closed it softly after me on so much suffering and so much love one hundred and second chapter the sun was shining in the street it was one of those clear clean frosty mornings when the very air of london even in the worst places seems to be washed by the sunlight from the sin and drink of the night before i was on my way to that church among the mews of mayfair to which i had gone so frequently during the early days of my marriage when i was struggling against the mortal sin as i thought it was of loving martin just as i reached the church and was ascending the steps a gorgeous landau with highstepping horses and a powdered footman drew up at the bottom of them the carriage which bore a coronet on the door contained a lady in long furs a rosyfaced babygirl in squirrel skins with a large doll in her arms and a nurse i could see that like myself the lady a young mother had come to confess for as she rose from her seat she told the child to sit quiet and be good and she would not keep her long tum out soon mummy and dolly will lub you eber and eber said the child the lady stooped and kissed the little one and then with a proud and happy look stepped out of the carriage and passed into the church while the doorkeeper opened the vestibule door for her and bowed deeply i stood at the top of the steps for a moment looking back at the carriage the horses the footman the nurse and above all the babygirl with her doll and then followed the lady into the church apparently mass was just over little spirelets of smoke were rising from the candles on the altar which the sacristan was putting out a few communicants were still on their knees and others with light yet echoing footsteps were making for the door the lady in furs had already taken her place at one of the confessional boxes and as there seemed to be no other that was occupied by a priest i knelt on a chair in the nave and tried to fix my mind on the prayers once so familiar for the examination of conscience before confession oh lord jesus christ dispel the darkness of my heart that i may bewail my sins and rightly confess them but the labouring of my spirit was like the flight of a bat in the daylight though i tried hard to keep my mind from wandering i could not do so again and again it went back to the lady in furs with the coroneted carriage and the highstepping horses she was about my own age and she began to rise before my tightly closed eyes as a vision of what i might have been myself if i had not given up everything for lovewealth rank title luxury god is my witness that down to that moment i had never once thought i had made any sacrifice but now as by a flash of cruel lightning i saw myself as i wasa peeress who had run away from her natural condition and was living in the slums working like any other workgirl even this did not hurt me much but when i thought of the rosyfaced child in the carriage and then of my own darling at mrs olivers as i had seen her last so thin and pale and with her little bib stained by her curdled milk a feeling i had never had before pierced to my very soul i asked myself if this was what god looked down upon and permittedthat because i had obeyed what i still believed to be the purest impulse of my nature love my child must be made to suffer then something hard began to form in my heart i told myself that what i had been taught to believe about god was falsehood and deception all this time i was trying to hush down my mind by saying my prayer which called on the gracious virgin mary to intercede for me with my redeemer and the holy saints of god to assist me assist me by thy grace that i may be able to declare my sins to the priest thy vicar it was of no use every moment my heart was hardening and what i had intended to confess about my wicked thoughts of the night before was vanishing away at last i rose to my feet and lifting my head looked boldly up at the altar just at that moment the young peeress having finished her confession went off with a light step and a cheerful face her kneelingplace at the confessional box was now vacant yet i did not attempt to take it and some minutes passed in which i stood biting my lips to prevent a cry then the priest parted his curtains and beckoned to me and i moved across and stood stubbornly by the perforated brass grating father i said as firmly as i could for my throat was fluttering i came here to make my confession but something has come over me since i entered this church and now i cannot what has come over you my child asked the priest i feel that what is said about god in a place like this that he is a kind and beneficent father who is just and merciful and pities the sufferings of his children is untrue it is all wrong and false god does not care the priest did not answer me immediately but after a moment of silence he said in a quivering voice my child i feel just like that myself sometimes it is the devil tempting you he is standing by your side and whispering in your ear at this moment i shuddered and the priest added i see how it is my daughter you are suffering and those you love are suffering too but must you surrender your faith on that account look round at the pictures on these walls the stations of the cross think of the great sufferer the great martyr who in the hour of his death at the malicious power of the world cried eloi eloi lama sabachthani my god my god why hast thou forsaken me i had dropped to my knees by now my head was down and my hands were clasped together you are wrong my child if you think god does not care for you because he allows you to suffer are you rich are you prosperous have you every earthly blessing then beware for satan is watching for your soul but are you poor are you going through unmerited trouble have you lost some one who was dearer to you than your heart of hearts then take courage for our holy and blessed saviour has marked you for his own i know nothing of that priest except his whispering voice which coming through the grating of the confessional produced the effect of the supernatural but i thought then and i think now that he must have been a great as well as a good man i perfectly recollect that when i left the church and passed into the streets it seemed as if his spirit went with me and built up in my soul a resolution that was bright with heavenly tears and sunshine work work work i should work still harder than before no matter how mean illpaid and uncongenial my work might be i should work all day and all night if necessary and since i had failed to get my child into an orphanage it was clearly intended that i should keep her with me for my own charge and care and joy this was the mood in which i returned to the house of the jew it was saturday morning and though the broader thoroughfares of the east end were crowded and the narrower streets full of life the jews house was silent for it was the jewish sabbath as i went hurriedly upstairs i heard the jew himself who was dressing for the synagogue singing his sabbath hymn lerho daudee likras kollocome o friend let us go forth to meet the bride let us receive the sabbath with joy then came a shock when i reached my room i found to my dismay that the pile of vests which i had left on my bed on going out the day before had been removed and just as i was telling myself that no one else except mrs abramovitch had a key to my door i heard shuffling footsteps on the stair and knew that her husband was coming up to me a moment afterwards the jew stood in my doorway he was dressed in his sabbath suit and free from the incongruous indications of his homely calling the patriarchal appearance which had first struck me was even more marked than before his face was pale his expression was severe and if his tongue betrayed the broken english of the polish jew i in my confusion and fear did not notice it then my first thought was that he had come to reprove me for neglecting my work and i was prepared to promise to make up for my absence but at a second glance i saw that something had happened something had become known and that he was there to condemn and denounce me you have been out all night he said can you tell me where you have been i knew i could not and though it flashed upon me to say that i had slept at the house of a friend i saw that if he asked who my friend was and what i should be speechless the jew waited for my reply and then said you have given us a namecan you say it is your true and right one again i made no answer and after another moment the jew said can you deny that you have a child whom you have hidden from our knowledge i felt myself gasping but still i did not speak can you say that it was lawfully born according to your christian marriage i felt the colour flushing into my face but i was still silent and after a moment in which as i could see the sternnatured jew was summing me up as a woman of double life and evil character he said then it is true very well you will understand that from this day you cease to be in my service all this time my eyes were down but i was aware that somebody else had come into the room it was miriam and she was trying to plead for me father she began but turning hotly upon her the jew cried passionately go away a true daughter of israel should know better than to speak for such a woman i heard the girl going slowly down the stairs and then the jew stepping up to me and speaking more loudly than before said woman leave my house at once before you corrupt the conscience of my child again i became aware that some one had come into the room it was mrs abramovitch and she too was pleading for me israel calm thyself do not give way to injustice and anger on shobbos morning too hannah said the jew thou speakest with thy mouth not thy heart the christian doth not deny that she hath given thee a false name and is the adulterous mother of a misbegotten child if she were a jewish woman she would be summoned before the beth din and in better days our law of moses would have stoned her shall she because she is a christian dishonour a good jewish house no the hand of the lord would go out against me but she is homeless and she hath been a good servant to thee israel give her time to find another shelter there was a moment of silence after that and then the jew said very well it shall not be said that israel abramovitch knows not to temper justice with mercy and then my face being still down i heard him saying over my head you may stay here another week after that i wash my hands of thee with these hard words he turned away and i heard him going heavily down the stairs his wife stayed a little longer saying something in a kind voice which i did not comprehend and then she followed him i do not think i had spoken a word i continued to stand where the jew had left me after a while i heard him closing and locking the door of his own apartment and knew that he was going off to his synagogue in brick lane in his tall silk hat worn on the back of his head like a skullcap and with his wife and daughter behind him carrying his leatherbound prayerbook i hardly knew what else was happening my heart was heaving like a dead body on a billow all that the priest had said was gone in its place there was a paralysing despair as if the wheels of life were rolling over me memorandum by martin conrad my dear longsuffering martyred darling it makes my blood boil to see how the very powers of darkness in the name of religion morality philanthropy and the judgment of god were persecuting my poor little woman but why speak of myself at all or interrupt my darlings narrative except to say what was happening in my efforts to reach her while we were swinging along in our big liner over the heaving bosom of the mediterranean the indefinable sense of her danger never left me day or night that old dream of the glacier and the precipice continued to haunt my sleep with the difference that instead of the aurora glistening in my dear ones eyes there was now a blizzard behind her the miserable thing so tortured me as we approached malta where i expected to receive a reply to the cable i had sent from port said to the house of daniel oneill that i felt physically weak at the thought of the joy or sorrow ahead of me though there was no telegram from my darling at malta there was one from the chairman of my committee saying he was coming to marseilles to meet our steamer and would sail the rest of the way home with us indirectly this brought me a certain comfort it reminded me of the letter i had written for my dear one on the day i left castle raa sixteen months had passed since then serious things had happened in the interval and i had never thought of that letter before it was not to her father as she supposed and certainly not to her husband it was to my chairman asking him in the event of my darling sending it on to do whatever was necessary to protect her during my absence if my chairman had not received that letter my conclusion would be that my dear little woman had never been reduced to such straits as to require help from any one if he had in fact received it he must have done what i wished and therefore everything would be well there was a certain suspense as well as a certain consolation in all this and before our big ship slowed down at marseilles i was on deck searching for my chairman among the people waiting for us on the pier i saw him immediately waving his travelling cap with a flourish of joy and i snatched a little comfort from that as soon as the steamer was brought to he was the first to come aboard and i scanned his face as he hurried up the gangway it was beaming its all right i thought a man could not look as happy as that if he were bringing me bad news a moment afterwards he was shaking my hand clapping me on the shoulder and saying splendid magnificent glorious achievement proved your point up to the hilt my boy and when i said something about not having gone all the way he cried never mind youll do it next time which made some of my shipmates who were standing round with shining eyes say aye aye sir and then one of them it was good old osullivan shouted by the stars of heaven thats thrue my lord and if anybodys after saying that the commanther was turned back this time by anything less than the almighty power of nature in her wrath you may say theres fortyeight of us here to tell him he lies i believe it said the chairman and then there were further congratulations with messages from members of my committee but never a word from my dear one thinking the chairman might hesitate to speak of a private matter until we were alone i took him down to my stateroom but he had nothing to say there either except about articles to be written reports to be compiled and invitations to be accepted several hours passed like this we were again out at sea and my longing to know what had happened was consuming me but i dared not ask from fear of a bad answer before the night was out however i had gone to work in a roundabout way taking osullivan into my confidence i told him it had not been my parents that i had been anxious about god forgive me but somebody else whom he had seen and spoken to do you mean mal i should say lady yes by the holy saints the way i was thinking that when i brought you the letter at port said and saw the clouds of heaven still hanging on you i found that the good fellow had a similar trouble of his own not yet having heard from his mother so he fell readily into my plan which was that of crossquestioning the chairman about my dear one and i about his and then meeting secretly and imparting what we had learned anybody may laugh who likes at the thought of two big lumbering fellows afraid to face the truth scouting round and round it but it grips me by the throat to this day to see myself taking our chairman into a quiet corner of the smokeroom and saying poor old osullivan he hasnt heard from his old mother yet she was sick when he sailed and wouldnt have parted with him to go with anybody except myself you havent heard of her have you and then to think of osullivan doing the same for me with the poor commanther look at him there faith hes keeping a good heart isnt he but its just destroyed he is for want of news of a great friend that was in trouble it was a girl a lady i mane you havent heard the whisper of a word sir eh our chairman had heard nothing and when bracing myself at last i asked pointblank if anything had been sent to him as from me and he answered no i might have been relieved but i wasnt though i did not know then that my darling had burnt my letter i began to feel that she was the last person in the world to use it being god bless her of the mettle that makes a woman want to fight her own battles without asking help of any one this quite crushed down my heart for seeing that she had sent no reply to my cables i could not find any escape from the conclusion that she was where no word could come from hershe was dead lord god how i suffered when this phantom got into my mind i used to walk up and down the promenade deck late into the night trying and condemning myself as if i had been my own judge and jury she is dead i have killed her i thought thank god the phantom was soon laid by the gladdest sight i ever saw on earth or ever expect to see and it wouldnt be necessary to speak of it now but for the glorious confidence it brought me it was the same with me as with a shipbroken man whom providence comes to relieve in his last extremity and i could fix the place of mine as certainly as if i had marked it on a chart we had called at gibraltar where osullivan had received a letter from his mother saying she was splendid and were running along the coast of portugal it was a dirty black night with intervals of rain i remember while my shipmates were making cheerful times of it in the smokeroom osullivan with heart at ease singing the minsthrel boy to a chorus of noisy cheers i was walking up and down the deck with my little stock of courage nearly gone for turn which way i would it was dark dark dark when just as we picked up the lights of finisterre something said to me as plainly as words could speak what in the name of thunder are you thinking about do you mean to say that you were turned back in the th latitude and have been hurried home without the loss of a moment only to find everything over at the end of your journey no no no your poor dear heroic little woman is alive she may be in danger and beset by all the powers of the devil but thats just why you have been brought home to save her and you will save her as surely as the sun will rise tomorrow morning there are thoughts which like great notes in music grip you by the soul and lift you into a world which you dont naturally belong to this was one of them never after that did i feel one moments real anxiety i was my own man once more and though i continued to walk the deck while our good ship sped along in the night it was only because there was a kind of wild harmony between the mighty voice of the rolling billows of the bay and the unheard anthem of boundless hope that was singing in my breast i recollect that during my walk a hymn was always haunting me it was the same that we used to sing in the shuddering darkness of that perpetual night when we stood fifty downhearted men under the shelter of our snow camp with a ninety mile blizzard shrieking above us lead kindly light amid th encircling gloom lead thou me on but the light was within me now and i knew as certainly as that the good ship was under my feet that i was being carried home at the call of the spirit to rescue my stricken darling god keep her on her solitary way england england england less than a week and i should be there that was early hours on saturday morningthe very saturday when my poor little woman after she had been turned away by those prating philanthropists was being sheltered by the prostitute let him explain it who can i cannot mc end of martin conrads memorandum one hundred and third chapter i must have been sitting a full hour or more on the end of my bedstunned stupefied unable to thinkwhen miriam back from the synagogue came stealthily upstairs to say that a messenger had come for me about six oclock the night before he said his name was oliver and father saw him and thats how he came to know tell her that her child is ill and she is to come immediately he said i was hardly conscious of what happened nexthardly aware of passing through the streets to ilford i had a sense of houses flying by as they seem to do from an express train of my knees trembling of my throat tightening and of my whole soul crying out to god to save the life of my child until i could get to her when i reached the house of the olivers the worst of my fears were relieved mrs oliver was sitting before the fire with baby on her lap at sight of me the woman began to mumble out something about my delay and how she could not be held responsible if anything happened but caring nothing about responsibility hers or mine i took baby from her without more words my child was in a state of deep drowsiness and when i tried to rouse her i could not do so i gathered that this condition had lasted twentyfour hours during which she had taken no nourishment with the result that she was now very thin i knew nothing of childrens ailments but a motherly instinct must have come to my aid for i called for a bath and bathed baby and she awoke and then took a little food but again she dropped back into the drowsy condition and mrs oliver who was alarmed called in some of the neighbours to look at her apparently the mission of the good women was to comfort mrs oliver not me but they said sleep never did no harm to nobody and i found a certain consolation in that hours passed i was barely sensible of anything that happened beyond the narrow circle of my own lap but at one moment i heard the squirling of a brass band that was going up the street with the shuffling of an irregular procession its the strike said mrs oliver running to the window theres ted carrying a banner a little later i heard the confused noises of a strike meeting which was being held on the green it was like the croaking of a frogpond with now and then a strident voice the bricklayers crying buckle your belts tighter and starve rather than give in boys still later i heard the procession going away singing with a slashing sound that was like driving wind and pelting rain the land the land the blessed blessed land gawd gave the land to the people but nothing awakened baby and towards three in the afternoon the idea that she was really ill having taken complete possession of me i asked where i could find the nearest doctor and being told i went off in search of him the doctor was on his rounds so i left a written message indicating babys symptoms and begging him to come to her immediately on the way back i passed a number of childrens funeralseasily recognisable by the combined coach and hearse the white linen weepers worn by the coachman and his assistant and the little coffin sprinkled with cheap flowers in the glass case behind the drivers seat these sights which brought back a memory of the woman who carried my baby down the mile end road almost deprived me of my senses i had hardly got back and taken off my coat and warmed my hands and dress by the fire before taking baby in my lap when the doctor in his gig pulled up at the door he was a young man but he seemed to take in the situation in a moment i was the mother wasnt i yes and this woman was babys nurse yes then he drew up a chair and looked steadfastly down at baby and i went through that breathless moment which most of us know when we are waiting for the doctors first word some acute digestive trouble here apparently he said and then something about finding out the cause of it but hardly had he put his hands on my child as she lay in my lap than there came a faintly discoloured vomit what have you been giving her he said looking round at mrs oliver mrs oliver protested that she had given baby nothing except her milk but the doctor said sharply dont talk nonsense woman show me what youve given her then mrs oliver looking frightened went upstairs and brought down a bottle of medicine saying it was a soothing syrup which i had myself bought for babys cough as i thought said the doctor and going to the door and opening it he flung the bottle on to the waste ground opposite saying as he did so if i hear of you giving your babies any more of your soothing syrup ill see what the inspector has to say after that ignoring nurse he asked me some searching and intimate questionsif i had had a great grief or shock or worry while baby was coming and whether and how long i had nursed her i answered as truthfully as i could though i saw the drift of his inquiries and was trembling with fear of what he would tell me next he said nothing then however except to make his recommendations and remembering my loss of work my heart sank as he enumerated babys needsfresh cows milk diluted with lime water small quantities of meat juice and twenty to thirty drops of the best brandy three or four times a day when he rose to go i paid his fee it was only halfacrown but he cannot have known how much that meant to me for as he was leaving the kitchen he told me to send for him again in the morning if there were a change in the symptoms feeling that i did not yet know the whole truth though i was trembling in terror of it i handed baby to mrs oliver and followed the doctor to the door doctor i said is my baby very ill he hesitated for a moment and then answered yes dangerously ill again he hesitated and then looking closely at me i felt my lower lip trembling he said i wont say that shes suffering from marasmus provoked by overdoses of the pernicious stuff that is given by ignorant and unscrupulous people to a restless child to keep it quiet but her real trouble comes of maternal weakness and the only cure for that is good nourishment and above all fresh air and sunshine will she get better if you can take her away into the country she will certainly and if if i cant i asked the words fluttering up to my lips will she die the doctor looked steadfastly at me again i was biting my lip to keep it firm and said she may when i returned to the kitchen i knew that i was face to face with another of the great mysteries of a womans lifedeaththe death of my child which my very love and tenderness had exposed her to meantime mrs oliver who was as white as a whitewashed wall was excusing herself in a whining voice that had the sound of a spent wave she wouldnt have hurt the pore dear precious for worlds and if it hadnt been for ted who was so tired at night and wanted sleep after walking in percession partly to get rid of the woman i sent her out with almost the last of my money for some of the things ordered by the doctor while she was away and i was looking down at the little silent face on my lap praying for one more glimpse of my martins seablue eyes the bricklayer came lunging into the house wheres lizer he said i told him and he cried the baiby again allus the baiby with that he took out of his pocket a cake of moist tobacco cut and rolled some of it in his palm and then charged his pipe and lit itfilling the air with clouds of rank smoke which made baby bark and cough without rousing her i pointed this out to him and asked him not to smoke eh he said and then i told him that the doctor had been called and what he had said about fresh air so thats it is it he said good just reminds me of something i want to say so ill introdooce the matter now in a manner o speaking last night i ad to go to mile end for you and heres lizer out on a simlar arrand if people ave got to be ospital nurses to a sick baiby they ought to be paid mind ye were only pore and it may be a sacred dooty walkin in percession but it aint fillin choking with anger i said put out your pipe please maam to you put it out this moment sir or ill see if i cant find somebody to make you the bricklayer laughed then pointed with the shank of his pipe to the two photographs over the mantelpiece and said see them thems me with my dooks up if any friend o yourn as is interested in the baiby comes to lay a and on me ill see if ive forgot ow to use em i felt the colour shuddering out of my cheeks and putting baby into the cot i turned on the man and cried you scoundrel the doctor has told me what is the immediate cause of my babys illness and your wife has confessed to giving overdoses of a drug at your direction if you dont leave this house in one minute ill go straight to the policestation and charge you with poisoning my child the bully in the coward was cowed in a moment dont get uffy maam he said im the peaceablest man in the east end and if i mentioned anything about a friend o yourn it slipped out in the eat of the momentsee out you go go go i cried and incredible as it may seem the man went flying before my face as if i had been a fury it would be a long tale to tell of what happened the day following the next and the next and the nexthow baby became less drowsy but more restless how being unable to retain her food she grew thinner and thinner how i wished to send for the doctor but dared not do so from fear of his fee how the little money i had left was barely sufficient to buy the food and stimulants which were necessary to babys cure how i sat for long hours with my little lamb on my lap straining my dry eyes into her face and how i cried to god for the life of my child which was everything i had or wanted all this time i was still lodging at the jews returning to it late every night and leaving it early in the morning but nothing happened there that seemed to me of the smallest consequence one day miriam looking at me with her big black eyes said you must take more rest dear or you will make yourself ill no no i am not ill i answered and then remembering how necessary my life was to the life of my child i said i must not be ill at last on the saturday morningi know now it must have been saturday but time did not count with me theni overheard mrs abramovitch pleading for me with her husband saying they knew i was in trouble and therefore i ought to have more time to find lodging another weekthree days at all events but the sternnatured man with his rigid religion was inexorable it was gods will that i should be punished and who was he to step in between the allhigh and his just retribution the woman is displeasing to god he said and then he declared that the day being sabbath the two tall candlesticks and the sabbath loaves must have been under his eyes at the moment he would give me until nine oclock that night and if i had not moved out by that time he would put my belongings into the street i remember that the jews threat made no impression upon my mind it mattered very little to me where i was to lodge next week or what roof was to cover me when i reached the olivers that morning i found baby distinctly worse even the brandy would not stay on her stomach and hence her strength was plainly diminishing i sat for some time looking steadfastly into my childs face and then i asked myself as millions of mothers must have done before me why my baby should suffer so why why why there seemed to be no answer to that question except one baby was suffering because i was poor if i had not been poor i could have taken her into the country for fresh air and sunshine where she would have recovered as the doctor had so confidently assured me and why was i poor i was poor because i had refused to be enslaved by my fathers authority when it was vain and wrong or my husbands when it was gross and cruel and because i had obeyed the highest that was in methe call of love and now god looked down on the sufferings of my baby who was being killed for my conductkilled by my poverty i tremble to say what wild impulses came at that thought i felt that if my baby died and i ever stood before god to be judged i should judge him in return i should ask him why if he were almighty he permitted the evil in the world to triumph over the good and if he were our heavenly father why he allowed innocent children to suffer was there any human father who could be so callous so neglectful so cruel as that i dare say it was a terrible thing to bring god to the bar of judgment to be judged by his poor weak ignorant creature but it was also terrible to sit with a dying baby on my lap i thought mine was dying and to feel that there was nothingnot one thingi could do to relieve its sufferings my faith went down like a flood during the heavy hours of that dayall that i had been taught to believe about gods goodness and the marvellous efficacy of the sacraments of his church i thought of the sacrament of my marriage which the pope told me had been sanctioned by my redeemer under a natural law that those who entered into it might live together in peace and loveand then of my husband and his brutal infidelities i thought of the sacrament of my babys baptism which was to exorcise all the devils out of my childand then of the worst devil in the world poverty which was taking her very life after that a dark shadow crossed my soul and i told myself that since god was doing nothing since he was allowing my only treasure to be torn away from me i would fight for my childs life as any animal fights for her young by this time a new kind of despair had taken hold of me it was no longer the paralysing despair but the despair that has a driving force in it my child shall not die i thought at least poverty shall not kill her many times during the day i had heard mrs oliver trying to comfort me with various forms of sloppy sentiment children were a great trial they were allus makin and keepin people pore and it was sometimes better for the dears themselves to be in their eavenly fathers boosim i hardly listened it was the same as if somebody were talking to me in my sleep but towards nightfall my deaf ear caught something about myselfthat it i knew what that meant might be better for me also for then i should be free of encumbrances and could marry again of course you couldyou so young and goodlookin only the other day the person at number five could tell me as you were the prettiest woman as comes up the row and the vicars wife couldnt hold a candle to you fine feathers makes fine birds says she give your young lady a nice frock and a bit o colour in her checks and there aint many as could best her in the west end neither as the woman talked dark thoughts took possession of me i began to think of angela i tried not to but i could not help it and then came the moment of my fiercest trial with a sense of death hanging over my child i told myself that the only way to drive it off was to make some great sacrifice hitherto i had thought of everything i possessed as belonging to baby but now i felt that i myself belonged to her i had brought her into the world and it was my duty to see that she did not suffer all this time the inherited instinct of my religion was fighting hard with me and i was saying many hail marys to prevent myself from doing what i meant to do hail mary full of grace the lord is with thee i felt as if i were losing my reason but it was of no use struggling against the awful impulse of selfsacrifice for such i thought it which had taken hold of my mind and at last it conquered me i must get money i thought unless i get money my child will die imustgetmoney towards seven oclock i got up gave baby to mrs oliver put on my coat and fixed with nervous fingers my hat and hatpins where are you going to pore thing asked mrs oliver i am going out ill be back in the morning i answered and then after kneeling and kissing my baby againmy sweet child my isabeli tore the street door open and pulled it noisily behind me one hundred and fourth chapter on reaching the front street i may have taken the penny tram for though i had a sense of growing blind and deaf i have vague memories of lights flashing past me and of the clanging of electric cars at bow church i must have got out probably to save a further fare because i recollect walking along the bow road between the lights in the shops and the coarse flares from the stalls on the edge of the pavement where women with baskets on their arms were doing their saturday nights shopping my heart was still strong sharpened indeed into poignancy and i know i was not crying for at one moment as i passed the mirror in a chemists window i caught sight of my face and it was fierce as flame at another moment while i was hurrying along i collided with a drunken woman who was coming out of a publichouse with her arm about the neck of a drunken sailor gawd heres the verging mary agine she cried it was the woman who had carried baby and when i tried to hurry past her she said you think im drunk dont you dear soam dont you never get drunk no what a bleedin fool you are want to get out o this ere ole tike my tip thengettin drunks ony way out of it farther on i had to steer my way through jostling companies of young people of both sexes who were going i thought the same way as the womangirls out of the factories with their free walk and their boisterous fellers from the breweries it was a cold and savage night as i approached the side street in which i lived i saw by the light of the arc lamps a small group of people a shivering straggle of audience with the hunchedup shoulders of beings thinly clad and badly fed standing in stupid silence at the corner while two persons wearing blue uniforms a man in a peaked cap and a young woman in a poke bonnet sang a salvation hymn of which the refrain was it is well it is well with my soul the door of the jews house was shut for the first time in my experience so i had to knock and wait and while i waited i could not help but hear the young woman in the poke bonnet pray her prayer was about raising the standard of calvary and making the drunkards and harlots of the east end into seekers and soul yielders and prisoners of the king of kings before the last words of the prayer were finished the man in the peaked cap tossed up his voice in another hymn and the young woman joined him with an accordion shall we gather at the river where bright angel feet have trod the door was opened by the jew himself who assuming a severe manner said something to me in his guttural voice which i did not hear or heed for i pushed past him and walked firmly upstairs when i had reached my room and lit the gas i closed and locked the door as if i were preparing to commit a crimeand perhaps i was i did not allow myself to think of what i intended to do that night but i knew quite well and when at one moment my conscience pressed me hard something cried out in my heart who can blame me since my childs life is in danger i opened my trunk and took out my clothesall that remained of the dresses i had brought from ellan they were few and more than a little out of fashion but one of them though far from gay was bright and stylisha light blue frock with a high collar and some white lace over the bosom i remember wondering why i had not thought of pawning it during the week when i had had so much need of money and then being glad that i had not done so it was thin and light being the dress i had worn on the day i first came to the east end carrying my baby to ilford when the weather was warm which now was cold but i paid no heed to that thinking only that it was my best and most attractive after i had put it on and glanced at myself in my little swinging lookingglass i was pleased but i saw at the same time that my face was deadly pale and that made me think of some bottles and cardboard boxes which lay in the pockets of my trunk i knew what they containedthe remains of the cosmetics which i had bought in cairo in the foolish days when i was trying to make my husband love me never since then had i looked at them but now i took them out with a hares foot and some pads and brushes and began to paint my pale facereddening my cracked and colourless lips and powdering out the dark rings under my eyes while i was doing this i heard though i was trying not to the deadened sound of the singing in the front street with the young womans treble voice above the mans bass and the wheezing of the accordion yes well gather at the river where bright angel feet have trod with its crystal tide for ever flowing by the throne of god the dark spirit must have taken possession of me by this time poor vessel of conflicting passions as i was for i remember that while i listened i laughedthinking what mockery was to sing of angel feet and crystal tides to those shivering wretches at the corner of the london street in the smoky night air what a farce i thought what a heartless farce then i put on my hat which was also not very gay and taking out of my trunk a pair of long light gloves which i had never worn since i left ellan i began to pull them on i was standing before the lookingglass in the act of doing this and trying god pity me to smile at myself when i was suddenly smitten by a new thought i was about to commit suicidethe worst kind of suicide not the suicide which is followed by oblivion but by a life on earth after death after that night mary oneill would no longer exist i should never he able to think of her again i should have killed her and buried her and stamped the earth down on her and she would be gone from me for ever that made a grip at my heartawakening memories of happy days in my childhood bringing back the wild bliss of the short period of my great love and even making me think of my life in rome with its confessions its masses and the sweetness of its church bells i was saying farewell to mary oneill and parting with oneself seemed so terrible that when i thought of it my heart seemed ready to burst but who can blame me when my childs life is in danger i asked myself again still tugging at my long gloves by the time i had finished dressing the salvationists were going off to their barracks with their followers behind them under the singing i could faintly hear the shuffling of bad shoes which made a sound like the wash of an ebbing tide over the teeth of a rocky beachup our side street past the womens night shelter where the beds never had time to become cool and beyond the publichouse with the placard in the window saying the ale sold there could be guaranteed to make anybody drunk for fourpence well stand the storm it wont be long and well anchor in the sweet byandby i listened and tried to laugh again but i could not do so now there was one last spasm of my cruelly palpitating heart in which i covered my face with both hands and cried for babys sake for my babys sake and then i opened my bedroom door walked boldly downstairs and went out into the streets memorandum by martin conrad i dont call it chance that this was the very day of my return to england if i had to believe that i should have to disbelieve half of what is best in the human story and the whole of what we are taught about a guiding providence and the spiritual influences which we cannot reason about and prove we were two days late arriving having made dirty weather of it in the bay of biscay which injured our propeller and compelled us to lie to so i will not say that the sense of certainty which came to me off finisterre did not suffer a certain shock in fact the pangs of uncertainty grew so strongly upon me as we neared home that in the middle of the last night of our voyage i went to osullivans cabin and sat on the side of his bunk for hours talking of the chances of my darling being lost and of the possibility of finding her osullivan god bless him was certain sure that everything would be right and he tried to take things gaily the way im knowing shell be at southampton in a new hat and feather so mind yer oi commanther we passed the channel islands in the spring of morning and at breakfasttime we picked up the pilot who had brought out a group of reporters i did my best for the good chaps though it is mighty hard to talk about exploring when you are thinking of another subject and then handed them over to my shipmates towards seven oclock at night we heaved up to the grey stone pier at the head of southampton water it was then dark so being unable to see more than the black forms and waving hands of the crowd waiting for us with the lights behind them i arranged with osullivan that he should slip ashore as soon as we got alongside and see if he could find my dear one will you remember her face i asked and why wouldnt i by the stars of god theres only one of it in the world he answered the welcome we got when we were brought to was enough to make a vain man proud and a modest one ashamed and perhaps i should have had a little of both feelings if the right woman had been there to share them my stateroom was on the promenade deck and i stood at the door of it as long as i dared raising my cap at the call of my name but feeling as if i were the loneliest man in the world god help me osullivan had not returned when treacle came to say that everything was ready and it was time to go ashore i will not say that i was not happy to be home i will not pretend that the warmhearted welcome did not touch me but god knows there was a moment when for want of a face i did not see i could have turned about and gone back to the south pole there and then without an instants hesitation when i got ashore i had as much as i could do to stand foursquare to the storm of handshaking that fell on me and perhaps if i had been in better trim i should have found lots of fun in the boyish delight of my shipmates in being back with old treacle shaking hands with everybody from the mayor of the town to the messengerboys crying what cheer matey while the scientific staff were bringing up their wives to be introduced to me just as the lowerform fellows used to do with their big sisters at school at last osullivan came back with a long face to say he could see nothing of my dear one and then i braced myself and said never mind shell be waiting for us in london perhaps it took a shocking time to pass through the customs but we got off at last in a special train commissioned by our chairmanhalf of our company with their wives and a good many reporters having crammed themselves into the big saloon carriage reserved for me at the last moment somebody threw a sheaf of evening papers through my window and as soon as we were well away i took up one of them and tried to read it but column after column fell blank on my eyes for my mind was full of other matters the talk in the carriage too did not interest me in the least it was about the big hustling resonant world general elections the fall of ministries acts of parliament and the lord knows whatthings that had looked important when we were in the dumb solitude of winter quarters but seemed to be of no account now when i was hungering for something else at last i got a quiet pressman in a corner and questioned him about ellan thats my native island you knowanything going on there the reporter said yes there was some commotion about the failure of banks with the whole island under a cloud and its biggest financial man gone smash is his name oneill i asked thats it anything else happened there while ive been away no yes well now that i think of it there was a big scare a year or so ago about a young peeress who disappeared mysteriously was was it lady raa yes said the reporter and then controlling myself as well as i could i listened to a rapid version of what had become known about my dear one down to the moment when she vanished as utterly as if she had been dropped into the middle of the irish sea it is of no use saying what i felt after that except that flying in an express train to london i was as impatient of space and time as if i had been in a ship down south stuck fast in the rigid besetment of the ice i could not talk and i dared not think so i shouted for a singsong and my shipmates who had been a little low at seeing me so silent jumped at the proposal like schoolboys let loose from school of course osullivan gave us the minsthrel boy and treacle sang yew are the enny and then i yes i oh god sang sallys the gel and every man of my company joined in the ridiculous chorus towards ten oclock we changed lines on the loop at waterloo and ran into charing cross where we found another and still bigger crowd of hearty people behind a barrier with a group of my committee my fellow explorers and geographers in general waiting on the platform i could not help it if i made a poor return to their warmhearted congratulations for my eyes were once more searching for a face i could not see so that i was glad and relieved when i heard the superintendent say that the motorcar that was to take me to the hotel was ready and waiting but just then osullivan came up and whispered that a priest and a nun were asking to speak to me and he believed they had news of mary the priest proved to be dear old father dan and the nun to be sister veronica whom my dear one calls mildred at the first sight of their sadjoyful faces something gripped me by the throat for i knew what they had come to say before they said itthat my darling was lost and father dan after some priestly qualms had concluded that i was the first man who ought to be told of it although this was exactly what i had expected it fell on me like a thunderbolt and in spite of the warmth of my welcome home i believe in my soul i was the most downhearted man alive nevertheless i bundled father dan and the sister and osullivan into the automobile and jumping in after them told the chauffeur to drive like the deuce to the hotel he could not do that though for the crowd in the stationyard surrounded the car and shouted for a speech i gave them one saying heaven knows what except that their welcome made me ashamed of not having got down to the pole but please god i should get there next time or leave my bones on the way we got to the hotel at last the same that my poor stricken darling had stayed at after her honeymoon and as soon as we reached my room i locked the door and said now out with it and please tell me everything father dan was the first to speak but his pulpit style was too slow for me in my present stress of thoughts and feelings he had hardly got further than his difference with his bishop and the oath he had sworn by him who died for us to come to london and never go back until he had found my darling when i shook his old hand and looked towards the sister she was quicker by a good deal and in a few minutes i knew something of my dear ones storyhow she had fled from home on my account and for my sake had become poor how she had lodged for a while in bloomsbury how hard she had been hit by the report of the loss of my ship and how oh my poor suffering heroic little woman she had disappeared on the approach of another event of still more serious consequence it was no time for modesty not from me at all events so while the fathers head was down i asked plainly if there was a child and was told there was and the fear of having it taken from her i could understand that was perhaps the reason my poor darling had hidden herself away and now when where and by whom was she seen last i asked last week and again today tonight here in the west endby a fallen woman answered the sister and what conclusion do you draw from that the sister hesitated for a moment and then said that her child is dead that she does not know you are alive and that she is throwing herself away thinking there is nothing left to live for what i cried you believe that because she left that brute of a husband and because she came to me you believe that she could never not mary oneill she would beg her bread or die in the streets first i dare say my thickening voice was betraying me but when i looked at mildred and saw the tears rolling down her cheeks and heard her excuses it was what hundreds of poor women were driven to every day i was ashamed and said so and she put her kind hand in my hand in token of her forgiveness but whats to be done now she asked osullivan was for sending for the police but i would not hear of that i was beginning to feel as i used to do when i lost a comrade in a blizzard down south and without a fact or a clue to guide me sent a score of men in a broad circle from the camp like spokes in a wheel to find him or follow back on their tracks there were only four of us but i mapped out our courses where we were to go when we were to return and what we were to do if any of us found my lost onetake her to sisters flat which she gave the address of it was halfpast eleven when we started on our search and i dare say our good old father dan after his fruitless journeys thought it a hopeless quest but i had found myself at last my spirits which had been down to zero had gone up with a bound i had no ghost of an idea that i had been called home from the th latitude for nothing and i had no fear that i had come too late call it frenzy if you likei dont much mind what people call it but i was as sure as i have ever been of anything in this life or ever expect to be that the sufferings of my poor martyred darling were at an end and that within an hour i should be holding her in my arms mc end of martin conrads memorandum one hundred and fifth chapter there must be a physical power in fierce emotion to deprive us of the use of our senses of hearing and even of sight for my memory of what happened after i left the jews has blank places in it trying to recall the incidents of that night is like travelling on a moorland road under a flying moon with sometimes the whitest light in which everything is clearly seen and then the blackest darkness i remember taking the electric car going west and seeing the whitechapel road shooting by me with its surging crowds of pedestrians its publichouses its cinema shows and its jewish theatres i remember getting down at aldgate pump and walking through that dead belt of the city which lying between east and west is alive like a beehive by day and silent and deserted by night i remember seeing an old man with a face like a rats picking up cigarends from the gutters before the dark banks and then a flock of sheep bleating before a barking dog as they were driven through the echoing streets from the riverside towards the slaughterhouses near smithfield market i remember that when i came to st pauls the precincts of the cathedral were very quiet and the big clock was striking nine but on ludgate hill the traffic was thick and when i reached fleet street crowds of people were standing in front of the newspaper offices reading large placards in written characters which were pasted on the windows i remember that i did not look at these placards thinking their news was nothing to me who had not seen a newspaper for months and for whom the world was now eclipsed but that as i stepped round one of the crowds which extended to the middle of the street somebody said he has landed at southampton it seems i remember that when i reached charing cross i found myself on the fringe of another and much larger crowd and that the people who seemed to be waiting for somebody and were chatting with a noise like the crackling of thorns under a pot were saying his train is fifty minutes late so weve half an hour to wait yet then i remember that walking at random round st martins church into leicester square i came upon three public women who were swinging along with a high step and laughing loudly and that one of them was angela and that she stopped on seeing me and cried hello here i am again you see giovannis dead and i dont care a damn i remember that she said something elseit was about sister mildred but my mind did not take it inand at the next moment she left me and i heard her laughter once more as she swept round the corner i hardly know what happened next for here comes one of the blank places in my memory with nothing to light it except vague thoughts of martin and that soulless night in bloomsbury when the newspapers announced that he was lost until wandering aimlessly through streets and streets of peoplesuch multitudes of people no end of peoplei found myself back at charing cross the waiting crowd was now larger and more excited than before and the traffic at both sides of the station was stopped hes coming hes coming here he is the people cried and then there were deafening shouts and cheers i recall the sight of a line of policemen pushing people back i was myself pushed back i recall the sight of a big motorcar containing three men and a woman ploughing its way through i recall the sight of one of the men raising his cap of the crowd rushing to shake hands with him then of the car swinging away and of the people running after it with a noise like that of the racing of a noisy river it is the literal truth that never once did i ask myself what this tumult was about and that for some time after it was overa full hour at leasti had a sense of walking in my sleep as if my body were passing through the streets of the west end of london while my soul was somewhere else altogether thus at one moment as i was going by the national gallery and thought i caught the sound of martins name i felt as if i were back in glen raa and it was i myself who had been calling it at another moment when i was standing at the edge of the pavement in piccadilly circus which was ablaze with electric light and thronged with people for the theatres and musichalls were emptying men in uniform were running about with whistles policemen were directing the traffic and streams of carriages were flowing by i felt as if i were back in my native island where i was alone on the dark shore while the sea was smiting me again after a brusque voice had said move on please i followed the current of pedestrians down piccadillyit must have been piccadillyand saw lines of public women chiefly french and belgian sauntering along and heard men throwing light words to them as they went by i was thinking of the bleating sheep and the barking dog and again when i was passing a mens club and the place where i had met angela my dazed mind was harking back to ilford with a frightened sense of the length of time since i had been theregood heavens it must be five hours at least and wondering if mrs oliver was giving baby her drops of brandy and her spoonfuls of diluted milk but somewhere about midnight my soul seemed to take full possession of my body and i saw things clearly and sharply as i turned out of oxford street into regent street the traffic was then rapidly dying down the streets were darker the cafes were closing men and women were coming pout of supper rooms smoking cigarettes getting into taxis and driving away and another london day was passing into another night people spoke to me i made no answer at one moment an elderly woman said something to which i replied no no and hurried on at another moment a foreignlooking man addressed me and i pushed past without replying then a string of noisy young fellows stretching across the broad pavement arminarm encircled me and cried here we are my dear lets have a kissingbee but with angry words and gestures i compelled them to let me go whereupon one of the foreign women who were sauntering by said derisively what does she think shes out for i wonder at length i found myself standing under a kind of loggia at the corner of piccadilly circus which was now halfdark the theatres and musichalls being closed and only one group of arc lamps burning on an island about a statue there were few people now where there had been so dense a crowd awhile ago policemen were tramping leisurely along horsecabs were going at walking pace and taxis were moving slowly but a few gentlemen walking home from their clubs apparently were passing at intervals often looking at me and sometimes speaking as they went by then plainly and pitilessly the taunt of the foreign woman came back to mewhat was i there for i knew quite well and yet i saw that not only was i not doing what i came out to do but every time an opportunity had offered i had resisted it it was just as if an inherited instinct of repulsion had restrained me or some strong unseen arm had always snatched me away this led mewas it some angel leading meto think again of martin and to remember our beautiful and sacred parting at castle raa whatever happens to either of us we belong to each other for ever he had said and i had answered for ever and ever it was a fearful shock to think of this now i saw that if i did what i had come out to do not only would mary oneill be dead to me after tonight but martin conrad would be dead also when i thought of that i realised that although i had accepted without question the newspaper reports of martins death he had never hitherto been dead to me at all he had lived with me every moment of my life since supporting me sustaining me and inspiring me so that nothing i had ever donenot one single thingwould have been different if i had believed him to be alive and been sure that he was coming back but now i was about to kill martin conrad as well as mary oneill by breaking the pledge sacred as any sacrament which they had made for life and for eternity could i do that in this hideous way too never never never i should die in the streets first i remember that i was making a movement to go back to ilford god knows how when on the top of all my brave thinking came the pitiful thought of my child my poor helpless little baby who had made no promise and was party to no pledge she needed nourishment and fresh air and sunshine and if she could not get themif i went back to her pennilessshe would die my sweet darling my isabel my only treasure martins child and mine that put a quick end to all my qualms again i bit my lip until it bled and told myself that i should speak to the very next man who came along yes the very next man who comes along i thought i was standing at that moment in the shadow of one of the pilasters of the loggia almost leaning against it and in the silence of the street i heard distinctly the sharp firm step of somebody coming my way it was a man as he came near me he slowed down and stopped he was then immediately behind me i heard his quick breathing i felt that his eyes were fixed on me one sidelong glance told me that he was wearing a long ulster and a cap that he was young tall powerfully built had a strong firm cleanshaven face and an indescribable sense of the open air about him now now i thought and to prevent myself from running away i turned quickly round to him and tried to speak but i said nothing i did not know what women say to men under such circumstances i found myself trembling violently and before i was aware of what was happening i had burst into tears then came another blinding moment and a tempest of conflicting feelings i felt that the man had laid hold of me that his strong hands were grasping my arms and that he was looking into my face i heard his voice it seemed to belong to no waking moment but to come out of the hours of sleep mary mary i looked up at him but before my eyes could carry the news to my brain i knew who it wasi knew i knew i knew dont be afraid its i then somethinggod knows whatmade me struggle to escape and i cried let me go but even while i was strugglingtrying to fly away from my greatest happinessi was praying with all my might that the strong arms would hold me conquer me master me they did and then something seemed to give way within my head and through a roaring that came into my brain i heard the voice again and it was saying quick sister call a cab open the door osullivan no leave her to me ive got her thank god and then blinding darkness fell over me and everything was blotted out but only a moment afterwards or what seemed to be a moment memory came back in a great swelling wave of joy though i did not open my eyes i knew that i was safe and baby was safe and all was well somebodyit was the same beloved voice againwas saying mally my mally my poor longsuffering darling my own again god bless her it was he it was martin my martin and oh mother of my lord he was carrying me upstairs in his arms seventh part i am found one hundred and sixth chapter my return to consciousness was a painful yet joyful experience it was almost like being flung in a frail boat out of a tempestuous sea into a quiet harbour i seemed to hear myself saying my child shall not die poverty shall not kill her i am going to take her into the country she will recover no no it is not martin martin is dead but his eyes dont you see his eyes let me go then all the confused sense of nightmare seemed to be carried away as by some mighty torrent and there came a great calm a kind of morning sweetness with the sun shining through my closed eyelids and not a sound in my ears but the thin carolling of a bird when i opened my eyes i was in bed in a room that was strange to me it was a little like the reverend mothers room in rome having pictures of the saints on the walls and a large figure of the sacred heart over the mantelpiece but there was a small gas fire and a canary singing in a gilded cage that hung in front of the window i was trying to collect my senses in order to realize where i was when sister mildreds kind face in her white wimple and gorget leaned over me and she said with a tender smile you are awake now my child then memory came rushing back and though the immediate past was still like a stormy dream i seemed to remember everything is it true that i saw yes said mildred then he was not shipwrecked that was a false report within a month or two the newspapers had contradicted it where is he i asked rising from my pillow hush lie quiet you are not to excite yourself i must call the doctor mildred was about to leave the room but i could not let her go wait i must ask you something more not now my child lie down but i must dear sister i must there is somebody else you mean the baby said mildred in a low voice yes she has been found and taken to the country and is getting better rapidly so lie down and be quiet said mildred and with a long breath of happiness i obeyed a moment afterwards i heard her speaking to somebody over the telephone saying i had recovered consciousness and was almost myself again and then some indistinct words came hack in the thick telephone voice like that of a dumb man shouting down a tunnel followed by sepulchral peals of merry laughter the doctor will be here presently said mildred returning to me with a shining face and he yes perhaps he will be permitted to come too she was telling me how baby had been discoveredby means of mrs olivers letter which had been found in my pocketwhen there was the whirr of an electric bell in the corridor outside followed as soon as mildred could reach the door by the rich roll of an irish voice it was dr osullivan and in a moment he was standing by my bed his face ablaze with smiles by the saints of heaven this is good though he said its worth a hundred dozen she is already of the woman we brought here first that was last night wasnt it i asked well not last night exactly he answered and then i gathered that i had been ill seriously ill being two days unconscious and that martin had been in a state of the greatest anxiety hes coming isnt he i said will he be here soon how does he look is he well did he finish his work now now now said the doctor with uplifted hands if its exciting yourself like this youre going to be it isnt myself that will he taking the risk of letting him come at all but after i had pleaded and prayed and promised to be good he consented to allow martin to see me and then it was as much as i could do not to throw my arms about his neck and kiss him i had not noticed what mildred was doing during this time and almost before i was aware of it somebody else had entered the room it was dear old father dan glory be to god he cried at sight of me and then he said dont worry my daughter now dont worrywith that nervous emphasis which i knew by long experience to be the surest sign of my dear fathers own perturbation i did not know then or indeed until long afterwards that for six months past he had been tramping the streets of london in search of me day after day and in the dark of the night and the cold of the morning but something in his tender old face which was seamed and worn so touched me with the memory of the last scene in my mothers room that my eyes began to overflow and seeing this he began to laugh and let loose his irish tongue on us my blissing on you doctor its the mighty proud man yell be entoirely to be saving the life of the swatest woman in the world and whisha sister if ye have a nip of something neat anywhere handy faith it isnt my cloth will prevent me from drinking the health of everybody if this was intended to cheer me up it failed completely for the next thing i knew was that the doctor was bustling the dear old father out of the room and that mildred was going out after him she left the door open though and as soon as i had calmed down a little i listened intently for every sound outside it was then that i heard the whirr of the electric bell again but more softly this time and followed by breathless whispered words in the corridor as of some one who had been running and once more i knew i knew i knew after a moment mildred came to ask me in a whisper if i was quite sure that i could control myself and though my heart was thumping against my breast i answered yes then i called for a handglass and made my hair a shade neater and after that i closed my eyes god knows why and waited there was a moment of silence dead silence and thenthen i opened my eyes and saw him standing in the open doorway his big strong bronzed facestronger than ever now and marked with a certain change from the struggles he had gone throughwas utterly broken up for some moments he did not speak but i could see that he saw the change that life had made in me also then in a low voice so low that it was like the breath of his soul he said forgive me forgive me and stepping forward he dropped to his knees by the side of my bed and kissed the arms and hands i was stretching out to him that was more than i could bear and the next thing i heard was my darlings great voice crying sister sister some brandy quick she has fainted but my poor little fit of hysterics was soon at an end and though martin was not permitted to stay more than a moment longer a mighty wave of happiness flowed over me such as i had never known before and may never know again one hundred and seventh chapter i had such a beautiful convalescence for the major operations of the great surgeon an anaesthetic has not yet been found but within a week i was sitting up again mutilated perhaps but gloriously alive and without the whisper of a cry by this time father dan had gone back to ellan parting from me with a solemn face as he said lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace and sister mildred had obtained permission to give up one of her rooms to me as long as i should need it martin came to see me every day first for five minutes then ten and finally for a quarter and even half an hour he brought such an atmosphere of health with him that merely to hold his hand seemed to give me new strengthbeing so pale and bloodless now that i thought the sun might have shone through me as through a seagull i could scarcely believe it was not a dream that he was sitting by my side and sometimes i felt as if i had to touch him to make sure he was there how he talked to keep up my spirits it was nearly always about his expedition never about me or my experiences for that seemed a dark scene from which he would not draw the curtain and i was all atremble as i listened to the story of his hairbreadth escapes though he laughed and made so light of them it nearly broke my heart that he had not got down to the pole and when he told me that it was the sense of my voice calling to him which had brought him back from the th latitude i felt as if i had been a coward unworthy of the man who loved me sometimes he talked about babyhe called her girlietelling a funny story of how he had carried her off from ilford where the bricklayer had suddenly conceived such a surprising affection for my child what he might go so far as to call a fatherly feeling that he had been unwilling to part with her until soothed down by a few sovereignsnot to say frightened by a grasp of martins iron hand which had nearly broken his wrist shes as right as a trivet now though said martin and ill run down to chevening every other day to see how shes getting on my darling was in great demand from the first but when he could not be with me in the flesh he was with me in the spirit by means of the newspapers which mildred brought up in armfuls i liked the illustrated ones best with their pictures of scenes in the expedition particularly the portraits of martin himself in his antarctic outfit with his broad throat determined lips clear eyes and that general resemblance to the people we all know which makes us feel that the great men of every age are brothers of one family but what literary tributes there were too what interviews what articles a member of the scientific staff had said that down there with nature in her wrath where science was nothing and even physical strength was not all only one thing really counted and that was the heroic soul and because martin had it he had always been the born leader of them all and then summing up the tangible gains of the expedition the times said its real value was moral and spiritual because it showed that in an age when one half of the world seemed to be thinking of nothing but the acquisition of wealth that made me think of my father and the other half of nothing but the pursuit of pleasure that reminded me of my husband and alma there could be found men like martin conrad and his dauntless comrades who had faced death for the sake of an ideal and were ready to do so again oh dear what showers of tears i shed over those newspapers but the personal honours that were bestowed on martin touched me most of all first the royal geographical society held a meeting at the albert hall where the gold medal was presented to him i was in a fever of anxiety on the night of that function i remember until dr osullivan heaven bless him came flying upstairs to tell me that it had been a splendid success and martins speech he hadnt prepared a word of it a perfect triumph then some of the universities conferred degrees on my darling which was a source of inexpressible amusement to him especially when after coming back from edinburgh he marched up and down my room in his doctors cap and gown and i asked him to spell promise and he couldnt oh the joy of it all it was so great a joy that at length it became a pain the climax came when the home secretary wrote to say that the king had been graciously pleased to confer a knighthood upon martin in recognition of his splendid courage and the substantial contribution he had already made to the material welfare of the world that frightened me terribly though only a woman would know why it was one thing to share the honours of the man i loved however secretly and as it were by stealth but quite another thing to feel that they were carrying him away from me drawing him off lifting him up and leaving me far below when the sense of this became acute i used to sit at night when mildred was out at her work by the lofty window of her room looking down on the precincts of piccadilly and wondering how much my darling really knew about the impulse that took me there and how nearly but for the grace of god its awful vortex had swallowed me up it was then that i began to write these notes having persuaded mildred to buy me this big book with its silver clasp and key not intending at first to tell the whole story of my life but only to explain to him for whom everything has been written what i could not bring myself to say face to face how it came to pass that i was tempted to that sin which is the most awful crime against her sex that a woman can commit three months had gone by this time the spring was coming and i was beginning to feel that martin who had not yet been home was being kept in london on my account when dr osullivan announced that i was well enough to be moved and that a little of my native air would do me good oh the thrill that came with that prospect i suppose there is a sort of call to ones heart from the soil that gave one birth but in my case it was coupled with a chilling thought of the poor welcome i should receive there my fathers house being closed to me and my husbands abandoned for ever the very next morning however there came a letter from father dan giving me all the news of ellan some of it sad enough god knows about the downfall of my fathers financial schemes some of it deliciously wicked such as it would have required an angel not to rejoice in about the bad odour in which alma and my husband were now held making the pendulum of popular feeling swing back in my direction and some of it utterly heartbreaking in its assurances of the love still felt for me in my native place of course the sweetest part of that came from christian ann who after a stiff fight with her moral principles had said that whatever i had done i was as pure as the mountain turf and who then charged father dan with the message that mary oneills little room was waiting for her still this settled everythingeverything except one thing and that was the greatest thing of all but when martin came later the same day having received the same message and declared his intention of taking me home there seemed to be nothing left to wish for in earth or heaven nevertheless i shouldnt have been a woman if i had not coquetted with my great happiness so when martin had finished i said but dare you dare iwhat said martin dare you go home with me i knew what i wanted him to say and he said it like a darling look here mary im just spoiling for a sight of the little island and the old people are destroyed at not seeing me but if i cant go back with you by the lord god ill never go back at all i wanted to see baby before going away but that was forbidden me wait until youre well enough and well send her after you said dr osullivan so the end of it all was that inside a week i was on my way to ellan not only with martin but also with mildred who being a little out of health herself had been permitted to take me home shall i ever forget our arrival at blackwater the steamer we sailed in was streaming with flags from stem to stern and as she slid up the harbour the dense crowds that packed the pier from end to end seemed frantic with excitement such shouting and cheering such waving of hats and handkerchiefs there was a sensible pause i thought a sort of hush when the gangway being run down martin was seen to give his arm to me and i was recognised as the lost and dishonoured one but even that only lasted for a moment it was almost as if the people felt that this act of martins was of a piece with the sacred courage that had carried him down near to the pole for hardly had he brought me ashore and put me into the automobile waiting to take us away when the cheering broke out into almost delirious tumult i knew it was all for martin but not even the humility of my position and the sense of my being an added cause of my darlings glory could make me otherwise than proud and happy we drove home with the sunset in our faces over the mountain road which i had crossed with my husband on the day of my marriage and when we came to our own village i could not help seeing that a littlejust a littleof the welcome waiting for us was meant for me father dan was there he got into the car and sat by my side and then some of the village women who had smartened themselves up in their sunday clothes reached over and shook hands with me speaking about things i had said and done as a child and had long forgotten we had to go at a walking pace the rest of the way and while martin saluted old friends he remembered everybody by name father dan talked in my ear about the domestic earthquake that had been going on at sunny lodge everything topsyturvy until today the little room being made ready for me and the best bedroom the doctors and christian anns for martin and the loft over the dairy for the old people themselvesas if their beloved son had been good in not forgetting them and had condescended in coming home is it true they had asked each other is he really really coming what does he like to eat mother what does he drink what does he smoke i had to close my eyes as i came near the gate of my fathers house and except for the rumbling of the river under the bridge and the cawing of the rooks in the elms i should not have known when we were there the old doctor his face overflowing with happiness and his closecropped white head bare as if he had torn out of the house at the toot of our horn met us as we turned into the lane and for the little that was left of our journey he walked blithely as a boy by the car at the side on which martin sat i reached forward to catch the first sight of sunny lodge and there it was behind its fuchsia hedge which was just breaking into bloom there was christian ann too at the gate in her sunbonnet and before the automobile had come to a stand martin was out of it and had her in his arms i knew what that meant to the dear sweet woman and for a moment my spirits failed me because it flashed upon my mind that perhaps her heart had only warmed to me for the sake of her son but just as i was stepping out of the car feeling physically weak and slipping a little though father dan and sister mildred were helping me to alight my martins mother rushed at me and gathered me in her arms crying goodness gracious me doctorif it isnt little mary oneill god bless herjust as she did in the old old days when i came as a child singing carvals to her door one hundred and eighth chapter when i awoke next morning in mary oneills little room with its odour of clean white linen and sweetsmelling scraas the sun was shining in at the halfopen window birds were singing cattle were lowing young lambs were bleating a crow was cawing its way across the sky and under the sounds of the land there was a faroff murmur of the sea through the floor unceiled beneath i could hear the doctor and christian ann chortling away in low tones like two cheerful old lovebirds and when i got up and looked out i saw the pink and white blossom of the apple and plum trees and smelt the smoke of burning peat from the chimney as well as the salt of the seaweed from the shore sister mildred came to help me to dress and when i went downstairs to the sweet kitchenparlour feeling so strong and fresh christian ann who was tossing an oatcake she was baking on the griddle cried to me as to a child come your ways villish you know the house and when i stepped over the ragwork hearthrug and sat in the elbowchair in the chiollagh under the silver bowls that stood on the high mantelpiece she cried again as if addressing the universe in general for there was nobody else in the room look at that now shes been out in the big world and seen great wonders and a power of people ill go bail but there she is as nice and comfortable as if she had never been away sister mildred came down next and then the old doctor who had been watching the road for martin he had refused to occupy the old peoples bedroom after all and had put up at the plough came in saying the boys late motherwhats doing on him i wonder we waited awhile longer and then sat down to breakfast oh the homely beauty of that morning meal with its porridge its milk its honey and cakes its butter like gold and its eggs like cream in spite of sister mildreds protests christian ann stood and served and i will not say that for me there was not a startling delight in being waited upon once more being asked what i would like and getting it giving orders and being obeyedme me me at length in the exercise of my authority i insisted on christian ann sitting down too which she did though she didnt eat but went on talking in her dear simple delicious way it was always about martin and the best of it was about her beautiful faith that he was still alive when the report came that he had been lost at sea what her son dying like that and she old and the sun going down on her never newspapers chut who cared what people put in the papers if martin had really been lost wouldnt she have known ithaving borne him on her bosom a middling hard birth too and being the first to hear his living voice in the world so while people thought she was growing weak in her intellects she had clung to the belief that her beloved son would come back to her and behold one dark night in winter when she was sitting in the chiollagh alone and the wind was loud in the trees and the doctor upstairs was calling on her to come to bed youre wearing yourself away woman she heard a sneck of the garden gate and a step on the gravel path and it was old tommy the mate who without waiting for her to open the door let a great yell out of him through the window that a talegraf had come to say her boy was safe father dan looked in after mass in his biretta and faded cassock the same i do declare that he had worn when i was a child and then martin himself came swinging up with his big voice like a shout from the quarterdeck helloa stunning morning isnt it it was perfectly delightful to see the way he treated his mother though there was not too much reverence in his teasing and hardly more love than license when she told him to sit down if he had not forgotten the house and said she hoped he had finished looking for south poles and was ready to settle quietly at home and he answered no he would have to go back to london presently she cried there now doctor what was i telling you once theyve been away its witched they arelonging and longing to go back again whats there in london thats wanting him whereupon the doctor thinking of the knighthood with a proud lift of his old head and a wink at father dan said who knows perhaps its the king thats wanting him woman the king cried christian ann hes got a bonny son of his own theyre telling me so what for should he be wanting mine mary said martin as soon as he could speak for laughing do you want a mother ive got one to sell and i wouldnt trust but i might give her away cuff him mrs conrad cried father dan cuff him the young rascal he may be a big man in the great world over the water but he mustnt come here expecting his mother and his old priest to worship him how we laughed i laughed until i cried not knowing which i was doing most but feeling as if i had never had an ache or a care in all my life before breakfast being over the men going into the garden to smoke and sister mildred insisting on clearing the table christian ann took up her knitting sat by my side and told me the newses of homesad news most of it about my father god pity him and how his great schemes for galvanising the old island into life had gone down to failure and fatuity sending some to the asylum and some to the graveyard and certain of the managers of corporations and banks to gaol my father himself had escaped prosecution but he was supposed to be a ruined man dying of cancer and had gone to live in his mothers old cottage on the curragh with only nessy macleod to care for himhaving left the big house to aunt bridget and cousin betsy who declared so i gathered or guessed that i had disgraced their name and should never look on their faces again but dear heart alive that wont cut much ice will it said christian ann catching a word of martins later in the day being alone with the old doctor i heard something of my husband alsothat he had applied according to the laws of ellan for an act of divorce and that our insular legislature was likely to grant it still later having walked out into the garden where the bluebells were in bloom i too heard the sneck of the gate and it was old tommy again who having been up to the plough to put a sight on himself had come round to welcome me as wella little older a little feebler tacking a bit as he said with romps in his fetlock joints but feeling well tremenjus he had brought the full of his coatpockets of lobsters and crabs for me wonderful good for invalids missie and the full of his mouth of the doings at castle raa which he had left immediately after myselfprice also neither of them being willing to stay with a master who had the rough word for everybody and a misthress who had the black curse on her that would carry her naked sowl to hell i wouldnt be gardener there after the lil missie had gone no not for the bank of ellan and it full of goold what a happy happy day that was there was many another day like it too during the sweet time following when spring was smiling once more upon earth and man and body and soul in myself were undergoing a resurrection no less marvellous after three or four weeks i had so far recovered as to be able to take walks with martinthrough the leafy lanes with the golden gorse on the high turf hedges and its nutty odour in the air as far sometimes as to the shore where we talked about asploring or perhaps without speaking at all looked into each others eyes and laughed there was really only one limitation to my happiness separation from my child and though i was conscious of something anomalous in my own position which the presence of my baby would make acute setting all the evil tongues awag i could not help it if as i grew stronger i yearned for my little treasure the end of it was that after many timid efforts i took courage and asked martin if i might have my precious darling back girlie he cried certainly you may you are well enough now so why shouldnt you im going to london on exploration business soon and ill bring her home with me but when he was gone mildred went with him i was still confronted by one cause of anxietychristian ann i could not even be sure she knew of the existence of my child still less that martin intended to fetch her so once more i took my heart in both hands and while we sat together in the garden with the sunlight pouring through the trees christian ann knitting and i pretending to read i told her all she knew everything already the dear old thing and had only been waiting for me to speak after dropping a good many stitches she said the world will talk and dear heart knows what father dan himself will say but bloods thicker than water even if its holy water and shes my own childs child god bless her after that we had such delicious times together preparing for the little stranger who was to comecutting up blankets and sheets and smuggling down from the loft to mary oneills room the wooden cradle which had once been martins and covering it with bows and ribbons we kept the old doctor in the dark pretended we did and when he wondered what all the fuss was about and if the island expected a visit from the queen we told him christian ann did to ask us no questions and wed tell no lies what children we were we two mothers the old one and the young one i used to hint with an air of great mystery that my baby had somebodys eyes and then the dear simple old thing would say somebodys eyes has she well well think of that now but christian ann from the lofty eminence of the motherhood of one child twentyfive years before was my general guide and counsellor answering all my foolish questions when i counted up babys age eleven months now and wondered if she could walk and talk by this time how many of her little teeth should have come and whether she could remember me as the time approached for martins return our childishness increased and on the last day of all we carried on such a game together as must have made the very saints themselves look down on us and laugh before i opened my eyes in the morning i was saying to myself now theyre on their way to euston and every time i heard the clock strike i was thinking now theyre in the train or now theyre at liverpool or now theyre on the steamer but all the while i sang sally and other nonsense and pretended to be as happy as the day was long christian ann was even more excited than myself and though she was always reproving me for my nervousness and telling me to be composed i saw her put the kettle instead of the teapot on to the tablecloth and the porridgestick into the fire in place of the tongs towards evening when martin was due i had reduced myself to such a state of weakness that christian ann wanted to put me to bed but sitting down in the chiollagh and watching the road from the imprisonment of the elbowchair i saw at last the two big white eyes of the automobile wheeling round in the dusk by the gate of my fathers house a few minutes afterwards martin came sweeping into the kitchen with a nicelooking nurse behind him carrying my darling at her breast she was asleep but the light of the fire soon wakened her and then a strange thing happened i had risen from my seat and christian ann had come hurrying up and we two women were standing about baby both ready to clutch at her when she blinked her blue eyes and looked at us and then held out her arms to her grandmother that nearly broke my heart for a moment though now i thank the lord for it but it raised christian ann into the seventh heaven of rapture did you see that now she cried clasping my baby to her bosomher eyes glistening as with sunshine though her cheeks were slushed as with rain i got my treasure to myself at last christian ann having to show the nurse up to her bedroom and then being alone with martin i did not care in the intoxication of my happiness how silly i was in my praise of her isnt she a little fairy a little angel a little cherub i cried and that nasty nasty birthmark quite quite gone the ugly word had slipped out unawares but martin had caught it and though i tried to make light of it he gave me no peace until i had told him what it meantwith all the humiliating story of my last night at castle raa and the blow my husband had struck me but thats all over now i said is it by the lord god i swear it isnt though said martin and his face was so fierce that it made me afraid but just at that moment christian ann came downstairs and the old doctor returned from his rounds and then tommy the mate looked in on his way to the plough and hinting at my going to church again some day gave it as his opinion that if i put the boght mulish under my perricut our old island custom for legitimising children the bishop himself couldnt say nothin against itat which martin laughed so much that i thought he had forgotten his vow about my husband memorandum of martin conrad i hadnt though the brute the bully when my darling told me that story i had to drag it out of her i felt that if i had been within a hundred miles at the time and had had to crawl home to the man on my hands and knees there wouldnt have been enough of him left now to throw on the dustheap nearly two years had passed since the debt was incurred but i thought a christian world could not go on a day longer until i had paid it backwith interest so fearing that my tenderhearted little woman if she got wind of my purpose might make me promise to put away my vow of vengeance i got up early next morning and ordered the motorcar to be made ready for a visit to castle raa old tommy happened to be in the yard of the inn while i was speaking to the chauffeur and he asked if he might be allowed to go with me i agreed and when i came out to start he was sitting in a corner of the car with his glengarry pulled down over his shaggy eyebrows and his knotty hands leaning on a thick blackthorn that had a head as big as a turnip we did not talk too much on the wayi had to save up my strength for better businessand it was a long spin but we got to our journeys end towards the middle of the morning as we went up the drive sacred to me by one poignant memory an open carriage was coming down the only occupant was a rather vulgarlooking elderly woman in large feathers and flowing furbelows whom i took to be the mother of alma three powdered footmen came to the door of the castle as our car drove up their master was out riding they did not know when he would be back ill wait for him i said and pushed into the hall old tommy following me i think the footmen had a mind to intercept us but i suppose there was something in my face which told them it would be better not to try so i walked into the first room with the door open it turned out to be the diningroom with portraits of the owners ancestors all round the wallsa solid square of evillooking rascals every mothers son of them tommy still resting his knotty hands on his big blackthorn was sitting on the first chair by the door and i on the end of the table neither saying a word to the other when there came the sound of horses hoofs on the path outside a little later there were voices in the hall both low and loud onesthe footmen evidently announcing my arrival and their master abusing them for letting me into the house at the next moment the man came sweeping into the diningroom he was carrying a heavy huntingcrop and his flabby face was livid behind him came alma she was in riding costume and was bending a lithe whip in her gloved hands i saw that my noble lord was furious but that mood suited me as well as another so i continued to sit on the end of the table so i hear sir he said striding up to me i hear that you have taken possession of my place without so much as by your leave thats so i answered havent you done enough mischief here without coming to insult me by your presence not quite ive a little more to do before ive finished jim said the woman in such a weary voice dont put yourself about over such a person better ring the bell for the servants and have him turned out of doors i looked round at her she tried an insolent smile but it broke down badly and then his lordship strode up to me with quivering lips look here sir he said arent you ashamed to show your face in my house im not i replied but before i leave it i believe youll be ashamed to show your face anywhere damn it sir will you do me the honour to tell me why you are here said his lordship with fury in his looks certainly thats exactly what ive come for i said and then i stated my business without more ado i told him what he had done to the woman who was ten thousand times too good to be his wifetorturing her with his cruelties degrading her with his infidelities subjecting her to the domination of his paramour and finally striking her in the face like a coward and a cur liar he cried fairly gasping in his rage youre a liar and your informant is a liar too tommy i said will you step outside for a moment tommy went out of the room at once and the woman who was now looking frightened tried to follow him i stopped her rising from the table i stepped over to the door and locked it no madam i said i want you to see what takes place between his lordship and me the wretched woman fell back but the man grinding his teeth came marching up to me so youve come to fight me in my own house have you he cried not at all i answered a man fights his equal ive come to thrash you that was enough for him he lifted his huntingcrop to strike but it didnt take long to get that from his hand or to paralyse the arm with which he was lunging out at me and then seizing him by the white stock at his throat i thrashed him i thrashed him as i should have thrashed vicious ape i thrashed him while he fumed and foamed and cursed and swore i thrashed him while he cried for help and then yelled with pain and whined for mercy i thrashed him under the eyes of his ancestors the mad bad race he came from and him the biggest blackguard of them all and then i flung him to the ground bruised in every bone and his huntingcrop after him i hear youre going to court for an act of divorce i said pity you cant take something to back you so take that and say i gave it you i was turning towards the door when i heard a low whining cry like that of a captured shebear it was from the woman the wretched creature was on her knees at the farthest corner of the room apparently mumbling prayers as if in terror that her own turn might be coming next in her sobbing fear i thought she looked more than ever like a poisonous snake and i will not say that the old impulse to put my foot on it did not come back for a moment but i only said as i passed pointing to the writhing worm on the floor look at him madame i wish you joy of your nobleman and him of you then i opened the door and notwithstanding the grim business i had been going through i could have laughed at the scene outside there was old tommy with his back to the diningroom door his glengarry awry on his tousled head and his bandy legs stretched firmly apart flourishing his bigheaded blackthorn before the faces of the three powdered footmen and inviting them to come on come on now you bleating ould billygoats come on come on i was in no hurry to get away but lit a cigar in front of the house while the chauffeur was starting the motor and tommy was wiping his steaming forehead on the sleeve of his coat all the way home the old man talked without ceasing sometimes to me and sometimes to the world in general you gave him a piece of your mind didnt you he asked with a wink of his starboard eye i believe i did i answered i allus said you would wait till himself is after coming home and itll be the devil sit up for some of them says i there was only one limitation to tommys satisfaction over our days expeditionthat he had not cracked the powdered skulls of some o them riddiclus dunkeys end of martin conrads memorandum one hundred and ninth chapter another month passed and then began the last and most important phase of my too changeful story every week martin had been coming and going between ellan and london occupied when he was away with the business of his next expedition for which parliament had voted a large sum and when he was at home with reports diaries charts maps and photographs toward a book he was writing about his last one as for myself i had been or tried to think i had been entirely happy with fresh air new milk a sweet bedroom and above all good and tender nursing god bless christian ann for all she did for me my health had improved every dayor perhaps by that heavenly hopefulness which goes with certain maladies it had seemed to me to do so yet mine was a sort of twilight happiness nevertheless though the sun was always shining in my sky it was frequently under eclipse in spite of the sheltered life i lived in that home of charity and love i was never entirely free from a certain indefinable uneasiness about my position i was always conscious too that martins mother and father not to speak of father dan were suffering from a similar feeling for sometimes when we talked about the future their looks would answer to my thoughts and it was just as if we were all silently waiting waiting waiting for some event that was to justify and rehabilitate me it came at lastfor me with a startling suddenness one morning nurse being out on an errand and christian ann patting her butter in the dairy i was playing with baby on the ragwork hearthrug when our village newsman came to the threshold of the open door take a times he said you might as well be out of the world maam as not know whats going on in it i took one of his island newspapers and after he had gone i casually glanced at it but what a shock it gave me the first heading that flew in my face was insular divorce bill passed it was a report of the proceedings of the supreme court of our ellan legislature which notwithstanding the opposition of its ecclesiastical members had granted my husbands petition perhaps i ought to have had a sense of immense relief or perhaps i should have gone down on my knees there and then and thanked god that the miserable entanglement of the horrible marriage that had been forced upon me was at last at an end but no i had only one feeling as the newspaper fell from my fingersshame and humiliation not for myself for what did it matter about me anyway but for martin whose name now so famous i had through my husbands malice been the means of dragging through the dust i remember that i thought i should never be able to look into my darlings face again that when he came in the afternoon as he always did i should have to run away from him and that all that was left to me was to hide myself and die but just as these wild thoughts were galloping through my brain i heard the sneck of the garden gate and almost before i was aware of what else was happening martin had come sweeping into the house like a rush of wind thrown his arms around me and covered my face my neck and my hands with kissesnever having done so before since i came to live at his mothers home such news such news he cried we are free free free then seeing the newspaper at my feet on the floor he said ah i see you know already i told them to keep everything away from youall the miserable legal business but no matter its over now of course its shockingperfectly shockingthat that squirming worm after his gross infidelities should have been able to do what he has done but what matter about that either he has done just what we wantedwhat you couldnt do for yourself before i went away your conscience forbidding you the barrier that has divided us is down now we can be married at any time i was so overcome by martins splendid courage so afraid to believe fully that the boundless relief i had looked for so long had come to me at last that for some time i could not speak and when i did speak though my heart was clamouring loud i only said but do you really think that that we can now be husband and wife think it he cried with a peal of laughter i should think i do think it whats to prevent us nothing youve suffered enough my poor girl but all that you have gone through has to be forgotten and you are never to look back again yes yes i know i should be happy very happy i said but what about you me i looked forward to being a helpat least not a trouble to you martin and so you will be why shouldnt you martin i said i knew what i was doing but i couldnt help doing it wouldnt it injure you to marry me being what i am now in the eyes of the world i mean he looked at me for a moment as if trying to catch my meaning and then snatched me still closer to his breast mary he cried dont ask me to consider what the damnable insincerities of society may say to a case like ours if you dont care then neither do i and as for the world by the lord god i swear that all i ask of it i am now holding in my arms that conquered mepoor trembling hypocrite that i was praying with all my soul that my objections would be overcome in another moment i had thrown my arms about my martins neck and kissed and kissed him feeling for the first time after my months and years of fiery struggle that in the eyes of god and man i had a right to do so and oh dear oh dear when martin had gone back to his work what foolish rein i gave to my newborn rapture i picked baby up from the hearthrug and kissed her also and then took her into the dairy to be kissed by her grandmother who must have overheard what had passed between martin and me for i noticed that her voice had suddenly become livelier and at least an octave higher then baby being sleepy i took her upstairs for her morning nap and after leaning over her cradle in the soft damp milklike odour of her sweet body and breath i stood up before the glass and looked at my own hot tingling blushing cheeks and sparkling eyes oh what gorgeous dreams of happiness came to me i may have been the unmarried mother of a child but my girlhoodmy lost girlhoodwas flowing back upon me a vision of my marriageday rose up before me and i saw myself as a bride in my bridal veil and blossoms how happy i was going to be but indeed i felt just then as if i had always been happy it was almost as though some blessed stream of holy water had washed my memory clean of all the soilure of my recent days in london for sure i am that if anybody had at that moment mentioned ilford and the east end the bricklayer and the jew or spoken of the maternity homes and the orphanages i should have screamed towards noon the old doctor came back from his morning rounds and i noticed that his voice was pitched higher too we never once spoke about the great news the great event while we sat at table but i could not help noticing that we were all talking loud and fast and on the top of each other as if some dark cloud which had hovered over our household had suddenly slid away after luncheon nurse being back with baby i went out for a walk alone feeling wonderfully well and light and having two hours to wait for martin who must be still pondering over his papers at the plough how beautiful was the day how blue the sky how bright the earth how joyous the airso sweet and so full of songbirds i remember that i thought life had been so good to me that i ought to be good to everybody elseespecially to my father from whom it seemed wrong for a daughter to be estranged whatever he was and whatever he had done to her so i turned my face towards my poor grandmothers restored cottage on the curragh fully determined to be reconciled to my father and i only slackened my steps and gave up my purpose when i began to think of nessy macleod and how difficult perhaps impossible it might be to reach him even then i faced about for a moment to the big house with some vain idea of making peace with aunt bridget and then slipping upstairs to my mothers roomhaving such a sense of joyous purity that i wished to breathe the sacred air my blessed saint had lived in but the end of it all was that i found myself on the steps of the presbytery feeling breathlessly happy and telling myself with a little access of pride in my own gratitude that it was only right and proper that i should bring my happiness where i had so often brought my sorrowto the dear priest who had been my friend since the day of my birth and my darling mothers friend before poor old father dan how good i was going to be to him one hundred and tenth chapter a few minutes afterwards i was tripping upstairs love and hope work wonderful miracles behind the fathers irish housekeeper mrs cassidy who was telling me how well i was looking smart and well extraordinary asking if it was on my two feet i had walked all the way and denouncing the omathauns who had been after telling her there wasnt the width of a wall itself betune me and the churchyard i found father dan in his cosy study lined with books and being so much wrapped up in my own impetuous happiness i did not see at first that he was confused and nervous or remember until next day that though at the sound of my voice from the landing he cried come in my child come in he was standing with his back to the door as i enteredhiding something it must have been a newspaper under the loose seat of his easychair father i said have you heard the news the news i mean the news in the newspaper ah the news in the newspaper isnt it glorious that terrible marriage is over at last without my doing anything either do you remember what you said the last time i came here the last time you said that i being a catholic could not break my marriage without breaking my faith but my husband being a protestant had no compunction so it has come to the same thing in the end you see and now im free youre free free are you it seems they have been keeping it all away from memaking no defence i supposeand it was only this morning i heard the news only this morning was it i first saw it in a newspaper but afterwards martin himself came to tell me martin came did he he doesnt care in the least in fact he is glad and says we can be married at any time married at any timehe says that does he of course nothing is arranged yet dear father but i couldnt help coming to see you about it i want everything to be simple and quietno display of any kind simple and quiet do you early in the morningimmediately after mass perhaps immediately after mass only a few wild flowers on the altar and the dear homely souls who love me gathered around the dear homely souls it will be a great great thing for me but i dont want to force myself upon anybody or to triumph over any oneleast of all over my poor father now that he is so sick and down no no now that he is so sick and down i shall want you to marry us daddy dannot the bishop or anybody else of that kind you know youll want me to marry younot the bishop or anybody else of that kind but father dan i cried laughing a little uneasily for i had begun to realise that he was only repeating my own words why dont you say something for yourself and then the cheery sunshine of the cosy room began to fade away father dan fumbled the silver cross which hung over his cassock a sure sign of his nervousness and said with a grave face and in a voice all atremble with emotion my child yes you believe that i wouldnt pain or distress or shock you if i could avoid it indeed i do yet i am going to pain and distress and shock you now i i cannot marry you to martin conrad i darent the church thinks that you are married alreadythat you are still the wife of your husband though my dear priest had dealt me my deathblow i had not yet begun to feel it so i smiled up into his troubled old face and said but how can the church think that dear father my husband has no rights over me now and no duties or responsibilities with respect to me he can marry again if he likes and he will i am sure he will and nobody can prevent him how then can the church say that i am still his wife because marriage according to the law of the church can only be dissolved by death said father dan havent i told you that before my daughter didnt we go over it again and again when you were here the last time yes yes but i thought if somebody else sought the divorcesomebody who had never believed in the indissolubility of marriage and wasnt bound by the law of the church weve heard of cases of that kind havent we father dan shook his head my poor child no the church thinks marriage is a sacred covenant which no difference of belief no sin on either side can ever break but father i cried dont you see that the law has already broken it only the civil law my daughter remember the words of our blessed and holy redeemer every one that putteth away his wife and marrieth another committeth adultery and he that marrieth one that is put away committeth adultery my poor child my heart bleeds for you but isnt that the divine commandment then you think i said the room was becoming dark and i could feel my lip trembling you think that because i went through that marriage ceremony two years ago and though the civil law has dissolved it you think i am still bound by it and will continue to be so to the end of my life father dan plucked at his cassock fumbled his print handkerchief and replied i am sorry my child very very sorry father dan i said sharply for by this time my heart was beginning to blaze have you thought about martin arent you afraid that if our church refuses to marry us he may ask some other church to do so christs words must be the final law for all true christians my daughter and besides well besides that yes it blisters my tongue to say it my child knowing your sufferings and great temptations but but what dear father you are in the position of the guilty party and therefore no good clergyman of any christian church in the world following the commandment of his master would dare to marry you what happened after that i cannot exactly say i remember that feeling the colour flying to my face i flung up my hands to cover it and that when i came to full possession of my senses again father dan himself in a state of great agitation was smoothing my arms and comforting me dont be angry with your old priest for telling you the truththe bitter truth my daughter he had always seen this dark hour coming to him and again and again he had prayed to be delivered from itin the long nights of his fruitless wanderings when i was lost in london and again since i had been found and had come home and he had looked on with many a pang at our silent hopes and expectationsmartins and mine we two children and when you came into my little den today my daughter with a face as bright as stars and diamonds god knows i would have given half of what is left of my life that mine should not be the hand to dash the cup of your happiness away as soon as i was sufficiently composed within and without father dan led me downstairs praying god and his holy mother to strengthen me on my solitary way and then stood at the door in his cassock to watch me while i walked up the road it was hardly more than half an hour since i had passed over the ground before yet in that short time the world seemed to have become pale and greythe sun gone out the earth grown dark the still air joyless nothing left but the everlasting heavens and the heavy song of the sea as i approached the doctors house martin came swinging down the road to meet me with his strong free step and that suggestion of the wind from the mountaintops which seemed to be always about him hello he cried thought you were lost and been hunting all over the place for you but as he came nearer and saw how white and wan my face was though i was doing my best to smile he stopped and said my poor little woman where have you been and what have they been doing to you and then as well as i could i told him one hundred and eleventh chapter its all my fault he said he had led me to the gardenhouse which stood among the bluebells at the end of the orchard and was striding to and fro in front of it i knew perfectly what the attitude of the church would be and i ought to have warned you i had never before seen him so excited there was a wild look in his eyes and his voice was quivering like the string of a bow poor old father dan hes an old angel with as good a heart as ever beat under a cassock but what a slave a man may be to the fetish of his faith only think what he says my darling the guilty party ill never believe you are the guilty party but consider the guilty party may never marry no good clergyman of any christian church in the world dare marry her what an infamy ask yourself what the churches are here for arent they here to bring salvation to the worst of sinners yet they cast out the woman who has sinned against her marriage vowdenying her access to the altar and turning her out of doorsthough she may have repented a thousand times with bitter bitter tears he walked two or three paces in front of the gardenhouse and then came back to me with flaming eyes but thats not your case anyway he said father dan knows perfectly that your marriage was no marriage at allonly a sordid bit of commercial bargaining in which your husband gave you his bad name for your fathers unclean money it was no marriage in any other sense either and might have been annulled if there had been any common honesty in annulment and now that it has tumbled to wreck and ruin as anybody might have seen it would do you are told that you are bound to it to the last day and hour of your life after all you have gone throughall you have sufferednever to know another hour of happiness as long as you live while your husband notwithstanding his brutalities and infidelities is free to do what he likes to marry whom he pleases how stupid how disgusting how damnable his passionate voice was breaking he could scarcely control it oh i know what theyll say it will be the old old song whom god hath joined together thats what this old church of ours has been saying for centuries to poor women with broken hearts has the church itself got a heart to break nonothing but its castiron laws which have been broken a thousand times and nobody a penny the worse but i wonder he continued i wonder why these churchmen who would talk about the impossibility of putting asunder those whom god has joined together dont begin by asking themselves how and when and where god joins them is it in church when they stand before the altar and are asked a few questions and give a few answers if so then god is responsible for some of the most shocking transactions that ever disgraced humanityall the pride and vanity and deliberate concubinage that have covered themselves in every age and are covering themselves still with the cloak of marriage but no said martin its not in churches that god marries people theyve got to be married before they go there or they are never married at allnever theyve got to be married in their hearts for thats where god joins people together not in churches and before priests and altars i sat listening to him with a rising and throbbing heart and after another moment he stepped into the gardenhouse and sat beside me mary he said in his passionate voice thats our case isnt it god married us from the very first there has never been any other woman for me and there never has been any other man for youisnt that so my darling then what are they talking aboutthese churches and churchmen its they who are the real divorcerstrying to put those asunder whom god himself has joined together thats the plain sense of the matter isnt it i was trembling with fear and expectation perhaps it was the same with me as it had been before perhaps i wanted now more than ever to believe what martin was saying perhaps i did not know enough to be able to answer him perhaps my overpowering love and the position i stood in compelled me to agree but i could not help it if it seemed to me that his clear mindclear as a mountain river and as swift and strongwas sweeping away all the wornout sophistries then what what are we to do i asked him do our duty to ourselves my darling thats what we have to do if we cannot be married according to the law of the church we must be married according to the law of the land isnt that enough this is our own affair dearest ours and nobody elses its only a witness we want anywaya witness before god and man that we intend to be man and wife in future but father dan leave him to me said martin ill tell him everything but come into the house now you are catching a cold unless we take care theyll kill you before theyve done next day he leaned over the back of my chair as i sat in the chiollagh with baby in my lap and said in a low tone ive seen father dan well the old angel took it badly god forbid that you should do that same my boy he said putting both yourself and that sweet child of mine out of the church for ever its the church thats putting us out i told him but gods holy law condemns it my son he said gods law is love and he has no other law i answered i was relieved and yet nervous glad and yet afraid a week passed and then the time came for martin to go to windsor for his investiture there had been great excitement in sunny lodge in preparation for this event but being a little unwell i had been out of the range of it at the moment of martins departure i was in bed and he had come upstairs to say goodbye to me what had been happening in the meantime i hardly knew but i had gathered that he thought pressure would be brought to bear on me our good old church is like a limpet on the shore he said once it gets its suckers down it doesnt let go in a hurry but sit tight little woman dont yield an inch while im away he whispered when he left me i reached up to see him going down the road to the railway station his old father was walking proudly by his side bareheaded as usual and still as blithe as a boy next day i was startled by an unexpected telegram it came from a convent in lancashire and was addressed to mary oneill care of doctor conrad it ran am making a round of visits to the houses of our society and would like to see you on my way to ireland may i cross tomorrow mother magdalene one hundred and twelfth chapter she arrived the following afternoonmy dear reverend mother with the pale spiritual face and saintlike eyes except that her habit was now blue and white instead of black she seemed hardly changed in any respect since our days at the sacred heart finding that i was in bed she put up at the plough and came every day to nurse me i was naturally agitated at seeing her again after so many years and such various experiences being uncertain how much she knew of them remembering martins warning i was also fairly certain that she had been sent for but my uneasiness on both heads soon wore off her noiseless step her soft voice and her sweet smile soothed and comforted me i began to feel afresh the influence she had exercised over me when i was a child and to wonder why during my dark time in london i had never thought of writing to her during the first days of her visit she said nothing about painful thingsnever mentioning my marriage or what had happened since she saw me last her talk was generally about our old school and my old schoolfellows many of whom came to the convent for her retreats which were under the spiritual direction of one of the popes domestic prelates sometimes she would laugh about our mother of the novices who had become old and naggledy sometimes about the little fat maestro of the popes choir who had cried when i first sang the hymn to the virgin go on little angel and sometimes about the two old lay sisters now quite toothless who still said i might have been a wonderful washerwoman if i had put my mind to it i hate to think that my dear reverend mother was doing this consciously in order to break down my defences but the effect was the same little by little during the few days she was with me she bridged the space back to my happy girlhood for insensibly i found myself stirred by the emotions of the convent and breathing again the air of my beloved rome on the afternoon of the fourth day of her visit i was sitting up by her side in front of my window which was wide open it was just such a peaceful evening as our last one at nemi not a leaf was stirring not a breath of wind in the air the only sounds we heard were the lowing of the cattle waiting to be milked the soft murmur of the sea and the jolting of a springless cart that was coming up from the shore laden with sea wrack as the sun began to sink it lit blazing fires in the windows of the village in frontespecially in the window of my mothers room which was just visible over the tops of the apple trees in the orchard the reverend mother talked of benediction if she were in rome she would be in church singing the ora pro nobis let us sing it now shall we she said at the next moment her deep majestic contralto accompanied by my own thin and quavering soprano were sending out into the silent air the holy notes which to me are like the reverberations of eternity mater purissima ora pro nobis mater castissima ora pro nobis when we had finished i found my hand lying in her lap patting it gently she said mary i am leaving you tomorrow so soon yes but i cant go without telling you why i cameand then her mission was revealed to me she had heard about my marriage and the ruin it had fallen to my disappearance from home and the circumstances of my recovery my husbands petition for divorce and the disclosures that had followed it but sad and serious and even tragic as all this might be it was as nothing in the eyes of the church and of god compared with the awful gravity of the step i now contemplateda second marriage while my husband was still alive she had nothing to say against martin except the facts that concerned myself she had never heard a word to his discredit she could even understand those facts though she could not condone them perhaps he had seen my position married to a cruel and unfaithful husband and his pity had developed into loveshe had heard of such happenings but only think my child what an abyss he is driving you to he asks you to break your marriage vows oh yes yes i can see what he will saythat pressure was put upon you and you were too young to know what you were doing that may be true but it isnt everything i thought it wrong cruelly wrong that your father should choose a husband for you without regard to your wish and will but it was you not your father who made your marriage vows and you can never get away from thatnever those marriage vows were sacred our blessed saviour had said they could never be broken and our holy church had taken his commandment for law think my child only think what would happen to the world if every woman who has made an unhappy marriage were to do as you think of doing what a chaos what an uprooting of all the sacred ties of home and family and how women would sufferwomen and children above all dont you see that my daughter the security of society lay in the sanctity of marriage the sanctity of marriage lay in its indissolubility and its indissolubility centred in the fact that god was a party to it perhaps you are told that your marriage will be your own concern only and that god and the church have nothing to do with it but if women had believed that in all ages how different the world would be today oh believe me your marriage vow is sacred and you cannot break it without sinmortal sin my daughter the moral of all this was that i must renounce martin conrad wash my heart clean of my love of him shun the temptation of seeing him again and if possible forget him altogether it will be hard i know it will he hard but it will be quite impossible i said as well as i could for my very lips were trembling i had been shaken to the depths of my soul by what the reverend mother said but remembering martins warning i now struggled to resist her two years ago while i was living with my husband i tried to do that and i couldnt i said and if i couldnt do it then when the legal barrier stood between us how can i do it now when the barrier is gone after that i told her of all i had passed through since as a result of my love for martinhow i had parted from him when he went down to the antarctic how i had waited for him in london how i had sacrificed family and friends and home and taken up poverty and loneliness and hard work for him how i had fallen into fathomless depths of despair when i thought i had lost him and how joy and happiness had returned only when god in his gracious goodness had given him back no no no i cried my love for martin can never be overcome or forgottennever as long as i live in the world then said the reverend mother she had been listening intently with her great eyes fixed on my hot and tingling face then she said in her grave and solemn voice if that is the case my child there is only one thing for you to doto leave it leave it leave the world i mean return with me to rome and enter the convent it would be impossible to say how this affected mehow it shook me to the hearts corehow in spite of my efforts to act on my darlings warning it seemed to penetrate to the inmost part of my being and to waken some slumbering instinct in my soul for a long time i sat without speaking again only listening with a fluttering heart to what the reverend mother was sayingthat it was one of the objects of the religious life to offer refuge to the tortured soul that could not trust itself to resist temptation and that taking my vows as a nun to god would be the only way known to and acknowledged by the church of cancelling my vows as a wife to my husband you will be a bride still my child but a bride of christ and isnt that betterfar better you used to wish to be a nun you know and if your father had not come for you on that most unhappy errand you might have been one of ourselves already think of it my child the mothers of our convent will be glad to welcome you if you can come as a willing and contented sister and how can i leave you here at the peril of your soul my daughter i was deeply moved but i made one more effort i told the reverend mother that since the days when i had wished to be a nun a great change had come over me i had become a woman with all a womans passionsthe hunger and thirst for love human love the love of the good man who loved me with all his soul and strength therefore i could never be a willing and contented sister i should only break the peace and harmony of their house and though she were to put me down in the lowest cell of her convent my love would follow me there it would interrupt my offices it would clamour through my prayers and i should always be unhappymiserably unhappy not so unhappy there as you will be if you remain in the world and carry out your intention said the reverend mother oh believe me my child i know you better than you know yourself if you marry again you will never be able to forget that you have broken your vow other women may forget itfrivolous womenwomen living in society and devoting their lives to selfish pleasures such women may divorce their husbands or be divorced by them and then marry again without remembering that they are living in a state of sin whatever the civil law may sayopen and wicked and shameless sin but you will remember it and it will make you more unhappy than you have ever been in your life before worse than that she continued after a moment it will make your husband unhappy also he will see your remorse and share it because he will know he has been the cause if he is a good man the mere sight of your grief will torture him the better man he is the more will he suffer if you were a runaway nun he would wish to take you back to your convent for though it might tear his heart out to part with you he would want to restore your soul but being a wife who has broken her marriage vows he will never be able to do anything an immense and awful shadow will stand between you and darken every hour of your lives that is left when the reverend mother had done i sat motionless and speechless with an aching and suffocating heart staring down on the garden over which the night was falling after a while she patted my cold hand and got up to go saying she would call early in the morning to bid me goodbye her visit to ireland would not last longer than three weeks and after that she might come back for me if i felt on reflection she was sure i should that i ought to return with her to rome i did not reply perhaps it was partly because i was physically weak that my darlings warning was so nearly overcome but the moment the door closed on the reverend mother a conviction of the truth of what she had said rushed upon me like the waves of an overflowing sea yet how cruel after all our waiting all our longing all our gorgeous daydreams of future happiness when i was going to be a bride a happy bride with my lost and stolen girlhood coming back to me for the second time a dark and frowning mountain had risen between martin and me formerly it had been my marriagenow it was my god but if god forbade my marriage with martin what was i to do what was left in life for me was there anything left i was sitting with both hands over my face asking myself these questions and struggling with a rising tempest of tears when i heard baby crying in the room below and christian ann hushing and comforting her whats doing on the boght i wonder a few minutes later they came upstairs isabel on her grandmothers arm in her nightdress ready for bed if it isnt the wind i dont know in the world whats doing on the millish said the old lady and then baby smiled through the big round beads that stood in her seablue eyes and held out her arms to me oh god oh god was not this my answer one hundred and thirteenth chapter in her different way christian ann had arrived at the same conclusion long before the thought came to me she had conceived the idea that father dan and the reverend mother were conspiring to carry me off and in her dear sweet womanly jealousy not to speak of higher and nobler instincts she had resented this intensely for four days she had smothered her wrath only revealing it to baby in halfarticulate interviews over the cradle were no women for these nun bodies going about the house like ghosts are we villish but on the fifth day it burst into the fiercest flame and the gentle old thing flung out at everybody that was the morning of the departure of the reverend mother who after saying goodbye to me in my bedroom had just returned to the parlourkitchen where father dan was waiting to take her to the railway station what provoked christian anns outburst i never rightly knew for though the door to the staircase was open and i could generally catch anything that was said in the room below through the open timbers of the unceiled floor the soft voice of the reverend mother never reached me and the irish roll of father dans vowels only rumbled up like the sound of a drum but christian anns words came sharp and clear as the crack of a breaker sometimes trembling with indignation sometimes quivering with emotion and at last thickening into sobs begging your pardon maam may i ask what is that youre saying to the father about mary oneill going back to rome is she to the convent eh no maam that she never will not if i know her maam not for any purpose in the world maam temptation you say you know best maam but i dont call it overcoming temptationgoing into hidlands to get out of the way of it yes im a christian woman and a good catholic too please the saints but asking your pardon maam im not thinking too much of your convents or believing the women inside of them are living such very unselfish lives either maam another soft rumble as of a drum and then no maam no thats truth enough maam ive never been a nun myself having had better work to do in the world maam but its all as onei know whats going on in the convents im thinking harmony and peace you say yes and jealousy and envy sometimes too or you wouldnt be women like the rest of us maam as for mary oneill she has something better to do too im thinking after doing wrong is she maybe she is the boght millish maybe we all are maam and have need of gods mercy and forgiveness but i never heard that praying is the only kind of penance he asks of us maam and if it is i wouldnt trust but there are poor women who are praying as well when theyre working over their washtubs as some ones when theyre saying their rosaries and singing their tantum ergos another interruption and thentheres bella kinnish herself who keeps the corner shop maam her husband was lost at the mackerel two years for easter he left her with three little children and a baby unborn and bellas finding it middling hard to get a taste of butchers meat or even a bit of loafbread itself for them maam and when shes sitting late at night as the doctors telling me and all the rest of the village dark darning little lizas stockings and patching little willies coat or maybe nursing the baby when its down with the measles the lord is as pleased with her im thinking as with some of your nun bodies in their grand blue cloaks taking turn and turn to kneel before the tabernacle there was another rumble of apologetic voices after that both father dans and the reverend mothers and then came christian anns clear notes again breaking fast though and sometimes threatening to stop whats that youre saying maam motherhood a sacred and holy state also deed it is maam thats truth enough too though some ones who shut themselves up in convents dont seem to think so a mothers a mother and whats more her child is her child wedlock or no wedlock and if shes doing right by her little one and bringing it up well and teaching it true i dont know that when her time comes the lord will be asking her which side of her weddingday it was born on as for mary oneill maam when youre talking and talking about her saving her soul youre forgetting she has her child to save too maam god gave her the boght villish and is she to run away from it its a fine blessing would be on her for that isnt it father dan im surprised at yousuch a terrible cruel shocking unnatural thing as youre thinking i thought you were a better man than thati really did and as for some ones that call themselves mothers theyre no mothers at all and never will betempting a poor woman in her trouble to leave her child to be a charge on other people still another rumble of soft voices and then not that im thinking of myself maam dear heart no its only too eager id be to have the lil angel to myself there she is on the hearthrug maam and if anything happens to mary oneill its there shell be for the rest of my life and its sorry i am for the darlings sake that my time cannot be longer but mary oneill isnt for leaving her little one to go into any convent deed no maam there would be no rest on her if she did im a mother myself and i know what shed be feeling you might put the black hood on her head but natures a wonderful powerful thing and shed never go to bed at night or get up in the morning without thinking of her baby wheres she now shed be asking herself whats happening to my motherless child shed be saying and as the years went on shed be thinking is she well and has she taken her first communion and is she growing up a good woman and whats the world doing on her no maam no mary oneill will go into no convent while her child is here to be cared for deed she wont not mary oneill ill never believe it of her never in this world i heard nothing more for a long time after thatnothing but a noise in my own head which drowned all other noises and when i recovered my composure the reverend mother and father dan must have gone for there was no sound in the room below except that of the rockingchair which was going rapidly and christian anns voice fierce but broken as if baby had cried and she was comforting her then a great new spirit came to me it was motherhood again the mighty passion of motherhoodwhich another mighty passion had temporarily overlaidsweeping down on me once more out of the big simple childlike heart of my martins mother in the fever of body and brain at that moment it seemed to solve all the problems of life for me if the commandment of god forbade me to marry again because i had already taken vows before the altar no matter how innocently or under what constraint and if i had committed a sin a great sin and baby was the living sign of it there was only one thing left me to doto remain as i was and consecrate the rest of my life to my child that would be the real expiation not burying myself in a convent to live for my child alone with her here where my sin had been to work out my atonement this pleased and stirred and uplifted me very much when i first thought of it and even when i remembered martin and thought how hard it would be to tear myself away from the love which waited with open arms for me so near so sweet so precious there seemed to be something majestic almost sublime in the sacrifice i was about to makethe sacrifice of everything in the world except one thing that was dearer to me than life itself a sort of spiritual pride came with the thought of this sacrifice i saw myself as a woman who having pledged herself to god in her marriage and sinned against the law in breaking her marriage vows was now going to accept her fate and to humble herself before the bar of eternal justice but oh what a weak vain thing i was just when i thought i was so strong and noble after a long day in which i had been fighting back the pains of my poor torn heart and almost persuading myself that i had won a victory a letter came by the evening post which turned all my great plans to dust and ashes the letter was from martin only four little pages written in my darlings rugged hand half serious and half playful yet they made the earth rock and reel beneath me my dear little womanjust back from windsor stunning do tell you all about it when i get back home meantime up to my eyes in work arrangements for next expedition going ahead splendidly had a meeting of the committee yesterday and settled to sail by the orient third week in august so as to get down to winter quarters in time to start south in october our own little affair has got to come off first though so ill see the high bailiff as soon as i return and what do you think my chree the boys of the scotia are all coming over to ellan for the great event deed yes though every manjack of them scientific staff included not to speak of osullivan and old treaclewho swears you blew a kiss to him they remember you coming down to tilbury aw god bless me soul gel the way theyre talking of you theres no holding them at all at all seriously darling you have no time to lose in making your preparations my plan is to take you to new zealand and leave you at wellington good little town good people too while i make my bit of a trip to the pole well arrange about girlie when i reach home which will be next week i hopeor rather fearfor every day is like a month when im away from you but never mind little woman once i get this big expedition over we are not going to be separated any more not for a single day as long as we live dearest no by the lord godlifes too short for it mart one hundred and fourteenth chapter after i had read this letter i saw that my great battle which i had supposed to be over was hardly begun martin was coming home with his big heart full of love for me and my own heart ran out to meet him he intended to sail for new zealand the second week in august and he expected to take me with him in spite of all my religious fears and misgivings i asked myself why i should not go what was to prevent me what sin had i really committed what was there for reparation was it anything more than the letter of the divine law that i had defied and broken my love was mine and i was his and i belonged to him for ever he was going out on a great errand in the service of humanity couldnt i go to be his partner and helpmate and if there had been sin if the law of god had been broken wouldnt that too be a great atonement thus my heart fought with my soul or with my instincts as a child of the church or whatever else it was that brought me back and back again and again in spite of all the struggles of my love to the firm commandment of our lord father dan had been righti could not get away from that the reverend mother had been right tooother women might forget that they had broken the divine law but i never should if i married martin and went away with him i should always be thinking of the falseness of my position and that would make me unhappy it would also make martin unhappy to witness my unhappiness and that would be the worst bitterness life could bring then what was left to me if it was impossible that i should bury myself in a convent it was equally impossible that i should live alone and martin in the same world with me not all the spiritual pride i could conjure up in the majesty and solemnity of my selfsacrifice could conquer the yearning of my heart as a woman not all my religious fervour could keep me away from martin in spite of my conscience sooner or later i should go to himi knew quite well i should and my child instead of being a barrier dividing us would be a natural bond calling on us and compelling us to come together then what was left to a woman in my position who believed in the divine commandmentwho could not get away from it were all the doors of life locked to her turn which way she would was there no way out darker and darker every day became this question but light came at last a kind of light or the promise of light it was terrible and yet it brought me oh such immense relief i am almost afraid to speak of it so weak and feeble must any words be in which i attempt to describe that unforgetable change already i had met some of the mysteries of a womans lifenow i was to meet the last the greatest the most tragic and yet the kindest of them all i suppose the strain of emotion i had been going through had been too much for my physical strength for three days after the arrival of martins letter i seemed to be really ill i am ashamed to dwell on my symptoms but for a moment i am forced to do so my eyes were bright my cheeks were coloured and there was no outward indication of any serious malady but towards evening i always had a temperature and in the middle of the night i was sleeping badly it rose very high with a rapid pulse and anxious breathing and in the morning there was great exhaustion old doctor conrad who had been coming to me twice a day began to look very grave at last after a short examination he said rather nervously i should like a colleague from blackwater to consult with me will you receive him i said yes on one conditionthat if the new doctor had anything serious to say he should report it first to me a little reluctantly martins father agreed to my terms and the consulting physician was sent for he came early the next daya beautiful ellan morning with a light breeze from the sea bringing the smell of newmown hay from the meadows lying between he was an elderly man and i could not help seeing a shadow cross his cleanshaven face the moment his eyes first fell on me they were those tender but searching eyes which are so often seen in doctors who are always walking through the valley of the shadow and seem to focus their gaze accordingly controlling his expression he came up to my bed and taking the hand i held out to him he said i trust well not frighten you my lady i liked that though i cared nothing about my lost title i thought it was nice of him to remember it and said i hoped i should not be too restless while he took out and fixed his stethoscope he had such beautiful soft hands he told me that he had had a daughter of my own age once once where is she now i asked him in the kingdom she died like a saint he answered then he made a long examination returning repeatedly to the same place and when it was over and he raised his face i thought it looked still more serious my child he said i liked that too youve never spared yourself have you i admitted that i had not when youve had anything to do youve done it whatever it might cost you i admitted that also he looked round to see if there was anybody else in the room there was only the old doctor who was leaning over the end of the bed watching the face of his colleague and then said in a low voice has it ever happened that you have suffered from privation and hard work and loss of sleep and bad lodgings and and exposure his great searching eyes seemed to be looking straight into my soul and i could not have lied to him if i had wished so i told him a little just a little about my life in londonat bayswater in the east end and ilford and did you get wet sometimes very wet through all your clothes he asked me i told him no but suddenly remembering that during the cold days after baby came when i could not afford a fire i had dried her napkins on my body i felt that i could not keep that fact from him you dried babys napkins on your own body he asked sometimes i did just for a while i answered feeling a little ashamed and my tears rising ah he said and then turning to the old doctor what a mother will do for her child conrad the eyes of doctor conrad which seemed to have become swollen were still fixed on the face of his colleague and speaking as if he had forgotten that i was present with them in the room he said you think shes very ill dont you well talk of that in your consultingroom said the strange doctor then telling me to lie quiet and they would come back presently he went downstairs and martins father followed him nurse came up while they were away she had taken possession of me during the last few days and i asked her who were in the parlourkitchen only father donovan and mrs conradand baby she told me then the doctors came backthe consultant first trying to look cheerful and the old doctor last with a slow step and his head down as if he had been a prisoner coming back to court to receive sentence my lady said the strange doctor you are a brave woman if ever there was one so we have decided to tell you the truth about your condition and then he told me i was not afraid i will not say that i was not sorry i could have wished to live a little longerespecially now when but for the commandment of god love and happiness seemed to be within my grasp but oh the relief there was something sacred in it something supernatural it was as if god himself had come down to me in the bewildering maze that was haunted by the footsteps of my fate and led me out of it yet why these poor weak words they can mean so little to anybody except a woman who has been what i was and she can have no need of them all fear had vanished from my thoughts i had no fear for myself i remembered and none for baby the only regret i felt was for martinhe loved me so there had never been any other woman in the world for him after a moment i thanked the doctors and hoped i had not given them too much trouble doctor conrad seemed crushed into stupefaction and said nothing but the strange doctor tried to comfort me by saying there would be no pain and that my malady was of a kind that would probably make no outward manifestation being a woman to the end i was very glad of that and then i asked him if it would last long he said no not long he feared although everything was in gods hands and nobody could say certainly i was saying i was glad of that too when my quick ears caught a sound of crying it was christian ann and father dan was hushing her i knew what was happeningthe good souls were listening at the bottom of the stairs my first impulse was to send nurse to say they were not to cry then i had half a mind to laugh so that they might hear me and know that what i was going through was nothing but finally i bethought me of martin and asked that they might both be brought up for i had something to say to them after a moment they came into the room christian ann in her simple pure dress and father dan in his shabby sack coat both looking very sorrowful the sweet old children then my two dear friends standing together at the foot of the bed i told them what the doctor had said and warned them that they were to tell nobody elsenobody whatever especially martin leave me to tell him i said do you faithfully promise me i could see how difficult it was for them to keep back their tears but they gave me their word and that was all i wanted my boy my poor boy veen hes thinking there isnt another woman in the world like her said christian ann and then father dan said something about my mother extracting the same promise concerning myself when i was a child at school after that the blackwater doctor stepped up to say goodbye i leave you in good hands but you must let me come to see you again some day he said and then with a playful smile he added theyve got lots of angels up in heavenwe must try to keep some of them on earth you know that was on the fifth of july old midsummer day which is our national day in ellan and flags were flying over many of the houses in the village one hundred and fifteenth chapter july i feel so much better today i hardly know what reaction of my whole being physical and spiritual has set in since yesterday but my heart is lighter than for a long time and sleep which i had come to look upon as a lost blessing came to me last night for four solid hoursbeautiful and untroubled as a childs july martin writes that he expects to be here on the th letter full of joyous spirits lots to tell you when i reach home dearest strange no mortal can imagine how anxious i am to get him back yet i almost dread his coming when he was away before time could not go fast enough for me now it is going too fast i know what that meansthe story i have to tell how am i to tell it july only two days more and martin will be here of course i must be up when he arrives nurse says no but i say yes to be in bed when he comes would be too much a shock for him servants are such domineering tyrants says christian ann who never had but one and the strange woman was such a phantom in the house that the poor mistress was grateful to god when hollantide came round and the ghost walked away of itself my nurse is a dear though how glad i am now that i persuaded christian ann to let her stay july martin comes today and the old doctor with such a proud and stately step has gone off to blackwater to meet him i am terribly weak no pain whatever but perfectly resolute on dressing and going downstairs towards teatime i shall wear a white teagown which sister mildred gave me in london martin likes me best in white later my martin has come we had counted it up that travelling across the island by motorcar he would arrive at five so i was dressed and downstairs by four sitting in the chiollagh and watching the road through the window opposite but he was half an hour late and christian ann and i were in such a fever that anybody would have believed it to be half a century and that the world had stood still we might have known what would happen at blackwater the boys the same that got up the spree when martin went away had insisted on a demonstration then on reaching our village martin had got down and shaken hands with everybodythe joiner and the grocer and the blacksmith and the widow who keeps the corner shopso that it had taken him a quarter of an hour to get through amid a general chorus of the boy he is though and no pride at all at all after that he drove home at top speed and my quick ears caught the musical hum of the motor as it crossed the bridge good gracious what excitement quick nurse help me to the gate i got there just in time to hear a shout and to see a precipitate bound out of the car and then what an embrace it is such a good thing my martin is a big brawny person for i dont know how i should have got back to the house being so weak and breathless just then if his strong arm had not been round my waist dr osullivan had come too looking as gay as a hummingbird and after i had finished with martin i kissed him also having such a largesse of affection to distribute generally whereupon he blushed like a boy bless him and stammered out something about st patrick and st thomas and how he wouldnt have believed anybody who had said there was anything so sweet etc martin said i was looking so well and he too declared he wouldnt have believed any man who had sworn i could have looked so much better in the time my nervous thermometer must have gone up by leaps and bounds during the next hour for immediately after tea the old doctor ordered me back to bed though i refused to go until he had faithfully promised that the door to the staircase should be kept open so that i could hear what was said downstairs what lots of fun they had there half the parish must have come in to put a sight on martin after his investiture including old tommy the mate who told everybody over and over again that he had known the lad since he was a lump and him and me are same as brothers the old doctors stately pride must have been something to see it was sir martin here and sir martin there until i could have cried to hear him i felt just as foolish myself too for though i cannot remember that my pulse gave one extra beat when they made me your ladyship now that martin has become but thats what we women are you see at length martins big voice came up clear above the rest and then the talk was about the visit to windsor christian ann wanted to know if he wasnt freckened to be there not being used of kings whereupon he cried what frightened of another manand a stunning good one too and then came a story of how the king had asked if he hadnt been in fear of icebergs and how he had answered no you could strike more of them in a day in london meaning icyhearted people than in a lifetime in the antarctic i suppose i must have laughed at that for the next i heard was hush isnt that mary aw yes the poor veg veen said a sad voice it was christian anns at the bottom of her heart i shall always be the child who sang carvals to her door what a wonderful day i shall not sleep a wink tonight though tomorrow i must tell him july i intended to tell martin this morning but i really couldnt i was going downstairs to breakfast holding on to the bannisters at one side and using nurses shoulder as my other crutch when i saw the brightest picture i have ever beheld baby and martin were on hands and knees on the ragwork hearthrug face to facemartin calling her to come isabel lifting up her little head to him like a fledgling in a nest and both laughing with that gurgling sound as of water bubbling out of a bottle this sight broke all the breath out of me at the very first moment and when martin after putting me into my place in the chiollagh plunged immediately into a rapturous account of his preparations for our departurehow we were to be married by special license at the high bailiffs on the tenth if that date would do how i was to rest a day and then travel up to london on the twelfth and then rest other four days during which warm clothes could be bought for me and sail by the orient on the sixteenthi could not find it in my heart to tell him then of the inexorable fate that confronted us it was cowardice i knew and sooner or later i should have to pay for it but when he went on to talk about baby and appealed to his mother to say if she wouldnt look after girlie when i was gone and christian ann in such a different tone said yes she would look after girlie when i was gone i decided that i dared not tell him at alli would die rather than do so the end of it all is that i have arranged with christian ann the old doctor and father dan that time and martins own observation are to tell him what is going to happen and none of us are to say anything about it what a deceiver i am though i put it all down to my unselfish love for martin it would be such a blow to himdisturbing his plans upsetting everything perhaps causing him to postpone his expedition or even to abandon it altogether let the truth fall soft on him hell see it soon enough dont let us be cruel the dear sweet unsuspecting old darlings have taken it all inall my vain and cowardly selfishness i am to play the part of pretending to fall in with martins plans and they are to stand by and say nothing can i do it i wonder i wonder july i am becoming quite a great actress its astonishing to see how i develop my deceptions under all sorts of veils and disguises martin told me today that he had given up the idea of leaving me at wellington and had determined to take me on to winter quarters having met on the way to windsor some great specialist in my kind of malady i wonder how much he knows of it who declared that the climate of the antarctic would act on me like magic such glorious sunshine in summer such crisp dry stimulating air new life with every breath such a stunning little house too so cosy and comfortable and then the men whom he would leave behind while he slipped down souththey would worship me how splendid how glorious i cried how delightful to be mistress over a houseful of big hungry healthy boys who come in out of the snow and want to eat up everything sometimes i feel myself being carried away by my own acting and then i see the others christian ann and the old doctor and father dan dropping their heads or stealing out of the room i wish i were not so weak i feel no pain whatever only this temperature during the nights and the everdeepening exhaustion in the mornings july i am keeping it up today i was alone with martin for a long hour in the gardenhouse weather soft and beautiful the heavens blue and gleams of sunshine coming through the trelliswork merely to sit beside my darling with his odour of health is to feel a flood of bodily strength coursing through me enough to make me forget that i am a frail thing myself who could be blown away by a puff of wind but to hear him talk on his own subject is to be lifted up to the highest reaches of the soul i always say there is a dumb poet in every explorer but the poet wasnt dumb today when martin talked about the cyclone or anticyclone or whatever it is which covers the region of the south pole like a cap and determines the weather of a great part of the habitable globe we are going to take from god his word and pass it on to the world he said after that he made reference for the first time since his return to the difficulties of our position saying what a glorious thing it would be to escape to that great free region from the world of civilisation with its effete laws and wornout creeds which enslave humanity only a month today until we start and youll be well enough to travel then dearest yes yes only a month today and i shall be well enough then dearest oh mary oneill how much longer will you be able to keep it up dear july martin brought the proofs of his new book from london and today in the summerhouse bluebells paling out and hanging their heads but the air full of the odour of fruit trees he and dr osullivan and i have been correcting galleysthe doctor reading aloud martin smoking his briarroot pipe and i in a crater of cushions supposed to be sitting as judge and jury such simple straight natural writing there may have been a thousand errors but my ears heard none of them the breathless bits about the moments when death was near the humorous bits about patching the tent with the tails of their shirts when an overturned lamp burnt a hole in the canvasthis was all i was conscious of until i was startled by the sound of a sepulchral voice groaning out oh lord amassy me and by the sight of a glengarry cap over the top of the fuchsia hedge old tommy was listening from the road we sat late over our proofs and then the dew having begun to fall martin said he must carry me indoors lest my feet should get wetwhich he did with the result that remembering what had happened on our first evening at castle raa i had a pretty fit of hysterics as soon as we reached the house lets skip commanther was the next thing i heard and then i was helped upstairs to bed july what a flirt i am becoming having conceived the idea that dr osullivan is a little wee bit in love with me too i have been playing him off against martin it was so delicious after all i have gone through to have two magnificent men out of the heroic youth of the world waiting hand and foot on one little woman that the feminine soul in me today couldnt resist the temptation to an innocent effort at coquetry so before we began business on the proofs i told martin that if he was determined to leave me behind at winter quarters while he went away to the pole he must allow dr osullivan to remain behind to take care of me of course the doctor rose to my bait like a dear crying he will tooby st patrick and st thomas he will and a mighty proud man hell be entirely but good gracious a momentary shadow passed over martins face then came one of his big broad smiles then out shot his clinched fist and the poor doctor and his garden seat were rolling over each other on the grass however we got through without bloodshed and did good days work on the book i must not write any more i have always written in my own book at night when i havent been able to get any kind of christian sleep but im weaker now so must stop lest i shouldnt have strength enough for martins july oh dear i am dragging all these other poor dears into my deceptions christian ann does not mind what lies or halflies she has to tell in order to save pain to her beloved son but the old doctor and father dan today itself as martins mother would say i had to make my poor old priest into a shocking storyteller i developed a cough a few weeks ago and though it is not really of much account i have been struggling to smother it while martin has been about knowing he is a doctor himself and fearing his ear might detect the note but this afternoon whether a little damp with a soft patter of sweet rain on the trees and the bushes i had a rather bad bout at which martins face looked grave until i laughed and said its nothing ive had this sort of cough every summer since i was bornhavent i father dan yees i shall have to remember that in my next confession but what father dan is to do i really dont know july i have been rather down today about a newspaper that came to me anonymously from paris with a report marked for my special delectation fashionable marriage of an english peer and an american heiress my husbands and almas it took place at the american embassy and was attended by great numbers of smart people there was a long account of the grandeur of the brides dress and of the splendour of the bridegrooms presents they have taken an apartment on the champs elysees and will spend most of the year in paris ah well why should i trouble about a matter that so little concerns me alma is still beautiful she will be surrounded by admirers her salon will be frequented by the fashionable parasites of europe and america as for my husband the strawfire of his wifes passion for him will soon burn out especially now that she has gained what she wantedhis name his title martin carried me upstairs to bed tonight i was really feeling weaker than usual but we made a great game of it nurse went first behind a mountain of pillows martin and i came next with his arms about my body and mine around his neck and dr osullivan last carrying two tall brass candlesticks how we laughed we all laughed together as if trying to see which of us could laugh the loudest only christian ann looked serious standing at the bottom of the stairs nursing baby in her nightdress it is three oclock in the morning as i write and i can hear our laughter stillonly it sounds like sobbing now july have heard something today that has taken all the warmth of life out of me it is about my father whom the old doctor still attends having been told of my husbands marriage he has announced his intention of claiming my child if anything happens to me what his object may be i do not know he cannot be thinking of establishing a claim to my husbands titleisabel being a girl remembering something his lawyer said about the marriage settlement when i consulted him on the subject of divorce i can only assume that now he is poor he is trying to recover the inheritance he settled on my husband it frightens meraising my old nightmare of a lawsuit about the legitimacy of my child i want to speak to martin about it yet how can i do so without telling him the truth which i have been struggling so hard to conceal july oh mary oneill what are you coming to i told martin about fathers threat only i gave it another colour he had heard of the reverend mothers visit so i said the rumour had reached my father that i intended to enter a convent and he had declared that if i did so he would claim my child from christian ann being its nearest blood relation can he do sowhen i am when we are gone i asked i thought martins strong face looked sterner than i had ever seen it he made a vague reply and left me soon afterwards on some sort of excuse about an hour later he came back to carry me upstairs and just as he was setting me down and christian ann was coming in with the candles he whispered dont worry about girlie ive settled that matter im thinking what has he done i wonder memorandum of martin conrad what i had done is easily told i had gone straight to daniel oneill himself intending to know the truth of the story and to act accordingly already i knew enough to scent mischief i could not be so stupefied into blindness of what was going on under my eyes as not to see that the dirty question of money and perhaps the dirtier question of the aims and expectations of the woman macleod were at the root of the matter that was distressing my darling daniel oneill had left the big house and gone to live in his mothers old cottage for two reasonsfirst to delude the law into the idea that he was himself utterly ruined by the bankruptcy to which he had brought the whole island and next to gratify the greed of his mistress who wanted to get him to herself at the end so that he might be persuaded to marry her if it were only on his deathbed and so establish against any claim of his daughters her widows rights in what a husband leaves behind himwhich is half of everything in ellan what connection this had with the mans desire to get hold of the child i had yet to learn but i meant to learn it without another hours delay so i set off for the cottage on the curragh it was growing dark and not being sure of my way through the everchanging bypaths of the bog land i called on father dan to guide me the old priest seemed to know my errand the matter my darling had communicated as a secret being common knowledge and at first he looked afraid well yes yes why shouldnt i he said and then yes i will i willwith the air of a man who had made up his mind to a daring enterprise our curragh is a stretch of wild marsh lying over against the sea undrained only partly cultivated half covered with sedge and sallow bushes and consequently liable to heavy mists there was a mist over it that night and hence it was not easy even for father dan accustomed to midnight visits to curragh cottages to find the house which had once been the home of neale the lord we rooted it out at last by help of the parish constable who was standing at the corner of a byroad talking to the coachman of a gorgeous carriage waiting there with its two splendid horses smoking in the thick night air when over the shingle of what we call the street we reached the low straggling croftercottage under its thick trammon tree supposed to keep off the evil spirits i rapped with my knuckles at the door and it was opened by a tall scraggy woman with a candle in her hand this was nessy macleod harder and uglier than ever with her red hair combed up giving her the appearance of a bunch of carrots over two stalks of rhubarb almost before i had time to say that we had come to see mr oneill and to step into the house while saying so a hoarse husky querulous mans voice cried from within who is it nessy its father dan and martin i mean sir thatll do i said and the next moment we were in the livingrooma bare bleak comfortless curraghmans kitchen a more incongruous sight than we saw there human eyes never beheld daniel oneill a shadow of the big brute creature he once was a shrivelled old man with his bony hands scored and contracted like an autumn leaf his shrunken legs scarcely showing through his baggy trousers his square face whiter than the wall behind it and a piece of red flannel hanging over his head like a cowl sat in the elbowchair at the side of the hearthfire while at a deal table which was covered with papers that looked like law deeds and share certificates being stamped and sealed sat the bishop of the island and its leading lawyer mr curphy on hearing my name and seeing me enter the house daniel oneill lost all control of himself he struggled to his feet by help of a stick and as i walked up to him he laid hold of me you devil he cried you infernal villain you but it is of no use to repeat what else he said in the fuming of his rage laying hold of me by the collar of my coat and tugging at it as if he would drag me to his feet i was half sorry for the man badly as i thought of him so i only opened his hand easy enough to do for the grip was gone from it and said youre an old man sir and youre a sick mandont tempt me to forget that you are the father of mary oneill sit down he sat down breathless and broken without another word but the bishop with a large air of outraged dignity faced about to poor father dan who was standing near the door turning his round hat in his trembling hands and said father donovan did you know that mr oneill was very ill i did monsignor said father dan and that a surgeon is coming from london to perform an operation upon himdid you know that i did monsignor did you know also that i was here tonight to attend with mr curphy to important affairs and perhaps discharge some sacred duties i knew that too monsignor then said the bishop pointing at me how dare you bring this man herethis man of all others who has been the chief instrument in bringing shame and disgrace upon our poor sick friend and his deeply injured family so thats how you look at it is it monsignor yes sir that is how i look at it and i am sorry for a priest of my church who has so weakened his conscience by sympathy with notorious sinners as to see things in any other light sinners bishop didnt you hear me father donovan or do you desire me to use a harder name for themfor one of them in particular on whom you have wasted so much weak sentimentality to the injury of your spiritual influence and the demoralisation of your parish i have warned you already do you wish me to go further to remove you from your presbytery or perhaps report your conduct to those who have power to take the frock off your back what standard of sanctity for the sacrament of holy matrimony do you expect to maintain while you degrade it by openly associating with a woman who has broken her marriage vows and become little better i grieve to say it with a deep inclination of the head towards the poor wreck in the elbowchair little better than a common i saw the word that was coming and i was out in an instant but there was somebody before me it was father dan the timid old priest seemed to break in one moment the bonds of a lifelong tyranny whats that you say monsignor he cried in a shrill voice i degrade the sacrament of holy matrimony never in this world but if theres anybody in the island of ellan who has done that same every day of his life its yourself and never more cruelly and shamefully than in the case were talking of at this present speaking im not used to this kind of language from my clergy father donovan began the bishop but before he could say more father dan caught him up by crying perhaps not monsignor but youve got to hear for once and thats now when this man pointing to daniel oneill for his own purposes wanted to marry his daughter who was a child and had no choice in the matter to one of another faith a man who didnt believe in the sacrament of marriage as we know it who was it that paved the way for him you actually mean that i i mean that without your help monsignor a good girl could never have been married to a bad man you didnt act in ignorance either when somebody told yousomebody who is here nowthat the man to whom you were going to marry that innocent girl was a notorious loose liver a profligate a reprobate a betrayer of women and a damned scoundrel go on father dan thats gods own name for him i said when the old priest caught his breath for a moment terrified by the word that had burst from his lips lets have an end of this said the bishop mightily wait a bit sir i said and then father dan went on to say how he had been told there was nothing to my story and how he had been forbidden to inquire into it thats how you made me a party to this wicked marriage god and his holy mother pardon me and now that it has come to the end you might have expected and the poor helpless child who was bought and sold like a slave is in the position of the sinner you want me to cut her off to turn the hearts of all good people against her to cast her out of communion to make her a thing to point the finger atme her spiritual father who baptized her taking her out of the arms of the angel who bore her and giving her to christor if i wont youll deprive me of my living youll report me to rome youll unfrock me do it monsignor cried father dan taking a step nearer to the bishop and lifting a trembling hand over his head do it if our holy church will permit you and ill put a wallet on my old shoulders and go round the houses of my parish in my old age begging a bite of bread and a basin of meal and sleeping under a thorn bush rather than lay my head on my pillow and know that that poor victim of your wicked scheming is in the road the throbbing and breaking of the old priests voice had compelled me to drop my head and it was not until i heard the sneck of the lock of the outer door that i realised that overcome by his emotion he had fled from the house and now i guess you can follow your friend said daniel oneill not yet sir i answered i have something to say first well well what is it please said the lawyer sharply and insolently looking to where i was standing with folded arms at one side of the hearthplace youll hear soon enough master curphy i answered then turning back to daniel oneill i told him what rumour had reached my dear one of his intentions with regard to her child and asked him to say whether there was any truth in it answer the man curphy said daniel oneill and thereupon the lawyer with almost equal insolence turned to me and said what is it you wish to know sir whether if mary oneill is unable from any cause to keep control of her child which god forbid her father intends to take possession of it why shouldnt he if the mother dies for instance her father will be the childs legal guardian but if by that time the father is dead toowhat then then the control of the child willwith the consent of the courtdevolve upon his heir and representative meaning this lady i asked pointing to the woman macleod who was now standing at the back of daniel oneills chair possibly and what will she do with it do with it the lawyer was running his fingers through his long beard and trying to look perplexed mr curphy ill ask you not to pretend to be unable to understand me if and when this lady gets possession of mary oneills child what is she going to do with it very well said the advocate seeing i meant business since my client permits me to speak ill tell you plainly whatever the childs actual parentage perhaps you know best go on sir whatever the childs parentage it was born in wedlock even the recent divorce proceedings have not disturbed that therefore we hold that the child has a right to the inheritance which in due time should come to mary oneills offspring by the terms of the settlement upon her husband it was just as i expected and every drop of my blood boiled at the thought of my darlings child in the hands of that frozenhearted woman so that is the law is it that is the law in ellan in the event of mary oneills death and her fathers death her child and all its interests will come into the hands of of her fathers heir and representative meaning again this lady probably the woman at the back of the chair began to look restless i dont know sir she said if your repeated references to me are intended to reflect upon my character or my ability to bring up the child well and look after its interests properly they are madamthey most certainly and assuredly are i answered daniel she cried be quiet gel said daniel oneill let the man speak well see what he has come for presently go on sir i took him at his word and was proceeding to say that as i understood things it was intended to appeal to the courts in order to recover nominally for the child succession to the money which had been settled on mary oneills husband at the time of their marriage when the old man cried struggling again to his feet there you are the money its the money the mans after he took my daughter and now hes for taking my fortunewhats left of it anyway he shant though no by god he shant go back to your woman sir do you hear meyour woman and tell her that neither you nor she shall touch one farthing of my fortune im seeing to that now its what were here for tonightbefore that damnable operation tomorrow for nobody knows what will come of it she has defied me and ruined me and made me the byword of the island gods curse on her daniel daniel cried the macleod woman trying to pacify the infuriated madman and to draw him back to his seat i would have given all i had in the world if daniel oneill could have been a strong man at that moment instead of a poor wisp of a thing with one foot in the grave but i controlled myself as well as i could and said mr oneill your daughter doesnt want your fortune and as for myself you and your money are no more to me than an old hen sitting on a nest of addled eggs give it to the lady at the back of your chairshe has earned it apparently really said the bishop who had at length recovered from father dans onslaught really sir whateveryourname is this is too outrageousthat you should come to this lonely house at this time of night interrupting most urgent business not to speak of serious offices and make injurious insinuations against the character of a respectable personyou sir who had the audacity to return openly to the island with the partner of your sin and to lodge her in the house of your own motheryour own mother sir though heaven knows what kind of mother it can be who harbours her sons sinladen mistress his woman as our sick friend says lord how my hands itched but controlling myself again with a mighty effort i said monsignor i dont think i should advise you to say that again why not sir because i have a deep respect for your cloth and should be sorry to see it soiled violence cried the bishop rising to his feet you threaten me with violence is there no policeman in this parish mr curphy theres one at the corner of the road bishop i said i brought him along with me i should have brought the high bailiff too if there had been time you would perhaps be no worse for a few witnesses to the business that seems to be going on here saying this as i pointed to the papers on the table i had hit harder than i knew for both the bishop and the lawyer who had also risen dropped back into their seats and looked at each other with expressions of surprise then stepping up to the table so as to face the four of them i said as calmly and deliberately as i could now listen to me i am leaving this island in about three weeks time and expect to be two yearsperhaps three yearsaway mary oneill is going with meas my wife she intends to leave her child in the care of my mother and i intend to promise her that she may set her mind at ease that it shall never under any circumstances be taken away you seem to have made up your minds that she is going to die please god she may disappoint your expectations and come back strong and well but if she does not and i have to return alone and if i find that her child has been removed from the protection in which she left it do you know what i shall do go to the courts i presume said the lawyer oh dear no ill go to no courts mr curphy ill go to the people who have set the courts in motionwhich means that ill go to you and you and you and you heaven knows how many of us may be living when that day comes but as surely as i am if i find that the promise i made to mary oneill has been a vain one and that her child is under this womans control and the subject of a lawsuit about this mans money and she in her grave as surely as the lord god is above us there isnt one soul of you here present who will be alive the following morning that seemed to be enough for all of them even old daniel oneill the only man in the house who had an ounce of fight in him dropped his head back in his chair with his mouth wide open and his broken teeth showing behind his discoloured lips i thought father dan would have been waiting for me under the trammon on the street but he had gone back to the presbytery and sent tommy the mate to lead me through the mist and the bylanes to the main road the old salt seemed to have a skute into the bad business which had brought out the bishop and the lawyer at that late hour and on parting from me at the gate of sunny lodge he said lordamassy me what for hasnt ould tom dug a fortune coming to him and when i asked him what he would do with a fortune if he had one he answered do have a tunderin thundering good lawshoot and sattle some o them big fellas going to bed in the plough that night i had an ugly vision of the scene being enacted in the cottage on the curragh a scene not without precedent in the history of the world though the priesthood as a whole is so pure and noblethe midnight marriage of a man dying in unnatural hatred of his own daughter and she the sweetest woman in the world while the priest and the prostitute divided the spoils end of martin conrads memorandum one hundred and sixteenth chapter july the old doctor brought me such sad and startling news today my poor father is deaddied yesterday after an operation which he had deferred too long refusing to believe it necessary the dreadful fact has hitherto been kept secret not only from me but from everybody out of fear of legal proceedings arising from the failure of banks c which has brought the whole island to the verge of bankruptcy he was buried this morning at old st marysvery early almost before daybreak to suit the convenience of the bishop who wished to catch the first steamer en route for rome as a consequence of these strange arrangements and the secrecy that has surrounded my fathers life of late people are saying that he is not dead at all that in order to avoid prosecution he has escaped from the island going off with the bishop in a sort of disguise and that the coffin put into the grave this morning did not contain a human body but thats all wrong said the old doctor your father is really dead and buried and the strange man who went away with the bishop was the london surgeon who performed the operation i can hardly realise itthat the strong stalwart being the stern old lion whose heavy foot tramping through my poor mothers room used to make the very house shake is gone he died as he had lived it seems to the last selfcentred inflexible domineeringa peasant yet a great man if greatness is to be measured by power ranking i think in his own little scene of life with the tragic figures of history i have spent the day in bitter grief ever since i was a child there has been a dark shadow between my father and me he was like a beetling mountain always hanging over my head i wonder whether he wished to see me at the end perhaps he did and was overpersuaded by the cold and savourless nature of nessy macleod who is giving it out i hear that grief and shame for me killed him people will say he was a vulgar parvenu a sycophant a snobheaven knows what all wrong for the true reading of his character one has to go back to the day when he was a ragged boy and the liveried coachman of the bad lord raa lashed at his mother on the road and he swore that when he was a man she should have a carriage of her own and then nobody should never lash her he found gesslers cap in the marketplace and was no more willing than tell to bend the knee to it my poor father he did wrong to use another life another soul for either his pride or his revenge but god knows best how it will be with him and if he was the first cause of making my life what it has been i send after him i almost tremble to say it if not my love my forgiveness july i begin to realise that after all i was not romancing when i told the old dears that martin and his schemes would collapse if i failed him poor boy he is always talking as it everything depended upon me it is utterly frightening to think what would happen to the expedition if he thought i could not sail with him on the sixteenth martin is not one of the men who weep for their wives as if the sun had suffered eclipse and then marry again before their graves are green so having begun on my great scheme of pretending that i am getting better every day and shall be ready to go never fear i have to keep it up i begin to suspect though that i am not such a wonderful actress after all sometimes in the midst of my raptures i see him looking at me uneasily as if he were conscious of a certain effort at such moments i have to avoid his eyes lest anything should happen for my great love seems to be always lying in wait to break down my makebelieve today though i had resolved not to give way to tears when he was talking about the voyage out and how it would set me up and how the invigorating air of the antarctic would make another woman of me i cried how splendid how glorious then why are you crying he asked oh good gracious thats nothingfor me i answered but if i am throwing dust in martins eyes i am deceiving nobody else it seems tonight after he and dr osullivan had gone back to the plough father dan came in to ask christian ann how she found me and being answered rather sadly i heard him say ugh cha nee woe is me what is life it is even a vapour which appeareth for a little while and then vanisheth away and half an hour later when old tommy came to bring me some lobsters he still declares they are the only food for invalids and to ask hows the lil woman now i heard him moaning as he was going out therell be no shelter for her this voyage the vogh shell carry the sea in with her to the head im thinking july i must keep it upi must i must to allow martins hopes and dreams to be broken in upon now would be enough to kill me outright i dont want to be unkind but some explorers leave the impression that their highest impulse is the praise of achievement and once they have done something all theyve got to do next is to stay at home and talk about it martin is not like that exploration is a passion with him the lure of the little voices and the call of the unknown have been with him from the beginning and they will be with him to the end i cannot possibly think of martin dying in bed and being laid to rest in the green peace of english earthdear and sweet as that is to tamer natures mine for instance i can only think of that wild heroic soul going up to god from the broad white wilderness of the stormy south and leaving his body under heaving hummocks of snow with blizzards blowing a requiem over his grave far off may that glorious ending be but shall my poor failing heart make it impossible never never never moralim going to get up every daywhatever my nurse may say july i was rocking baby to sleep this afternoon when christian ann who was spinning by the fire told me of a quarrel between aunt bridget and nessy macleod it seems that nessy who says she was married to my father immediately before the operation claims to be the heiress of all that is left and as the estate includes the big house she is putting the law on aunt bridget to obtain possession poor aunt bridget what a pitiful end to all her scheming for betsy beauty all her cruelties to my longsuffering mother all her treatment of meto be turned out of doors by her own stepdaughter when old tommy heard of the lawsuit he said chut sarves her right i say its the black life the big woman lived before and its the black life shell be living now and her growing old and the death looking in on her july we have finished the proofs today and dr osullivan has gone back with them i thought he looked rather wae when he came to say goodbye to me and though he made a great deal of noise his voice was husky when swearing by his favourite saints he talked about returning for the tenth with all the boys including treacle of course that was nonsense about his being in love with me but im sure he loves me all the samemany many people love me i dont know what ive done to deserve all this love i have had a great deal of love in my life now that i come to think of it we worked hard over the last of the proofs and i suppose i was tired at the end of them for when martin carried me upstairs tonight there was less laughter than usual and i thought he looked serious as he set me down by the bed i bantered him about that a penny for your thoughts mister but towards midnight the truth flashed upon mei am becoming thinner and therefore lighter every day and he is beginning to notice it morali must try to walk upstairs in future july ah me it looks as if it were going to be a race between me and the expeditionwhich shall come off firstand sometimes i am afraid i am going to be the loser martin ought to sail on the sixteenthonly seventeen days i am expected to be married on the tenthonly eleven oh mary oneill what a strange contradictory war you are waging look straight before you dear and dont be afraid i had a letter from the reverend mother this evening she is crossing from ireland tomorrow which is earlier than she intended so i suppose father dan must have sent for her i do hope martin and she will get on comfortably together a struggle between my religion and my love would he more than i could bear now july when i awoke this morning very late i had slept after daybreak i was thinking of the reverend mother but lo who should come into the room but the doctor from blackwater he was very nice said i had promised to let him see me again so he had taken me at my word i watched him closely while he examined me and i could see that he was utterly astonishedcouldnt understand how i came to be aliveand said he would never again deny the truth of the old saying about dying of a broken heart because i was clearly living by virtue of a whole one i made pretence of wanting something in order to get nurse out of the room and then reached lip to the strange doctor and whispered when he wasnt for telling me talked about the miraculous power of god which no science could reckon with but at last i got a word out of him which made me happy or at least content perhaps its sad but many things look brighter that are far more sorrowfuldying of a broken heart for example and whatever else is amiss with me mine is not broken but healed gloriously healed after its bruises so thank god for that anyway just had some heavenly sleep and such a sweet dream i thought my darling mother came to me youre cold my child she said and then covered me up in the bedclothes i talked about leaving my baby and she said she had had to do the sameleaving me thats what we mothers come toso many of usbut heaven is over all she whispered august i really cannot understand myself so it isnt a matter for much surprise if nobody else understands me in spite of what the strange doctor said yesterday i dressed up grandly today not only in my teagown but some beautiful old white irish lace which nurse lent me to wrap about my throat i think the effect was rather good and when i went downstairs leaning on nurses shoulder there was martin waiting for me and though he did not speak couldnt perhaps the look that came into his blue eyes was the same as on that last night at castle raa when he said something about a silvery firtree with its dark head against the sky oh my own darling i could wish to live for you such as i am if i could be of any use if i would not be a hindrance rather than a help if our union were right if in short god himself had not already answered to all such questionings and beseechings his great unalterable irrevocable no august the reverend mother who arrived in the island last night has been with me all day i think she knows for she has said nothing more about the conventonly with her eyes so soft and tender that she intends to remain with me a little while having need of rest herself to my surprise and joy martin and she have got on famously this evening she told me that in spite of all i know what she meant by that she is willing to believe that he is a true man and notwithstanding his unhappy opinions about the church a christian gentleman such a touching thing happened today we were all sitting in the garden sun warm light breeze off the sea ripe corn chattering in the field opposite when i felt a tugging at my skirts and who should it be but isabel who had been crawling along the dry grass plucking daisies and now dragging herself up to my side emptied them into my lap no i will not give way to tears any more as long as i live yet it rather touches me up as martin says to see how ones vainest dreams seem to come to pass i dont know if martin thought i was going to break down but he rattled away about girlie having two other mothers nowgrandma who would keep her while we were down south and the reverend mother who would take her to school when she was old enough so theres nothing more to fear about baby but what about martin himself am i dealing fairly in allowing him to go on with his preparations isnt it a kind of cruelty not to tell him the truth this problem is preying on my mind if i could only get some real sleep perhaps i could solve it august i am growing weaker every day no pain no cough nothing but exhaustion father dan told me this morning that i was growing more than ever like my motherthat sweet saint whom the lord has made his own i know what he meanslike her as she was at the last my poor old priest is such a child a good old man is always a childa woman can see through and through him ah me i am cared for now as i never was before yet i feel like baby when she is tired after walking round the chairs and comes to be nursed what children we all are at the endjust children august father dan came across in breathless excitement today it seems the poor soul has been living in daily dread of some sort of censure from rome through his bishopabout his toleration of me i supposebut behold its the bishop himself who has suffered censure having been sent into quarantine at one of the roman colleges and forbidden to return to his diocese and now lo a large sum of money comes from rome for the poor of ellan to be distributed by father dan i think i know whose money it is that has been returned but the dear father suspects nothing and is full of a great scheme for a general thanksgiving with a procession of our village people to old st marys and then rosary and benediction it is to come off on the afternoon of the tenth it seems my last day in ellan after my marriage but before my departure how god governs everything august it is really wrong of me to allow martin to go on this morning he told me he had bought the special license for our marriage and this evening he showed me our tickets for sydneytwo berths first cabin steadiest part of the ship oh my dear heart if you only knew that i have had my ticket these many days and that it is to take me out first on the great expeditionto the still bigger unknown the everlasting sea the immeasurable eternity i must be brave although i am a little cowardly sometimes i can be brave i have definitely decided tonight that i will tell him but how can i look into his face and say august i have made up my mind to write to martin one can say things so much easier in a letteri can anyway even my voice affects meswelling and falling when i am moved like a billow on the ocean i find my writing cannot any longer be done in a sitting position in bed but i can prop my book on my breast and write lying down mary oneills letter to martin conrad august th am my own darlingstrengthen yourself for what i am going to say it will be very hard for youi know that dear tomorrow we were to have gone to the high bailiff this day week we were to have sailed for sydney and two months hence we were to have reached winter quarters but i cannot go with you to the high bailiffs i cannot go with you to sydney i cannot go with you to winter quarters i cannot go anywhere from here it is impossible quite impossible i have loved too much dear so the power of life is burnt out for me my great lovelove for my mother for my darling baby and above all for youhas consumed me and i cannot live much longer forgive me for not telling you this beforefor deceiving you by saying that i was getting better and growing stronger when i knew i was not i used to think it was cowardice which kept me from telling you the truth but i see now that it was love too i was so greedy of the happiness i have had since i came to this house of love that i could not reconcile myself to the loss of it you will try to understand that wont you dear and so forgive me for keeping you in the dark down to the very last moment this will be a great grief to you i would die with a glad heart to save you a moments pain yet i could not die at ease if i did not think you would miss me and grieve for me i like to think that in the time to come people will say once he loved mary oneill and now there is no other woman in the world for him i should not be a woman if i did not feel like thatshould i but dont grieve too much dearest only think if i had been strong and had years and years still to live what a life would have been before mebefore both of us we couldnt have lived apart could we and if we had married i should never have been able to shake off the thought that the world which would always be opening its arms to you did not want me that would be so wouldnt itafter all i have gone through the world never forgives a woman for the injuries it inflicts on her itself and i have had too many wounds darling to stand by your side and be any help to you oh i know what you would say dearest she gave up everything for love of me choosing poverty obscurity and pain above wealth and rank and ease and therefore i will choose her before everything else in the world but i know what would come to us in the end dear and i should always feel that your love for me had dragged you down closed many of the doors of life to you i should know that you were always hearing behind you the echoing footsteps of my fate and that is the only thing i could not bear besides my darling there is something else between us in this worldthe divine commandment our blessed lord says we can never be man and wife and there is no getting beyond that is there oh dont think i reproach myself with loving youthat i think it a sin to do so i do not now and never shall he who made my heart what it is must know that i am doing no wrong and dont think i regret that night at castle raa if i have to answer to god for that i will do so without fear because i know he will know that when the cruelty and selfseeking of others were trying to control my most sacred impulses i was only claiming the right he gave me to be mistress of myself and sovereign of my soul you must not regret it either dearest or reproach yourself in any way for when we stand together before gods footstool he will see that from the beginning i was yours and you were mine and he will cover us with the wings of his loving mercy then dont think dear that i have ever looked upon what happened afterwardsfirst in ellan and then in londonas in any sense a punishment i have never done that at any time and now i believe from the bottom of my heart that if i suffered while you were away it was not for my sin but my salvation think dear if you and i had never met again after my marriage and if i had gone on living with the man they had married me to my soul would have shrivelled up and died that is what happens to the souls of so many poor women who are fettered for life to coarse and degrading husbands but my soul has not died dearest and it is not dying whatever my poor body may do so i thank my gracious god for the sweet and pure and noble love that has kept it alive all the same my darling to marry again is another matter i took my vow before the altar dear and however ignorantly i took it or under whatever persuasion or constraint it is registered in heaven it cannot be for nothing dear that our blessed lord made that stern commandment the church may have given a wrong interpretation to ityou say it has and i am too ignorant to answer you even if i wished to which i dont but i am sure my lord foresaw all such mistakes and all the hardships that would come to many poor women perhaps some men too as well as the wreck the world might fall to for want of this unyielding stay when he issued his divine and irrevocable law that never under any circumstances should marriage be broken oh i am sure of it dear quite sure and before his unsearchable wisdom i bow my head although my heart is torn yet think darling how light is the burden that is laid upon us marriage vows are for this world only the marriage law of the church which lasts as long as life does not go on one moment longer the instant death sets my body free my soul may fly to where it belongs if i were going to live ten twenty thirty years this might be cold comfort but i am not then why should we be sorry you cannot be mine in this life and i cannot be yours so death comes in its mercy and majesty to unite us our love will go far beyond life and the moment the barrier of death is passed our union will begin and once it begins it will never end so death is not really a separator but a great uniter dont you see that dearest one moment of partinghardly a moment perhapsand then we shall be together through all eternity how wonderful how glorious how triumphant do you believe in individual immortality dear i do i believe that in the other life i shall meet and know my dear ones who are in heaven more than that i believe that the instant i pass from this life i shall live with my dear ones who are still on earth that is why i am willing to gobecause i am sure that the moment i draw my last breath i shall be standing by your side so dont let there be any weeping for me dear nothing is here for tears nothing but well and fair always rememberlove is immortal i will not say that i could not have wished to live a little longerif things had been otherwise with both of us i should like to live to see your book published and your work finished i know it will be some day and baby grow up to be a good girl and a beautiful one too for thats something isnt it and i should like to live a little longer for another reason a womans reasonsimply to be loved and to be told that i am loved for though a woman may know that she likes to hear it said and is never tired of hearing it but things have gone against us and it is almost sinfully ungrateful to regret anything when we have so many reasons for thankfulness and then about girliei used to think it would be terrible for me i mean to die before she could be old enough to have any clear memory of her mother such as i have of mine to cherish and loveonly the cold blank unfilled by a face which must be all that remains to most of those whose parents passed away while they were children but i am not afraid of that now because i know that in the future when our little girl asks about her mother you will describe me to her as you saw and remember meand that will be so much sweeter and lovelier than i ever was and it will be such a joy to think that my daughter sees me through her fathers eyes besides dearest there is something still more thrillingthe thought that girlie may grow to be like me like what you think me and that in the time to come she may startle you with undescribable resemblances in her voice or smile or laugh to her mother in heaven so that some day perhaps years and years hence when she is quite grown up she may touch your arm and you may turn quickly to look at her and lo it will seem to you as if mary herself your mary were by your side oh death where is thy sting oh grave where is thy victory go on with your great work dearest dont let it flag from any cold feeling that i am lost to you whenever you think of me say to yourself mary is here love is stronger than death many waters cannot quench it did you ever read browning i have been doing so during the last few days nurse she is quite a thoughtful woman having lent me his last volume when i read the last lines of what is said to have been his last poem i thought of you dear no at noonday in the bustle of mans worktime greet the unseen with a cheer bid him forward breast and back as either should be strive and thrive cry speedfight on fare ever there as here i am going to get up again today dear having something to do that is just a little importantto give you this manuscript book in which i have been writing every day or rather every night since you found me in london you will see what it is and why it was written so ill say no more on that subject i am afraid youll find it very egotistical being mainly about myself but i seem to have been looking into my soul all the time and when one does that and gets down to the deep places one meets all other souls there so perhaps i have been writing the lives of some women as well i once thought i could write a real book youll see what vain and foolish things i thought especially in my darker moments to show what a womans life may be when from any cause whatsoever she is denied the right god gave her of choosing the best for herself and her children there is a dream lying somewhere there dear which is stirring the slumber of mankind but the awakening will not be in my time certainly and perhaps not even in girlies and yet why not do you know dearest what it was in your wonderful book which thrilled me most it was your description of the giant iceberg you passed in the antarctic oceanfive hundred feet above the surface of the sea and therefore five hundred below it going steadily on and on against all the force of tempestuous wind and wave by power of the current underneath isnt the movement of all great things in life like that dearest so perhaps the world will be a better place for girlie than it has been for me and in any case i shall always feel that after all and in spite of everything it has been glorious to be a woman and now my own darling though we are only to be separated for a little while i want to write what i should like to say when i part from you tomorrow if i did not know that something in my throat would choke me i want to tell you again that i love you dearly that i have never loved anybody but you and that no marriage vows will keep me from loving you to the last i want to thank you for the great great love you have given me in returnall the way back from the time when i was a child oh my dearest may god for ever bless you for the sunshine you have brought into my lifeevery single day of it joyful days and sorrowful ones bright days and dark but all shining with the glory of your love never allow yourself to think that my life has not been a happy one looking back on it now i feel as if i have always had happiness and when i have not had happiness i have had something far higher and betterblessedness i have had such joy in my life dearjoy in the beauty of the world in the sunshine and the moon and the stars and the flowers and the songs of the birds and then apart from the divine love that is too holy to speak about in my religion in my beloved church in the love of my dear mother and my sweet child and above allabove all in you i feel a sense of sacred thankfulness to god for giving you to me and if it has not been for long in this life it will be for ever in the next so goodbye my dearest mejust for a little moment my dearest one goodbye mary oneill mary oneills last note written on the flyleaves of her missal august it is all over i have given him my book my secret is out he knows now i almost think he has known all along i had dressed even more carefully than usual with nurses irish lace about my neck as a collar and my black hair brushed smooth in my mothers manner and when i went downstairs by help of my usual kind crutch it is wonderful how strong i have been today everybody said how much better i was looking martin was there and he took me into the garden it was a little late in the afternoon but such a sweet and holy time with its clear air and quiet sunshineone of those evenings when nature is like a nun breathless with adoration although i had a feeling that it was to be our last time together we talked on the usual subjectsthe high bailiff the special license the boys of the scotia who were coming over for my wedding and how some of them would have to start out early in the morning but it didnt matter what we talked about it was only what we felt and i felt entirely happysitting there in my cushions with my white hand in his brown one looking into his clear eyes and ruddy face or up to the broad blue of the sky the red sun had begun to sink down behind the dark bar of st marys rock and the daisies in the garden to close their eyes and drop their heads in sleep when martin became afraid of the dew then we went back to the housei walking firmly by martins side though i held his arm so close the old doctor was in his consulting room nurse was in my room and we could hear christian ann upstairs putting baby into her darling white cotshe sleeps with grandma now the time came for me to go up also and then i gave him my book which i had been carrying under my arm telling him to read the last pages first although we had never spoken of my book before he seemed to know all about it and it flashed upon me at that moment that while i thought i had been playing a game of makebelieve with him he had been playing a game of makebelieve with me and had known everything from the first there was a certain relief in that yet there was a certain sting in it too what strange creatures we are we women for some moments we stood together at the bottom of the stairs holding each others hands i was dreadfully afraid he was going to break down as he did at castle raa and once again i had that thrilling swelling feeling the most heavenly emotion that comes into a womans life perhaps that i the weak one had to strengthen the strong it was only for a moment though and then he put his great gentle arms about me and kissed me on the lips and said silently but oh so eloquently goodbye darling and god bless you then i walked upstairs alone quite alone and when i reached the top he was still at the bottom looking up at me i smiled down to him then walked firmly into my room and up to my bed and then down all my strength gone in a moment i have had such a wonderful experience during the night it was like a dream and yet something more than a dream i dont want to make too much of itto say that it was a vision or any supernatural manifestation such as the blessed margaret mary speaks about perhaps it was only the result of memory operating on my past life my thoughts and desires but perhaps it was something higher and more spiritual and god for my comforting has permitted me to look for one moment behind the veil i thought it was tomorrowmy wedding day and the day of father dans thanksgiving celebrationand i was sitting by my french window which was wide open to look at the procession i seemed to see everythingfather dan in his surplice the fishermen in their clean ganzies the village people in their sunday clothes the rechabites the foresters and the oddfellows with their coloured badges and banners coming round the corner of the road and the mothers with babies too young to be left looking on from the bridge i thought the procession passed under my window and went on to the church which was soon crowded leaving numbers of people to kneel on the path in front as far down as the crumbling gate piers which lean towards each other their foundations having given way then i thought benediction began and when the congregation sang i sang also i heard myself singing mater purissima ora pro nobis down to this moment i thought i had been alone but now the reverend mother entered my room and she joined me i heard her deep rich voice under mine mater castissima ora pro nobis then i thought the ora ended and in the silence that followed it i heard christian arm talking to baby on the gravel path below i had closed my eyes yet i seemed to see them for i felt as if i were under some strange sweet anaesthetic which had taken away all pain but not all consciousness then i thought i saw martin come close under my window and lift baby up to me and say something about her i tried to answer him and could not but i smiled and then there was darkness in which i heard voices about me with somebody sobbing and father dan saying as he did on the morning my mother died dont call her back shes on her way to gods beautiful paradise after all her suffering after that the darkness became still deeper and the voices faded away and then gradually a great light came a beautiful marvellous celestial light such as martin describes when he speaks about the aurora and then i was on a broad white snowy plateau and martin was walking by my side how wonderful how joyful how eternally glorious it is am some of the boys will be on their way to my wedding though i have been often ashamed of letting them come i am glad now for his sake that i didnt try to keep them back with his comrades about him he will control himself and be strong such a peaceful morning there is just light enough to see st marys rock it is like a wavering ghost moving in the vapour on the face of the deep i can hear the faroff murmur of the sea it is like the humming in a big shell a bird is singing in the garden and the swallows are twittering in a nest under the thatch a mist is lying over the meadows and the tree tops seem to be floating between the earth and the sky how beautiful the world is very soon the mist will rise and the day will break and the sun will come again and there will be no more night end of the narrative of mary oneill memorandum of martin conrad my darling was right i had known all along but i had been hoping against hopethat the voyage would set her up and the air of the antarctic cure her then her cheerfulness never failed her and when she looked at me with her joyous eyes and when her soft hand slipped into mine i forgot all my fears so the blow fell on me as suddenly as if i had never expected it with a faint pathetic smile she gave me her book and i went back to my room at the inn and read it i read all night and far into the next dayall her dear story straight from her heart written out in her small delicate beautiful characters with scarcely an erasure no use saying what i thought or went through so many things i had never known before such love as i had never even dreamt of and could never repay her for now how my whole soul rebelled against the fate that had befallen my dear one if i have since come to share however reluctantly her sweet resignation to bow my head stubbornly where she bowed hers so meekly before the divine commandment and to see that marriage true marriage is the rock on which god builds his world it was not then that i thought anything about that i only thought with bitter hatred of the accursed hypocrisies of civilised society which in the names of law and religion had been crushing the life out of the sweetest and purest woman on earth merely because she wished to be mistress of herself and sovereign of her soul what did i care about the future of the world or the movement of divine truths or the new relations of man and woman in the good time that was to come or the tremendous problems of lost and straying womanhood or the sufferings of neglected children or the tragedies of the whole girlhood of the world what did i care about anything but my poor martyred darling the woman god gave me was mine and i could not give her upnot now after all she had gone through sometime in the afternoon heaven knows when i went back to sunny lodge the house was very quiet baby was babbling on the hearthrug my mother was silent and trying not to let me see her swollen eyes my dear one was sleeping had been sleeping all day long the sleep of an angel strange and frightening fact nobody being able to remember that she had ever been seen to sleep before after a while sick and cold at heart i went down to the shore where we had played as children the boat we sailed in was moored on the beach the tide was far out making a noise on the teeth of the rock which stood out against the reddening sky stern grand gloomy old tommy the mate came to the door of his cabin i went into the quiet smoky place with its earthen floor and sat in a dull torpor by the hearth under the sooty laff and rafters the old man did not say a word to me he put some turf on the fire and then sat on a threelegged stool at the other side of the hearthplace once he got up and gave me a basin of buttermilk then stirred the peats and sat down again without speaking towards evening when the rising sea was growing louder i got up to go the old man followed me to the door and there laying his hand on my arm he said shes been beating to windward all her life boy but mind ye thisshes fetching the harbour all right at last going up the road i heard a band of music in the distance and saw a procession of people coming down it was father dans celebration of thanksgiving to god for what was left of daniel oneills illgotten wealth sent back from rome for the poor being in no humour to thank god for anything i got over a sod hedge and crossed a field until i came to a back gate to our garden near to william rufuss burial placestone overgrown with moss inscription almost obliterated on the path i met my mother with baby toddling and tumbling by her side how is she now i asked she was awakehad been awake these two hours but in a strange kind of wakefulness her big angel eyes open and shining like stars as if smiling at someone whom nobody else could see and her lips moving as if speaking some words which nobody else could hear what art thou saying boght millish my mother had asked and after a moment in which she seemed to listen in rapture my darling had answered hush i am speaking to mammatelling her i am leaving isabel with christian ann and she is saying she is very glad we walked round to the front of the house until we came close under the window of mary oneills little room which was wide open the evening was so still that we could hear the congregation singing in the church and on the path in front of it presently somebody began to sing in the room above it was my darlingin her clear sweet silvery voice which i have never heard the like of in this world and never shall again after a moment another voice joined hersa deep voice the reverend mothers all else was quiet not a sound on earth or in the air a hush had fallen on the sea itself which seemed to be listening for my precious darlings last breath the sun was going down very red in its setting and the sky was full of glory when the singing came to an end baby was babbling in my mothers armsboloolalamama i took her and held her up to the open window crying look darling heres girlie there was no answer but after another moment the reverend mother came to the window her pale face was even paler than usual and her lips trembled she did not speak but she made the sign of the cross and by that i knew out of the depths i cry unto thee o lord lord hear my cry the author to the reader i saw him off at tilbury when he left england on his last expedition already he was his own man once more after the blinding stunning effect of the great event there had been a quick recuperation his spirit had risen to a wonderful strength and even a certain cheerfulness i did not find it hard to read the secret of this change it was not merely that time the great assuager had begun to do its work with him but that he had brought himself to accept without qualm or question mary oneills beautiful belief the old old belief in the immortality of personal love and was firmly convinced that freed from the imprisonment of the flesh she was with him every day and hour and that as long as he lived she always would be there was nothing vague nothing fantastic nothing mawkish nothing unmanly about this belief but only the simple faith of a steady soul and a perfectly clear brain it was good to see how it braced a strong man for life to face death in that way as for his work i found him quite hopeful his mission apart i thought he was looking forward to his third trip to the antarctic in expectation of the silence and solitude of that strengthening region as i watched the big liner that was taking him away disappear down the thames i had no more doubt that he would get down to the south pole and finish his task there than that the sun would rise the following morning whatever happens this time he will march breast forward martin conrad to the author wirelessantarctic continent via macquarie island and radio hobart arrived safe all well weather excellent blue sky warm not a breath of wind sun never going down constellations revolving without dipping feel as if we can see the movement of the world start south tomorrow calmer than i have ever been since she was taken from me but she was right she is here love is stronger than death many waters cannot quench it the end
