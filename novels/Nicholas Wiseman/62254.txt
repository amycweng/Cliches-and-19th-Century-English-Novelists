electrotyped by smith mcdougal new york preface to the illustrated edition the late cardinal wisemans admirable story fabiola has been read for the last thirty years in many lands and many tongues at this late day to say that it has been everywhere productive of inestimable good to christian souls would be the utterance of the merest truism but while its salutary influence has been felt far and wide it seems to have been fraught with special blessings most peculiarly adapted to the religious circumstances of our own land where thirty years ago when the work made its first appearance among us the condition of the church was not altogether dissimilar from that of the early church in pagan rome at the date of the story although the sun of divine faith had long before begun to warm with its vivifying and sanctifying rays the virgin soil of this western land of ours yet it had hardly risen above the horizon when dark and threatening clouds of persecution seemed about to obscure its light promising instead of a bright and cheerful day for the church a night of disappointment and suffering the good already accomplished by the early missionaries seemed imperilled by the coming storm and the work at that time in progress was meeting with fierce and even cruel opposition then it was that men asked themselves was it necessary that the founding of christs church in america should undergo a process similar to that which it had undergone in pagan rome although the catholics of america thirty years ago had little cause to fear the torch or the axe of the executioner though they could hardly hope for the blood stained crown of martyrdom in the public arena though they heard not the cry to the wild beasts with the christians yet they dwelt amid much religious privation underwent keen mental persecution and were made the victims of rampant bigotry furious political partisanship and humiliating social ostracism like the heroic characters so graphically portrayed by the cardinals graceful pen in the history of fabiola the catholics in america professed a faith imperfectly known in the land or known only to be despised and hated by the great majority of the american people just as that self same faith had been misrepresented detested and persecuted in the early ages by the misguided citizens of pagan rome in such times catholics sorely needed the help of bright examples of courage zeal and perseverance to beckon them on in the steady pursuit of their arduous and sometimes perilous task of preserving practising and declaring their faith such examples they found in cardinal wisemans beautiful work models of fidelity to faith heroes and heroines who in their patient lives and cruel deaths gave testimony unto christ jesus producing such fruits of virtue and showing forth so beautifully and so powerfully the effects of the true faith that that faith itself finally triumphed over all opposition and verifying the words of the apostle became a victory that conquered the world haec est victoria qu vincit mundum fides nostra this is the victory which overcometh the world our faith by the study of these models as presented in the story of fabiola the struggling catholics of this country learned how to possess their souls in patience while admiring the heroic fortitude of those martyrs though not presuming always to imitate their extraordinary ways our predecessors in the faith felt themselves encouraged to follow in their footsteps bearing patiently all religious privations and adhering to their faith amid hatred and contempt and giving bold testimony of it before unbelieving men inspired by the example of these primitive christians the priests and people alike of the past generation were strengthened in the conviction that in their poor despised church at that time remarkable for its poverty and obscurity there dwelt the eternal truth brought down to earth from heaven by the son of the living god the truth which he had confirmed by miracles and sealed with his precious lifes blood the truth in whose defence millions of the holiest and greatest men sacrificed their very lives the truth in whose possession the noblest and most enlightened among the children of adam had found peace in life and consolation in death for this truth they were willing to die how opportune at that time was the appearance in our midst of a work from a master hand presenting to view in a most vivid and realistic light the trials and triumphs of those heroes in the church who raised the cross of christ bedewed with martyr blood upon the dome of the roman capitol like the cheering flambeau borne in the hands of the acolyte of the catacombs the story of fabiola served to brighten and cheer the arduous path of many a despised if not persecuted catholic amid the religious wilderness then to a great extent prevailing over our broad land but as the primitive church emerged from her hiding places so thank god has that same church in our own country bounded forth from obscurity and contempt into the broad light of day where she stands confessed in all her truth and beauty at once the envy and admiration of her recent opponents while to day protestantism is an enemy that no catholic need fear a new and more formidable foe confronts us in the shape of materialism the contest between truth and error is as fierce as ever though the tactics are changed we should arm ourselves for the battle against materialism as our fathers did against protestantism we can win no laurels in a war against protestantism for it has been subdued by those ahead of us in the ranks such laurels have been gathered by earlier and worthier hands than ours nor are there places for us by the side of the martyrs pancratius sebastian and other heroes of primitive christianity yet a great trust has descended to our hands and sacred obligations have devolved on the present generation of catholics there remains to us a great duty of defence and preservation and there lies open before us a grand and glorious pursuit to which the religious needs of the times loudly call us we live in an age of sordid materialism when it is of vital importance to turn the thoughts of all christians to the really heroic ages of the church and to the lives of men and women who have done honor to principle glorified god and benefited their fellow beings by their holy and self sacrificing lives as the story of fabiola taught our immediate predecessors in the faith to admire and imitate the virtues of the primitive christians so should we learn to cherish the names and memories of the devoted ones who amid hardships privations and contempt laid the solid foundations in this land of that stately and magnificent structure beneath whose hallowed roof it is our happy lot to dwell unmolested in peace and prosperity therefore we gladly welcome this first illustrated edition of cardinal wisemans fabiola viewed in its improved mechanical aspect it is emblematic of the wondrous development of our catholic literature and when contrasted with the simpler and humbler editions which we received thirty years ago seems like the stately cathedral that has taken the place of the lowly wooden chapel of that period its many beautiful engravings will bring more vividly before the reader the scenes of cruel persecution already graphically described and with its bright examples of constancy and self sacrifice serve to stimulate and fortify catholics of the present and future generations in their contest with worldliness materialism and we may say unmitigated paganism r b st roses rectory all saints day preface when the plan of the popular catholic library was formed the author of the following little work was consulted upon it he not only approved of the design but ventured to suggest among others a series of tales illustrative of the condition of the church in different periods of her past existence one for instance might be called the church of the catacombs a second the church of the basilicas each comprising three hundred years a third would be on the church of the cloister and then perhaps a fourth might be added called the church of the schools in proposing this sketch he added perhaps the reader will find indiscreetly that he felt half inclined to undertake the first by way of illustrating the proposed plan he was taken at his word and urged strongly to begin the work after some reflection he consented but with an understanding that it was not to be an occupation but only the recreation of leisure hours with this condition the work was commenced early in this year and it has been carried on entirely on that principle it has therefore been written at all sorts of times and in all sorts of places early and late when no duty urged in scraps and fragments of time when the body was too fatigued or the mind too worn for heavier occupation in the road side inn in the halt of travel in strange houses in every variety of situation and circumstances sometimes trying ones it has thus been composed bit by bit in portions varying from ten lines to half a dozen pages at most and generally with few books or resources at hand but once begun it has proved what it was taken for a recreation and often a solace and a sedative from the memories it has revived the associations it has renewed the scattered and broken remnants of old studies and early readings which it has combined and by the familiarity which it has cherished with better times and better things than surround us in our age why need the reader be told all this for two reasons first this method of composition may possibly be reflected on the work and he may find it patchy and ill assorted or not well connected in its parts if so this account will explain the cause secondly he will thus be led not to expect a treatise or a learned work even upon ecclesiastical antiquities nothing would have been easier than to cast an air of erudition over this little book and fill half of each page with notes and references but this was never the writers idea his desire was rather to make his reader familiar with the usages habits condition ideas feeling and spirit of the early ages of christianity this required a certain acquaintance with places and objects connected with the period and some familiarity more habitual than learned with the records of the time for instance such writings as the acts of primitive martyrs should have been frequently read so as to leave impressions on the authors mind rather than have been examined scientifically and critically for mere antiquarian purposes and so such places or monuments as have to be explained should seem to stand before the eye of the describer from frequently and almost casually seeing them rather than have to be drawn from books another source of instruction has been freely used any one acquainted with the roman breviary must have observed that in the offices of certain saints a peculiar style prevails which presents the holy persons commemorated in a distinct and characteristic form this is not the result so much of any continuous narrative as of expressions put into their mouths or brief descriptions of events in their lives repeated often again and again in antiphons responsoria to lessons and even versicles till they put before us an individuality a portrait clear and definite of singular excellence to this class belong the offices of ss agnes agatha ccilia and lucia and those of st clement and st martin each of these saints stands out before our minds with distinct features almost as if we had seen and known them if for instance we take the first that we have named we clearly draw out the following circumstances she is evidently pursued by some heathen admirer whose suit for her hand she repeatedly rejects sometimes she tells him that he is forestalled by another to whom she is betrothed sometimes she describes this object of her choice under various images representing him even as the object of homage to sun and moon on another occasion she describes the rich gifts or the beautiful garlands with which he has adorned her and the chaste caresses by which he has endeared himself to her then at last as if more importunately pressed she rejects the love of perishable man the food of death and triumphantly proclaims herself the spouse of christ threats are used but she declares herself under the protection of an angel who will shield her this history is as plainly written by the fragments of her office as a word is by scattered letters brought and joined together but throughout one discerns another peculiarity and a truly beautiful one in her character it is clearly represented to us that the saint had ever before her the unseen object of her love saw him heard him felt him and entertained and had returned a real affection such as hearts on earth have for one another she seems to walk in perpetual vision almost in ecstatic fruition of her spouses presence he has actually put a ring upon her finger has transferred the blood from his own cheek to hers has crowned her with budding roses her eye is really upon him with unerring gaze and returned looks of gracious love what writer that introduced the person would venture to alter the character who would presume to attempt one at variance with it or who would hope to draw a portrait more life like and more exquisite than the church has done for putting aside all inquiry as to the genuineness of the acts by which these passages are suggested and still more waving the question whether the hard critical spirit of a former age too lightly rejected such ecclesiastical documents as guranger thinks it is clear that the church in her office intends to place before us a certain type of high virtue embodied in the character of that saint the writer of the following pages considered himself therefore bound to adhere to this view whether these objects have been attained it is for the reader to judge at any rate even looking at the amount of information to be expected from a work in this form and one intended for general reading a comparison between the subjects introduced either formally or casually and those given in any elementary work such as fleurys manners of the christians which embraces several centuries more will show that as much positive knowledge on the practices and belief of that early period is here imparted as it is usual to communicate in a more didactic form at the same time the reader must remember that this book is not historical it takes in but a period of a few months extended in some concluding chapters it consists rather of a series of pictures than of a narrative of events occurrences therefore of different epochs and different countries have been condensed into a small space chronology has been sacrificed to this purpose the date of dioclesians edict has been anticipated by two months the martyrdom of st agnes by a year the period of st sebastian though uncertain has been brought down later all that relates to christian topography has been kept as accurate as possible a martyrdom has been transferred from imola to fondi illustration the bark of peter as found in the catacombs it was necessary to introduce some view of the morals and opinions of the pagan world as a contrast to those of christians but their worst aspect has been carefully suppressed as nothing could be admitted here which the most sensitive catholic eye would shrink from contemplating it is indeed earnestly desired that this little work written solely for recreation be read also as a relaxation from graver pursuits but that at the same time the reader may rise from its perusal with a feeling that his time has not been lost nor his mind occupied with frivolous ideas rather let it be hoped that some admiration and love may be inspired by it of those primitive times which an over excited interest in later and more brilliant epochs of the church is too apt to diminish or obscure contents page preface to the illustrated edition iii authors preface vii list of

interior of a roman dwelling at pompeii part first peace chapter i the christian house it is on an afternoon in september of the year that we invite our reader to accompany us through the streets of rome the sun has declined and is about two hours from his setting the day is cloudless and its heat has cooled so that multitudes are issuing from their houses and making their way towards csars gardens on one side or sallusts on the other to enjoy their evening walk and learn the news of the day illustration plan of pansas house at pompeii but the part of the city to which we wish to conduct our friendly reader is that known by the name of the campus martius it comprised the flat alluvial plain between the seven hills of older rome and the tiber before the close of the republican period this field once left bare for the athletic and warlike exercises of the people had begun to be encroached upon by public buildings pompey had erected in it his theatre soon after agrippa raised the pantheon and its adjoining baths but gradually it became occupied by private dwellings while the hills in the early empire the aristocratic portion of the city were seized upon for greater edifices thus the palatine after neros fire became almost too small for the imperial residence and its adjoining circus maximus the esquiline was usurped by tituss baths built on the ruins of the golden house the aventine by caracallas and at the period of which we write the emperor dioclesian was covering the space sufficient for many lordly dwellings by the erection of his therm on the quirinal not far from sallusts garden just alluded to the particular spot in the campus martius to which we will direct our steps is one whose situation is so definite that we can accurately describe it to any one acquainted with the topography of ancient or modern rome in republican times there was a large square space in the campus martius surrounded by boarding and divided into pens in which the comitia or meetings of the tribes of the people were held for giving their votes this was called the septa or ovile from its resemblance to a sheepfold augustus carried out a plan described by cicero in a letter to atticus of transforming this homely contrivance into a magnificent and solid structure the septa julia as it was thenceforth called was a splendid portico of by feet supported by columns and adorned with paintings its ruins are clearly traceable and it occupied the space now covered by the doria and verospi palaces running thus along the present corso the roman college the church of st ignatius and the oratory of the caravita the house to which we invite our reader is exactly opposite and on the east side of this edifice including in its area the present church of st marcellus whence it extended back towards the foot of the quirinal hill it is thus found to cover as noble roman houses did a considerable extent of ground from the outside it presents but a blank and dead appearance the walls are plain without architectural ornament not high and scarcely broken by windows in the middle of one side of this quadrangle is a door in antis that is merely relieved by a tympanum or triangular cornice resting on two half columns using our privilege as artists of fiction of invisible ubiquity we will enter in with our friend or shadow as he would have been anciently called passing through the porch on the pavement of which we read with pleasure in mosaic the greeting salve or welcome we find ourselves in the atrium or first court of the house surrounded by a portico or colonnade illustration door of pansas house with the greeting salve or welcome in the centre of the marble pavement a softly warbling jet of pure water brought by the claudian aqueduct from the tusculan hills springs into the air now higher now lower and falls into an elevated basin of red marble over the sides of which it flows in downy waves and before reaching its lower and wider recipient scatters a gentle shower on the rare and brilliant flowers placed in elegant vases around under the portico we see furniture disposed of a rich and sometimes rare character couches inlaid with ivory and even silver tables of oriental woods bearing candelabra lamps and other household implements of bronze or silver delicately chased busts vases tripods and objects of mere art on the walls are paintings evidently of a former period still however retaining all their brightness of color and freshness of execution these are separated by niches with statues representing indeed like the pictures mythological or historical subjects but we cannot help observing that nothing meets the eye which could offend the most delicate mind here and there an empty niche or a covered painting proves that this is not the result of accident illustration atrium of a pompeian house illustration atrium of a house in pompeii as outside the columns the coving roof leaves a large square opening in its centre called the impluvium there is drawn across it a curtain or veil of dark canvas which keeps out the sun and rain an artificial twilight therefore alone enables us to see all that we have described but it gives greater effect to what is beyond through an arch opposite to the one whereby we have entered we catch a glimpse of an inner and still richer court paved with variegated marbles and adorned with bright gilding the veil of the opening above which however here is closed with thick glass or talc lapis specularis has been partly withdrawn and admits a bright but softened ray from the evening sun on to the place where we see for the first time that we are in no enchanted hall but in an inhabited house beside a table just outside the columns of phrygian marble sits a matron not beyond the middle of life whose features noble yet mild show traces of having passed through sorrow at some earlier period but a powerful influence has subdued the recollection of it or blended it with a sweeter thought and the two always come together and have long dwelt united in her heart the simplicity of her appearance strangely contrasts with the richness of all around her her hair streaked with silver is left uncovered and unconcealed by any artifice her robes are of the plainest color and texture without embroidery except the purple ribbon sewed on and called the segmentum which denotes the state of widowhood and not a jewel or precious ornament of which the roman ladies were so lavish is to be seen upon her person the only thing approaching to this is a slight gold cord or chain round her neck from which apparently hangs some object carefully concealed within the upper hem of her dress at the time that we discover her she is busily engaged over a piece of work which evidently has no personal use upon a long rich strip of gold cloth she is embroidering with still richer gold thread and occasionally she has recourse to one or another of several elegant caskets upon the table from which she takes out a pearl or a gem set in gold and introduces it into the design it looks as if the precious ornaments of earlier days were being devoted to some higher purpose illustration clepsydra or water clock from a bas relief in the mattei palace rome but as time goes on some little uneasiness may be observed to come over her calm thoughts hitherto absorbed to all appearance in her work she now occasionally raises her eyes from it towards the entrance sometimes she listens for footsteps and seems disappointed she looks up towards the sun then perhaps turns her glance towards a clepsydra or water clock on a bracket near her but just as a feeling of more serious anxiety begins to make an impression on her countenance a cheerful rap strikes the house door and she bends forward with a radiant look to meet the welcome visitor illustration a portrait of christ from the catacomb of st pontianus chapter ii the martyrs boy it is a youth full of grace and sprightliness and candor that comes forward with light and buoyant steps across the atrium towards the inner hall and we shall hardly find time to sketch him before he reaches it he is about fourteen years old but tall for that age with elegance of form and manliness of bearing his bare neck and limbs are well developed by healthy exercise his features display an open and warm heart while his lofty forehead round which his brown hair naturally curls beams with a bright intelligence he wears the usual youths garment the short prtexta reaching below the knee and a golden bulla or hollow spheroid of gold suspended round his neck a bundle of papers and vellum rolls fastened together and carried by an old servant behind him shows us that he is just returning home from school while we have been thus noting him he has received his mothers embrace and has sat himself low by her feet she gazes upon him for some time in silence as if to discover in his countenance the cause of his unusual delay for he is an hour late in his return but he meets her glance with so frank a look and with such a smile of innocence that every cloud of doubt is in a moment dispelled and she addresses him as follows what has detained you to day my dearest boy no accident i trust has happened to you on the way oh none i assure you sweetest mother on the contrary all has been delightful so much so that i can scarcely venture to tell you a look of smiling expostulation drew from the open hearted boy a delicious laugh as he continued well i suppose i must you know i am never happy and cannot sleep if i have failed to tell you all the bad and the good of the day about myself the mother smiled again wondering what the bad was i was reading the other day that the scythians each evening cast into an urn a white or a black stone according as the day had been happy or unhappy if i had to do so it would serve to mark in white or black the days on which i have or have not an opportunity of relating to you all that i have done but to day for the first time i have a doubt a fear of conscience whether i ought to tell you all did the mothers heart flutter more than usual as from a first anxiety or was there a softer solicitude dimming her eye that the youth should seize her hand and put it tenderly to his lips while he thus replied fear nothing mother most beloved your son has done nothing that may give you pain only say do you wish to hear all that has befallen me to day or only the cause of my late return home tell me all dear pancratius she answered nothing that concerns you can be indifferent to me well then he began this last day of my frequenting school appears to me to have been singularly blessed and yet full of strange occurrences first i was crowned as the successful competitor in a declamation which our good master cassianus set us for our work during the morning hours and this led as you will hear to some singular discoveries the subject was that the real philosopher should be ever ready to die for truth i never heard anything so cold or insipid i hope it is not wrong to say so as the compositions read by my companions it was not their fault poor fellows what truth can they possess and what inducements can they have to die for any of their vain opinions but to a christian what charming suggestions such a theme naturally makes and so i felt it my heart glowed and all my thoughts seemed to burn as i wrote my essay full of the lessons you have taught me and of the domestic examples that are before me the son of a martyr could not feel otherwise but when my turn came to read my declamation i found that my feelings had nearly fatally betrayed me in the warmth of my recitation the word christian escaped my lips instead of philosopher and faith instead of truth at the first mistake i saw cassianus start at the second i saw a tear glisten in his eye as bending affectionately towards me he said in a whisper beware my child there are sharp ears listening what then interrupted the mother is cassianus a christian i chose his school for you because it was in the highest repute for learning and for morality and now indeed i thank god that i did so but in these days of danger and apprehension we are obliged to live as strangers in our own land scarcely knowing the faces of our brethren certainly had cassianus proclaimed his faith his school would soon have been deserted but go on my dear boy were his apprehensions well grounded i fear so for while the great body of my school fellows not noticing these slips vehemently applauded my hearty declamation i saw the dark eyes of corvinus bent scowlingly upon me as he bit his lip in manifest anger and who is he my child that was so displeased and wherefore he is the oldest and strongest but unfortunately the dullest boy in the school but this you know is not his fault only i know not why he seems ever to have had an ill will and grudge against me the cause of which i cannot understand did he say aught to you or do yes and was the cause of my delay for when we went forth from school into the field by the river he addressed me insultingly in the presence of our companions and said come pancratius this i understand is the last time we meet here he laid a particular emphasis on the word but i have a long score to demand payment of from you you have loved to show your superiority in school over me and others older and better than yourself i saw your supercilious looks at me as you spouted your high flown declamation to day ay and i caught expressions in it which you may live to rue and that very soon for my father you well know is prefect of the city the mother slightly started and something is preparing which may nearly concern you before you leave us i must have my revenge if you are worthy of your name and it be not an empty word let us fairly contend in more manly strife than that of the style and tables wrestle with me or try the cestus against me i burn to humble you as you deserve before these witnesses of your insolent triumphs the anxious mother bent eagerly forward as she listened and scarcely breathed and what she exclaimed did you answer my dear son i told him gently that he was quite mistaken for never had i consciously done anything that could give pain to him or any of my school fellows nor did i ever dream of claiming superiority over them and as to what you propose i added you know corvinus that i have always refused to indulge in personal combats which beginning in a cool trial of skill end in an angry strife hatred and wish for revenge how much less could i think of entering on them now when you avow that you are anxious to begin them with those evil feelings which are usually their bad end our school mates had now formed a circle round us and i clearly saw that they were all against me for they had hoped to enjoy some of the delights of their cruel games i therefore cheerfully added and now my comrades good bye and may all happiness attend you i part from you as i have lived with you in peace not so replied corvinus now purple in the face with fury but the boys countenance became crimsoned his voice quivered his body trembled and half choked he sobbed out i cannot go on i dare not tell the rest i entreat you for gods sake and for the love you bear your fathers memory said the mother placing her hand upon her sons head conceal nothing from me i shall never again have rest if you tell me not all what further said or did corvinus the boy recovered himself by a moments pause and a silent prayer and then proceeded not so exclaimed corvinus not so do you depart cowardly worshipper of an asss head you have concealed your abode from us but i will find you out till then bear this token of my determined purpose to be revenged so saying he dealt me a furious blow upon the face which made me reel and stagger while a shout of savage delight broke forth from the boys around us he burst into tears which relieved him and then went on oh how i felt my blood boil at that moment how my heart seemed bursting within me and a voice appeared to whisper in my ear scornfully the name of coward it surely was an evil spirit i felt that i was strong enough my rising anger made me so to seize my unjust assailant by the throat and cast him gasping on the ground i heard already the shout of applause that would have hailed my victory and turned the tables against him it was the hardest struggle of my life never were flesh and blood so strong within me o god may they never be again so tremendously powerful and what did you do then my darling boy gasped forth the trembling matron he replied my good angel conquered the demon at my side i thought of my blessed lord in the house of caiphas surrounded by scoffing enemies and struck ignominiously on the cheek yet meek and forgiving could i wish to be otherwise i stretched forth my hand to corvinus and said may god forgive you as i freely and fully do and may he bless you abundantly cassianus came up at that moment having seen all from a distance and the youthful crowd quickly dispersed i entreated him by our common faith now acknowledged between us not to pursue corvinus for what he had done and i obtained his promise and now sweet mother murmured the boy in soft gentle accents into his parents bosom do you not think i may call this a happy day chapter iii the dedication while the foregoing conversation was held the day had fast declined an aged female servant now entered unnoticed and lighted the lamps placed on marble and bronze candelabra and quietly retired a bright light beamed upon the unconscious group of mother and son as they remained silent after the holy matron lucina had answered pancratiuss last question only by kissing his glowing brow it was not merely a maternal emotion that was agitating her bosom it was not even the happy feeling of a mother who having trained her child to certain high and difficult principles sees them put to the hardest test and nobly stand it neither was it the joy of having for her son one in her estimation so heroically virtuous at such an age for surely with much greater justice than the mother of the gracchi showed her boys to the astonished matrons of republican rome as her only jewels could that christian mother have boasted to the church of the son she had brought up but to her this was an hour of still deeper or shall we say sublimer feeling it was a period looked forward to anxiously for years a moment prayed for with all the fervor of a mothers supplication many a pious parent has devoted her infant son from the cradle to the holiest and noblest state illustration ordination in the early ages of the church that earth possesses has prayed and longed to see him grow up to be first a spotless levite and then a holy priest at the altar and has watched eagerly each growing inclination and tried gently to bend the tender thought towards the sanctuary of the lord of hosts and if this was an only child as samuel was to anna that dedication of all that is dear to her keenest affection may justly be considered as an act of maternal heroism what then must be said of ancient matrons felicitas symphorosa or the unnamed mother of the maccabees who gave up or offered their children not one but many yea all to be victims whole burnt rather than priests to god it was some such thought as this which filled the heart of lucina in that hour while with closed eyes she raised it high to heaven and prayed for strength she felt as though called to make a generous sacrifice of what was dearest to her on earth and though she had long foreseen it and desired it it was not without a maternal throe that its merit could be gained and what was passing in that boys mind as he too remained silent and abstracted not any thought of a high destiny awaiting him no vision of a venerable basilica eagerly visited years later by the sacred antiquary and the devout pilgrim and giving his name which it shall bear to the neighboring gate of rome no anticipation of a church in his honor to rise in faithful ages on the banks of the distant thames which even after desecration should be loved and eagerly sought as their last resting place by hearts faithful still to his dear rome no forethought of a silver canopy or ciborium weighing lbs to be placed over the porphyry urn that should contain his ashes by pope honorius i no idea that his name would be enrolled in every martyrology his picture crowned with rays hung over many altars as the boy martyr of the early church he was only the simple hearted christian youth who looked upon it as a matter of course that he must always obey gods law and his gospel and only felt happy that he had that day performed his duty when it came under circumstances of more than usual trial there was no pride no self admiration in the reflection otherwise there would have been no heroism in his act when he raised again his eyes after his calm reverie of peaceful thoughts in the new light which brightly filled the hall they met his mothers countenance gazing anew upon him radiant with a majesty and tenderness such as he never recollected to have seen before it was a look almost of inspiration her face was as that of a vision her eyes what he would have imagined an angels to be silently and almost unknowingly he had changed his position and was kneeling before her and well he might for was she not to him as a guardian spirit who had shielded him ever from evil or might he not well see in her the living saint whose virtues had been his model from childhood lucina broke the silence in a tone full of grave emotion the time is at length come my dear child she said which has long been the subject of my earnest prayer which i have yearned for in the exuberance of maternal love eagerly have i watched in thee the opening germ of each christian virtue and thanked god as it appeared i have noted thy docility thy gentleness thy diligence thy piety and thy love of god and man i have seen with joy thy lively faith and thy indifference to worldly things and thy tenderness to the poor but i have been waiting with anxiety for the hour which should decisively show me whether thou wouldst be content with the poor legacy of thy mothers weakly virtue or art the true inheritor of thy martyred fathers nobler gifts that hour thank god has come to day what have i done then that should thus have changed or raised thy opinion of me asked pancratius listen to me my son this day which was to be the last of thy school education methinks that our merciful lord has been pleased to give thee a lesson worth it all and to prove that thou hast put off the things of a child and must be treated henceforth as a man for thou canst think and speak yea and act as one how dost thou mean dear mother what thou hast told me of thy declamation this morning she replied proves to me how full thy heart must have been of noble and generous thoughts thou art too sincere and honest to have written and fervently expressed that it was a glorious duty to die for the faith if thou hadst not believed it and felt it and truly i do believe and feel it interrupted the boy what greater happiness can a christian desire on earth yes my child thou sayest most truly continued lucina but i should not have been satisfied with words what followed afterwards has proved to me that thou canst bear intrepidly and patiently not merely pain but what i know it must have been harder for thy young patrician blood to stand the stinging ignominy of a disgraceful blow and the scornful words and glances of an unpitying multitude nay more thou hast proved thyself strong enough to forgive and to pray for thine enemy this day thou hast trodden the higher paths of the mountain with the cross upon thy shoulders one step more and thou wilt plant it on its summit thou hast proved thyself the genuine son of the martyr quintinus dost thou wish to be like him mother mother dearest sweetest mother broke out the panting youth could i be his genuine son and not wish to resemble him though i never enjoyed the happiness of knowing him has not his image been ever before my mind has he not been the very pride of my thoughts when each year the solemn commemoration has been made of him as of one of the white robed army that surrounds the lamb in whose blood he washed his garments how have my heart and my flesh exulted in his glory and how have i prayed to him in the warmth of filial piety that he would obtain for me not fame not distinction not wealth not earthly joy but what he valued more than all these nay that the only thing which he has left on earth may be applied as i know he now considers it would most usefully and most nobly be what is that my son it is his blood replied the youth which yet remains flowing in my veins and in these only i know he must wish that it too like what he held in his own may be poured out in love of his redeemer and in testimony of his faith enough enough my child exclaimed the mother thrilling with a holy emotion take from thy neck the badge of childhood i have a better token to give thee he obeyed and put away the golden bulla thou hast inherited from thy father spoke the mother with still deeper solemnity of tone a noble name a high station ample riches every worldly advantage but there is one treasure which i have reserved for thee from his inheritance till thou shouldst prove thyself worthy of it i have concealed it from thee till now though i valued it more than gold and jewels it is now time that i make it over to thee with trembling hands she drew from her neck the golden chain which hung round it and for the first time her son saw that it supported a small bag or purse richly embroidered and set with gems she opened it and drew from it a sponge dry indeed but deeply stained illustration with trembling hands she drew from her neck the golden chain this too is thy fathers blood pancratius she said with faltering voice and streaming eyes i gathered it myself from his death wound as disguised i stood by his side and saw him die from the wounds he had received for christ she gazed upon it fondly and kissed it fervently and her gushing tears fell on it and moistened it once more and thus liquefied again its color glowed bright and warm as if it had only just left the martyrs heart illustration a piece of a gold glass found in the catacombs the holy matron put it to her sons quivering lips and they were empurpled with its sanctifying touch he venerated the sacred relic with the deepest emotions of a christian and a son and felt as if his fathers spirit had descended into him and stirred to its depths the full vessel of his heart that its waters might be ready freely to flow the whole family thus seemed to him once more united lucina replaced her treasure in its shrine and hung it round the neck of her son saying when next it is moistened may it be from a nobler stream than that which gushes from a weak womans eyes but heaven thought not so and the future combatant was anointed and the future martyr was consecrated by the blood of his father mingled with his mothers tears chapter iv the heathen household while the scenes described in the three last chapters were taking place a very different one presented itself in another house situated in the valley between the quirinal and esquiline hills it was that of fabius a man of the equestrian order whose family by farming the revenues of asiatic provinces had amassed immense wealth his house was larger and more splendid than the one we have already visited it contained a third large peristyle or court surrounded by immense apartments and besides possessing many treasures of european art it abounded with the rarest productions of the east carpets from persia were laid on the ground silks from china many colored stuffs from babylon and gold embroidery from india and phrygia covered the furniture while curious works in ivory and in metals scattered about were attributed to the inhabitants of islands beyond the indian ocean of monstrous form and fabulous descent fabius himself the owner of all this treasure and of large estates was a true specimen of an easy going roman who was determined thoroughly to enjoy this life in fact he never dreamt of any other believing in nothing yet worshipping as a matter of course on all proper occasions whatever deity happened to have its turn he passed for a man as good as his neighbors and no one had a right to exact more the greater part of his day was passed at one or other of the great baths which besides the purposes implied in their name comprised in their many adjuncts the equivalents of clubs reading rooms gambling houses tennis courts and gymnasiums there he took his bath gossiped read and whiled away his hours or sauntered for a time into the forum to hear some orator speaking or some advocate pleading or into one of the many public gardens whither the fashionable world of rome repaired he returned home to an elegant supper not later than our dinner where he had daily guests either previously invited or picked up during the day among the many parasites on the look out for good fare at home he was a kind and indulgent master his house was well kept for him by an abundance of slaves and as trouble was what most he dreaded so long as every thing was comfortable handsome and well served about him he let things go on quietly under the direction of his freedmen it is not however so much to him that we wish to introduce our reader as to another inmate of his house the sharer of its splendid luxury and the sole heiress of his wealth this is his daughter who according to roman usage bears the fathers name softened however into the diminutive fabiola as we have done before we will conduct the reader at once into her apartment a marble staircase leads to it from the second court over the sides of which extends a suite of rooms opening upon a terrace refreshed and adorned by a graceful fountain and covered with a profusion of the rarest exotic plants in these chambers is concentrated whatever is most exquisite and curious in native and foreign art a refined taste directing ample means and peculiar opportunities has evidently presided over the collection and arrangement of all around at this moment the hour of the evening repast is approaching and we discover the mistress of this dainty abode engaged in preparing herself to appear with becoming splendor illustration pompeian couch illustration table after a painting in herculaneum she is reclining on a couch of athenian workmanship inlaid with silver in a room of cyzicene form that is having glass windows to the ground and so opening on to the flowery terrace against the wall opposite to her hangs a mirror of polished silver sufficient to reflect a whole standing figure on a porphyry table beside it is a collection of the innumerable rare cosmetics and perfumes of which the roman ladies had become so fond and on which they lavished immense sums on another of indian sandal wood was a rich display of jewels and trinkets in their precious caskets from which to select for the days use illustration couch from herculaneum it is by no means our intention nor our gift to describe persons or features we wish more to deal with minds we will therefore content ourselves with saying that fabiola now at the age of twenty was not considered inferior in appearance to other ladies of her rank age and fortune and had many aspirants for her hand but she was a contrast to her father in temper and in character proud haughty imperious and irritable she ruled like an empress all that surrounded her with one or two exceptions and exacted humble homage from all that approached her an only child whose mother had died in giving her birth she had been nursed and brought up in indulgence by her careless good natured father she had been provided with the best masters had been adorned with every accomplishment and allowed to gratify every extravagant wish she had never known what it was to deny herself a desire having been left so much to herself she had read much and especially in profounder books she had thus become a complete philosopher of the refined that is the infidel and intellectual epicureanism which had been long fashionable in rome of christianity she knew nothing except that she understood it to be something very low material and vulgar she despised it in fact too much to think of inquiring into it and as to paganism with its gods its vices its fables and its idolatry she merely scorned it though outwardly she followed it in fact she believed in nothing beyond the present life and thought of nothing except its refined enjoyment but her very pride threw a shield over her virtue she loathed the wickedness of heathen society as she despised the frivolous youths who paid her jealously exacted attention for she found amusement in their follies she was considered cold and selfish but she was morally irreproachable illustration elaborate seat from herculaneum if at the beginning we seem to indulge in long descriptions we trust that our reader will believe that they are requisite to put him in possession of the state of material and social rome at the period of our narrative and will make this the more intelligible and should he be tempted to think that we describe things as over splendid and refined for an age of decline in arts and good taste we beg to remind him that the year we are supposed to visit rome is not as remote from the better periods of roman art for example that of the antonines as our age is from that of cellini raffaele or donatello yet in how many italian palaces are still preserved works by these great artists fully prized though no longer imitated so no doubt it was with the houses belonging to the old and wealthy families of rome we find then fabiola reclining on her couch holding in her left hand a silver mirror with a handle and in the other a strange instrument for so fair a hand it is a sharp pointed stiletto with a delicately carved ivory handle and a gold ring to hold it by this was the favorite weapon with which roman ladies punished their slaves or vented their passion on them upon suffering the least annoyance or when irritated by pettish anger three female slaves are now engaged about their mistress they belong to different races and have been purchased at high prices not merely on account of their appearance but for some rare accomplishment they are supposed to possess one is a black not of the degraded negro stock but from one of those races such as the abyssinians and numidians in whom the features are as regular as in the asiatic people she is supposed to have great skill in herbs and their cosmetic and healing properties perhaps also in more dangerous uses in compounding philtres charms and possibly poisons she is merely known by her national designation as afra a greek comes next selected for her taste in dress and for the elegance and purity of her accent she is therefore called graia the name which the third bears syra tells us that she comes from asia and she is distinguished for her exquisite embroidering and for her assiduous diligence she is quiet silent but completely engaged with the duties which now devolve upon her the other two are garrulous light and make great pretence about any little thing they do every moment they address the most extravagant flattery to their young mistress or try to promote the suit of one or other of the profligate candidates for her hand who has best or last bribed them illustration a slave from a painting in herculaneum illustration a slave from a painting in pompeii how delighted i should be most noble mistress said the black slave if i could only be in the triclinium this evening as you enter in to observe the brilliant effect of this new stibium on your guests it has cost me many trials before i could obtain it so perfect i am sure nothing like it has been ever seen in rome as for me interrupted the wily greek i should not presume to aspire to so high an honor i should be satisfied to look from outside the door and see the magnificent effect of this wonderful silk tunic which came with the last remittance of gold from asia nothing can equal its beauty nor i may add is its arrangement the result of my study unworthy of the materials and you syra interposed the mistress with a contemptuous smile what would you desire and what have you to praise of your own doing nothing to desire noble lady but that you may be ever happy nothing to praise of my own doing for i am not conscious of having done more than my duty was the modest and sincere reply it did not please the haughty lady who said methinks slave that you are not over given to praise one seldom hears a soft word from your mouth and what worth would it be from me answered syra from a poor servant to a noble dame accustomed to hear it all day long from eloquent and polished lips do you believe it when you hear it from them do you not despise it when you receive it from us a look of spite was darted at her from her two companions fabiola too was angry at what she thought a reproof a lofty sentiment in a slave have you yet to learn then she answered haughtily that you are mine and have been bought by me at a high price that you might serve me as i please i have as good a right to the service of your tongue as of your arms and if it please me to be praised and flattered and sung to by you do it you shall whether you like it or not a new idea indeed that a slave has to have any will but that of her mistress when her very life belongs to her true replied the handmaid calmly but with dignity my life belongs to you and so does all else that ends with life time health vigor body and breath all this you have bought with your gold and it has become your property but i still hold as my own what no emperors wealth can purchase no chains of slavery fetter no limit of life contain and pray what is that a soul a soul re echoed the astonished fabiola who had never before heard a slave claim ownership of such a property and pray let me ask you what you mean by the word i cannot speak philosophical sentences answered the servant but i mean that inward living consciousness within me which makes me feel to have an existence with and among better things than surround me which shrinks sensitively from destruction and instinctively from what is allied to it as disease is to death and therefore it abhors all flattery and it detests a lie while i possess that unseen gift and die it cannot either is impossible to me the other two could understand but little of all this so they stood in stupid amazement at the presumption of their companion fabiola too was startled but her pride soon rose again and she spoke with visible impatience where did you learn all this folly who has taught you to prate in this manner for my part i have studied for many years and have come to the conclusion that all ideas of spiritual existences are the dreams of poets or sophists and as such i despise them do you an ignorant uneducated slave pretend to know better than your mistress or do you really fancy that when after death your corpse will be thrown on the heap of slaves who have drunk themselves or have been scourged to death to be burnt in one ignominious pile and when the mingled ashes have been buried in a common pit you will survive as a conscious being and have still a life of joy and freedom to be lived non omnis moriar as one of your poets says replied illustration fabiola grasped the style in her right hand and made an almost blind thrust at the unflinching handmaid modestly but with a fervent look that astonished her mistress the foreign slave yes i hope nay i intend to survive all this and more yet i believe and know that out of that charnel pit which you have so vividly described there is a hand that will pick out each charred fragment of my frame and there is a power that will call to reckoning the four winds of heaven and make each give back every grain of my dust that it has scattered and i shall be built up once more in this my body not as yours or any ones bondwoman but free and joyful and glorious loving for ever and beloved this certain hope is laid up in my bosom what wild visions of an eastern fancy are these unfitting you for every duty you must be cured of them in what school did you learn all this nonsense i never read of it in any greek or latin author in one belonging to my own land a school in which there is no distinction known or admitted between greek or barbarian freeman or slave what exclaimed with strong excitement the haughty lady without waiting even for that future ideal existence after death already even now you presume to claim equality with me nay who knows perhaps superiority over me come tell me at once and without daring to equivocate or disguise if you do so or not and she sat up in an attitude of eager expectation at every word of the calm reply her agitation increased and violent passions seemed to contend within her as syra said most noble mistress far superior are you to me in place and power and learning and genius and in all that enriches and embellishes life and in every grace of form and lineament and in every charm of act and speech high are you raised above all rivalry and far removed from envious thought from one so lowly and so insignificant as i but if i must answer simple truth to your authoritative question she paused as faltering but an imperious gesture from her mistress bade her continue then i put it to your own judgment whether a poor slave who holds an unquenchable consciousness of possessing within her a spiritual and living intelligence whose measure of existence is immortality whose only true place of dwelling is above the skies whose only rightful prototype is the deity can hold herself inferior in moral dignity or lower in greatness of thought than one who however gifted owns that she claims no higher destiny recognizes in herself no sublimer end than what awaits the pretty irrational songsters that beat without hope of liberty against the gilded bars of that cage fabiolas eyes flashed with fury she felt herself for the first time in her life rebuked humbled by a slave she grasped the style in her right hand and made an almost blind thrust at the unflinching handmaid syra instinctively put forward her arm to save her person and received the point which aimed upwards from the couch inflicted a deeper gash than she had ever before suffered the tears started into her eyes through the smart of the wound from which the blood gushed in a stream fabiola was in a moment ashamed of her cruel though unintentional act and felt still more humbled before her servants go go she said to syra who was stanching the blood with her handkerchief go to euphrosyne and have the wound dressed i did not mean to hurt you so grievously but stay a moment i must make you some compensation then after turning over her trinkets on the table she continued take this ring and you need not return here again this evening fabiolas conscience was quite satisfied she had made illustration he who watched with beaming eye the alms coffers of jerusalem and noted the widows mite alone saw dropped into the chest by the bandaged arm of a foreign female slave a valuable emerald ring illustration a lamp found in the catacombs what she considered ample atonement for the injury she had inflicted in the shape of a costly present to a menial dependant and on the following sunday in the title of st pastor not far from her house among the alms collected for the poor was found a valuable emerald ring which the good priest polycarp thought must have been the offering of some very rich roman lady but which he who watched with beaming eye the alms coffers of jerusalem and noted the widows mite alone saw dropped into the chest by the bandaged arm of a foreign female slave chapter v the visit during the latter part of the dialogue just recorded and the catastrophe which closed it there took place an apparition in fabiolas room which if seen by her would probably have cut short the one and prevented the other the interior chambers in a roman house were more frequently divided by curtains across their entrances than by doors and thus it was easy especially during such an excited scene as had just taken place to enter unobserved this was the case now and when syra turned to leave the room she was almost startled at seeing standing in bright relief before the deep crimson door curtain a figure which she immediately recognized but which we must briefly describe it was that of a lady or rather a child not more than twelve or thirteen years old dressed in pure and spotless white without a single ornament about her person in her countenance might be seen united the simplicity of childhood with the intelligence of a maturer age there not merely dwelt in her eyes that dove like innocence which the sacred poet describes but often there beamed from them rather an intensity of pure affection as though they were looking beyond all surrounding objects and rested upon one unseen by all else but to her really present and exquisitely dear her forehead was the very seat of candor open and bright with undisguising truthfulness a kindly smile played about the lips and the fresh youthful features varied their sensitive expression with guileless earnestness passing rapidly from one feeling to the other as her warm and tender heart received it those who knew her believed that she never thought of herself but was divided entirely between kindness to those about her and affection for her unseen love when syra saw this beautiful vision like that of an angel before her she paused for a moment but the child took her hand and reverently kissed it saying i have seen all meet me in the small chamber near the entrance when i go out she then advanced and as fabiola saw her a crimson blush mantled in her cheek for she feared the child had been witness of her undignified burst of passion with a cold wave of her hand she dismissed her slaves and then greeted her kinswoman for such she was with cordial affection we have said that fabiolas temper made a few exceptions in its haughty exercise one of these was her old nurse and freed woman euphrosyne who directed all her private household and whose only creed was that fabiola was the most perfect of beings the wisest most accomplished most admirable lady in rome another was her young visitor whom she loved and ever treated with gentlest affection and whose society she always coveted this is really kind of you dear agnes said the softened fabiola to come at my sudden request to join our table to day but the fact is my father has called in one or two new people to dine and i was anxious to have some one with whom i could have the excuse of a duty to converse yet i own i have some curiosity about one of our new guests it is fulvius of whose grace wealth and accomplishments i hear so much though nobody seems to know who or what he is or whence he has sprung up my dear fabiola replied agnes you know i am always happy to visit you and my kind parents willingly allow me therefore make no apologies about that illustration saint agnes from an old vase and so you have come to me as usual said the other playfully in your own snow white dress without jewel or ornament as if you were every day a bride you always seem to me to be celebrating one eternal espousal but good heavens what is this are you hurt or are you aware that there is right on the bosom of your tunic a large red spot it looks like blood if so let me change your dress at once not for the world fabiola it is the jewel the only ornament i mean to wear this evening it is blood and that of a slave but nobler in my eyes and more generous than flows in your veins or mine the whole truth flashed upon fabiolas mind agnes had seen all and humbled almost to sickening she said somewhat pettishly do you then wish to exhibit proof to all the world of my hastiness of temper in over chastising a forward slave no dear cousin far from it i only wish to preserve for myself a lesson of fortitude and of elevation of mind learnt from a slave such as few patrician philosophers can teach us what a strange idea indeed agnes i have often thought that you make too much of that class of people after all what are they illustration saint agnes from an old vase preserved in the vatican museum human beings as much as ourselves endowed with the same reason the same feelings the same organization thus far you will admit at any rate to go no higher then they form part of the same family and if god from whom comes our life is thereby our father he is theirs as much and consequently they are our brethren a slave my brother or sister agnes the gods forbid it they are our property and our goods and i have no notion of their being allowed to move to act to think or to feel except as it suits their masters or is for their advantage come come said agnes with her sweetest tones do not let us get into a warm discussion you are too candid and honorable not to feel and to be ready to acknowledge that to day you have been outdone by a slave in all that you most admire in mind in reasoning in truthfulness and in heroic fortitude do not answer me i see it in that tear but dearest cousin i will save you from a repetition of your pain will you grant me my request any in my power then it is that you will allow me to purchase syra i think that is her name you will not like to see her about you you are mistaken agnes i will master pride for once and own that i shall now esteem her perhaps almost admire her it is a new feeling in me towards one in her station but i think fabiola i could make her happier than she is no doubt dear agnes you have the power of making every body happy about you i never saw such a household as yours you seem to carry out in practice that strange philosophy which syra alluded to in which there is no distinction of freeman and slave every body in your house is always smiling and cheerfully anxious to discharge his duty and there seems to be no one who thinks of commanding come tell me your secret agnes smiled i suspect you little magician that in that mysterious chamber which you will never open for me you keep your charms and potions by which you make every body and every thing love you if you were a christian and were exposed in the amphitheatre i am sure the very leopards would crouch and nestle at your feet but why do you look so serious child you know i am only joking agnes seemed absorbed and bent forward that keen and tender look which we have mentioned as though she saw before her nay as if she heard speaking to her some one delicately beloved it passed away and she gaily said well well fabiola stranger things have come to pass and at any rate if aught so dreadful had to happen syra would just be the sort of person one would like to see near one so you really must let me have her for heavens sake agnes do not take my words so seriously i assure you they were spoken in jest i have too high an opinion of your good sense to believe such a calamity possible but as to syras devotedness you are right when last summer you were away and i was so dangerously ill of contagious fever it required the lash to make the other slaves approach me while that poor thing would hardly leave me but watched by me and nursed me day and night and i really believe greatly promoted my recovery and did you not love her for this love her love a slave child of course i took care to reward her generously though i cannot make out what she does with what i give her the others tell me she has nothing put by and she certainly spends nothing on herself nay i have even heard that she foolishly shares her daily allowance of food with a blind beggar girl what a strange fancy to be sure dearest fabiola exclaimed agnes she must be mine you promised me my request name your price and let me take her home this evening well be it so you most irresistible of petitioners but we will not bargain together send some one to morrow to see my fathers steward and all will be right and now this great piece of business being settled between us let us go down to our guests but you have forgotten to put on your jewels never mind them i will do without them for once i feel no taste for them to day chapter vi the banquet they found on descending all the guests assembled in a hall below it was not a state banquet which they were going to share but the usual meal of a rich house where preparation for a tableful of friends was always made we will therefore content ourselves with saying that every thing was elegant and exquisite in arrangement and material and we will confine ourselves entirely to such incidents as may throw a light upon our story when the two ladies entered the exedra or hall fabius after saluting his daughter exclaimed why my child you have come down though late still scarcely fittingly arranged you have forgotten your usual trinkets fabiola was confused she knew not what answer to make she was ashamed of her weakness about her angry display and still more of what she now thought a silly way of punishing herself for it agnes stepped in to the rescue and blushingly said it is my fault cousin fabius both that she is late and that she is so plainly dressed i detained her with my gossip and no doubt she wishes to keep me in countenance by the simplicity of her attire you dear agnes replied the father are privileged to do as you please but seriously speaking i must say that even with you this may have answered while you were a mere child now that you are marriageable you must begin to make a little more display and try to win the affections of some handsome and eligible youth a beautiful necklace for instance such as you have plenty of at home would not make you less attractive but you are not attending to me come come i dare say you have some one already in view during most of this address which was meant to be thoroughly good natured as it was perfectly worldly agnes appeared in one of her abstracted moods her bewitched looks as fabiola called them transfixed in a smiling ecstasy as if attending to some one else but never losing the thread of the discourse nor saying any thing out of place she therefore at once answered fabius oh yes most certainly one who has already pledged me to him by his betrothal ring and has adorned me with immense jewels really asked fabius with what why answered agnes with a look of glowing earnestness and in tones of artless simplicity he has girded my hand and neck with precious gems and has set in my ears rings of peerless pearls goodness who can it be come agnes some day you must tell me your secret your first love no doubt may it last long and make you happy for ever was her reply as she turned to join fabiola and enter with her into the dining room it was well she had not overheard this dialogue or she would have been hurt to the quick as thinking that agnes had concealed the most important thought of her age as she would have considered it from her most loving friend but while agnes was defending her she had turned away from her father and had been attending to the other guests one was a heavy thick necked roman sophist or dealer in universal knowledge named calpurnius another proculus a mere lover of good fare often at the house two more remain deserving further notice the first of them evidently a favorite both with fabiola and agnes was a tribune a high officer of the imperial or prtorian guard though not above thirty years of age he had already distinguished himself by his valor and enjoyed the highest favor with the emperors dioclesian in the east and maximian herculius in rome he was free from all affectation in manner or dress though handsome in person and though most engaging in conversation he manifestly scorned the foolish topics which generally occupied society in short he was a perfect specimen of a noble hearted youth full of honor and generous thoughts strong and brave without a particle of pride or display in him quite a contrast to him was the last guest already alluded to by fabiola the new star of society fulvius young and almost effeminate in look dressed with most elaborate elegance with brilliant rings on every finger and jewels in his dress affected in his speech which had a slightly foreign accent overstrained in his courtesy of manners but apparently good natured and obliging he had in a short time quietly pushed his way into the highest society of rome this was indeed owing partly to his having been seen at the imperial court and partly to the fascination of his manner he had arrived in rome accompanied by a single elderly attendant evidently deeply attached to him whether slave freedman or friend nobody well knew they spoke together always in a strange tongue and the swarthy features keen fiery eye and unamiable expression of the domestic inspired a certain degree of fear in his dependants for fulvius had taken an apartment in what was called an insula or house let out in parts had furnished it luxuriously and had peopled it with a sufficient bachelors establishment of slaves profusion rather than abundance distinguished all his domestic arrangements and in the corrupted and degraded circle of pagan rome the obscurity of his history and the suddenness of his apparition were soon forgotten in the evidence of his riches and the charm of his loose conversation a shrewd observer of character however would soon notice a wandering restlessness of eye and an eagerness of listening attention for all sights and sounds around him which betrayed an insatiable curiosity and in moments of forgetfulness a dark scowl under his knit brows from his flashing eyes and a curling of the upper lip which inspired a feeling of mistrust and gave an idea that his exterior softness only clothed a character of feline malignity illustration banquet table from a pompeian painting the guests were soon at table and as ladies sat while men reclined on couches during the repast fabiola and agnes were together on one side the two younger guests last described were opposite and the master with his two elder friends in the middle if these terms can be used to describe their position about three parts of a round table one side being left unencumbered by the sigma or semi circular couch for the convenience of serving and we may observe in passing that a table cloth a luxury unknown in the times of horace was now in ordinary use when the first claims of hunger or the palate had been satisfied conversation grew more general what news to day at the baths asked calpurnius i have no leisure myself to look after such trifles very interesting news indeed answered proculus it seems quite certain that orders have been received from the divine dioclesian to finish his therm in three years impossible exclaimed fabius i looked in at the works the other day on my way to sallusts gardens and found them very little advanced in the last year there is an immense deal of heavy work to be done such as carving marbles and shaping columns true interposed fulvius but i know that orders have been sent to all parts to forward hither all prisoners and all persons condemned to the mines in spain sardinia and even chersonesus who can possibly be spared to come and labor at the therm a few thousand christians thus set to the work will soon finish it and why christians better than other criminals asked with some curiosity fabiola why really said fulvius with his most winning smile i can hardly give a reason for it but the fact is so among fifty workmen so condemned i would engage to pick out a single christian indeed exclaimed several at once pray how ordinary convicts answered he naturally do not love their work and they require the lash at every step to compel them to perform it and when the overseers eye is off them no work is done and moreover they are of course rude sottish quarrelsome and querulous but the christians when condemned to these public works seem on the contrary to be glad and are always cheerful and obedient i have seen young patricians so occupied in asia whose hands had never before handled a pickaxe and whose weak shoulders had never borne a weight yet working hard and as happy to all appearance as when at home of course for all that the overseers apply the lash and the stick very freely to them and most justly because it is the will of the divine emperors that their lot should be made as hard as possible but still they never complain i cannot say that i admire this sort of justice replied fabiola but what a strange race they must be i am most curious to know what can be the motive or cause of this stupidity or unnatural insensibility in these christians proculus replied with a facetious look calpurnius here no doubt can tell us for he is a philosopher and i hear could declaim for an hour on any topic from the alps to an ant hill calpurnius thus challenged and thinking himself highly complimented solemnly gave mouth the christians said he are a foreign sect the founder of which flourished many ages ago in chaldea his doctrines were brought to rome at the time of vespasian by two brothers named peter and paul some maintain that these were the same twin brothers as the jews call moses and aaron the second of whom sold his birthright to his brother for a kid the skin of which he wanted to make chirothec of but this identity i do not admit as it is recorded in the mystical books of the jews that the second of these brothers seeing the others victims give better omens of birds than his own slew him as our romulus did remus but with the jaw bone of an ass for which he was hung by king mardochus of macedon upon a gibbet fifty cubits high at the suit of their sister judith however peter and paul coming as i said to rome the former was discovered to be a fugitive slave of pontius pilate and was crucified by his masters orders on the janiculum their followers of whom they had many made the cross their symbol and adore it and they think it the greatest honor to suffer stripes and even ignominious death as the best means of being like their teachers and as they fancy of going to them in a place somewhere among the clouds this lucid explanation of the origin of christianity was listened to with admiration by all except two the young officer gave a piteous look towards agnes which seemed to say shall i answer the goose or shall i laugh outright but she put her finger on her lips and smiled imploringly for silence well then the upshot of it is observed proculus that the therm will be finished soon and we shall have glorious sport is it not said fulvius that the divine dioclesian will himself come to the dedication it is quite certain and so will there be splendid festivals and glorious games but we shall not have to wait so long already for other purposes have orders been sent to numidia for an unlimited supply of lions and leopards to be ready before winter then turning round sharp to his neighbor he said bending a keen eye upon his countenance a brave soldier like you sebastian must be delighted with the noble spectacles of the amphitheatre especially when directed against the enemies of the august emperors and of the republic the officer raised himself upon his couch looked on his interrogator with an unmoved majestic countenance and answered calmly fulvius i should not deserve the title which you give me could i contemplate with pleasure in cold blood the struggle if it deserve the name between a brute beast and a helpless child or woman for such are the spectacles which you call noble no i will draw my sword willingly against any enemy of the princes or the state but i would as readily draw it against the lion or the leopard that should rush even by imperial order against the innocent and defenceless fulvius was starting up but sebastian placed his strong hand upon his arm and continued hear me out i am not the first roman nor the noblest who has thought thus before me remember the words of cicero magnificent are these games no doubt but what delight can it be to a refined mind to see either a feeble man torn by a most powerful beast or a noble animal pierced through by a javelin i am not ashamed of agreeing with the greatest of roman orators then shall we never see you in the amphitheatre sebastian asked fulvius with a bland but taunting tone if you do the soldier replied depend upon it it will be on the side of the defenceless not on that of the brutes that would destroy them illustration david with his sling from the catacomb of st petronilla sebastian is right exclaimed fabiola clapping her hands and i close the discussion by my applause i have never heard sebastian speak except on the side of generous and high minded sentiments fulvius bit his lip in silence and all rose to depart chapter vii poor and rich during the latter part of the conversation just recorded fabius had been quite abstracted speculating upon his conversation with agnes how quietly she had kept her secret to herself but who could this favored person be who had already won her heart he thought over many but could find no answer the gift of rich jewels particularly perplexed him he knew no young roman nobleman likely to possess them and sauntering as he did every day into the great shops he was sure to have heard if any such costly order had been given suddenly the bright idea flashed through his mind that fulvius who daily exhibited new and splendid gems brought from abroad could be the only person able to make her such presents he moreover noticed such occasional looks darted towards his cousin by the handsome foreigner as left him no doubt that he was deeply enamored of her and if agnes did not seem conscious of the admiration this of course was part of her plan once convinced of this important conclusion he determined to favor the wishes of the two and astonish his daughter one day by the sagacity he had displayed but we must leave our nobler guests for more humble scenes and follow syra from the time that she left her young mistresss apartment when she presented herself to euphrosyne the good natured nurse was shocked at the cruel wound and uttered an exclamation of pity but immediately recognizing in it the work of fabiola she was divided between two contending feelings poor thing she said as she went on first washing then closing and dressing the gash it is a dreadful cut what did you do to deserve it how it must have hurt you my poor girl but how wicked you must have been to bring it upon yourself it is a savage wound yet inflicted by the gentlest of creatures you must be faint from loss of blood take this cordial to support you and no doubt she found herself obliged to strike no doubt said syra amused it was all my fault i had no business to argue with my mistress argue with her argue o ye gods who ever heard before of a slave arguing with a noble mistress and such a learned one why calpurnius himself would be afraid of disputing with her no wonder indeed she was so so agitated as not to know that she was hurting you but this must be concealed it must not be known that you have been so wrong have you no scarf or nice veil that we could throw round the arm as if for ornament all the others i know have plenty given or bought but you never seem to care for these pretty things let us look she went into the maid slaves dormitory which was within her room opened syras capsa or box and after turning over in vain its scanty contents she drew forth from the bottom a square kerchief of richest stuff magnificently embroidered and even adorned with pearls syra blushed deeply and entreated not to be obliged to wear this most disproportioned piece of dress especially as it was a token of better days long and painfully preserved but euphrosyne anxious to hide her mistresss fault was inexorable and the rich scarf was gracefully fastened round the wounded arm this operation performed syra proceeded to the little parlor opposite the porters room where the higher slaves could see their friends she held in her hand a basket covered with a napkin the moment she entered the door a light step came bounding across the room to meet her it was that of a girl of about sixteen or seventeen dressed in the poorest attire but clean and neat who threw her arms round syras neck with such a bright countenance and such hearty glee that a bystander would hardly have supposed that her sightless eyes had never communed with the outer world sit down dear ccilia said syra with a most affectionate tone and leading her to a seat to day i have brought you a famous feast you will fare sumptuously how so i think i do every day no but to day my mistress has kindly sent me out a dainty dish from her table and i have brought it here for you how kind of her yet how much kinder of you my sister but why have you not partaken of it yourself it was meant for you and not for me why to tell the truth it is a greater treat to me to see you enjoy any thing than to enjoy it myself no dear syra no it must not be god has wished me to be poor and i must try to do his will i could no more think of eating the food than i could of wearing the dress of the rich so long as i can obtain that of the poor i love to share with you your pulmentum which i know is given me in charity by one poor like myself i procure for you the merit of alms deeds you give me the consolation of feeling that i am before god still only a poor blind thing i think he will love me better thus than if feeding on luxurious fare i would rather be with lazarus at the gate than with dives at the table how much better and wiser you are than i my good child it shall be as you wish i will give the dish to my companions and in the meantime here i set before you your usual humble fare thanks thanks dear sister i will await your return syra went to the maids apartment and put before her jealous but greedy companions the silver dish as their mistress occasionally showed them this little kindness it did not much surprise them but the poor servant was weak enough to feel ashamed of appearing before her comrades with the rich scarf round her arm she took it off before she entered then not wishing to displease euphrosyne replaced it as well as she could with one hand on coming out she was in the court below returning to her blind friend when she saw one of the noble guests of her mistresss table alone and with a mortified look crossing towards the door and she stepped behind a column to avoid any possible and not uncommon rudeness it was fulvius and no sooner did she unseen catch a glimpse of him than she stood for a moment as one nailed to the spot her heart beat against her bosom then quivered as if about to cease its action her knees struck against one another a shiver ran through her frame while perspiration started on her brow her eyes wide open were fascinated like the birds before the snake she raised her hand to her breast made upon it the sign of life and the spell was broken she fled in an instant still unnoticed and had hardly stepped noiselessly behind a curtain that closed the stairs when fulvius with downcast eyes reached the spot on which she had stood he started back a step as if scared by something lying before him he trembled violently but recovering himself by a sudden effort he looked around him and saw that he was alone there was no eye upon him except one which he did not heed but which read his evil heart in that hour he gazed again upon the object and stooped to pick it up but drew back his hand and that more than once at last he heard footsteps approaching he recognized the martial tread of sebastian and hastily he snatched up from the ground the rich scarf which had dropped from syras arm he shook as he folded it up and when to his horror he found upon it spots of fresh blood which had oozed through the bandages he reeled like a drunken man to the door and rushed to his lodgings pale sick and staggering he went into his chamber repulsing roughly the officious advances of his slaves and only beckoned to his faithful domestic to follow him and then signed to him to bar the door a lamp was burning brightly by the table on which fulvius threw the embroidered scarf in silence and pointed to the stains of blood that dark man said nothing but his swarthy countenance was blanched while his masters was ashy and livid it is the same no doubt at length spoke the attendant in their foreign tongue but she is certainly dead art thou quite sure eurotas asked the master with the keenest of his hawks looks as sure as man can be of what he has not seen himself where didst thou find this and whence this blood i will tell thee all to morrow i am too sick to night as to those stains which were liquid when i found it i know not whence they came unless they are warnings of vengeance nay a vengeance themselves deep as the furies could meditate fierce as they could launch that blood has not been shed now tut tut this is no time for dreams or fancies did any one see thee pick the the thing up no one i am sure then we are safe better in our hands than in others a good nights rest will give us better counsel true eurotus but do thou sleep this night in my chamber both threw themselves on their couches fulvius on a rich bed eurotus on a lowly pallet from which raised upon his elbow with dark but earnest eye he long watched by the lamps light the troubled slumbers of the youth at once his devoted guardian and his evil genius fulvius tossed about and moaned in his sleep for his dreams were gloomy and heavy first he sees before him a beautiful city in a distant land with a river of crystal brightness flowing through it upon it is a galley weighing anchor with a figure on deck waving towards him in farewell an embroidered scarf the scene changes the ship is in the midst of the sea battling with a furious storm while on the summit of the mast the same scarf streams out like a pennant unruffled and uncrumpled by the breeze the vessel is now dashed upon a rock and all with a dreadful shriek are buried in the deep but the topmast stands above the billows with its calm and brilliant flag till amidst the sea birds that shriek around a form with a torch in her hand and black flapping wings flies by snatches it from the staff and with a look of stern anger displays it as in her flight she pauses before him he reads upon it written in fiery letters nemesis but it is time to return to our other acquaintances in the house of fabius after syra had heard the door close on fulvius she paused to compose herself offered up a secret prayer and returned to her blind friend she had finished her frugal meal and was waiting patiently the slaves return syra then commenced her daily duties of kindness and hospitality she brought water washed her hands and feet in obedience to christian practice and combed and dressed her hair as if the poor creature had been her own child indeed though not much older her look was so tender as she hung over her poor friend her tones were so soft her whole action so motherly that one would have thought it was a parent ministering to her daughter rather than a slave serving a beggar and this beggar too looked so happy spoke so cheerily and said such beautiful things that syra lingered over her work to listen to her and gaze on her it was at this moment that agnes came for her appointed interview and fabiola insisted on accompanying her to the door but when agnes softly raised the curtain and caught a sight of the scene before her she beckoned to fabiola to look in enjoining silence by her gesture the blind girl was opposite and her voluntary servant on one side unconscious of witnesses the heart of fabiola was touched she had never imagined that there was such a thing as disinterested love on earth between strangers as to charity it was a word unknown to greece or rome she retreated quietly with a tear in her eye and said to agnes as she took leave i must retire that girl as you know proved to me this afternoon that a slave may have a head she has now shown me that she may have a heart i was amazed when a few hours ago you asked me if i did not love a slave i think now i could almost love syra i half regret that i have agreed to part with her as she went back into the court agnes entered the room and laughing said so ccilia i have found out your secret at last this is the friend whose food you have always said was so much better than mine that you would never eat at my house well if the dinner is not better at any rate i agree that you have fallen in with a better hostess oh dont say so sweet lady agnes answered the blind girl it is the dinner indeed that is better you have plenty of opportunities for exercising charity but a poor slave can only do so by finding some one still poorer and helpless like me that thought makes her food by far the sweetest well you are right said agnes and i am not sorry to have you present to hear the good news i bring to syra it will make you happy too fabiola has allowed me to become your mistress syra and to take you with me to morrow you shall be free and a dear sister to me ccilia clapped her hands with joy and throwing her arms round syras neck exclaimed oh how good how happy you will now be dear syra but syra was deeply troubled and replied with faltering voice o good and gentle lady you have been kind indeed to think so much about one like me but pardon me if i entreat you to remain as i am i assure you dear ccilia i am quite happy here but why wish to stay asked agnes because rejoined syra it is most perfect to abide with god in the state wherein we have been called i own this is not the one in which i was born i have been brought to it by others a burst of tears interrupted her for a moment and then she went on but so much the more clear is it to me that god has willed me to serve him in this condition how can i wish to leave it well then said agnes still more eagerly we can easily manage it i will not free you and you shall be my bondwoman that will be just the same no no said syra smiling that will never do our great apostles instructions to us are servants be subject to your masters with all fear not only to the good and gentle but also to the froward i am far from saying that my mistress is one of these but you noble lady agnes are too good and gentle for me where would be my cross if i lived with you you do not know how proud and headstrong i am by nature and i should fear for myself if i had not some pain and humiliation agnes was almost overcome but she was more eager than ever to possess such a treasure of virtue and said i see syra that no motive addressed to your own interest can move you i must therefore use a more selfish plea i want to have you with me that i may improve by your advice and example come you will not refuse such a request selfish replied the slave you can never be and therefore i will appeal to yourself from your request you know fabiola and you love her what a noble soul and what a splendid intellect she possesses what great qualities and high accomplishments if they only reflected the light of truth and how jealously does she guard in herself that pearl of virtues which only we know how to prize what a truly great christian she would make go on for gods sake dear syra broke out agnes all eagerness and do you hope for it it is my prayer day and night it is my chief thought and aim it is the occupation of my life i will try to win her by patience by assiduity even by such unusual discussions as we have held to day and when all is exhausted i have one resource more what is that both asked to give my life for her conversion i know that a poor slave like me has few chances of martyrdom still a fiercer persecution is said to be approaching and perhaps it will not disdain such humble victims but be that as god pleases my life for her soul is placed in his hands and oh dearest best of ladies she exclaimed falling on her knees and bedewing agness hand with tears do not come in thus between me and my prize you have conquered sister syra oh never again call me lady said agnes remain at your post such single hearted generous virtue must triumph it is too sublime for so homely a sphere as my household and i for my part subjoined ccilia with a look of arch gravity say that she has said one very wicked thing and told a great story this evening what is that my pet asked syra laughing why you said that i was wiser and better than you because i declined eating some trumpery delicacy which would have gratified my palate for a few minutes at the expense of an act of greediness while you have given up liberty happiness the free exercise of your religion and have offered to give up life itself for the salvation of one who is your tyrant and tormentor oh fie how could you tell me such a thing illustration a dove as a symbol of the soul found in the catacombs the servant now announced that agness litter was waiting at the door and any one who could have seen the affectionate farewell of the three the noble lady the slave and the beggar would have justly exclaimed as people had often done before see how these christians love one another chapter viii the first days conclusion if we linger a little time about the door and see agnes fairly off and listen to the merry conversation between her and ccilia in which agnes asks her to allow herself to be accompanied home by one of her attendants as it has grown dark and the girl is amused at the ladys forgetfulness that day and night are the same to her and that on this very account she is the appointed guide to thread the mazes of the catacombs familiar to her as the streets of rome which she walks in safety at all hours if thus we pass a little time before re entering to inquire how the mistress within fares after the days adventures we shall find the house turned topsy turvy slaves with lamps and torches are running about in every direction looking for something or other that is lost in every possible and impossible place euphrosyne insists it must be found till at last the search is given up in despair the reader will probably have anticipated the solution of the mystery syra had presented herself to have her wound re dressed according to orders and the scarf which had bound it was no longer there she could give no account of it further than that she had taken it off and put it on certainly not so well as euphrosyne had done it and she gave the reason for she scorned to tell a lie indeed she had never missed it till now the kind hearted old nurse was much grieved at the loss which she considered must be heavy to a poor slave girl as she probably reserved that object for the purchase of her liberty and syra too was sorry but for reasons which she could not have made the good housekeeper comprehend euphrosyne had all the servants interrogated and many even searched to syras great pain and confusion and then ordered a grand general battue through every part of the house where syra had been who for a moment could have dreamt of suspecting a noble guest at the masters table of purloining any article valuable or not the old lady therefore came to the conclusion that the scarf had been spirited away by some magical process and greatly suspected that the black slave afra who she knew could not bear syra had been using some spell to annoy the poor girl for she believed the moor to be a very canidia being often obliged to let her go out alone at night under pretence of gathering herbs at full moon for her cosmetics as if plucked at any other time they would not possess the same virtues to procure deadly poisons euphrosyne suspected but in reality to join in the hideous orgies of fetichism with others of her race or to hold interviews with such as consulted her imaginary art it was not till all was given up and syra found herself alone that on more coolly recollecting the incidents of the day she remembered the pause in fulviuss walk across the court at the very spot where she had stood and his hurried steps after this to the door the conviction then flashed on her mind that she must have there dropped her kerchief and that he must have picked it up that he should have passed it with indifference she believed impossible she was confident therefore that it was now in his possession after attempting to speculate on the possible consequences of this misadventure and coming to no satisfactory conclusion she determined to commit the matter entirely to god and sought that repose which a good conscience was sure to render balmy and sweet fabiola on parting with agnes retired to her apartment and after the usual services had been rendered to her by her other two servants and euphrosyne she dismissed them with a gentler manner than ever she had shown before as soon as they had retired she went to recline upon the couch where first we found her when to her disgust she discovered lying on it the style with which she had wounded syra she opened a chest and threw it in with horror nor did she ever again use any such weapon illustration volumina from a painting of pompeii scrinium from a picture in the cemetery of st callistus she took up the volume which she had last laid down and which had greatly amused her but it was quite insipid and seemed most frivolous to her she laid it down again and gave free course to her thoughts on all that had happened it struck her first what a wonderful child her cousin agnes was how unselfish how pure how simple how sensible too and even wise she determined to be her protector her elder sister in all things she had observed too as well as her father the frequent looks which fulvius had fixed upon her not indeed those libertine looks which she herself had often borne with scorn but designing cunning glances such as she thought betrayed some scheme or art of which agnes might become the victim she resolved to frustrate it whatever it might be and arrived at exactly the opposite conclusion to her fathers about him she made up her mind to prevent fulvius having any access to agnes at least at her house and even blamed herself for having brought one so young into the strange company which often met at her fathers table especially as she now found that her motives for doing so had been decidedly selfish it was nearly at the same moment that fulvius tossing on his couch had come to the determination never again if possible to go inside fabiuss door and to resist or elude every invitation from him fabiola had measured his character had caught with her penetrating eye the affectation of his manner and the cunning of his looks and could not help contrasting him with the frank and generous sebastian what a noble fellow that sebastian is she said to herself how different from all the other youths that come here never a foolish word escapes his lips never an unkind look darts from his bright and cheerful eye how abstemious as becomes a soldier at the table how modest as befits a hero about his own strength and bold actions in war which others speak so much about oh if he only felt towards me as others pretend to do she did not finish the sentence but a deep melancholy seemed to steal over her whole soul then syras conversation and all that had resulted from it passed again through her mind it was painful to her yet she could not help dwelling on it and she felt as if that day were a crisis in her life her pride had been humbled by a slave and her mind softened she knew not how had her eyes been opened in that hour and had she been able to look up above this world she would have seen a soft cloud like incense but tinged with a rich carnation rising from the bed side of a kneeling slave prayer and willing sacrifice of life breathed upwards together which when it struck the crystal footstool of a mercy seat in heaven fell down again as a dew of gentlest grace upon her arid heart she could not indeed see this yet it was no less true and wearied at length she sought repose but she too had a distressing dream she saw a bright spot as in a delicious garden richly illuminated by a light like noonday but inexpressibly soft while all around was dark beautiful flowers formed the sward plants covered with richest bloom grew festooned from tree to tree on each of which glowed golden fruit in the midst of this space she saw the poor blind girl with her look of happiness on her cheerful countenance seated on the ground while on one side agnes with her sweetest simple looks and on the other syra with her quiet patient smile hung over her and caressed her fabiola felt an irresistible desire to be with them it seemed to her that they were enjoying some felicity which she had never known or witnessed and she thought they even beckoned her to join them she ran forward to do so when to her horror she found a wide and black and deep ravine at the bottom of which roared a torrent between herself and them by degrees its waters rose till they reached the upper margin of the dyke and there flowed though so deep yet sparkling and brilliant and most refreshing oh for courage to plunge into this stream through which alone the gorge could be crossed and land in safety on the other side and still they beckoned urging her on to try it but as she was standing on the brink clasping her hands in despair calpurnius seemed to emerge from the dark air around with a thick heavy curtain stretched out on which were worked all sorts of monstrous and hideous chimeras most curiously running into and interwoven with each other and this dark veil grew and grew till it shut out the beautiful vision from her sight she felt disconsolate till she seemed illustration our saviour from a representation found in the catacombs to see a bright genius as she called him in whose features she fancied she traced a spiritualized resemblance to sebastian and whom she had noticed standing sorrowful at a distance now approach her and smiling on her fan her fevered face with his gold and purple wing when she lost her vision in a calm and refreshing sleep chapter ix meetings of all the roman hills the most distinctly traceable on every side is undoubtedly the palatine augustus having chosen it for his residence successive emperors followed his example but gradually transformed his modest residence into a palace which covered the entire hill nero not satisfied with its dimensions destroyed the neighborhood by fire and then extended the imperial residence to the neighboring esquiline taking in the whole space now occupied between the two hills by the coliseum vespasian threw down that golden house of which the magnificent vaults remain covered with beautiful paintings and built the amphitheatre just mentioned and other edifices with its materials the entrance to the palace was made soon after this period from the via sacra or sacred way close to the arch of titus after passing through a vestibule the visitor found himself in a magnificent court the plan of which can be distinctly traced turning from this on the left side he entered into an immense square space arranged and consecrated to adonis by domitian and planted with trees shrubs and flowers still keeping to the left you would enter into sets of chambers constructed by alexander severus in honor of his illustration the ruins of the coliseum as seen from the palatine of st bonaventure mother mamma whose name they bore they looked out opposite to the clian hill just at the angle of it which abuts upon the later triumphal arch of constantine and the fountain called the meta sudans here was the apartment occupied by sebastian as a tribune or superior officer of the imperial guard it consisted of a few rooms most modestly furnished as became a soldier and a christian his household was limited to a couple of freedmen and a venerable matron who had been his nurse and loved him as a child they were christians as were all the men in his cohort partly by conversion but chiefly by care in recruiting new soldiers illustration meta sudans after a bronze of vespasian it was a few evenings after the scenes described in the last chapter that sebastian a couple of hours after dark ascended the steps of the vestibule just described in company with another youth of whom we have already spoken pancratius admired and loved sebastian with the sort of affection that an ardent young officer may be supposed to bear towards an older and gallant soldier who receives him into his friendship but it was not as to a soldier of csar but as to a champion of christ that the civilian boy looked up to the young tribune whose generosity noble mindedness and valor were enshrouded in such a gentle simple bearing and were accompanied by such prudence and considerateness as gave confidence and encouragement to all that dealt with him and sebastian loved pancratius no less on account of his single hearted ardor and the innocence and candor of his mind but he well saw the dangers to which his youthful warmth and impetuosity might lead him and he encouraged him to keep close to himself that he might guide and perhaps sometimes restrain him illustration the arch of titus as they were entering the palace that part of which sebastians cohort guarded he said to his companion every time that i enter here it strikes me how kind an act of divine providence it was to plant almost at the very gate of csars palace the arch which commemorates at once the downfall of the first great system that was antagonistic to christianity and the completion of the greatest prophecy of the gospel the destruction of jerusalem by the roman power i cannot but believe that another arch will one day arise to commemorate no less a victory over the second enemy of our religion the heathen roman empire itself what do you contemplate the overthrow of this vast empire as the means of establishing christianity god forbid i would shed the last drop of my blood as i shed my first to maintain it and depend upon it when the empire is converted it will not be by such gradual growth as we now witness but by some means so unhuman so divine as we shall never in our most sanguine longings forecast but all will exclaim this is the change of the right hand of the most high no doubt but your idea of a christian triumphal arch supposes an earthly instrument where do you imagine this to lie why pancratius my thoughts i own turn towards the family of one of the augusti as showing a slight germ of better thoughts i mean constantius chlorus but sebastian how many of even our learned and good men will say nay do say if you speak thus to them that similar hopes were entertained in the reigns of alexander gordian or aurelian yet ended in disappointment why they ask should we not expect the same results now i know it too well my dear pancratius and bitterly have i often deplored those dark views which damp our energies that lurking thought that vengeance is perpetual and mercy temporary that martyrs blood and virgins prayer have no power even to shorten times of visitation and hasten hours of grace by this time they had reached sebastians apartment the principal room of which was lighted and evidently prepared for some assembly but opposite the door was a window open to the ground and leading to a terrace that ran along that side of the building the night looked so bright through it that they both instinctively walked across the room and stood upon the terrace a lovely and splendid view presented itself to them the moon was high in the heavens swimming in them as an italian moon does a round full globe not a flat surface bathed all round in its own refulgent atmosphere it dimmed indeed the stars near itself but they seemed to have retired in thicker and more brilliant clusters into the distant corners of the azure sky it was just such an evening as years after monica and augustine enjoyed from a window at ostia as they discoursed of heavenly things it is true that below and around all was beautiful and grand the coliseum or flavian amphitheatre rose at one side in all its completeness and the gentle murmur of the fountain while its waters glistened in a silvery column like the refluent sea wave gliding down a slanting rock came soothingly on the ear on the other side the lofty building called the septizonium of severus in front towering above the clian the sumptuous baths of caracalla reflected from their marble walls and stately pillars the radiance of the autumn moon but all these massive monuments of earthly glory rose unheeded before the two christian youths as they stood silent the elder with his right arm round his youthful companions neck and resting on his shoulder after a long pause he took up the thread of his last discourse and said in a softer tone i was going to show you when we stepped out here the very spot just below our feet where i have often fancied the triumphal arch to which i have alluded would stand but who can think of such paltry things below with the splendid vault above us lighted up so brilliantly as if on purpose to draw upwards our eyes and hearts true sebastian and i have sometimes thought that if illustration hark said pancratius these are the trumpet notes that summon us the under side of that firmament up to which the eye of man however wretched and sinful may look be so beautiful and bright what must that upper side be down upon which the eye of boundless glory deigns to glance i imagine it to be like a richly embroidered veil through the texture of which a few points of golden thread may be allowed to pass and these only reach us how transcendently royal must be that upper surface on which tread the lightsome feet of angels and of the just made perfect a graceful thought pancratius and no less true it makes the veil between us laboring here and the triumphal church above thin and easily to be passed and pardon me sebastian said the youth with the same look up to his friend as a few evenings before had met his mothers inspired gaze pardon me if while you wisely speculate upon a future arch to record the triumph of christianity i see already before me built and open the arch through which we feeble as we are may lead the church speedily to the triumph of glory and ourselves to that of bliss where my dear boy where do you mean pancratius pointed steadily with his hand towards the left and said there my noble sebastian any of those open arches of the flavian amphitheatre which lead to its arena over which not denser than the outstretched canvas which shades our spectators is that veil of which you spoke just now but hark that was a lions roar from beneath the clian exclaimed sebastian surprised wild beasts must have arrived at the vivarium of the amphitheatre for i know there were none there yesterday yes hark continued pancratius not noticing the interruption these are the trumpet notes that summon us that is the music that must accompany us to our triumph both paused for a time when pancratius again broke the silence saying this puts me in mind of a matter on which i want to take your advice my faithful counsellor will your company be soon arriving not immediately and they will drop in one by one till they assemble come into my chamber where none will interrupt us they walked along the terrace and entered the last room of the suite it was at the corner of the hill exactly opposite the fountain and was lighted only by the rays of the moon streaming through the open window on that side the soldier stood near this and pancratius sat upon his small military couch what is this great affair pancratius said the officer smiling upon which you wish to have my sage opinion quite a trifle i dare say replied the youth bashfully for a bold and generous man like you but an important one to an unskilful and weak boy like me a good and virtuous one i doubt not do let me hear it and i promise you every assistance well then sebastian now dont think me foolish proceeded pancratius hesitating and blushing at every word you are aware i have a quantity of useless plate at home mere lumber you know in our plain way of living and my dear mother for any thing i can say wont wear the lots of old fashioned trinkets which are lying locked up and of no use to any body i have no one to whom all this should descend i am and shall be the last of my race you have often told me who in that case are a christians natural heirs the widow and the fatherless the helpless and the indigent why should these wait my death to have what by reversion is theirs and if a persecution is coming why run the risk of confiscation seizing them or of plundering lictors stealing them whenever our lives are wanted to the utter loss of our rightful heirs pancratius said sebastian i have listened without offering a remark to your noble suggestion i wished you to have all the merit of uttering it yourself now just tell me what makes you doubt or hesitate about what i know you wish to do why to tell the truth i feared it might be highly presumptuous and impertinent in one of my age to offer to do what people would be sure to imagine was something grand or generous while i assure you dear sebastian it is no such thing for i shall not miss these things a bit they are of no value to me whatever but they will be to the poor especially in the hard times coming of course lucina consents oh no fear about that i would not touch a grain of gold dust without her even wishing it but why i require your assistance is principally this i should never be able to stand its being known that i presumed to do any thing considered out of the way especially in a boy you understand me so i want you and beg of you to get the distribution made at some other house and as from a say from one who needs much the prayers of the faithful especially the poor and desires to remain unknown i will serve you with delight my good and truly noble boy hush did you not hear the lady fabiolas name just mentioned there again and with an epithet expressive of no good will pancratius approached the window two voices were conversing together so close under them that the cornice between prevented their seeing the speakers evidently a woman and a man after a few minutes they walked out into the moonlight almost as bright as day i know that moorish woman said sebastian it is fabiolas black slave afra and the man added pancratius is my late school fellow corvinus they considered it their duty to catch if possible the thread of what seemed a plot but as the speakers walked up and down they could only make out a sentence here and there we will not however confine ourselves to these parts but give the entire dialogue only a word first about the interlocutors of the slave we know enough for the present corvinus was son as we have said to tertullus originally prefect of the prtorium this office unknown in the republic and of imperial creation had from the reign of tiberius gradually absorbed almost all civil as well as military power and he who held it often discharged the duties of chief criminal judge in rome it required no little strength of nerve to occupy this post to the satisfaction of despotic and unsparing masters to sit all day in a tribunal surrounded with hideous implements of torture unmoved by the moans or the shrieks of old men youths or women on whom they were tried to direct a cool interrogatory to one stretched upon the rack and quivering in agony on one side while the last sentence of beating to death with bullet laden scourges was being executed on the other to sleep calmly after such scenes and rise with appetite for their repetition was not an occupation to which every member of the bar could be supposed to aspire tertullus had been brought from sicily to fill the office not because he was a cruel but because he was a cold hearted man not susceptible of pity or partiality his tribunal however was corvinuss early school he could sit while quite a boy for hours at his fathers feet thoroughly enjoying the cruel spectacles before him and angry when any one got off he grew up sottish coarse and brutal and not yet arrived at mans estate his bloated and freckled countenance and blear eyes one of which was half closed announced him to be already a dissolute and dissipated character without taste for any thing refined or ability for any learning he united in himself a certain amount of animal courage and strength and a considerable measure of low cunning he had never experienced in himself a generous feeling and he had never curbed an evil passion no one had ever offended him whom he did not hate and pursue with vengeance two above all he had sworn never to forgive the school master who had often chastised him for his sulky idleness and the school fellow who had blessed him for his brutal contumely justice and mercy good and evil done to him were equally odious to him tertullus had no fortune to give him and he seemed to have little genius to make one to become possessed of one however was all important to his mind for wealth as the means of gratifying his desires was synonymous with him to supreme felicity a rich heiress or rather her dower seemed the simplest object at which to aim too awkward shy and stupid to make himself a way in society he sought other means more kindred to his mind for the attainment of his ambitious or avaricious desires what these means were his conversation with the black slave will best explain i have come to meet you at the meta sudans again for the fourth time at this inconvenient hour what news have you for me none except that after to morrow my mistress starts for her villa at cajeta and of course i go with her i shall want more money to carry on my operations in your favor more still you have had all i have received from my father for months why do you know what fabiola is yes to be sure the richest match in rome the haughty and cold hearted fabiola is not so easily to be won but yet you promised me that your charms and potions would secure me her acceptance or at any rate her fortune what expense can these things cause illustration the appian way as it was very great indeed the most precious ingredients are requisite and must be paid for and do you think i will go out at such an hour as this amidst the tombs of the appian way to gather my simples without being properly rewarded but how do you mean to second my efforts i have told you this would hasten their success and how can i you know i am not cut out by nature or fitted by accomplishments to make much impression on any ones affections i would rather trust to the power of your black art then let me give you one piece of advice if you have no grace or gift by which you can gain fabiolas heart fortune you mean they cannot be separated depend upon it there is one thing which you may bring with you that is irresistible what is that gold and where am i to get it it is that i seek the black slave smiled maliciously and said why cannot you get it as fulvius does how does he get it by blood how do you know it i have made acquaintance with an old attendant that he has who if not as dark as i am in skin fully makes up for it in his heart his language and mine are sufficiently allied for us to be able to converse he has asked me many questions about poisons and pretended he would purchase my liberty and take me back home as his wife but i have something better than that in prospect i trust however i got all that i wanted out from him and what was that why that fulvius had discovered a great conspiracy against dioclesian and from the wink of the old mans awful eye i understood he had hatched it first and he has been sent with strong recommendations to rome to be employed in the same line but i have no ability either to make or to discover conspiracies though i may have to punish them one way however is easy what is that in my country there are large birds which you may attempt in vain to run down with the fleetest horses but which if you look about for them quietly are the first to betray themselves for they only hide their heads what do you wish to represent by this the christians is there not going to be a persecution of them soon yes and a most fierce one such as has never been before then follow my advice do not tire yourself with hunting them down and catching after all but mean prey keep your eyes open and look about for one or two good fat ones half trying to conceal themselves pounce upon them get a good share of their confiscation and come with one good handful to get two in return thank you thank you i understand you you are not fond of these christians then fond of them i hate the entire race the spirits which i worship are the deadly enemies of their very name and she grinned horrible a ghastly smile as she proceeded i suspect one of my fellow servants is one oh how i detest her what makes you think it in the first place she would not tell a lie for anything and gets us all into dreadful scrapes by her absurd truthfulness good what next then she cares not for money or gifts and so prevents our having them offered better and moreover she is the last word died in the ear of corvinus who replied well indeed i have to day been out of the gate to meet a caravan of your countryfolk coming in but you beat them all indeed exclaimed afra with delight who were they simply africans replied corvinus with a laugh lions panthers leopards wretch do you insult me thus come come be pacified they are brought expressly to rid you of your hateful christians let us part friends here is your money but let it be the last and let me know when the philtres begin to work i will not forget your hint about christian money it is quite to my taste as he departed by the sacred way she pretended to go along the carin the street between the palatine and the clian mounts then turned back and looking after him exclaimed fool to think that i am going to try experiments for you on a person of fabiolas character she followed him at a distance but as sebastian to his amazement thought turned into the vestibule of the palace he determined at once to put fabiola on her guard against this new plot but this could not be done till her return from the country illustration emblematic representation of paradise found in the catacombs chapter x other meetings when the two youths returned to the room by which they had entered the apartment they found the expected company assembled a frugal repast was laid upon the table principally as a blind to any intruder who might happen unexpectedly to enter the assembly was large and varied containing clergy and laity men and women the purpose of the meeting was to concert proper measures in consequence of something which had lately occurred in the palace this we must briefly explain sebastian enjoying the unbounded confidence of the emperor employed all his influence in propagating the christian faith within the palace numerous conversions had gradually been made but shortly before this period there had been a wholesale one effected the particulars of which are recorded in the genuine acts of this glorious soldier in virtue of former laws many christians were seized and brought to trial which often ended in death two brothers marcus and marcellianus had been so accused and were expecting execution when their friends admitted to see them implored them with tears to save their lives by apostasy they seemed to waver they promised to deliberate sebastian heard of this and rushed to save them he was too well known to be refused admittance and he entered into their gloomy prison like an angel of light it consisted of a strong room in the house of the magistrate to whose care they had been intrusted the place of confinement was generally left to that officer and here tranquillinus the father of the two youths had obtained a respite for them of thirty days to try to shake their constancy and to second his efforts nicostratus the magistrate had placed them in custody in his own house sebastians was a bold and perilous office besides the two christian captives there were gathered in the place sixteen heathen prisoners there were the parents of the unfortunate youths weeping over them and caressing them to allure them from their threatened doom there was the gaoler claudius and there was the magistrate nicostratus with his wife zo drawn thither by the compassionate wish of seeing the youths snatched from their fate could sebastian hope that of this crowd not one would be found whom a sense of official duty or a hope of pardon or hatred of christianity might impel to betray him if he avowed himself a christian and did he not know that such a betrayal involved his death illustration saint sebastian from the roma sotteranea of de rossi he knew it well but what cared he if three victims would thus be offered to god instead of two so much the better all that he dreaded was that there should be none the room was a banqueting hall but seldom opened in the day and consequently requiring very little light what it had entered only as in the pantheon by an opening in the roof and sebastian anxious to be seen by all stood in the ray which now darted through it strong and brilliant where it beat but leaving the rest of the apartment almost dark it broke against the gold and jewels of his rich tribunes armor and as he moved scattered itself in sparks of brilliant hues into the darkest recesses of that gloom while it beamed with serene steadiness upon his uncovered head and displayed his noble features softened by an emotion of tender grief as he looked upon the two vacillating confessors it was some moments before he could give vent in words to the violence of his grief till at length it broke forth in impassioned tones illustration military tribunes after a bas relief on trajans column holy and venerable brothers he exclaimed who have borne witness to christ who are imprisoned for him whose limbs are marked by chains worn for his sake who have tasted torments with him i ought to fall at your feet and do you homage and ask your prayers instead of standing before you as your exhorter still less as your reprover can this be true which i have heard that while angels were putting the last flower to your crowns you have bid them pause and even thought of telling them to unweave them and scatter their blossoms to the winds can i believe that you who have already your feet on the threshold of paradise are thinking of drawing them back to tread once more the valley of exile and of tears the two youths hung down their heads and wept in humble confession of their weakness sebastian proceeded you cannot meet the eye of a poor soldier like me the least of christs servants how then will you stand the angry glance of the lord whom you are about to deny before men but cannot in your hearts deny on that terrible day when he in return will deny you before his angels when instead of standing manfully before him like good and faithful servants as to morrow ye might have done you shall have to come into his presence after having crawled through a few more years of infamy disowned by the church despised by its enemies and what is worse gnawed by an undying worm and victims of a sleepless remorse cease oh in pity cease young man whoever thou art exclaimed tranquillinus the father of the youths speak not thus severely to my sons it was i assure thee to their mothers tears and to my entreaties that they had begun to yield and not to the tortures which they have endured with such fortitude why should they leave their wretched parents to misery and sorrow does thy religion command this and dost thou call it holy wait in patience my good old man said sebastian with the kindest look and accent and let me speak first with thy sons they know what i mean which thou canst not yet but with gods grace thou too shalt soon your father indeed is right in saying that for his sake and your mothers you have been deliberating whether you should not prefer them to him who told you he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me you cannot hope to purchase for these your aged parents eternal life by your own loss of it will you make them christians by abandoning christianity will you make them soldiers of the cross by deserting its standard will you teach them that its doctrines are more precious than life by preferring life to them do you want to gain for them not the mortal life of the perishable body but the eternal life of the soul then hasten yourselves to its acquisition throw down at the feet of your saviour the crowns you will receive and entreat for your parents salvation enough enough sebastian we are resolved cried out together both the brothers claudius said one put on me again the chains you have taken off nicostratus added the other give orders for the sentence to be carried out yet neither claudius nor nicostratus moved farewell dear father adieu dearest mother they in turn said embracing their parents no replied the father we part no more nicostratus go tell chromatius that i am from this moment a christian with my sons i will die with them for a religion which can make heroes thus of boys and i continued the mother will not be separated from my husband and children the scene which followed baffles description all were moved all wept the prisoners joined in the tumult of these new affections and sebastian saw himself surrounded by a group of men and women smitten by grace softened by its influences and subdued by its power yet all was lost if one remained behind he saw the danger not to himself but to the church if a sudden discovery were made and to those souls fluttering upon the confines of life some hung upon his arms some clasped his knees some kissed his feet as though he had been a spirit of peace such as visited peter in his dungeon at jerusalem two alone had expressed no thought nicostratus was indeed moved but by no means conquered his feelings were agitated but his convictions unshaken his wife zo knelt before sebastian with a beseeching look and outstretched arms but she spoke not a word come sebastian said the keeper of the records for such was nicostratuss office it is time for thee to depart i cannot but admire the sincerity of belief and the generosity of heart which can make thee act as thou hast done and which impel these young men to death but my duty is imperative and must overweigh my private feelings and dost not thou believe with the rest no sebastian i yield not so easily i must have stronger evidences than even thy virtue oh speak to him then thou said sebastian to zo speak faithful wife speak to thy husbands heart for i am mistaken indeed if those looks of thine tell me not that thou at least believest zo covered her face with her hands and burst into a passion of tears thou hast touched her to the quick sebastian said her husband knowest thou not that she is dumb i knew it not noble nicostratus for when last i saw her in asia she could speak for six years replied the other with a faltering voice her once eloquent tongue has been paralyzed and she has not uttered a single word sebastian was silent for a moment then suddenly he threw out his arms and stretched them forth as the christians always did in prayer and raised his eyes to heaven then burst forth in these words o god father of our lord jesus christ the beginning of this work is thine let its accomplishment be thine alone put forth thy power for it is needed intrust it for once to the weakest and poorest of instruments let me though most unworthy so wield the sword of thy victorious cross as that the spirits of darkness may fly before it and thy salvation may embrace us all zo look up once more to me all were hushed in silence when sebastian after a moments silent prayer with his right hand made over her mouth the sign of the cross saying zo speak dost thou believe i believe in the lord jesus christ she replied in a clear and firm voice and fell upon sebastians feet it was almost a shriek that nicostratus uttered as he threw himself on his knees and bathed sebastians right hand with tears the victory was complete every one was gained and immediate steps were taken to prevent discovery the person responsible for the prisoners could take them where he wished and nicostratus transferred them all with tranquillinus and his wife to the full liberty of his house sebastian lost no time in putting them under the care of the holy priest polycarp of the title of st pastor it was a case so peculiar and requiring such concealment and the times were so threatening and all new irritations had so much to be avoided that the instruction was hurried and continued night and day so that baptism was quickly administered the new christian flock was encouraged and consoled by a fresh wonder tranquillinus who was suffering severely from the gout was restored to instant and complete health by baptism chromatius was the prefect of the city to whom nicostratus was liable for his prisoners and this officer could not long conceal from him what had happened it was indeed a matter of life or death to them all but strengthened now by faith they were prepared for either chromatius was a man of upright character and not fond of persecution and listened with interest to the account of what had occurred but when he heard of tranquillinuss cure he was greatly struck he was himself a victim to the same disease and suffered agonies of pain if he said what you relate be true and if i can have personal experience of this healing power i certainly will not resist its evidence sebastian was sent for to have administered baptism without faith preceding as an experiment of its healing virtue would have been a superstition sebastian took another course which will be later described and chromatius completely recovered he received baptism soon after with his son tibertius it was clearly impossible for him to continue in his office and he had accordingly resigned it to the emperor tertullus the father of the hopeful corvinus and prefect of the prtorium had been named his successor so the reader will perceive that the events just related from the acts of st sebastian had occurred a little before our narrative begins for in an early chapter we spoke of corvinuss father as already prefect of the city let us now come down again to the evening in which sebastian and pancratius met most of the persons above enumerated in the officers chamber many of them resided in or about the palace and besides them were present castulus who held a high situation at court and his wife irene several previous meetings had been held to decide upon some plan for securing the completer instruction of the converts and for withdrawing from observation so many persons whose change of life and retirement from office would excite wonder and inquiry sebastian had obtained permission from the emperor for chromatius to retire to a country house in campania and it had been arranged that a considerable number of the neophytes should join him there and forming one household should go on with religious instruction and unite in common offices of piety the season was come when every body retired to the country and the emperor himself was going to the coast of naples and thence would take a journey to southern italy it was therefore a favorable moment for carrying out the preconcerted plan indeed the pope we are told on the sunday following this conversion celebrated the divine mysteries in the house of nicostratus and proposed this withdrawal from the city illustration the roman forum at this meeting all details were arranged different parties were to start in the course of the following days by various roads some direct by the appian some along the latin others round by tibur and a mountain road through arpinum but all were to meet at the villa not far from capua through the whole discussion of these somewhat tedious arrangements torquatus one of the former prisoners converted by sebastians visit showed himself forward impatient and impetuous he found fault with every plan seemed discontented with the directions given him spoke almost contemptuously of this flight from danger as he called it and boasted that for his part he was ready to go into the forum on the morrow and overthrow any altar or confront any judge as a christian every thing was said and done to soothe and even to cool him and it was felt to be most important that he should be taken with the rest into the country he insisted however upon going his own way only one more point remained to be decided it was who should head the little colony and direct its operations here was renewed a contest of love between the holy priest polycarp and sebastian each wishing to remain in rome and have the first chance of martyrdom but now the difference was cut short by a letter brought in from the pope addressed to his beloved son polycarp priest of the title of st pastor in which he commanded him to accompany the converts and leave sebastian to the arduous duty of encouraging confessors and protecting christians in rome to hear was to obey and the meeting broke up with a prayer of thanksgiving sebastian after bidding affectionate farewell to his friends insisted upon accompanying pancratius home as they were leaving the room the latter remarked sebastian i do not like that torquatus i fear he will give us trouble to tell the truth answered the soldier i would rather he were different but we must remember that he is a neophyte and will improve in time and by grace as they passed into the entrance court of the palace they heard a babel of uncouth sounds with coarse laughter and occasional yells proceeding from the adjoining yard in which were the quarters of the mauritanian archers a fire seemed to be blazing in the midst of it for the smoke and sparks rose above the surrounding porticoes sebastian accosted the sentinel in the court where they were and asked friend what is going on there among our neighbors the black slave he replied who is their priestess and who is betrothed to their captain if she can purchase her freedom has come in for some midnight rites and this horrid turmoil takes place every time she comes indeed said pancratius and can you tell me what is the religion these africans follow i do not know sir replied the legionary unless they be what are called christians what makes you think so why i have heard that the christians meet by night and sing detestable songs and commit all sorts of crimes and cook and eat the flesh of a child murdered for the purpose just what might seem to be going on here good night comrade said sebastian and then exclaimed as they were issuing from the vestibule is it not strange pancratius that in spite of all our efforts we who are conscious that we worship only the one living god in spirit and truth who know what care we take to keep ourselves undefiled by sin and who would die rather than speak an unclean word should yet after years be confounded by the people with the followers of the most degraded superstitions and have our worship ranked with the very idolatry which above all things we abhor how long o lord how long so long said pancratius pausing on the steps outside the vestibule and looking at the now declining moon so long as we shall continue to walk in this pale light and until the sun of justice shall rise upon our country in his beauty and enrich it with his splendor sebastian tell me whence do you best like to see the sun rise the most lovely sunrise i have ever seen replied the soldier as if humoring his companions fanciful question was from the top of the latial mountain by the temple of jupiter the sun rose behind the mountain and projected its huge shadow like a pyramid over the plain and far upon the sea then as it rose higher this lessened and withdrew and every moment some new object caught the light first the galleys and skiffs upon the water then the shore with its dancing waves and by degrees one white edifice after the other sparkled in the fresh beams till at last majestic rome itself with its towering pinnacles basked in the effulgence of day it was a glorious sight indeed such as could not have been witnessed or imagined by those below just what i should have expected sebastian observed pancratius and so it will be when that more brilliant sun rises fully upon this benighted country how beautiful will it then be to behold the shades retiring and each moment one and another of the charms as yet concealed of our holy faith and worship starting into light till the imperial city itself shines forth a holy type of the city of god will they who live in those times see these beauties and worthily value them or will they look only at the narrow space around them and hold their hands before their eyes to shade them from the sudden glare i know not dear sebastian but i hope that you and i will look down upon that grand spectacle from where alone it can be duly appreciated from a mountain higher than jupiters be he alban or be he olympian dwelling on that holy mount whereon stands the lamb from whose feet flow the streams of life they continued their walk in silence through the brilliantly lighted streets and when they had reached lucinas house and had affectionately bid one another good night pancratius seemed to hesitate a moment and then said sebastian you said something this evening which i should much like to have explained what was it when you were contending with polycarp about going into campania or remaining in rome you promised that if you stayed you would be most cautious and not expose yourself to unnecessary risks then you added that there was one purpose in your mind which would effectually restrain you but that when that was accomplished you would find it difficult to check your longing ardor to give your life for christ and why pancratius do you desire so much to know this foolish thought of mine because i own i am really curious to learn what can be the object high enough to check in you the aspiration after what i know you consider to be the very highest of a christians aim i am sorry my dear boy that it is not in my power to tell you now but you shall know it sometime do you promise me yes most solemnly god bless you illustration a lamb with a milk can found in the catacomb of ss peter and marcellin chapter xi a talk with the reader we will take advantage of the holiday which rome is enjoying sending out its inhabitants to the neighboring hills or to the whole line of sea coast from genoa to pstum for amusement on land and water and in a merely didactic way endeavor to communicate to our reader some information which may throw light on what we have already written and prepare him for what will follow from the very compressed form in which the early history of the church is generally studied and from the unchronological arrangement of the saints biographies as we usually read them we may easily be led to an erroneous idea of the state of our first christian ancestors this may happen in two different ways we may come to imagine that during the first three centuries the church was suffering unrespited under active persecution that the faithful worshipped in fear and trembling and almost lived in the catacombs that bare existence with scarcely an opportunity for outward development or inward organization none for splendor was all that religion could enjoy that in fine it was a period of conflict and of tribulation without an interval of peace or consolation on the other hand we may suppose that those three centuries were divided into epochs by ten distinct persecutions some of longer and some of shorter duration but definitely separated from one another by breathing times of complete rest either of these views is erroneous and we desire to state more accurately the real condition of the christian church under the various circumstances of that most pregnant portion of her history when once persecution had broken loose upon the church it may be said never entirely to have relaxed its hold till her final pacification under constantine an edict of persecution once issued by an emperor was seldom recalled and though the rigor of its enforcement might gradually relax or cease through the accession of a milder ruler still it never became completely a dead letter but was a dangerous weapon in the hands of a cruel or bigoted governor of a city or province hence in the intervals between the greater general persecutions ordered by a new decree we find many martyrs who owed their crowns either to popular fury or to the hatred of christianity in local rulers hence also we read of a bitter persecution being carried on in one part of the empire while other portions enjoyed complete peace perhaps a few examples of the various phases of persecution will illustrate the real relations of the primitive church with the state better than mere description and the more learned reader can pass over this digression or must have the patience to hear repeated what he is so familiar with that it will seem commonplace trajan was by no means one of the cruel emperors on the contrary he was habitually just and merciful yet though he published no new edicts against the christians many noble martyrs amongst them st ignatius bishop of antioch at rome and st simeon at jerusalem glorified their lord in his reign indeed when pliny the younger consulted him on the manner in which he should deal with illustration st ignatius bishop of antioch christians who might be brought before him as governor of bithynia the emperor gave him a rule which exhibits the lowest standard of justice that they were not to be sought out but if accused they were to be punished adrian who issued no decree of persecution gave a similar reply to a similar question from serenius granianus pro consul of asia and under him too and even by his own orders cruel martyrdom was suffered by the intrepid symphorosa and her seven sons at tibur or tivoli a beautiful inscription found in the catacombs mentions marius a young officer who shed his blood for christ under this emperor indeed st justin martyr the great apologist of christianity informs us that he owed his conversion to the constancy of the martyrs under this emperor in like manner before the emperor septimus severus had published his persecuting edicts many christians had suffered torments and death such were the celebrated martyrs of scillita in africa and ss perpetua and felicitas with their companions the acts of whose martyrdom containing the diary of the first noble lady twenty years of age brought down by herself to the eve of her death form one of the most touching and exquisitely beautiful documents preserved to us from the ancient church from these historical facts it will be evident that while there was from time to time a more active severe and general persecution of the christian name all through the empire there were partial and local cessations and sometimes even a general suspension of its rigor an occurrence of this sort has secured for us most interesting information connected with our subject when the persecution of severus had relaxed in other parts it happened that scapula pro consul of africa prolonged it in his province with unrelenting cruelty he had condemned among others mavilus of adrumetum to be devoured by beasts when he was seized with a severe illness tertullian the oldest christian latin writer addressed a letter to him in which he bids him take warning from this visitation and repent of his crimes reminding him of many judgments which had befallen cruel judges of the christians in various parts of the world yet such was the charity of those holy men that he tells him they were offering up earnest prayers for their enemys recovery he then goes on to inform him that he may very well fulfil his duties without practising cruelty by acting as other magistrates had done for instance cincius severus suggested to the accused the answers they should make to be acquitted vespronius candidus dismissed a christian on the ground that his condemnation would encourage tumults asper seeing one ready to yield upon the application of slight torments would not press him further and expressed regret that such a case should have been brought before him pudens on reading an act of accusation declared the title informal because calumnious and tore it up we thus see how much might depend upon the temper and perhaps the tendencies of governors and judges in the enforcing even of imperial edicts of persecution and st ambrose tells us that some governors boasted that they had brought back from their provinces their swords unstained with blood incruentos enses we can also easily understand how at any particular time a savage persecution might rage in gaul or africa or asia while the main part of the church was enjoying peace but rome was undoubtedly the place most subject to frequent outbreaks of the hostile spirit so that it might be considered as the privilege of its pontiffs during the first three centuries to bear the witness of blood to the faith which they taught to be elected pope was equivalent to being promoted to martyrdom at the period of our narrative the church was in one of those longer intervals of comparative peace which gave opportunity for great development from the death of valerian in there had been no new formal persecution though the interval is glorified by many noble martyrdoms during such periods the christians were able to carry out their religious system with completeness and even with splendor the city was divided into districts or parishes each having its title or church served by priests deacons and inferior ministers the poor were supported the sick visited catechumens instructed the sacraments were administered daily worship was practised and the penitential canons were enforced by the clergy of each title and collections were made for these purposes and others connected with religious charity and its consequence hospitality it is recorded that in during the pontificate of cornelius there were in rome forty six priests a hundred and fifty four inferior ministers who were supported by the alms of the faithful together with fifteen hundred poor this number of the priests pretty nearly corresponds to that of the titles which st optatus tells us there were in rome although the tombs of the martyrs in the catacombs continued to be objects of devotion during these more peaceful intervals and these asylums of the persecuted were kept in order and repair they did not then serve for the ordinary places of worship the churches to which we have already alluded were often public large and even splendid and heathens used to be present at the sermons delivered in them and such portions of the liturgy as were open to catechumens but generally they were in private houses probably made out of the large halls or triclinia which the nobler mansions contained thus we know that many of the titles in rome were originally of that character tertullian mentions christian cemeteries under a name and with circumstances which show that they were above ground for he compares them to threshing floors which were necessarily exposed to the air a custom of ancient roman life will remove an objection which may arise as to how considerable multitudes could assemble in these places without attracting attention and consequently persecution it was usual for what may be called a leve to be held every morning by the rich attended by dependents or clients and messengers from their friends either slaves or freedmen some of whom were admitted into illustration the sacrament of penance in the early ages of the church the inner court to the masters presence while others only presented themselves and were dismissed hundreds might thus go in and out of a great house in addition to the crowd of domestic slaves tradespeople and others who had access to it through the principal or the back entrance and little or no notice would be taken of the circumstance there is another important phenomenon in the social life of the early christians which one would hardly know how to believe were not evidence of it brought before us in the most authentic acts of the martyrs and in ecclesiastical history it is the concealment which they contrived to practise no doubt can be entertained that persons were moving in the highest society were occupying conspicuous public situations were near the persons of the emperors who were christians and yet were not suspected to be such by their most intimate heathen friends nay cases occurred where the nearest relations were kept in total ignorance on this subject no lie no dissembling no action especially inconsistent with christian morality or christian truth was ever permitted to ensure such secrecy but every precaution compatible with complete uprightness was taken to conceal christianity from the public eye however necessary this prudential course might be to prevent any wanton persecution its consequences fell often heavily upon those who held it the heathen world the world of power of influence and of state the world which made laws as best suited it and executed them the world that loved earthly prosperity and hated faith felt itself surrounded filled compenetrated by a mysterious system which spread no one could see how and exercised an influence derived no one knew whence families were startled at finding a son or daughter to have embraced this new law with which they were not aware that they had been in contact and which in their heated fancies and popular views they considered stupid grovelling and anti social hence the hatred of christianity was political as well as religious the system was considered as un roman as having an interest opposed to the extension and prosperity of the empire and as obeying an unseen and spiritual power the christians were pronounced irreligiosi in csares disloyal to the emperors and that was enough hence their security and peace depended much upon the state of popular feeling when any demagogue or fanatic could succeed in rousing this neither their denial of the charges brought against them nor their peaceful demeanor nor the claims of civilized life could suffice to screen them from such measure of persecution as could be safely urged against them after these digressive remarks we will resume and unite again the broken thread of our narrative illustration a monogram of christ chapter xii the wolf and the fox the hints of the african slave had not been thrown away upon the sordid mind of corvinus her own hatred of christianity arose from the circumstance that a former mistress of hers had become a christian and had manumitted all her other slaves but feeling it wrong to turn so dangerous a character as afra or rather jubala her proper name upon the world had transferred her to another proprietor corvinus had often seen fulvius at the baths and other places of public resort had admired and envied him for his appearance his dress his conversation but with his untoward shyness or moroseness he could never have found courage to address him had he not now discovered that though a more refined he was not a less profound villain than himself fulviuss wit and cleverness might supply the want of these qualities in his own sottish composition while his own brute force and unfeeling recklessness might be valuable auxiliaries to those higher gifts he had the young stranger in his power by the discovery which he had made of his real character he determined therefore to make an effort and enter into alliance with one who otherwise might prove a dangerous rival it was about ten days after the meeting last described that corvinus went to stroll in pompeys gardens these covered the space round his theatre in the neighborhood of the present piazza farnese a conflagration in the reign of carinus had lately destroyed the scene as it was called of the edifice and dioclesian had repaired it with great magnificence the gardens were distinguished from others by rows of plane trees which formed a delicious shade statues of wild beasts fountains and artificial brooks profusely adorned them while sauntering about corvinus caught a sight of fulvius and made up to him illustration roman gardens from an old painting what do you want with me asked the foreigner with a look of surprise and scorn at the slovenly dress of corvinus to have a talk with you which may turn out to your advantage and mine what can you propose to me with the first of these recommendations no doubt at all as to the second fulvius i am a plain spoken man and have no pretensions to your cleverness and elegance but we are both of one trade and both consequently of one mind fulvius started and deeply colored then said with a contemptuous air what do you mean sirrah if you double your fist rejoined corvinus to show me the fine rings on your delicate fingers it is very well but if you mean to threaten by it you may as well put your hand again into the folds of your toga it is more graceful cut this matter short sir again i ask what do you mean this fulvius and he whispered into his ear that you are a spy and an informer fulvius was staggered then rallying said what right have you to make such an odious charge against me you discovered with a strong emphasis a conspiracy in the east and dioclesian fulvius stopped him and asked what is your name and who are you i am corvinus the son of tertullus prefect of the city this seemed to account for all and fulvius said in subdued tones no more here i see friends coming meet me disguised at daybreak to morrow in the patrician street under the portico of the baths of novatus we will talk more at leisure corvinus returned home not ill satisfied with his first attempt at diplomacy he procured a garment shabbier than his own from one of his fathers slaves and was at the appointed spot by the first dawn of day he had to wait a long time and had almost lost patience when he saw his new friend approach fulvius was well wrapped up in a large overcoat and wore its hood over his face he thus saluted corvinus good morning comrade i fear i have kept you waiting in the cold morning air especially as you are thinly clad i own replied corvinus that i should have been tired had i not been immensely amused and yet puzzled by what i have been observing what is that why from an early hour long i suspect before my coming there have been arriving here from every side and entering into that house by the back door in the narrow street the rarest collection of miserable objects that you ever saw the blind the lame the maimed the decrepit the deformed of every possible shape while by the front door several persons have entered evidently of a different class whose dwelling is it do you know it looks a large old house but rather out of condition it belongs to a very rich and it is said very miserly old patrician but look there come some more at that moment a very feeble man bent down by age was approaching supported by a young and cheerful girl who chatted most kindly to him as she supported him we are just there she said to him a few more steps and you shall sit down and rest thank you my child replied the poor old man how kind of you to come for me so early i knew she said you would want help and as i am the most useless person about i thought i would go and fetch you i have always heard that blind people are selfish and it seems but natural but you ccilia are certainly an exception not at all this is only my way of showing selfishness how do you mean why first i get the advantage of your eyes and then i get the satisfaction of supporting you i was an eye to the blind that is you and a foot to the lame that is myself they reached the door as she spoke these words that girl is blind said fulvius to corvinus do you not see how straight she walks without looking right or left so she is answered the other surely this is not the place so often spoken of where beggars meet and the blind see and the lame walk and all feast together but yet i observed these people were so different from the mendicants on the arician bridge they appeared respectable and even cheerful and not one asked me for alms as he passed it is very strange and i should like to discover the mystery a good job might perhaps be got out of it the old patrician you say is very rich immensely humph how could one manage to get in i have it i will take off my shoes screw up one leg like a cripple and join the next group of queer ones that come and go boldly in doing as they do that will hardly succeed depend upon it every one of these people is known at the house i am sure not for several of them asked me if this was the house of the lady agnes of whom asked fulvius with a start why do you look so said corvinus it is the house of her parents but she is better known than they as being a young heiress nearly as rich as her cousin fabiola fulvius paused for a moment a strong suspicion too subtle and important to be communicated to his rude companion flashed through his mind he said therefore to corvinus if you are sure that these people are not familiar at the house try your plan i have met the lady before and will venture by the front door thus we shall have a double chance do you know what i am thinking fulvius something very bright no doubt that when you and i join in any enterprise we shall always have two chances what are they the foxs and the wolfs when they conspire to rob a fold fulvius cast on him a look of disdain which corvinus returned by a hideous leer and they separated for their respective posts illustration a lamp with the monogram of christ chapter xiii charity as we do not choose to enter the house of agnes either with the wolf or with the fox we will take a more spiritual mode of doing so and find ourselves at once inside the parents of agnes represented noble lines of ancestry and her family was not one of recent conversion but had for several generations professed the faith as in heathen families was cherished the memory of ancestors who had won a triumph or held high offices in the state so in this and other christian houses was preserved with pious reverence and affectionate pride the remembrance of those relations who had in the last hundred and fifty years or more borne the palm of martyrdom or occupied the sublimer dignities of the church but though ennobled thus and with a constant stream of blood poured forth for christ accompanying the waving branches of the family tree the stem had never been hewn down but had survived repeated storms this may appear surprising but when we reflect how many a soldier goes through a whole campaign of frequent actions and does not receive a wound or how many a family remains untainted through a plague we cannot be surprised if providence watched over the well being of the church by preserving in it through old family successions long unbroken chains of tradition and so enabling the faithful to say unless the lord of hosts had left us seed we had been as sodom and we should have been like to gomorrha all the honors and the hopes of this family centred now in one whose name is already known to our readers agnes the only child of that ancient house given to her parents as they had reached the very verge of hope that their line could be continued she had been from infancy blest with such a sweetness of disposition such a docility and intelligence of mind and such simplicity and innocence of character that she had grown up the common object of love and almost of reverence to the entire house from her parents down to the lowest servant yet nothing seemed to spoil or warp the compact virtuousness of her nature but her good qualities expanded with a well balanced adjustment which at the early age in which we find her had ripened into combined grace and wisdom she shared all her parents virtuous thoughts and cared as little for the world as they she lived with them in a small portion of the mansion which was fitted up with elegance though not with luxury and their establishment was adequate to all their wants here they received the few friends with whom they preserved familiar relations though as they did not entertain nor go out these were few fabiola was an occasional visitor though agnes preferred going to see her at her house and she often expressed to her young friend her longing for the day when meeting with a suitable match she would re embellish and open all the splendid dwelling for notwithstanding the voconian law on the inheritance of women now quite obsolete agnes had received from collateral sources large personal additions to the family property in general of course the heathen world who visited attributed appearances to avarice and calculated what immense accumulations of wealth the miserly parents must be putting by and concluded that all beyond the solid screen which shut up the second court was left to fall into decay and ruin it was not so however the inner part of the house consisting of a large court and the garden with a detached dining hall or triclinium turned into a church and the upper portion of the house accessible from those parts were devoted to the administration of that copious charity which the church carried on as a business of its life it was under the care and direction of the deacon reparatus and his exorcist secundus officially appointed by the supreme pontiff to take care of the sick poor and strangers in one of the seven regions into which pope cajus about five years before had divided the city for this purpose committing each region to one of the seven deacons of the roman church illustration a deacon from de rossis roma sotteranea rooms were set apart for lodging strangers who came from a distance recommended by other churches and a frugal table was provided for them upstairs were apartments for an hospital for the bed ridden the decrepit and the sick under the care of the deaconesses and such of the faithful as loved to assist in this work of charity it was here that the blind girl had her cell though she refused to take her food as we have seen in the house the tablinum or muniment room which generally stood detached in the middle of the passage between the inner courts served as the office and archives for transacting the business of this charitable establishment and preserving all local documents such as the acts of martyrs procured or compiled by the one of the seven notaries kept for that purpose by institution of st clement i who was attached to that region a door of communication allowed the household to assist in these works of charity and agnes had been accustomed from childhood to run in and out many times a day and to pass hours there always beaming like an angel of light consolation and joy on the suffering and distressed this house then might be called the almonry of the region or district of charity and hospitality in which it was situated and it was accessible for these purposes through the posticum or back door situated in a narrow lane little frequented no wonder that with such an establishment the fortune of the inmates should find an easy application we heard pancratius request sebastian to arrange for the distribution of his plate and jewels among the poor without its being known to whom they belonged he had not lost sight of the commission and had fixed on the house of agnes as the fittest for this purpose on the morning which we have described the distribution had to take place other regions had sent their poor accompanied by their deacons while sebastian pancratius and other persons of higher rank had come in through the front door to assist in the division some of these had been seen to enter by corvinus illustration a fish carrying bread and wine from the cemetery of st lucina chapter xiv extremes meet a group of poor coming opportunely towards the door enabled corvinus to tack himself to them an admirable counterfeit in all but the modesty of their deportment he kept sufficiently close to them to hear that each of them as he entered in pronounced the words deo gratias thanks be to god this was not merely a christian but a catholic pass word for st augustine tells us that heretics ridiculed catholics for using it on the ground that it was not a salutation but rather a reply but that catholics employed it because consecrated by pious usage it is yet heard in italy on similar occasions corvinus pronounced the mystic words and was allowed to pass following the others closely and copying their manners and gestures he found himself in the inner court of the house which was already filled with the poor and infirm the men were ranged on one side the women on the other under the portico at the end were tables piled with costly plate and near them was another covered with brilliant jewelry two silver and goldsmiths were weighing and valuing most conscientiously this property and beside them was the money which they would give to be distributed amongst the poor in just proportion corvinus eyed all this with a gluttonous heart he would have given anything to get it all and almost thought of making a dash at something and running out but he saw at once the folly or madness of such a course and resolved to wait for a share and in the meantime take note for fulvius of all he saw he soon however became aware of the awkwardness of his present position while the poor were all mixed up together and moving about he remained unnoticed but he soon saw several young men of peculiarly gentle manners but active and evidently in authority dressed in the garment known to him by the name of dalmatic from its dalmatian origin that is having over the tunic instead of the toga a close fitting shorter tunicle with ample but not over long or wide sleeves the dress adopted and worn by the deacons not only at their more solemn ministrations in church but also when engaged in the discharge of their secondary duties about the sick and poor these officers went on marshalling the attendants each evidently knowing those of his own district and conducting them to a peculiar spot within the porticoes but as no one recognized or claimed corvinus for one of his poor he was at length left alone in the middle of the court even his dull mind could feel the anomalous situation into which he had thrust himself here he was the son of the prefect of the city whose duty it was to punish such violators of domestic rights an intruder into the innermost parts of a noblemans house having entered by a cheat dressed like a beggar and associating himself with such people of course for some sinister or at least unlawful purpose he looked towards the door meditating an escape but he saw it guarded by an old man named diogenes and his two stout sons who could hardly restrain their hot blood at this insolence though they only showed it by scowling looks and repressive biting of their lips he saw that he was a subject of consultation among the young deacons who cast occasional glances towards him he imagined that even the blind were staring at him and the decrepit ready to wield their crutches like battle axes against him he had only one consolation it was evident he was not known and he hoped to frame some excuse for getting out of the scrape at length the deacon reparatus came up to him and thus courteously accosted him friend you probably do not belong to one of the regions invited here to day where do you live in the region of the alta semita this answer gave the civil not the ecclesiastical division of rome still reparatus went on the alta semita is in my region yet i do not remember to have seen you while he spoke these words he was astonished to see the stranger turn deadly pale and totter as if about to fall while his eyes were fixed upon the door of communication with the dwelling house reparatus looked in the same direction and saw pancratius just entered and gathering some hasty information from secundus corvinuss last hope was gone he stood the next moment confronted with the youth who asked reparatus to retire much in the same position as they had last met in only that instead of a circle round him of applauders and backers he was here hemmed in on all sides by a multitude who evidently looked with preference upon his rival nor could corvinus help observing the graceful development and manly bearing which a few weeks had given his late school mate he expected a volley of keen reproach and perhaps such chastisement as he would himself have inflicted in similar circumstances what was his amazement when pancratius thus addressed him in the mildest tone corvinus are you really reduced to distress and lamed by some accident or how have you left your fathers house not quite come to that yet i hope replied the bully encouraged to insolence by the gentle address though no doubt you would be heartily glad to see it by no means i assure you i hold you no grudge if therefore you require relief tell me and though it is not right that you should be here i can take you into a private chamber where you can receive it unknown then i will tell you the truth i came in here merely for a freak and i should be glad if you could get me quietly out corvinus said the youth with some sternness this is a serious offence what would your father say if i desired these young men who would instantly obey to take you as you are barefoot clothed as a slave counterfeiting a cripple into the forum before his tribunal and publicly charge you with what every roman would resent forcing your way into the heart of a patricians house for the gods sakes good pancratius do not inflict such frightful punishment you know corvinus that your own father would be obliged to act towards you the part of junius brutus or forfeit his office i entreat you by all that you love by all that you hold sacred not to dishonor me and mine so cruelly my father and his house not i would be crushed and ruined for ever i will go on my knees and beg your pardon for my former injuries if you will only be merciful hold hold corvinus i have told you that was long forgotten but hear me now every one but the blind around you is a witness to this outrage there will be a hundred evidences to prove it if ever then you speak of this assembly still more if you attempt to molest any one for it we shall have it in our power to bring you to trial at your own fathers judgment seat do you understand me corvinus i do indeed replied the captive in a whining tone never as long as i live will i breathe to mortal soul that i came into this dreadful place i swear it by the hush hush we want no such oaths here take my arm and walk with me then turning to the others he continued i know this person his coming here is quite a mistake the spectators who had taken the wretchs supplicating gestures and tone for accompaniments to a tale of woe and strong application for relief joined in crying out pancratius you will not send him away fasting and unsuccored leave that to me was the reply the self appointed porters gave way before pancratius who led corvinus still pretending to limp into the street and dismissed him saying corvinus we are now quits only take care of your promise fulvius as we have seen went to try his fortune by the front door he found it according to roman custom unlocked and indeed no one could have suspected the possibility of a stranger entering at such an hour instead of a porter he found guarding the door only a simple looking girl about twelve or thirteen years of age clad in a peasants garment no one else was near and he thought it an excellent opportunity to verify the strong suspicion which had crossed his mind accordingly he thus addressed the little portress what is your name child and who are you i am she replied emerentiana the lady agness foster sister are you a christian he asked her sharply the poor little peasant opened her eyes in the amazement of ignorance and replied no sir it was impossible to resist the evidence of her simplicity and fulvius was satisfied that he was mistaken the fact was that she was the daughter of a peasant who had been agness nurse the mother had just died and her kind sister had sent for the orphan daughter intending to have her instructed and baptized she had only arrived a day or two before and was yet totally ignorant of christianity fulvius stood embarrassed what to do next solitude made him feel as awkwardly situated as a crowd was making corvinus he thought of retreating but this would have destroyed all his hopes he was going to advance when he reflected that he might commit himself unpleasantly at this critical juncture whom should he see coming lightly across the court but the youthful mistress of the house all joy all spring all brightness and sunshine as soon as she saw him she stood as if to receive his errand and he approached with his blandest smile and most courtly gesture and thus addressed her i have anticipated the usual hour at which visitors come and i fear must appear an intruder lady agnes but i was impatient to inscribe myself as an humble client of your noble house our house she replied smiling boasts of no clients nor do we seek them for we have no pretensions to influence or power pardon me with such a ruler it possesses the highest of influences and the mightiest of powers those which reign without effort over the heart as a most willing subject incapable of imagining that such words could allude to herself she replied with artless simplicity oh how true are your words the lord of this house is indeed the sovereign over the affections of all within it but i interposed fulvius allude to that softer and benigner dominion which graceful charms alone can exercise on those who from near behold them agnes looked as one entranced her eyes beheld a very different image before them from that of her wretched flatterer and with an impassioned glance towards heaven she exclaimed yes he whose beauty sun and moon in their lofty firmament gaze on and admire to him is pledged my service and my love fulvius was confounded and perplexed the inspired look the rapturous attitude the music of the thrilling tones in which she uttered these words their mysterious import the strangeness of the whole scene fastened him to the spot and sealed his lips till feeling that he was losing the most favorable opportunity he could ever expect of opening his mind affection it could not be called to her he boldly said it is of you i am speaking and i entreat you to believe my expression of sincerest admiration of you and of unbounded attachment to you as he uttered these words he dropt on his knee and attempted to take her hand but the maiden bounded back with a shudder and turned away her burning countenance fulvius started in an instant to his feet for he saw sebastian who was come to summon agnes to the poor impatient of her absence striding forward towards him with an air of indignation sebastian said agnes to him as he approached be not angry this gentleman has probably entered here by some unintentional mistake and no doubt will quietly retire saying this she withdrew sebastian with his calm but energetic manner now addressed the intruder who quailed beneath his look fulvius what do you here what business has brought you i suppose answered he regaining courage that having met the lady of the house at the same place with you her noble cousins table i have a right to wait upon her in common with other voluntary clients but not at so unreasonable an hour as this i presume the hour that is not unreasonable for a young officer retorted fulvius insolently is not i trust so for a civilian sebastian had to use all his power of self control to check his indignation as he replied fulvius be not rash in what you say but remember that two persons may be on a very different footing in a house yet not even the longest familiarity still less a one dinners acquaintance can authorize or justify the audacity of your bearing towards the young mistress of this house a few moments ago oh you are jealous i suppose brave captain replied fulvius with his most refined sarcastic tone report says that you are the acceptable if not accepted candidate for fabiolas hand she is now in the country and no doubt you wish to make sure for yourself of the fortune of one or the other of romes richest heiresses there is nothing like having two strings to ones bow this coarse and bitter sarcasm wounded the noble officers best feelings to the quick and had he not long before disciplined himself to christian meekness his blood would have proved too powerful for his reason it is not good for either of us fulvius that you remain longer here the courteous dismissal of the noble lady whom you have insulted has not sufficed i must be the ruder executor of her command saying this he took the unbidden guests arm in his powerful grasp and conducted him to the door when he had put him outside still holding him fast he added go now fulvius in peace and remember that you have this day made yourself amenable to the laws of the state by this unworthy conduct i will spare you if you know how to keep your own counsel but it is well that you should know that i am acquainted with your occupation in rome and that i hold this mornings insolence over your head as a security that you will follow it discreetly now again i say go in peace but he had no sooner let go his grasp than he felt himself seized from behind by an unseen but evidently an athletic assailant it was eurotas from whom fulvius durst conceal nothing and to whom he had confided the intended interview with corvinus that had followed and watched him from the black slave he had before learnt the mean and coarse character of this client of her magical arts and he feared some trap when he saw the seeming struggle at the door he ran stealthily behind sebastian who he fancied must be his pupils new ally and pounced upon him with a bears rude assault but he had no common rival to deal with he attempted in vain though now helped by fulvius to throw the soldier heavily down till despairing of success in this way he detached from his girdle a small but deadly weapon a steel mace of finished syrian make and was raising it over the back of sebastians head when he felt it wrenched in a trice from his hand and himself twirled two or three times round in an iron gripe and flung flat in the middle of the street i am afraid you have hurt the poor fellow quadratus said sebastian to his centurion who was coming up at that moment to join his fellow christians and was of most herculean make and strength he well deserves it tribune for his cowardly assault replied the other as they re entered the house the two foreigners crest fallen slunk away from the scene of their defeat and as they turned the corner caught a glimpse of corvinus no longer limping but running as fast as his legs would carry him from his discomfiture at the back door however often they may have met afterwards neither ever alluded to their feats of that morning each knew that the other had incurred only failure and shame and they came both to the conclusion that there was one fold at least in rome which either fox or wolf would assail in vain illustration a wall painting from the cemetery of st priscilla chapter xv charity returns when calm had been restored after this twofold disturbance the work of the day went quietly on besides the distribution of greater alms such as was made by st laurence from the church it was by no means so uncommon in early ages for fortunes to be given away at once by those who wished to retire from the world indeed we should naturally expect to find that the noble charity of the apostolic church at jerusalem would not be a barren example to that of rome but this extraordinary charity would be most naturally suggested at periods when the church was threatened with persecution and when christians who from position and circumstances might look forward to martyrdom would to use a homely phrase clear their hearts and houses for action by removing from both whatever could attach themselves to earth and become the spoil of the impious soldier instead of having been made the inheritance of the poor nor would the great principles be forgotten of making the light of good works to shine before

distributed to the poor must have been a bright example of charity which consoled the church animated the generous shamed the avaricious touched the heart of the catechumen and drew blessings and prayers from the lips of the poor and yet the individual right hand that gave them remained closely shrouded from the scrutiny or consciousness of the left and the humility and modesty of the noble giver remained concealed in his bosom into which these earthly treasures were laid up to be returned with boundless and eternal usury and such was the case in the instance before us when all was prepared dionysius the priest who at the same time was the physician to whom the care of the sick was committed and who had succeeded polycarp in the title of st pastor made his appearance and seated in a chair at one end of the court thus addressed the assembly dear brethren our merciful god has touched the heart of some charitable brother to have compassion on his poorer brethren and strip himself of much worldly possession for christs sake who he is i know not nor would i seek to know he is some one who loves not to have his treasures where rust consumes and thieves break in and steal but prefers like the blessed laurence that they should be borne up by the hands of christs poor into the heavenly treasury accept then as a gift from god who has inspired this charity the distribution which is about to be made and which may be a useful help in the days of tribulation which are preparing for us and as the only return which is desired from you join all in that familiar prayer which we daily recite for those who give or do us good during this brief address poor pancratius knew not which illustration st laurence displaying his treasures way to look he had shrunk into a corner behind the assistants and sebastian had compassionately stood before him making himself as large as possible and his emotion did all but betray him when the whole of that assembly knelt down and with outstretched hands uplifted eyes and fervent tone cried out as if with one voice retribuere dignare domine omnibus nobis bona facientibus propter nomen tuum vitam ternam amen the alms were then distributed and they proved unexpectedly large abundant food was also served out to all and a cheerful banquet closed the edifying scene it was yet early indeed many partook not of food as a still more delicious and spiritual feast was about to be prepared for them in the neighboring titular church when all was over ccilia insisted upon seeing her poor old cripple safe home and upon carrying for him his heavy canvas purse and chatted so cheerfully to him that he was surprised when he found they had reached the door of his poor but clean lodging his blind guide then thrust his purse into his hand and giving him a hurried good day tripped away most lightly and was soon lost to his sight the bag seemed uncommonly full so he counted carefully its contents and found to his amazement that he had a double portion he tried again and still it was so at the first opportunity he made inquiries from reparatus but could get no explanation if he had seen ccilia when she had turned the corner laugh outright as if she had been playing some one a good trick and running as lightly as if she had nothing heavy about her he might have discovered a solution of the problem of his wealth chapter xvi the month of october the month of october in italy is certainly a glorious season the sun has contracted his heat but not his splendor he is less scorching but not less bright as he rises in the morning he dashes sparks of radiance over awakening nature as an indian prince upon entering his presence chamber flings handfuls of gems and gold into the crowd and the mountains seem to stretch forth their rocky heads and the woods to wave their lofty arms in eagerness to catch his royal largess and after careering through a cloudless sky when he reaches his goal and finds his bed spread with molten gold on the western sea and canopied above with purple clouds edged with burnished yet airy fringes more brilliant than ophir supplied to the couch of solomon he expands himself into a huge disk of most benignant effulgence as if to bid farewell to his past course but soon sends back after disappearing radiant messengers from the world he is visiting and cheering to remind us he will soon come back and gladden us again if less powerful his ray is certainly richer and more active it has taken months to draw out of the sapless shrivelled vine stem first green leaves then crisp slender tendrils and last little clusters of hard sour berries and the growth has been provokingly slow but now the leaves are large and mantling and worthy in vine countries to have a name of their own and the separated little knots have swelled up into luxurious bunches of grapes and of these some are already assuming their bright amber tint while those which are to glow in rich imperial purple are passing rapidly to it through a changing opal hue scarcely less beautiful it is pleasant then to sit in a shady spot on a hill side and look ever and anon from ones book over the varied and varying landscape for as the breeze sweeps over the olives on the hill side and turns over their leaves it brings out from them light and shade for their two sides vary in sober tint and as the sun shines or the cloud darkens on the vineyards in the rounded hollows between the brilliant web of unstirring vine leaves displays a yellower or browner shade of its delicious green then mingle with these the innumerable other colors that tinge the picture from the dark cypress the duller ilex the rich chestnut the reddening orchard the adust stubble the melancholy pine to italy what the palm tree is to the east towering above the box and the arbutus and laurels of villas and these scattered all over the mountain hill and plain with fountains leaping up and cascades gliding down porticoes of glittering marble statues of bronze and stone painted fronts of rustic dwellings with flowers innumerable and patches of greensward and you have a faint idea of the attractions which for this month as in our days used to draw out the roman patrician and knight from what horace calls the clatter and smoke of rome to feast his eyes upon the calmer beauties of the country and so as the happy month approached villas were seen open to let in air and innumerable slaves were busy dusting and scouring trimming the hedges into fantastic shapes clearing the canals for the artificial brooklets and plucking up the weeds from the gravel walks the villicus or country steward superintends all and with sharp word or sharper lash makes many suffer that perhaps one only may enjoy at last the dusty roads become encumbered with every species of vehicle from the huge wain carrying furniture and slowly drawn by oxen to the light chariot or gig dashing on behind spirited barbs and as the best roads were narrow and the drivers of other days were not more smooth tongued than those of ours we may imagine what confusion and noise and squabbling filled the public ways nor was there a favored one among these sabine tusculan and alban hills were all studded over with splendid villas or humbler cottages such as a mcenas or a horace might respectively occupy even the flat campagna of rome is covered with the ruins of immense country residences while from the mouth of the tiber along the coast of laurentum lanuvium and antium and so on to cajeta baj and other fashionable watering places round vesuvius a street of noble residences may be said to have run nor were these limits sufficient to satisfy the periodical fever for rustication in rome the borders of benacus now the lago maggiore north of milan como and the beautiful banks of the brenta received their visitors not from neighboring cities only still less from wanderers of germanic origin but rather from the inhabitants of the imperial capital it was to one of these tender eyes of italy as pliny calls its villas because forming its truest beauty that fabiola had hastened before the rush on the road the day after her black slaves interview with corvinus it was situated on the slope of the hill which descends to the bay of gaeta and was remarkable like her house for the good taste which arranged the most costly though not luxurious elements of comfort from the terrace in front of the elegant villa could be seen the calm azure bay embowered in the richest of shores like a mirror in an embossed and enamelled frame relieved by the white sun lit sails of yachts galleys pleasure boats and fishing skiffs from some of which rose the roaring laugh of excursionists from others the song or harp notes of family parties or the loud sharp and not over refined ditties of the various ploughmen of the deep a gallery of lattice covered with creepers led to the baths on the shore and half way down was an opening on a favorite spot of green kept ever fresh by the gush from an out cropping rock of a crystal spring confined for a moment in a natural basin in which it bubbled and fretted till rushing over its ledge it went down murmuring and chattering in the most good natured way imaginable along the side of the trellis into the sea two enormous plane trees cast their shade over this classic ground as did platos and ciceros over their choice scenes of philosophical disquisition the most beautiful flowers and plants from distant climates had been taught to make this spot their home sheltered as it was equally from sultriness and from frost fabius for reasons which will be explained later seldom paid more than a flying visit for a couple of days to this villa and even then it was generally on his way to some gayer resort of roman fashion where he had or pretended to have business his daughter was therefore mostly alone and enjoyed a delicious solitude besides a well furnished library always kept at the villa chiefly containing works on agriculture or of a local interest a stock of books some old favorites other lighter productions of the season of which she generally procured an early copy at a high price was brought every year from rome together with a quantity of smaller familiar works of art such as distributed through new apartments make them become a home most of her morning hours were spent in the cherished retreat just described with a book casket at her side from which she selected first one volume and then another but any visitor calling upon her this year would have been surprised to find her almost always with a companion and that a slave we may imagine how amazed she was when the day following the dinner at her house agnes informed her that syra had declined leaving her service though tempted by a bribe of liberty still more astonished was she at learning that the reason was attachment to herself she could feel no pleasurable consciousness of having earned this affection by any acts of kindness nor even by any decent gratitude for her servants care of her in illness she was therefore at first inclined to think syra a fool for her pains but it would not do in her mind it was true she had often read or heard of instances of fidelity and devotedness in slaves even towards oppressive masters but these were always accounted as exceptions to the general rule and what were a few dozen cases in as many centuries of love compared with the daily ten thousand ones of hatred around her yet here was a clear and palpable one at hand and it struck her forcibly she waited a time and watched her maid eagerly to see if she could discover in her conduct any airs any symptom of thinking she had done a grand thing and that her mistress must feel it not in the least syra pursued all her duties with the same simple diligence and never betrayed any signs of believing herself less a slave than before fabiolas heart softened more and more and she now began to think that not quite so difficult which in her conversation with agnes she had pronounced impossible to love a slave and she had also discovered a second evidence that there was such a thing in the world as disinterested love affection that asked for no return her conversations with her slave after the memorable one which we have recounted had satisfied her that she had received a superior education she was too delicate to question her on her early history especially as masters often had young slaves highly educated to enhance their value but she soon discovered that she read greek and latin authors with ease and elegance and wrote well in both languages by degrees she raised her position to the great annoyance of her companions she ordered euphrosyne to give her a separate room the greatest of comforts to the poor maid and she employed her near herself as a secretary and reader still she could perceive no change in her conduct no pride no pretensions for the moment any work presented itself of the menial character formerly allotted to her she never seemed to think of turning it over to any one else but at once naturally and cheerfully set herself about it the reading generally pursued by fabiola was as has been previously observed of rather an abstruse and refined character consisting of philosophical literature she was surprised however to find how her slave by a simple remark would often confute an apparently solid maxim bring down a grand flight of virtuous declamation or suggest a higher view of moral truth or a more practical course of action than authors whom she had long admired proposed in their writings nor was this done by any apparent shrewdness of judgment or pungency of wit nor did it seem to come from much reading or deep thought or superiority of education for though she saw traces of this in syras words ideas and behavior yet the books and doctrines which she was reading now were evidently new to her but there seemed to be in her maids mind some latent but infallible standard of truth some master key which opened equally every closed deposit of moral knowledge some well attuned chord which vibrated in unfailing unison with what was just and right but jangled in dissonance with whatever was wrong vicious or even inaccurate what this secret was she wanted to discover it was more like an intuition than any thing she had before witnessed she was not yet in a condition to learn that the meanest and least in the kingdom of heaven and what lower than a slave was greater in spiritual wisdom intellectual light and heavenly privileges than even the baptist precursor it was on a delicious morning in october that reclining by the spring the mistress and slave were occupied in reading when the former wearied with the heaviness of the volume looked for something lighter and newer and drawing out a manuscript from her casket said syra put that stupid book down here is something i am told very amusing and only just come out it will be new to both of us the handmaid did as she was told looked at the title of the proposed volume and blushed she glanced over the few first lines and her fears were confirmed she saw that it was one of those trashy works which were freely allowed to circulate as st justin complained though grossly immoral and making light of all virtue while every christian writing was suppressed or as much as possible discountenanced she put down the book with a calm resolution and said do not my good mistress ask me to read to you from that book it is fit neither for me to recite nor for you to hear fabiola was astonished she had never heard or even thought of such a thing as restraint put upon her studies what in our days would be looked upon as unfit for common perusal formed part of current and fashionable literature from horace to ausonius all classical writers demonstrate this and what rule of virtue could have made that reading seem indelicate which only described by the pen a system of morals which the pencil and the chisel made hourly familiar to every eye fabiola had no higher standard of right and wrong than the system under which she had been educated could give her what possible harm can it do either of us she asked smiling i have no doubt there are plenty of foul crimes and wicked actions described in the book but it will not induce us to commit them and in the meantime it is amusing to read them of others would you yourself for any consideration do them not for the world yet as you hear them read their image must occupy your mind as they amuse you your thoughts must dwell upon them with pleasure certainly what then that image is foulness that thought is wickedness how is that possible does not wickedness require an action to have any existence true my mistress and what is the action of the mind or as i call it the soul but thought a passion which wishes death is the action of this invisible power like it unseen the blow which inflicts it is but the mechanical action of the body discernible like its origin but which power commands and which obeys in which resides the responsibility of the final effect i understand you said fabiola after a pause of some little mortification but one difficulty remains there is responsibility you maintain for the inward as well as the outward act to whom if the second follow there is joint responsibility for both to society to the laws to principles of justice to self for painful results will ensue but if only the inward action exist to whom can there be responsibility who sees it who can presume to judge it who to control it god answered syra with simple earnestness fabiola was disappointed she expected some new theory some striking principle to come out instead they had sunk down into what she feared was mere superstition though not so much as she once had deemed it what syra do you then really believe in jupiter and juno or perhaps minerva who is about the most respectable of the olympian family do you think they have any thing to do with our affairs far indeed from it i loathe their very names and i detest the wickedness which their histories or fables symbolize on earth no i spoke not of gods and goddesses but of one only god and what do you call him syra in your system he has no name but god and that only men have given him that they may speak of him it describes not his nature his origin his attributes and what are these asked the mistress with awakened curiosity simple as light is his nature one and the same every where indivisible undefilable penetrating yet diffusive ubiquitous and unlimited he existed before there was any beginning he will exist after all ending has ceased power wisdom goodness love justice too and unerring judgment belong to him by his nature and are as unlimited and unrestrained as it he alone can create he alone preserve and he alone destroy fabiola had often read of the inspired looks which animated a sibyl or the priestess of an oracle but she had never witnessed them till now the slaves countenance glowed her eyes shone with a calm brilliancy her frame was immovable the words flowed from her lips as if these were but the opening of a musical reed made vocal by anothers breath illustration interior of the temple of jupiter her expression and manner forcibly reminded fabiola of that abstracted and mysterious look which she had so often noticed in agnes and though in the child it was more tender and graceful in the maid it seemed more earnest and oracular how enthusiastic and excitable an eastern temperament is to be sure thought fabiola as she gazed upon her slave no wonder the east should be thought the land of poetry and inspiration when she saw syra relaxed from the evident tension of her mind she said in as light a tone as she could assume but syra can you think that a being such as you have described far beyond all the conception of ancient fable can occupy himself with constantly watching the actions still more the paltry thoughts of millions of creatures it is no occupation lady it is not even choice i called him light is it occupation or labor to the sun to send his rays through the crystal of this fountain to the very pebbles in its bed see how of themselves they disclose not only the beautiful but the foul that harbors there not only the sparkles that the falling drops strike from its rough sides not only the pearly bubbles that merely rise glisten for a moment then break against the surface not only the golden fish that bask in their light but black and loathsome creeping things which seek to hide and bury themselves in dark nooks below and cannot for the light pursues them is there toil or occupation in all this to the sun that thus visits them far more would it appear so were he to restrain his beams at the surface of the transparent element and hold them back from throwing it into light and what he does here he does in the next stream and in that which is a thousand miles off with equal ease nor can any imaginable increase of their number or bulk lead us to fancy or believe that rays would be wanting or light would fail to scrutinize them all your theories are beautiful always syra and if true most wonderful observed fabiola after a pause during which her eyes were fixedly contemplating the fountain as though she were testing the truth of syras words and they sound like truth she added for could falsehood be more beautiful than truth but what an awful idea that one has never been alone has never had a wish to oneself has never held a single thought in secret has never hidden the most foolish fancy of a proud or childish brain from the observation of one that knows no imperfection terrible thought that one is living if you say true under the steady gaze of an eye of which the sun is but a shadow for he enters not the soul it is enough to make one any evening commit self destruction to get rid of the torturing watchfulness yet it sounds so true fabiola looked almost wild as she spoke these words the pride of her pagan heart rose strong within her and she rebelled against the supposition that she could never again feel alone with her own thoughts or that any power should exist which could control her inmost desires imaginings or caprices still the thought came back yet it seems so true her generous intellect struggled against the writhing passion like an eagle with a serpent more with eye than with beak and talons subduing the quailing foe after a struggle visible in her countenance and gestures a calm came over her she seemed for the first time to feel the presence of one greater than herself some one whom she feared yet whom she would wish to love she bowed down her mind she bent her intelligence to his feet and her heart too owned for the first time that it had a master and a lord syra with calm intensity of feeling silently watched the workings of her mistresss mind she knew how much depended on their issue what a mighty step in her unconscious pupils religious progress was involved in the recognition of the truth before her and she fervently prayed for this grace at length fabiola raised her head which seemed to have been bowed down in accompaniment to her mind and with graceful kindness said syra i am sure i have not yet reached the depths of your knowledge you must have much more to teach me a tear and a blush came to the poor handmaids relief but to day you have opened a new world and a new life to my thoughts a sphere of virtue beyond the opinions and the judgments of men a consciousness of a controlling an approving and a rewarding power too am i right syra expressed approbation standing by us when no other eye can see or restrain or encourage us a feeling that were we shut up forever in solitude we should be ever the same because that influence on us must be so superior to that of any amount of human principles in guiding us and could not leave us such if i understand your theory is the position of moral elevation in which it would place each individual to fall below it even with an outwardly virtuous life is mere deceit and positive wickedness is this so o my dear mistress exclaimed syra how much better you can express all this than i you have never flattered me yet syra replied fabiola smilingly do not begin now but you have thrown a new light upon other subjects till to day obscure to me tell me now was it not this you meant when you once told me that in your view there was no distinction between mistress and slave that is that as the distinction is only outward bodily and social it is not to be put in comparison with that equality which exists before your supreme being and that possible moral superiority which he might see of the one over the other inversely of their visible rank it was in a great measure so my noble lady though there are other considerations involved in the idea which would hardly interest you at present and yet when you stated that proposition it seemed to me so monstrous so absurd that pride and anger overcame me do you remember that syra oh no no replied the gentle servant do not allude to it i pray have you forgiven me that day syra said the mistress with an emotion quite new to her the poor maid was overpowered she rose and threw herself on her knees before her mistress and tried to seize her hand but she prevented her and for the first time in her life fabiola threw herself upon a slaves neck and wept her passion of tears was long and tender her heart was getting above her intellect and this can only be by its increasing softness at length she grew calm and as she withdrew her embrace she said one thing more syra dare one address by worship this being whom you have described to me is he not too great too lofty too distant for this oh no far from it noble lady answered the servant he is not distant from any of us for as much as in the light of the sun so in the very splendor of his might his kindness and his wisdom we live and move and have our being hence one may address him not as far off but as around us and within us while we are in him and he hears us not with ears but our words drop at once into his very bosom and the desires of our hearts pass directly into the divine abyss of his but pursued fabiola somewhat timidly is there no great act of acknowledgment such as sacrifice is supposed to be whereby he may be formally recognized and adored syra hesitated for the conversation seemed to be trenching upon mysterious and sacred ground never opened by the church to profane foot she however answered in a simple and general affirmative and could not i still more humbly asked her mistress be so far instructed in your school as to be able to perform this sublimer act of homage i fear not noble fabiola one must needs obtain a victim worthy of the deity ah yes to be sure answered fabiola a bull may be good enough for jupiter or a goat for bacchus but where can be found a sacrifice worthy of him whom you have brought me to know it must indeed be one every way worthy of him spotless in purity matchless in greatness unbounded in acceptableness and what can that be syra only himself fabiola shrouded her face with her hands and then looking up earnestly into syras face said to her i am sure that after having so clearly described to me the deep sense of responsibility under which you must habitually speak as well as act you have a real meaning in this awful saying though i understand you not as surely as every word of mine is heard as every thought of mine is seen it is a truth which i have spoken i have not strength to carry the subject further at present my mind has need of rest illustration a monogram of christ found in the catacombs chapter xvii the christian community after this conversation fabiola retired and during the rest of the day her mind was alternately agitated and calm when she looked steadily on the grand view of moral life which her mind had grasped she found an unusual tranquillity in its contemplation she felt as if she had made discovery of a great phenomenon the knowledge of which guided her into a new and lofty region whence she could smile on the errors and follies of mankind but when she considered the responsibility which this light imposed the watchfulness which it demanded the unseen and unrequited struggles which it required the desolateness almost of a virtue without admiration or even sympathy she again shrunk from the life that was before her as about to be passed without any stay or help from the only sources of it which she knew unconscious of the real cause she saw that she possessed not instruments or means to carry out the beautiful theory this seemed to stand like a brilliant lamp in the midst of a huge bare unfurnished hall lighting up only a wilderness what was the use of so much wasted splendor the next morning had been fixed for one of those visits which used to be annually paid in the country that to the now ex prefect of the city chromatius our reader will remember that after his conversion and resignation of office this magistrate had retired to his villa in campania taking with him a number of the converts made by sebastian with the holy priest polycarp to complete their instruction of these circumstances of course fabiola had never been informed but she heard all sorts of curious reports about chromatiuss villa it was said that he had a number of visitors never before seen at his house that he gave no entertainments that he had freed all his country slaves but that many of them had preferred remaining with him that if numerous the whole establishment seemed very happy though no boisterous sports or frolicsome meetings seemed to be indulged in all this stimulated fabiolas curiosity in addition to her wish to discharge a pleasing duty of courtesy to a most kind friend of hers from childhood and she longed to see with her own eyes what appeared to her to be a very platonic or as we should say utopian experiment in a light country carriage with good horses fabiola started early and dashed gaily along the level road across the happy campania an autumnal shower had laid the dust and studded with glistening gems the garlands of vine which bordered the way festooned instead of hedges from tree to tree it was not long before she reached the gentle acclivity for hill it could scarce be called covered with box arbutus and laurels relieved by tall tapering cypresses amidst which shone the white walls of the large villa on the summit a change she perceived had taken place which at first she could not exactly define but when she had passed through the gate the number of empty pedestals and niches reminded her that the villa had entirely lost one of its most characteristic ornaments the number of beautiful statues which stood gracefully against the clipped evergreen hedges and gave it the name now become quite an empty one of ad statuas chromatius whom she had last seen limping with gout now a hale old man courteously received her and inquired kindly after her father asking if the report were true that he was going shortly to asia at this fabiola seemed grieved and mortified for he had not mentioned his intention to her chromatius hoped it might be a false alarm and asked her to take a stroll about the grounds she found them kept with the same care as ever full of beautiful plants but still much missed the old statues at last they reached a grotto with a fountain in which formerly nymphs and sea deities disported but which now presented a black unbroken surface she could contain herself no longer and turning to chromatius she said why what on earth have you been doing chromatius to send away all your statues and destroy the peculiar feature of your handsome villa what induced you to do this my dear young lady answered the good humored old gentleman do not be so angry of what use were those figures to any one if you thought so replied she others might not but tell me what have you done with them all why to tell you the truth i have had them brought under the hammer what and never let me know any thing about it you know there were several pieces i would most gladly have purchased chromatius laughed outright and said with that familiar tone which acquaintance with fabiola from a child authorized him always to assume with her dear me how your young imagination runs away far too fast for my poor old tongue to keep pace with i meant not the auctioneers hammer but the sledge hammer the gods and goddesses have been all smashed pulverized if you happen to want a stray leg or a hand minus a few fingers perhaps i may pick up such a thing for you but i cannot promise you a face with a nose or a skull without a fracture fabiola was utterly amazed as she exclaimed what an utter barbarian you have become my wise old judge what shadow of reason can you give to justify so outrageous a proceeding why you see as i have grown older i have grown wiser and i have come to the conclusion that mr jupiter and mrs juno are no more gods than you or i so i summarily got rid of them yes that may be very well and i though neither old nor wise have been long of the same opinion but why not retain them as mere works of art because they had been set up here not in that capacity but as divinities they were here as impostors under false pretences and as you would turn out of your house for an intruder any bust or image found among those of your ancestors but belonging to quite another family so did i these pretenders to a higher connection with me when i found it false neither could i run a risk of their being bought for the continuance of the same imposture and pray my most righteous old friend is it not an imposture to continue calling your villa ad statuas after not a single statue is left standing in it certainly replied chromatius amused at her sharpness and you will see that i have planted palm trees all about and as soon as they show their heads above the evergreens the villa will take the title of ad palmas instead that will be a pretty name said fabiola who little thought of the higher sense of appropriateness which it would contain she of course was not aware that the villa was now a training school in which many were being prepared as wrestlers or gladiators used to be in separate institutions for the great combat of faith martyrdom to death they who had entered in and they who would go out might equally say they were on their way to pluck the conquerors palm to be borne by them before gods judgment seat in token of their victory over the world many were the palm branches shortly to be gathered in that early christian retreat but we must here give the history of the demolition of chromatiuss statues which forms a peculiar episode in the acts of st sebastian when nicostratus informed him as prefect of rome of the release of his prisoners and of the recovery of tranquillinus from gout by baptism chromatius after making every inquiry into the truth of the fact sent for sebastian and proposed to become a christian as a means of obtaining a cure of the same complaint this of course could not be and another course was proposed which would give him new and personal evidence of christianity without risking an insincere baptism chromatius was celebrated for the immense number of idolatrous images which he possessed and was assured by sebastian that if he would have them all broken in pieces he would at once recover this was a hard condition but he consented his son tiburtius however was furious and protested that if the promised result did not follow he would have sebastian and polycarp thrown into a blazing furnace not perhaps so difficult a matter for the prefects son in one day two hundred pagan statues were broken in pieces including of course those in the villa as well as those in the house at rome the images indeed were broken but chromatius was not cured sebastian was sent for and sharply rebuked but he was calm and inflexible i am sure he said that all have not been destroyed something has been withheld from demolition he proved right some small objects had been treated as works of art rather than religious things and like achans coveted spoil concealed they were brought forth and broken up and chromatius instantly recovered not only was he converted but his son tiburtius became also one of the most fervent of christians and dying in glorious martyrdom gave his name to a catacomb he had begged to stay in rome to encourage and assist his fellow believers in the coming persecution which his connection with the palace his great courage and activity would enable him to do he had become naturally the great friend and frequent companion of sebastian and pancratius after this little digression we resume the conversation between chromatius and fabiola who continued her last sentence by adding but do you know chromatius let us sit down in this lovely spot where i remember there was a beautiful bacchus that all sorts of strange reports are going round the country about your doings here dear me what are they do tell me why that you have a quantity of people living with you whom nobody knows that you see no company go out nowhere and lead quite a philosophical sort of life forming a most platonic republic highly flattered interrupted chromatius with a smile and bow but that is not all continued fabiola they say you keep most unfashionable hours have no amusements and live most abstemiously in fact almost starve yourselves but i hope they do us the justice to add that we pay our way observed chromatius they dont say do they that we have a long score run up at the bakers or grocers oh no replied fabiola laughing how kind of them rejoined the good humored old judge they the whole public i mean seem to take a wonderful interest in our concerns but is it not strange my dear young lady that so long as my villa was on the free and easy system with as much loose talk deep drinking occasional sallies of youthful mirth and troublesome freaks in the neighborhood as others i beg your pardon for alluding to such things but in fact so long as i and my friends were neither temperate nor irreproachable nobody gave himself the least trouble about us but let a few people retire to live in quiet be frugal industrious entirely removed from public affairs and never even talk about politics or society and at once there springs up a vulgar curiosity to know all about them and a mean pruritus in third rate statesmen to meddle with them and there must needs fly about flocks of false reports and foul suspicions about their motives and manner of living is not this a phenomenon it is indeed but how do you account for it i can only do so by that faculty of little minds which makes them always jealous of any aims higher than their own so that almost unconsciously they depreciate whatever they feel to be better than they dare aspire to but what is really your object and your mode of life here my good friend we spend our time in the cultivation of our higher faculties we rise frightfully early i hardly dare tell you how early we then devote some hours to religious worship after which we occupy ourselves in a variety of ways some read some write some labor in the gardens and i assure you no hired workmen ever toiled harder and better than these spontaneous agriculturists we meet at different times and sing beautiful songs together all breathing virtue and purity and read most improving books and receive oral instruction from eloquent teachers our meals are indeed very temperate we live entirely on vegetables but i have already found out that laughing is quite compatible with lentils and that good cheer does not necessarily mean good fare why you are turned complete pythagoreans i thought that was quite out of date but it must be a most economical system remarked fabiola with a knowing look ha you cunning thing answered the judge so you really think that this may be a saving plan after all but it wont be for we have taken a most desperate resolution and what on earth is that asked the young lady nothing less than this we are determined that there shall not be such a thing as a poor person within our reach this winter we will endeavor to clothe all the naked and feed the hungry and attend to all the sick about all our economy will go for this it is indeed a very generous though very new idea in our times and no doubt you will be well laughed at for your pains and abused on all sides they will even say worse of you than they do now if it were possible but it is not how so do not be offended if i tell you but already they have gone so far as to hint that possibly you are christians but this i assure you i have every where indignantly contradicted chromatius smiled and said why an indignant contradiction my dear child because to be sure i know you and tiburtius and nicostratus and that dear dumb zo too well to admit for a moment that you had adopted the compound of stupidity and knavery called by that name let me ask you one question have you taken the trouble of reading any christian writings by which you might know what is really held and done by that despised body oh not i indeed i would not waste my time over them i could not have patience to learn any thing about them i scorn them too much as enemies of all intellectual progress as doubtful citizens as credulous to the last degree and as sanctioning every abominable crime ever to give myself a chance of a nearer acquaintance with them well dear fabiola i thought just the same about them once but i have much altered my opinion of late this is indeed strange since as prefect of the city you must have had to punish many of these wretched people for their constant transgression of the laws a cloud came over the cheerful countenance of the old man and a tear stood in his eye he thought of st paul who had once persecuted the church of god fabiola saw the change and was distressed in the most affectionate manner she said to him i have said something very thoughtless i fear or stirred up recollections of what must be painful to your kind heart forgive me dear chromatius and let us talk of something else one purpose of my visit to you was to ask you if you knew of any one going immediately to rome i have heard from several quarters of my fathers projected journey and i am anxious to write to him lest he repeat what he did before go without taking leave of me to spare me pain yes replied chromatius there is a young man starting early to morrow morning come into the library and write your letter the bearer is probably there they returned to the house and entered an apartment on the ground floor full of book chests at a table in the middle of the room a young man was seated transcribing a large volume which on seeing a stranger enter he closed and put aside torquatus said chromatius addressing him this lady desires to send a letter to her father in rome it will always give me great pleasure replied the young man to serve the noble fabiola or her illustrious father what do you know them asked the judge rather surprised i had the honor when very young as my father had had before me to be employed by the noble fabius in asia ill health compelled me to leave his service several sheets of fine vellum cut to a size evidently for transcription of some book lay on the table one of these the good old man placed before the lady with ink and a reed and she wrote a few affectionate lines to her father she doubled the paper tied a thread round it attached some wax to this and impressed her seal which she drew from an embroidered bag upon the wax anxious some time to reward the messenger when she could better know how she took another piece of the vellum and made on it a memorandum of his name and residence and carefully put this into her bosom after partaking of some slight refreshment she mounted her car and bid chromatius an affectionate farewell there was something touchingly paternal in his look as though he felt he should never see her again so she thought but it was a very different feeling which softened his heart should she always remain thus must he leave her to perish in obstinate ignorance were that generous heart and that noble intellect to grovel on in the slime of bitter paganism when every feeling and every thought in them seemed formed of strong yet finest fibres across which truth might weave the richest web it could not be and yet a thousand motives restrained him from an avowal which he felt would at present only repulse her fatally from any nearer approach to the faith farewell my child he exclaimed may you be blessed a hundredfold in ways which as yet you know not he turned away his face as he dropped her hand and hastily withdrew fabiola too was moved by the mystery as well as the tenderness of his words but was startled before reaching the gate to find her chariot stopped by torquatus she was at that moment painfully struck by the contrast between the easy and rather familiar though respectful manner of the youth and the mild gravity mixed with cheerfulness of the old ex prefect pardon this interruption madam he said but are you anxious to have this letter quickly delivered certainly i am most anxious that it should reach my father as speedily as possible then i fear i shall hardly be able to serve you i can only afford to travel on foot or by chance and cheap conveyance and i shall be some days upon the road fabiola hesitating said would it be taking too great a liberty if i should offer to defray the expenses of a more rapid journey by no means answered torquatus rather eagerly if i can thereby better serve your noble house fabiola handed him a purse abundantly supplied not only for his journey but for an ample recompense he received it with smiling readiness and disappeared by a side alley there was something in his manner which made a disagreeable impression she could not think he was fit company for her dear old friend if chromatius had witnessed the transaction he would have seen a likeness to judas in that eager clutching of the purse fabiola however was not sorry to have discharged by a sum of money once for all any obligation she might have contracted by making him her messenger she therefore drew out her memorandum to destroy it as useless when she perceived that the other side of the vellum was written on as the transcriber of the book which she saw put by had just commenced its continuation on that sheet only a few sentences however had been written and she proceeded to read them then for the first time she perused the following words from a book unknown to her i say to you love your enemies do good to them that hate you and pray for them that persecute and calumniate you that you may be the children of your father who is in heaven who maketh his sun to rise on the good and the bad and raineth upon the just and the unjust we may imagine the perplexity of an indian peasant who has picked up in a torrents bed a white pellucid pebble rough and dull outside but where chipped emitting sparks of light unable to decide whether he have become possessed of a splendid diamond or of a worthless stone a thing to be placed on a royal crown or trodden under a beggars feet shall he put an end to his embarrassment by at once flinging it away or shall he take it to a lapidary ask its value and perhaps be laughed at to his face such were the alternating feelings of fabiola on her way home whose can these sentences be no greek or roman philosophers they are either very false or very true either sublime morality or base degradation does any one practise this doctrine or is it a splendid paradox i will trouble myself no more on the subject or rather i will ask syra about it it sounds very like one of her beautiful but impracticable theories no it is better not she overpowers me by her sublime views so impossible for me though they seem easy to her my mind wants rest the shortest way is to get rid of the cause of my perplexity and forget such harassing words so here it goes to the winds or to puzzle some one else who may find it on the road side ho phormio stop the chariot and pick up that piece of parchment which i have dropped the outrider obeyed though he had thought the sheet deliberately flung out it was replaced in fabiolas bosom it was like a seal upon her heart for that heart was calm and silent till she reached home illustration christ in the midst of his apostles from a painting in the catacombs chapter xviii temptation very early next morning a mule and guide came to the door of chromatiuss villa on it was packed a moderate pair of saddle bags the whole known property of torquatus many friends were up to see him off and receive from him the kiss of peace ere he departed may it not prove like that of gethsemani some whispered a kind soft word in his ear exhorting him to be faithful to the graces he had received and he earnestly and probably sincerely promised that he would others knowing his poverty put a little present into his hand and entreated him to avoid his old haunts and acquaintances polycarp however the director of the community called him aside and with fervent words and flowing tears conjured him to correct the irregularities slight perhaps but threatening which had appeared in his conduct repress the levity which had manifested itself in his bearing and cultivate more all christian virtues torquatus also with tears promised obedience knelt down kissed the good priests hand and obtained his blessing then received from him letters of recommendation for his journey and a small sum for its moderate expenses at length all was ready the last farewell was spoken the last good wish expressed and torquatus mounted on his mule with his guide at its bridle proceeded slowly along the straight avenue which led to the gate long after every one else had re entered the house chromatius was standing at the door looking wistfully with a moist eye after him it was just such a look as the prodigals father kept fixed on his departing son as the villa was not on the high road this modest quadrupedal conveyance had been hired to take him across the country to fundi now fondi as the nearest point where he could reach it there he was to find what means he could for prosecuting his journey fabiolas purse however had set him very much at ease on that score the road by which he travelled was varied in its beauties sometimes it wound along the banks of the liris gay with villas and cottages then it plunged into a miniature ravine in the skirts of the apennines walled in by rocks matted with myrtle aloes and the wild vine amidst which white goats shone like spots of snow while beside the path gurgled and wriggled on a tiny brook that seemed to have worked itself into the bright conceit that it was a mountain torrent so great was the bustle and noise with which it pushed on and pretended to foam and appeared to congratulate itself loudly on having achieved a waterfall by leaping down two stones at a time and plunging into an abyss concealed by a wide acanthus leaf then the road emerged to enjoy a wide prospect of the vast garden of campania with the blue bay of cajeta in the background speckled by the white sails of its craft that looked at that distance like flocks of bright plumed waterfowl basking and fluttering on a lake what were the travellers thoughts amidst these shifting scenes of a new act in his lifes drama did they amuse him did they delight him did they elevate him or did they depress his eye scarcely noted them it had run on far beyond them to the shady porticoes and noisy streets of the illustration interior of a roman theatre capital the dusty garden and the artificial fountain the marble bath and the painted vault were more beautiful in his eyes than fresh autumn vineyards pure streams purple ocean and azure sky he did not of course for a moment turn his thoughts towards its foul deeds and impious practices its luxury its debauchery its profaneness its dishonesties its calumnies its treacheries its uncleannesses oh no what would he a christian have again to do with these sometimes as his mind became abstracted it saw in a dark nook of a hall in the therm a table round which moody but eager gamesters were casting their knuckle bone dice and he felt a quivering creep over him of an excitement long suppressed but a pair of mild eyes like polycarps loomed on him from behind the table and aroused him then he caught himself in fancy seated at a maple board with a ruby gem of falernian wine set in the rim of a golden goblet and discourse ungirded by inebriety going round with the cup when the reproving countenance of chromatius would seem placed opposite repelling with a scowl the approach of either illustration hall in the baths of caracalla he was in fact returning only to the innocent enjoyments of the imperial city to its walks its music its paintings its magnificence its beauty he forgot that all these were but the accessories to a living and panting mass of human beings whose passions they enkindled whose evil desires they inflamed whose ambition they fanned whose resolutions they melted and whose minds they enervated poor youth he thought he could walk through that fire and not be scorched poor moth he imagined he could fly through that flame and have his wings unscathed it was in one of his abstracted moods that he journeyed through a narrow overhung defile when suddenly he found himself at its opening with an inlet of the sea before him and in it one solitary and motionless skiff the sight at once brought to his memory a story of his childhood true or false it mattered not but he almost fancied its scene was before him once upon a time there was a bold young fisherman living on the coast of southern italy one night stormy and dark he found that his father and brothers would not venture out in their tight and strong smack so he determined in spite of every remonstrance to go alone in the little cockle shell attached to it it blew a gale but he rode it out in his tiny buoyant bark till the sun rose warm and bright upon a placid glassy sea overcome by fatigue and heat he fell asleep but after some time was awakened by a loud shouting at a distance he looked round and saw the family boat the crew of which were crying aloud and waving their hands to invite him back but they made no effort to reach him what could they want what could they mean he seized his oars and began to pull lustily towards them but he was soon amazed to find that the fishing boat towards which he had turned the prow of his skiff appeared upon his quarter and soon though he righted his craft it was on the opposite side evidently he had been making a circle but the end came within its beginning in a spiral curve and now he was commencing another and a narrower one a horrible suspicion flashed upon his mind he threw off his tunic and pulled like a madman at his oars but though he broke the circle a bit here and a bit there still round he went and every time nearer to the centre in which he could see a downward funnel of hissing and foaming water then in despair he threw down his oars and standing he flung up his arms frantically and a sea bird screaming near heard him cry out as loud as itself charibdis and now the circle his boat went spinning round was only a few times longer than itself and he cast himself flat down and shut his ears and eyes with his hands and held his breath till he felt the waters gurgling above him and he was whirled down into the abyss i wonder torquatus said to himself did any one ever perish in this way or is it a mere allegory if so of what can a person be drawn on gradually in this manner to spiritual destruction are my present thoughts by any chance an outer circle which has caught me and fundi exclaimed the muleteer pointing to a town before them and presently the mule was sliding along the broad flags of its pavement torquatus looked over his letters and drew one out for the town he was taken to a little inn of the poorest class by his guide who was paid handsomely and retired swearing and grumbling at the niggardliness of the traveller he then inquired the way to the house of cassianus the school master found it and delivered his letter he received as kind a welcome as if he had arrived at home joined his host in a frugal meal during which he learned the masters history a native of fundi he had started the school in rome with which we became acquainted at an early period of our history and had proved eminently successful but finding a persecution imminent and his christianity discovered he had disposed of his school and retired to his small native town where he was promised after the vacation the children of the principal inhabitants in a fellow christian he saw nothing but a brother and as such he talked freely with him of his past adventures and his future prospects a strange idea dashed through the mind of torquatus that some day that information might be turned into money it was still early when torquatus took his leave and pretending to have some business in the town he would not allow his host to accompany him he bought himself some more respectable apparel went to the best inn and ordered a couple of horses with a postillion to accompany him for to fulfill fabiolas commission it was necessary to ride forward quick change his horses at each relay and travel through the night he did so till he reached bovill on the skirts of the alban hills here he rested changed his travelling suit and rode on gaily between the lines of tombs which brought him to the gate of that city within whose walls there was more of good and more of evil contained than in any province of the empire illustration the peacock as an emblem of the resurrection chapter xix the fall torquatus now elegantly attired proceeded at once to the house of fabius delivered his letter answered all inquiries and accepted without much pressing an invitation to supper that evening he then went to seek a respectable lodging suited to the present state of his purse and easily found one fabius we have said did not accompany his daughter into the country and rarely visited her there the fact was that he had no love for green fields or running brooks his tastes were for the gossip and free society of rome during the year his daughters presence was a restraint on his liberty but when she was gone with her establishment into campania his house presented scenes and entertained persons that he would not have presumed to bring in contact with her men of profligate life surrounded his table and deep drinking till late hours with gambling and loose conversation generally followed his sumptuous entertainments having invited torquatus to sup with him he went forth in search of guests to meet him he soon picked up a batch of sycophants who were loitering about his known haunts in readiness for invitations but as he was sauntering home from the baths of titus he saw two men in a small grove round a temple earnestly conversing together after a moments look he advanced towards them but waited at a small distance for a pause in the dialogue which was something to this effect there is no doubt then about the news none at all it is quite certain that the people have risen at nicomedia and burnt down the church as they call it of the christians close to and in sight of the palace my father heard it from the emperors secretary himself this morning what ever possessed the fools to go and build a temple in one of the most conspicuous places of the metropolis they must have known that sooner or later the religious spirit of the nation would rise against them and destroy the eye sore as every exhibition of a foreign religion must be to an empire to be sure as my father says these christians if they had any wit in them would hide their heads and slink into corners when they are so condescendingly tolerated for a time by the most humane princes but as they do not choose to do so but will build temples in public instead of skulking in by lanes as they used to do i for one am not sorry one may gain some notoriety and profit too by hunting these odious people down and destroying them if possible well be it so but to come to the purpose it is understood between us that when we can discover who are christians among the rich and not too powerful at first there shall be a fair division we will aid one another you propose bold and rough means i will keep my counsel as to mine but each shall reap all the profit from those whom he discovers and his right proportion from those who are shared between us is it not so exactly fabius now stepped forward with a hearty how are you fulvius i have not seen you for an age come and sup with me to day i have friends engaged and your friend too corvinus i believe the gentleman alluded to made an uncouth bow will accompany you i hope thank you replied fulvius but i fear i have an engagement already nonsense man said the good natured knight there is nobody left in the city with whom you could sup except myself but has my house the plague that you have never ventured into it since you dined there with sebastian and quarrelled with him or did you get struck by some magical charm which has driven you away fulvius turned pale and drew away fabius to one side while he said to tell the truth something very like it i hope answered fabius somewhat startled that the black witch has been playing no tricks with you i wish heartily she were out of my house but come he continued in good humor i really thought you were struck by a better charm that evening i have my eyes open i saw how your heart was fixed on my little cousin agnes fulvius stared at him with some amazement and after a pause replied and if it was so i saw that your daughter made up her mind that no good should ever come out of it say you so then that explains your constant refusal to come to me again but fabiola is a philosopher and understands nothing of such matters i wish indeed she would give up her books and think of settling herself in life instead of preventing others but i can give you better news than that agnes is as much attached to you as you can be to her is it possible how can you happen to know it why then to tell you what i should have told you long since if you had not fought so shy of me she confided it to me that very day to you yes to me those jewels of yours quite won her heart she told me as much i knew she could only mean you indeed i am sure she meant you fulvius understood these words of the rich gems which he displayed while the knight spoke of the jewels which he imagined agnes had received she had proved fulvius was thinking an easy prize in spite of her demureness and here lay fortune and rank open before him if he could only manage his game when fabius thus broke in upon his dream come now you have only to press your suit boldly and i tell you you will win it whatever fabiola may think but you have nothing to fear from her now she and all her servants are absent her part of the house is closed and we enter by the back door to the more enjoyable part of the establishment i will wait on you without fail replied fulvius and corvinus with you added fabius as he turned away we will not describe the banquet further than to say that wines of rare excellence flowed so plentifully that almost all the guests got more or less heated and excited fulvius however for one kept himself cool the news from the east came into discussion the destruction of the church at nicomedia had been followed by incendiary fires in the imperial palace little doubt could exist that the emperor galerius was their author but he charged them on the christians and thus goaded on the reluctant mind of dioclesian to become their fiercest persecutor every one began to see that before many months were over the imperial edict to commence the work of destruction would reach rome and find in maximian a ready executor the guests were generally inclined to gore the stricken deer for generosity in favor of those whom popular clamor hunts down requires an amount of courage too heroic to be common even the most liberal found reasons for christians being excepted from all kind consideration one could not bear their mysteriousness another was vexed at their supposed progress this man thought them opposed to the real glory of the empire that considered them a foreign element that ought to be eliminated from it one thought their doctrine detestable another their practice infamous during all this debate if it could be so called where both sides came to the same conclusion fulvius after having glanced from one to the other of the guests had fixed his evil eye upon torquatus the youth was silent but his countenance by turns was pale and flushed wine had given him a rash courage which some strong principle restrained now he clenched his hand and pressed it to his breast now he bit his lip at one time he was crumbling the bread between his fingers at another he drank off unconsciously a cup of wine these christians hate us and would destroy us all if they could said one torquatus leaned forward opened his lips but remained silent destroy us indeed did they not burn rome under nero and have they not just set fire to the palace in asia over the emperors head asked a second torquatus rose upon his couch stretched forth his hand as if about to reply but drew it back but what is infinitely worse is their maintaining such anti social doctrines conniving at such frightful excesses and degrading themselves to the disgusting worship of an asss head proceeded a third torquatus now fairly writhed and rising had lifted his arm when fulvius with a cool calculation of time and words added in bitter sarcasm ay and massacre a child and devour his flesh and blood at every assembly the arm descended on the table with a blow that made every goblet and beaker dance and ring as in a choked voice torquatus exclaimed it is a lie a cursed lie how can you know that asked fulvius with his blandest tone and look because answered the other with great excitement i am myself a christian and ready to die for my faith if the beautiful alabaster statue with a bronze head in the niche beside the table had fallen forward and been smashed on the marble pavement it could not have caused a more fearful sensation than this sudden announcement all were startled for a moment next a long blank pause ensued after which each began to show his feelings in his features fabius looked exceedingly foolish as if conscious that he had brought his guests into bad company calpurnius puffed himself out evidently thinking himself ill used by having a guest brought in who might absurdly be supposed to know more about christians than himself a young man opened his mouth as he stared at torquatus and a testy old gentleman was evidently hesitating whether he should not knock down somebody or other no matter whom corvinus looked at the poor christian with the sort of grin of delight half idiotic half savage with which a countryman might gaze upon the vermin that he finds in his trap in a morning here was a man ready to hand to put on the rack or the gridiron whenever he pleased but the look of fulvius was worth them all if ever any microscopic observer has had the opportunity of witnessing the expression of the spiders features when after a long fast it sees a fly plump with others blood approach its net and keenly watches every stroke of its wing and studies how it can best throw only the first thread round it sure that then all that gorges it shall be its own that we fancy would be the best image of his looks as certainly it is of his feelings to get hold of a christian ready to turn traitor had long been his desire and study here he was sure was one if he could only manage him how did he know this because he knew sufficient of christians to be convinced that no genuine one would have allowed himself either to drink to excess or to boast of his readiness to court martyrdom the company broke up every body slunk away from the discovered christian as from one pest stricken he felt alone and depressed when fulvius who had whispered a word to fabius and to corvinus went up to him and taking him by the hand said courteously i fear i spoke inconsiderately in drawing out from you a declaration which may prove dangerous i fear nothing replied torquatus again excited i will stand to my colors to the last hush hush broke in fulvius the slaves may betray you come with me to another chamber where we can talk quietly together so saying he led him into an elegant room where fabius had ordered goblets and flagons of the richest falernian wine to be brought for such as according to roman fashion liked to enjoy a commissatio or drinking bout but only corvinus engaged by fulvius followed on a beautifully inlaid table were dice fulvius after plying torquatus with more liquor negligently took them up and threw them playfully down talking in the mean time on indifferent subjects dear me he kept exclaiming what throws it is well i am not playing with any one or i should have been ruined you try torquatus gambling as we learnt before had been the ruin of torquatus for a transaction arising out of it he was in prison when sebastian converted him as he took the dice into his hand with no intention as he thought of playing fulvius watched him as a lynx might its prey torquatuss eye flashed keenly his lips quivered his hand trembled fulvius at once recognized in all this coupled with the poising of his hand the knowing cast of the wrist and the sharp eye to the value of the throw the violence of a first temptation to resume a renounced vice i fear you are not a better hand than i am at this stupid occupation said he indifferently but i dare say corvinus here will give you a chance if you will stake something very low it must be very low indeed merely for recreation for i have renounced gambling once indeed but no matter come on said corvinus whom fulvius had pressed to his work by a look they began to throw for the most trifling stakes and torquatus generally won fulvius made him drink still from time to time and he became very talkative corvinus corvinus he said at length as if recollecting himself was not that the name that cassianus mentioned who asked the other surprised yes it was continued torquatus to himself the bully the big brute were you the person he asked looking up to corvinus who struck that nice christian boy pancratius corvinus was on the point of bursting into a rage but fulvius checked him by a gesture and said with timely interference that cassianus whom you mentioned is an eminent school master pray where does he live this he knew his companion wished to ascertain and thus he quieted him torquatus answered he lives let me see no no i wont turn traitor no i am ready to be burnt or tortured or die for my faith but i wont betray any one that i wont let me take your place corvinus said fulvius who saw torquatuss interest in the game deepening he put forth sufficient skill to make his antagonist more careful and more intent he threw down a somewhat larger stake torquatus after a moments pause of deliberation matched it he won it fulvius seemed vexed torquatus threw back both sums fulvius seemed to hesitate but put down an equivalent and lost again the play was now silent each won and lost but fulvius had steadily the advantage and he was the more collected of the two once torquatus looked up and started he thought he saw the good polycarp behind his adversarys chair he rubbed his eyes and saw it was only corvinus staring at him all his skill was now put forth conscience had retreated faith was wavering grace had already departed for the demon of covetousness of rapine of dishonesty of recklessness had come back and brought with him seven spirits worse than himself to that cleansed but ill guarded soul and as they entered in all that was holy all that was good departed at length worked up by repeated losses and draughts of wine into a frenzy after he had drawn frequently upon the heavy purse which fabiola had given him he threw the purse itself upon the table fulvius coolly opened it emptied it counted the money and placed opposite an equal heap of gold each prepared himself for a final throw the fatal bones fell each glanced silently upon their spots fulvius drew the money towards himself torquatus fell upon the table his head buried and hidden within his arms fulvius motioned corvinus out of the room torquatus beat the ground with his foot then moaned next gnashed his teeth and growled then put his fingers in illustration the ruins of the roman forum as they are to day his hair and begun to pull and tear it a voice whispered in his ear are you a christian which of the seven spirits was it surely the worst it is hopeless continued the voice you have disgraced your religion and you have betrayed it too no no groaned the despairing wretch yes in your drunkenness you have told us all quite enough to make it impossible for you ever to return to those you have betrayed begone begone exclaimed piteously the tortured sinner they will forgive me still god silence utter not his name you are degraded perjured hopelessly lost you are a beggar to morrow you must beg your bread you are an outcast a ruined prodigal and gamester who will look at you will your christian friends and nevertheless you are a christian you will be torn to pieces by some cruel death for it yet you will not be worshipped by them as one of their martyrs you are a hypocrite torquatus and nothing more who is it that is tormenting me he exclaimed and looked up fulvius was standing with folded arms at his side and if all this be true what is it to you what have you to say more to me he continued much more than you think you have betrayed yourself into my power completely i am master of your money and he showed him fabiolas purse of your character of your peace of your life i have only to let your fellow christians know what you have done what you have said what you have been to night and you dare not face them i have only to let that bully that big brute as you called him but who is son of the prefect of the city loose upon you and no one else can now restrain him after such provocation and to morrow you will be standing before his fathers tribunal to die for that religion which you have betrayed and disgraced are you ready now any longer to reel and stagger as a drunken gambler to represent your christianity before the judgment seat in the forum the fallen man had not courage to follow the prodigal in repentance as he had done in sin hope was dead in him for he had relapsed into his capital sin and scarcely felt remorse he remained silent till fulvius aroused him by asking well have you made your choice either to go at once to the christians with to night on your head or to morrow to the court which do you choose torquatus raised his eyes to him with a stolid look and faintly answered neither come then what will you do asked fulvius mastering him with one of his falcon glances what you like said torquatus only neither of those things fulvius sat down beside him and said in a soft and soothing voice now torquatus listen to me do as i tell you and all is mended you shall have house and food and apparel ay and money to play with if you will only do my bidding and what is that rise to morrow as usual put on your christian face go freely among your friends act as if nothing had happened but answer all my questions tell me every thing torquatus groaned a traitor at last call it what you will that or death ay death by inches i hear corvinus pacing impatiently up and down the court quick which is it to be not death oh no any thing but that fulvius went out and found his friend fuming with rage and wine he had hard work to pacify him corvinus had almost forgotten cassianus in fresher resentments but all his former hatred had been rekindled and he burnt for revenge fulvius promised to find out where he lived and used this means to secure the suspension of any violent and immediate measure having sent corvinus sulky and fretting home he returned to torquatus whom he wished to accompany that he might ascertain his lodgings as soon as he had left the room his victim had arisen from his chair and endeavored by walking up and down to steady his senses and regain self possession but it was in vain his head was swimming from his inebriety and his subsequent excitement the apartment seemed to turn round and round and float up and down he was sick too and his heart was beating almost audibly shame remorse self contempt hatred of his destroyers and of himself the desolateness of the outcast and the black despair of the reprobate rolled like dark billows through his soul each coming in turn uppermost unable to sustain himself longer on his feet he threw himself on his face upon a silken couch and buried his burning brow in his icy hands and groaned and still all whirled round and round him and a constant moaning sounded in his ears illustration a dove as an emblem of the soul fulvius found him in this state and touched his shoulder to rouse him torquatus shuddered and was convulsed then exclaimed can this be charybdis illustration diogenes the excavator from a painting in the cemetery of domitilla part second conflict chapter i diogenes the scenes through which we have hitherto led our reader have been laid in one of those slippery truces rather than peace which often intervened between persecution and persecution already rumors of war have crossed our path and its note of preparation has been distinctly heard the roar of the lions near the amphitheatre which startled but dismayed not sebastian the reports from the east the hints of fulvius and the threats of corvinus have brought us the same news that before long the horrors of persecution will re appear and christian blood will have to flow in a fuller and nobler stream than had hitherto watered the paradise of the new law the church ever calmly provident cannot neglect the many signs of a threatened combat nor the preparations necessary for meeting it from the moment she earnestly begins to arm herself we date the second period of our narrative it is the commencement of conflict illustration jonas after a painting in the cemetery of callistus it was towards the end of october that a young man not unknown to us closely muffled up in his cloak for it was dark and rather chill might be seen threading his way through the narrow alleys of the district called the suburra a region the extent and exact position of which is still under dispute but which lay in the immediate vicinity of the forum as vice is unfortunately too often linked with poverty the two found a common asylum here pancratius did not seem much at home in this part of the city and made several wrong turns till at length he found the street he was in search of still without numbers on the doors the house he wanted was an unsolved problem although not quite insoluble he looked for the neatest dwelling in the street and illustration lazarus raised from the dead a similar representation is found in the catacomb inter duos lauros and in the cemetery of saints nereus and achilles being particularly struck with the cleanliness and good order of one beyond the rest he boldly knocked at its door it was opened by an old man whose name has already appeared in our pages diogenes he was tall and broad shouldered as if accustomed to bear burdens which however had given him a stoop in his gait his hair was a perfect silver and hung down at the sides of a large massive head his features were strongly marked in deep melancholy lines and though the expression of his countenance was calm it was solemnly sad he looked like one who had lived much among the dead and was happiest in their company his two sons majus and severus fine athletic youths were with him the first was busy carving or scratching rather a rude epitaph on an old slab of marble the reverse of which still bore traces of a heathen sepulchral inscription rudely effaced by its new possessor illustration two fossores or excavators from a picture in the cemetery of callistus pancratius looked over the work in hand and smiled there was hardly a word rightly spelt or a part of speech correct indeed here it is de bianoba pollecla qve ordev bendet de bianoba the other son was making a rough design in which could be distinguished jonas devoured by the whale and lazarus raised from the dead both most conventionally drawn with charcoal on a board a sketch evidently for a more permanent painting elsewhere further it was clear that when the knock came to the door old diogenes was busy fitting a new handle to an old pick axe these varied occupations in one family might have surprised a modern but they did not at all the youthful visitor he well knew that the family belonged to the honorable and religious craft of the fossores or excavators of the christian cemeteries indeed diogenes was the head and director of that confraternity in conformity with the assertion of an anonymous writer contemporary with st jerome some modern antiquarians have considered the fossor as forming a lesser ecclesiastical order in the primitive church like the lector or reader but although this opinion is untenable it is extremely probable that the duties of this office were in the hands of persons appointed and recognized by ecclesiastical authority the uniform system pursued in excavating arranging and filling up of the numerous cemeteries round rome a system too so complete from the beginning as not to leave positive signs of improvement or change as time went on gives us reason to conclude that these wonderful and venerable works were carried on under one direction and probably by some body associated for that purpose it was not a cemetery or necropolis company which made a speculation of burying the dead but rather a pious and recognized confraternity which was associated for the purpose a series of interesting inscriptions found in the cemetery of st agnes proves that this occupation was continued in particular families grandfather father and sons having carried it on in the same place we can thus easily understand the great skill and uniformity of practice observable in the catacombs but the fossores had evidently a higher office or even jurisdiction in that underground world though the church provided space for the burial of all her children it was natural that some should make compensation for their place of sepulture if chosen in a favorite spot such as the vicinity of a martyrs tomb these sextons had the management of such transactions which are often recorded in the ancient cemeteries the following inscription is preserved in the capitol emptv locvm ab artemisivm visomvm hoc est et praetivm datvm fossori hilaro idest fol nood praesentia severi foss et lavrenti that is this is the grave for two bodies bought by artimisius and the price was given to the fossor hilarus that is purses in the presence of severus the fossor and laurentius possibly the last named was the witness on the purchasers side and severus on the sellers however this may be we trust we have laid before our readers all that is known about the profession as such of diogenes and his sons we left pancratius amused at majuss rude attempts in glyptic art his next step was to address him do you always execute these inscriptions yourself oh no answered the artist looking up and smiling i do them for poor people who cannot afford to pay a better hand this was a good woman who kept a small shop in the vianova and you may suppose did not become rich especially as she was very honest and yet a curious thought struck me as i was carving her epitaph let me hear it majus it was that perhaps some thousand years hence or more christians might read with reverence my scratches on the wall and hear of poor old pollecla and her barley stall with interest while the inscription of not a single emperor who persecuted the church would be read or even known well i can hardly imagine that the superb mausoleums of sovereigns will fall to utter decay and yet the memory of a market wife descend to distant ages but what is your reason for thinking thus simply because i would sooner commit to the keeping of posterity the memory of the pious poor than that of the wicked rich and my rude record may possibly be read when triumphal arches have been demolished its dreadfully written though is it not illustration a gallery in the cemetery of st agnes on the nomentan way never mind that its simplicity is worth much fine writing what is that slab leaning against the wall ah that is a beautiful inscription brought us to put up you will see the writer and engraver were different people it is to go to the cemetery at the lady agness villa on the nomentan way i believe it is in memory of a most sweet child whose death is deeply felt by his virtuous parents pancratius took a light to it and read as follows illustration inscription of the cemetery of saint agnes the innocent boy dionysius lieth here among the saints remember us in your holy prayers the writer and the engraver dear happy child continued pancratius when he had perused the inscription add me the reader to the writer and carver of thine epitaph in thy holy prayers amen answered the pious family but pancratius attracted by a certain husky sound in diogeness voice turned round and saw the old man vigorously trying to cut off the end of a little wedge which he had driven into the top of the handle of his pick axe to keep it fast in the iron but every moment baffled by some defect in his vision which he removed by drawing the back of his brawny hand across his eyes what is the matter my good old friend said the youth kindly why does this epitaph of young dionysius particularly affect you it does not of itself but it reminds me of so much that is past and suggests so much that may be about to come that i feel almost faint to think of either what are your painful thoughts diogenes why do you see it is all simple enough to take into ones arms a good child like dionysius wrapped in his cerecloth fragrant with spices and lay him in his grave his parents may weep but his passage from sorrow to joy was easy and sweet it is a very different thing and requires a heart as hardened as mine by practice another stroke of the hand across the eyes to gather up hastily the torn flesh and broken limbs of such another youth to wrap them hurriedly in their winding sheet then fold them into another sheet full of lime instead of balsams and shove them precipitately into their tomb how differently one would wish to treat a martyrs body illustration an arcosolium true diogenes but a brave officer prefers the plain soldiers grave on the field of battle to the carved sarcophagus on the via appia but are such scenes as you describe common in times of persecution by no means uncommon my good young master i am sure a pious youth like you must have visited on his anniversary the tomb of restitutus in the cemetery of hermes indeed i have and often have i been almost jealous of his early martyrdom did you bury him yes and his parents had a beautiful tomb made the arcosolium of his crypt my father and i made it of six slabs of marble hastily collected and i engraved the inscription now beside it i think i carved better than majus there added the old man now quite cheerful that is not saying much for yourself father rejoined his son no less smiling but here is the copy of the inscription which you wrote he added drawing out a parchment from a number of sheets i remember it perfectly said pancratius glancing over it and reading it as follows correcting the errors in orthography but not those in grammar as he read illustration to lius fabius restitutus their most pious son his parents erected this tomb who lived eighteen years and seven months in peace he continued what a glorious youth to have confessed christ at such an age no doubt replied the old man but i dare say you have always thought that his body reposes alone in his sepulchre any one would think so from the inscription certainly i have always thought so is it otherwise yes noble pancratius he has a comrade younger than himself lying in the same bed as we were closing the tomb of restitutus the body of a boy not more than twelve or thirteen years old was brought to us oh i shall never forget the sight he had been hung over a fire and his head trunk and limbs nearly to the knees were burnt to the very bone and so disfigured was he that no feature could be recognized poor little fellow what he must have suffered but why should i pity him well we were pressed for time and we thought the youth of eighteen would not grudge room for his fellow soldier of twelve but would own him for a younger brother so we laid him at lius fabiuss feet but we had no second phial of blood to put outside that a second martyr might be known to lie there for the fire had dried his blood up in his veins what a noble boy if the first was older the second was younger than i what say you diogenes dont you think it likely you may have to perform the same office for me one of these days oh no i hope not said the old digger with a return of his husky voice do not i entreat you allude to such a possibility surely my own time must come sooner how the old trees are spared indeed and the young plants cut down come come my good friend i wont afflict you but i have almost forgotten to deliver the message i came to bring it is that to morrow at dawn you must come to my mothers house to arrange about preparing the cemeteries for our coming troubles our holy pope will be there with the priests of the titles the regionary deacons the notaries whose number has been filled up and you the head fossor that all may act in concert i will not fail pancratius replied diogenes and now added the youth i have a favor to ask you a favor from me asked the old man surprised yes you will have to begin your work immediately i suppose now often as i have visited for devotion our sacred cemeteries i have never studied or examined them and this i should like to do with you who know them so well nothing would give me greater pleasure answered diogenes somewhat flattered by the compliment but still more pleased by this love for what he so much loved after i have received my instructions i shall go at once to the cemetery of callistus meet me out of the porta capena half an hour before mid day and we will go on together but i shall not be alone continued pancratius two youths recently baptized desire much to become acquainted with our cemeteries which they do not yet much know and have asked me to initiate them there any friends of yours will be always welcome what are their names that we may make no mistake one is tiburtius the son of chromatius the late prefect the other is a young man named torquatus severus started a little and said are you quite sure about him pancratius diogenes rebuked him saying that he comes to us in pancratiuss company is security enough i own interposed the youth that i do not know as much about him as about tiburtius who is really a gallant noble fellow torquatus is however very anxious to obtain all information about our affairs and seems in earnest what makes you fear severus only a trifle indeed but as i was going early to the cemetery this morning i turned into the baths of antoninus what interrupted pancratius laughing do you frequent such fashionable resorts not exactly replied the honest artist but you are not perhaps aware that cucumio the capsarius and his wife are christians is it possible where shall we find them next well so it is and moreover they are making a tomb for themselves in the cemetery of callistus and i had to show them majuss inscription for it here it is said the latter exhibiting it as follows cvcvmio et victoria se vivos fecervnt capsararivs de antoninianas capital exclaimed pancratius amused at the blunders in the epitaph but we are forgetting torquatus as i entered the building then said severus i was not a little surprised to find in one corner at that early hour this torquatus in close conversation with the present prefects son corvinus the pretended cripple who thrust himself into agness house you remember when some charitable unknown person god bless him gave large alms to the poor there not good company i thought and at such an hour for a christian true severus returned pancratius blushing deeply but he is young as yet in the faith and probably his old friends do not know of his change we will hope for the best the two young men offered to accompany pancratius who rose to leave and see him safe through the poor and profligate neighborhood he accepted their courtesy with pleasure and bade the old excavator a hearty good night illustration our saviour blessing the bread from a picture in the catacombs chapter ii the cemeteries m antoni vs restvtv s fecit ypo cevsibi et svis fidenti bvs in domino it seems to us as though we had neglected one whose character and thoughts opened this little history the pious lucina her virtues were indeed of that quiet unobtrusive nature which affords little scope for appearing on a public scene or taking part in general affairs her house besides being or rather containing a title or parochial church was now honored by being the residence of the supreme pontiff the approach of a violent persecution in which the rulers of christs spiritual kingdom were sure to be the first sought out as the enemies of csar illustration a staircase in the catacombs illustration the martyrs widow rendered it necessary to transfer the residence of the ruler of the church from his ordinary dwelling to a securer asylum for this purpose lucinas house was chosen and it continued to be so occupied to her great delight in that and the following pontificate when the wild beasts were ordered to be transferred to it that pope marcellus might feed them at home this loathsome punishment soon caused his death lucina admitted at forty into the order of deaconesses found plenty of occupation in the duties of her office the charge and supervision of the women in church the care of the sick and poor of her own sex the making and keeping in order of sacred vestments and linen for the altar and the instruction of children and female converts preparing for baptism as well as the attending them at that sacred rite belonged to the deaconesses and gave sufficient occupation in addition to domestic offices in the exercise of both these classes of duties lucina quietly passed her life its main object seemed to be attained her son had offered himself to god and lived ready to shed his blood for the faith to watch over him and pray for him were her delight rather than an additional employment early in the morning of the appointed day the meeting mentioned in our last chapter took place it will be sufficient to say that in it full instructions were given for increasing the collection of alms to be employed in enlarging the cemeteries and burying the dead in succoring those driven to concealment by persecution in nourishing prisoners and obtaining access to them and finally in ransoming or rescuing the bodies of martyrs a notary was named for each region to collect their acts and record interesting events the cardinals or titular priests received instructions about the administration of sacraments particularly of the holy eucharist during the persecution and to each was intrusted one cemetery or more in whose subterranean church he was to perform the sacred mysteries the holy pontiff chose for himself that of callistus which made diogenes its chief sexton not a little but innocently proud illustration a chapel of the blessed sacrament the good old excavator seemed rather more cheery than otherwise under the exciting forebodings of a coming persecution no commanding officer of engineers could have given his orders more briskly or more decidedly for the defence of a fortified city committed to his skill to guard than he issued his to the subordinate superintendents of the various cemeteries round rome who met him by appointment at his own house to learn the instructions of the superior assembly the shadow of the sun dial at the porta capena was pointing to mid day as he issued from it with his sons and found already waiting the three young men they walked in parties of two along the appian road and at nearly two miles from the illustration underground gallery in the catacombs from th rollers catacombes de rome gate they entered by various ways slipping round different tombs that lined the road into the same villa on the right hand here they found all the requisites for a descent into the subterranean cemeteries such as candles lanterns and the instruments for procuring light severus proposed that as the guides and the strangers were in equal number they should be divided into pairs and in the division he allotted torquatus to himself what his reason was we may easily conjecture it would probably weary our readers to follow the whole conversation of the party diogenes not only answered all questions put to him but from time to time gave intelligent little lectures on such objects as he considered peculiarly attractive but we believe we shall better interest and inform our friends if we digest the whole matter of these into a more connected narrative and besides they will wish to know something of the subsequent history of those wonderful excavations into which we have conducted our youthful pilgrims the history of the early christian cemeteries the catacombs as they are commonly called may be divided into three portions from their beginning to the period of our narrative or a few years later from this term to the eighth century then down to our own time when we have reason to hope that a new epoch is being commenced we have generally avoided using the name of catacombs because it might mislead our readers into an idea that this was either the original or a generic name of those early christian crypts it is not so however rome might be said to be surrounded by a circumvallation of cemeteries sixty or thereabouts in number each of which was generally known by the name of some saint or saints whose bodies reposed there thus we have the cemeteries of ss nereus and achilleus illustration the tomb of saint cecilia on october cardinal sfondrati had her tomb opened and the body of the saint in a state of perfect preservation was found in the position here depicted the sculptor stefano maderno made an exact copy of it and his statue now ornaments her tomb of st agnes of st pancratius of prtextatus priscilla hermes c sometimes these cemeteries were known by the names of the places where they existed the cemetery of st sebastian which was called sometimes cmeterium ad sanctam cciliam and by other names had among them that of ad catacumbas the meaning of this word is completely unknown though it may be attributed to the circumstance of the relics of ss peter and paul having been for a time buried there in a crypt still existing near the cemetery this term became the name of that particular cemetery then was generalized till we familiarly call the whole system of these underground excavations the catacombs their origin was in the last century a subject of controversy following two or three vague and equivocal passages some learned writers pronounced the catacombs to have been originally heathen excavations made to extract sand for the building of the city these sand pits were called arenaria and so occasionally are the christian cemeteries but a more scientific and minute examination particularly made by the accurate f marchi has completely confuted this theory the entrance to the catacombs was often as can yet be seen from these sand pits which are themselves under ground and no doubt were a convenient cover for the cemetery but several circumstances prove that they were never used for christian burial nor converted into christian cemeteries the man who wishes to get the sand out of the ground will keep his excavation as near as may be to the surface will have it of easiest possible access for drawing out materials and will make it as ample as is consistent with the safety of the roof and the supply of what he is seeking and all this we find in the arenaria still abounding round rome but the catacombs are constructed on principles exactly contrary to all these the catacomb dives at once generally by a steep flight of steps below the stratum of loose and friable sand into that where it is indurated to the hardness of a tender but consistent rock on the surface of which every stroke of the pickaxe is yet distinctly traceable when you have reached this depth you are in the first story of the cemetery for you descend again by stairs to the second and third below all constructed on the same principle a catacomb may be divided into three parts its passages or streets its chambers or squares and its churches the passages are long narrow galleries cut with tolerable regularity so that the roof and floor are at right angles with the sides often so narrow as scarcely to allow two persons to go abreast they sometimes run quite straight to a great length but they are crossed by others and these again by others so as to form a complete labyrinth or net work of subterranean corridors to be lost among them would easily be fatal but these passages are not constructed as the name would imply merely to lead to something else they are themselves the catacomb or cemetery their walls as well as the sides of the staircases are honeycombed with graves that is with rows of excavations large and small of sufficient length to admit a human body from a child to a full grown man laid with its side to the gallery sometimes there are as many as fourteen sometimes as few as three or four of these rows one above the other they are evidently so made to measure that it is probable the body was lying by the side of the grave while this was being dug when the corpse wrapped up as we heard from diogenes was laid in its narrow cell the front was hermetically closed either by a marble slab or more frequently by several broad tiles put edgeways in a groove or mortice cut for them in the rock and cemented all round the inscription was cut upon the marble or scratched in the wet mortar thousands of the former sort have been collected and may be seen in museums and churches many of the latter have been copied and published but by far the greater number of tombs are anonymous and have no record upon them and now the reader may reasonably ask through what period does the interment in the catacombs range and how are its limits determined we will try to content him as briefly as possible illustration a loculus closed there is no evidence of the christians having ever buried any where anteriorily to the construction of catacombs two principles as old as christianity regulate this mode of burial the first is the manner of christs entombment he was laid in a grave in a cavern wrapped up in linen embalmed with spices and a stone sealed up closed his sepulchre as st paul so often proposes him for the model of our resurrection and speaks of our being buried with him in baptism it was natural for his disciples to wish to be buried after his example so as to be ready to rise with him this lying in wait for resurrection was the second thought that guided the formation of these cemeteries every expression connected with them alluded to the rising again the word to bury is unknown in christian inscriptions deposited in peace the deposition of are the expressions used that is the dead are but left there for a time till called for again as a pledge or precious thing intrusted to faithful but temporary keeping the very name of cemetery suggests that it is only a place where many lie as in a dormitory slumbering for a while till dawn come and the trumpets sound awake them hence the grave is only called the place or more technically the small home of the dead in christ these two ideas which are combined in the planning of the catacombs were not later insertions into the christian system but must have been more vivid in its earlier times they inspired abhorrence of the pagan custom of burning the dead nor have we a hint that this mode was at any time adopted by christians but ample proof is to be found in the catacombs themselves of their early origin the style of paintings yet remaining belongs to a period of still flourishing art their symbols and the symbolical taste itself are characteristic of a very ancient period for this peculiar taste declined as time went on although inscriptions with dates are rare yet out of ten thousand collected and about to be published by the learned and sagacious cavalier de rossi about three hundred are found bearing consular dates through every period from the early emperors to the middle of the fourth illustration a columbarium or underground sepulchre in which the romans deposited the urns containing the ashes of the dead century ad another curious and interesting custom furnishes us with dates on tombs at the closing of the grave the relations or friends to mark it would press into its wet plaster and leave there a coin a cameo or engraved gem sometimes even a shell or pebble probably that they might find the sepulchre again especially where no inscription was left many of these objects continue to be found many have been long collected but it is not uncommon where the coin or to speak scientifically the medal has fallen from its place to find a mould of it left distinct and clear in the cement which equally gives its date this is sometimes of domitian or other early emperors illustration a loculus open it may be asked wherefore this anxiety to rediscover with certainty the tomb besides motives of natural piety there is one constantly recorded on sepulchral inscriptions in england if want of space prevented the full date of a persons death being given we should prefer chronicling the year to the day of the month when it occurred it is more historical no one cares about remembering the day on which a person died without the year but the year without the day is an important recollection yet while so few ancient christian inscriptions supply the year of peoples deaths thousands give us the very day of it on which they died whether in the hopefulness of believers or in the assurance of martyrs this is easily explained of both classes annual commemoration had to be made on the very day of their departure and accurate knowledge of this was necessary therefore it alone was recorded in a cemetery close to the one in which we have left our three youths with diogenes and his sons were lately found inscriptions mingled together belonging to both orders of the dead one in greek after mentioning the deposition of augenda on the th day before the calends or st of june adds this simple address cc enk kai epta live in the lord and pray for us another fragment is as follows n ivn ivibas in pace et pete pro nobis nones of june live in peace and pray for us this is a third victoria refrigerer et isspiritvs tvs in bono victoria be refreshed and may thy spirit be in enjoyment good this last reminds us of a most peculiar inscription found scratched in the mortar beside a grave in the cemetery of prtextatus not many yards from that of callistus it is remarkable first for being in latin written with greek letters then for containing a testimony of the divinity of our lord lastly for expressing a prayer for the refreshment of the departed we fill up the portions of words wanting from the falling out of part of the plaster illustration to the well deserving sister bon the eighth day before the calends of nov christ god almighty refresh thy spirit in christ in spite of this digression on prayers inscribed over tombs the reader will not we trust have forgotten that we were establishing the fact that the christian cemeteries of rome owe their origin to the earliest ages we have now to state down to what period they were used after peace was restored to the church the devotion of christians prompted them to desire burial near the martyrs and holy people of an earlier age but generally speaking they were satisfied to lie under the pavement hence the sepulchral stones which are often found in the rubbish of the catacombs and sometimes in their places bearing consular dates of the fourth century are thicker larger better carved and in a less simple style than those of an earlier period placed upon the walls but before the end of that century these monuments become rarer and interment in the catacombs ceased in the following at latest pope damasus who died in reverently shrunk as he tells us in his own epitaph from intruding into the company of the saints illustration a lamb with a milk pail emblematic of the blessed eucharist found in the catacombs restitutus therefore whose sepulchral tablet we gave for a title to our chapter may well be considered as speaking in the name of the early christians and claiming as their own exclusive work and property the thousand miles of subterranean city with their six millions of slumbering inhabitants who trust in the lord and await his resurrection chapter iii what diogenes could not tell about the catacombs diogenes lived during the first period in the history of the cemeteries though near its close could he have looked into their future fate he would have seen near at hand an epoch that would have gladdened his heart to be followed by one that would have deeply afflicted him although therefore the matter of this chapter have no direct bearing upon our narrative it will serve essentially to connect it with the present topography of its scene when peace and liberty were restored to the church these cemeteries became places of devotion and of great resort each of them was associated with the name of one or the names of several of the more eminent martyrs buried in it and on their anniversaries crowds of citizens and of pilgrims thronged to their tombs where the divine mysteries were offered up and the homily delivered in their praise hence began to be compiled the first martyrologies or calendars of martyrs days which told the faithful whither to go at rome on the salarian or the appian or the ardeatine way such are the indications almost daily read in the roman martyrology now swelled out by the additions of later ages an ordinary reader of the book hardly knows the importance of these indications for they have served to verify several otherwise dubious cemeteries another class of valuable writers also comes to our aid but before mentioning them we will glance at the changes which this devotion produced in the cemeteries first commodious entrances with easy staircases were made then walls were built to support the crumbling galleries and from time to time funnel shaped apertures in the vaults were opened to admit light and air finally basilicas or churches were erected over their entrances generally leading immediately to the principal tomb then called the confession of the church the pilgrim thus on arriving at the holy city visited each of these churches a custom yet practised descended below and without having to grope his way about went direct by well constructed passages to the principal martyrs shrine and so on to others perhaps equally objects of reverence and devotion during this period no tomb was allowed to be opened no body to be extracted through apertures made into the grave handkerchiefs or scarfs called brandea were introduced to touch the martyrs relics and these were carried to distant countries to be held in equal reverence no wonder that st ambrose st gaudentius and other bishops should have found it so difficult to obtain bodies or large relics of martyrs for their churches another sort of relics consisted of what was called familiarly the oil of a martyr that is the oil often mixed with balsam which burned in a lamp beside his tomb often a round stone pillar three feet or so in height and scooped out at the top stands beside a monument probably to hold the lamp or serve for the distribution of its contents st gregory the great wrote to queen theodelinda that he sent her a collection of the oils of the popes who were martyrs the list which accompanied them was copied by mabillon in the treasury of monza and republished by ruinart it exists there yet together with the very phials containing them sealed up in metal tubes this jealousy of disturbing the saints is displayed most beautifully in an incident related by st gregory of tours among the martyrs most honored in the ancient roman church were sts chrysanthus and daria their tombs became so celebrated for cures that their fellow christians built that is excavated over them a chamber with a vault of beautiful workmanship where crowds of worshippers assembled this was discovered by the heathens and the emperor closed them in walled up the entrance and from above probably through the luminare or ventilating shaft showered down earth and stones and buried the congregation alive as the two holy martyrs had been before them the place was unknown at the peace of the church till discovered by divine manifestation but instead of being permitted to enter again into this hallowed spot pilgrims were merely allowed to look at it through a window opened in the wall so as to see not only the tombs of the martyrs but also the bodies of those who had been buried alive at their shrines and as the cruel massacre had taken place while preparations were being made for oblation of the holy eucharist there were still to be seen lying about the silver cruets in which the wine was brought for that spotless sacrifice it is clear that pilgrims resorting to rome would want a hand book to the cemeteries that they might know what they had to visit it is likewise but natural that on their return home they may have sought to edify their less fortunate neighbors by giving an account of what they had seen accordingly there exists no less fortunately for us than for their untravelled neighbors several records of this character the first place among these is held by catalogues compiled in the fourth century one of the places of sepulture of roman pontiffs the other of martyrs after these come three distinct guides to the catacombs the more interesting because they take different rounds yet agree marvellously in their account to show the value of these documents and describe the changes which took place in the catacombs during the second period of their history we will give a brief account of one discovery in the cemetery where we have left our little party among the rubbish near the entrance of a catacomb the name of which was yet doubtful and which had been taken for that of prtextatus was found a fragment of a slab of marble which had been broken across obliquely from left to right with the following letters nelii martyris the young cavalier de rossi at once declared that this was part of the sepulchral inscription of the holy pope cornelius that probably his tomb would be found below in a distinguished form and that as all the itineraries above mentioned concurred in placing it in the cemetery of callistus this and not the one at st sebastians a few hundred yards off must claim the honor of that name he went further and foretold that as these works pronounced st cyprian to be buried near cornelius there would be found something at the tomb which would account for that idea for it was known that his body rested in africa it was not long before every prediction was verified the great staircase discovered was found to lead at once to a wider space carefully secured by brick work of the time of peace and provided with light and air from above on the left was a tomb cut like others in the rock without any exterior arch over it it was however large and ample and except one very high above it there were no other graves below or over or at the sides the remaining portion of the slab was found within it the first piece was brought from the kircherian museum where it had been deposited and exactly fitted to it and both covered the tomb thus cornelii martyris ep below reaching from the lower edge of this stone to the ground was a marble slab covered with an inscription of which only the left hand end remains the rest being broken off and lost above the tomb was another slab let into the sand stone of which the right hand end exists and a few more fragments have been recovered in the rubbish not enough to make out the lines but sufficient to show it was an inscription in verse by pope damasus how is this authorship traceable very easily not only do we know that this holy pope already mentioned took pleasure in putting verses which he loved to write on the tombs of martyrs but the number of inscriptions of his yet extant exhibit a particular and very elegant form of letters known among antiquarians by the name of damasian the fragments of this marble bear portions of verses in this character illustration saint cornelius and saint cyprian from de rossis roma sotteranea to proceed on the wall right of the tomb and on the same plane were painted two full length figures in sacerdotal garments with glories round their heads evidently of byzantine work of the seventh century down the wall by the left side of each letter below letter were their names some letters were effaced which we supply in italics as follow si cornelpp sci prin we here see how a foreigner reading these two inscriptions with the portraits and knowing that the church commemorates the two martyrs on the same day might easily be led to suppose that they were here deposited together finally at the right hand of the tomb stands a truncated column about three feet high concave at the top as before described and as a confirmation of the use to which we said it might be put st gregory has in his list of oils sent to the lombard queen oleum s cornelii the oil of st cornelius we see then how during the second period new ornaments as well as greater conveniences were added to the primitively simple forms of the cemeteries but we must not on that account imagine that we are in any danger of mistaking these later embellishments for the productions of the early ages the difference is so immense that we might as easily blunder by taking a rubens for a beato angelico as by considering a byzantine figure to be a production of the two first centuries we come now to the third period of these holy cemeteries the sad one of their desolation when the lombards and later the saracens began to devastate the neighborhood of rome and the catacombs were exposed to desecration the popes extracted the bodies of the most illustrious martyrs and placed them in the basilicas of the city this went on till the eighth or ninth century when we still read of repairs made in the cemeteries by the sovereign pontiffs the catacombs ceased to be so much places of devotion and the churches which stood over their entrances were destroyed or fell to decay only those remained which were fortified and could be defended such are the extramural basilicas of st paul on the ostian way of st sebastian on the appian st laurence on the tiburtine or in the ager veranus st agnes on the nomentan road st pancratius on the aurelian and greatest of all st peters on the vatican the first and last had separate burghs or cities round them and the traveller can still trace remains of strong walls round some of the others strange it is however that the young antiquarian whom we have frequently named with honor should have re discovered two of the basilicas over the entrance to the cemetery of callistus almost entire the one being a stable and bakehouse the other a wine store one is most probably that built by pope damasus so often mentioned the earth washed down through air holes the spoliation practised during ages by persons entering from vineyards through unguarded entrances the mere wasting action of time and weather have left us but a wreck of the ancient catacombs still there is much to be thankful for enough remains to verify the records left us in better times and these serve to guide us to the reconstruction of our ruins the present pontiff has done more in a few years for these sacred places which he has appointed have done wonders with very limited means they are going systematically to work finishing as they advance nothing is taken from the spot where it is found but every thing is restored as far as possible to its original state accurate tracings are made of all the paintings and plans of every part explored to secure these good results the pope has from his own resources bought vineyards and fields especially at tor marancia where the cemetery of ss nereus and achilleus is situated and we believe also over that of callistus the french emperor too has sent to rome artists who have produced a most magnificent work perhaps somewhat overdone upon the catacombs a truly imperial undertaking illustration the tomb of cornelius it is time however for us to rejoin our party below and finish our inspection of these marvellous cities of departed saints under the guidance of our friends the excavators chapter iv what diogenes did tell about the catacombs all that we have told our readers of the first period of the history of subterranean rome as ecclesiastical antiquarians love to call the catacombs has no doubt been better related by diogenes to his youthful hearers as taper in hand they have been slowly walking through a long straight gallery crossed indeed by many others but adhered to faithfully with sundry pauses and of course lectures embodying what we have put together in our prosaic second chapter at length diogenes turned to the right and torquatus looked around him anxiously i wonder he said how many turns we have passed by before leaving this main gallery a great many answered severus drily how many do you think ten or twenty full that i fancy for i never have counted them torquatus had however but wished to make sure he continued still pausing how do you distinguish the right turn then oh what is this and he pretended to examine a small niche in the corner but severus kept too sharp a look out and saw that he was making a mark in the sand come come along he said or we shall lose sight of the rest and not see which way they turn that little niche is to hold a lamp you will find one at each angle as to ourselves we know every alley and turn here below as you do those of the city above illustration a lamp with a representation of the good shepherd found at ostium prior to the third century from rollers catacombes torquatus was somewhat reassured by this account of the lamps those little earthen ones evidently made on purpose for the catacombs of which so many are there found but not content he kept as good count as he could of the turns as they went and now with one excuse and now with another he constantly stopped and scrutinized particular spots and corners but severus had a lynxs eye upon him and allowed nothing to escape his attention at last they entered a doorway and found themselves in a square chamber richly adorned with paintings what do you call this asked tiburtius it is one of the many crypts or cubicula which abound in our cemeteries answered diogenes sometimes they are merely family sepultures but generally they contain the tomb of some martyr on whose anniversary we meet here see that tomb opposite us which though flush with the wall is arched over that becomes on such an occasion the altar whereon the divine mysteries are celebrated you are of course aware of the custom of so performing them illustration cubiculum or crypt as found in the catacombs perhaps my two friends interposed pancratius so recently baptized may not have heard it but i know it well it is surely one of the glorious privileges of martyrdom to have the lords sacred body and precious blood offered upon ones ashes and to repose thus under the very feet of god but let us see well the paintings all over this crypt illustration the last supper from a picture in the cemetery of st callistus it is on account of them that i brought you into this chamber in preference to so many others in the cemetery it is one of the most ancient and contains a most complete series of pictures from the remotest times down to some of my sons doing well then diogenes explain them systematically to my friends said pancratius i think i know most of them but not all and i shall be glad to hear you describe them i am no scholar replied the old man modestly but when one has lived sixty years man and boy among things one gets to know them better than others because one loves them more all here have been fully initiated i suppose he added with a pause all answered tiburtius though not so fully instructed as converts ordinarily are torquatus and myself have received the sacred gift illustration a ceiling in the catacombs from de rossis roma sotteranea enough resumed the excavator the ceiling is the oldest part of the painting as is natural for that was done when the crypt was excavated whereas the walls were decorated as tombs were hollowed out you see the ceiling has a sort of trellis work painted over it with grapes to represent perhaps our true vine of which we are the branches there you see orpheus sitting down and playing sweet music not only to his own flock but to the wild beasts of the desert which stand charmed around him why that is a heathen picture altogether interrupted torquatus with pettishness and some sarcasm what has it to do with christianity it is an allegory torquatus replied pancratius gently and a favorite one the use of gentile images when in themselves harmless has been permitted you see masks for instance and other pagan ornaments in this ceiling and they belong generally to a very ancient period and so our lord was represented under the symbol of orpheus to conceal his sacred representation from gentile blasphemy and sacrilege look now in that arch you have a more recent representation of the same subject illustration our lord under the symbol of orpheus from a picture in the cemetery of domitilius i see said torquatus a shepherd with a sheep over his shoulders the good shepherd that i can understand i remember the parable but why is this subject such a favorite one asked tiburtius i have observed it in other cemeteries if you will look over the arcosolium answered severus you will see a fuller representation of the scene but i think we had better first continue what we have begun and finish the ceiling you see that figure on the right illustration the good shepherd a woman praying from the arcosolium of the cemetery of sts nereus and achilleus yes replied tiburtius it is that of a man apparently in a chest with a dove flying towards him is that meant to represent the deluge it is said severus as the emblem of regeneration by water and the holy spirit and of the salvation of the world such is our beginning and here is our end jonas thrown out of the boat and swallowed by the whale and then sitting in enjoyment under his gourd the resurrection with our lord and eternal rest as its fruit how natural is this representation in such a place observed pancratius pointing to the other side and here we have another type of the same consoling doctrine where asked torquatus languidly i see nothing but a figure bandaged all round and standing up like a huge infant in a small temple and another person opposite to it exactly said severus that is the way we always represent the resurrection of lazarus here look is a touching expression of the hopes of our fathers in persecution the three babylonian children in the fiery furnace illustration a ceiling in the catacombs in the cemetery of domitilla third century well now i think said torquatus we may come to the arcosolium and finish this room what are these pictures round it if you look at the left side you see the multiplication of the loaves and fishes the fish is you know the symbol of christ why so asked torquatus rather impatiently severus turned to pancratius as the better scholar to answer there are two opinions about its origin said the youth readily one finds the meaning in the word itself its letters forming the beginning of words so as to mean jesus christ son of god saviour another puts it in the symbol itself that as fish are born and live in the water so is the christian born of water and buried with christ in it by baptism hence as we came along we saw the figure of a fish carved on tombs or its name engraven on them now go on severus illustration the fishes and anchor illustration the fishes and doves then the union of the bread and the fish in one multiplication shows us how in the eucharist christ becomes the food of all opposite is moses striking the rock from which all drank and which is christ our drink as well as our food now at last said torquatus we are come to the good shepherd yes continued severus you see him in the centre of the arcosolium in his simple tunic and leggings with a sheep upon his shoulders the recovered wanderer from the flock two more are standing at his sides the truant ram on his right the gentle ewe upon his left the penitent in the post of honor on each side too you see a person evidently sent by him to preach both are leaning forward and addressing sheep not of the fold one on either side is apparently giving no heed to their words but browsing quietly on while one is turning up its eyes and head looking and listening with eager attention rain is falling copiously on them that is the grace of god it is not difficult to interpret this picture but what makes this emblem such a particular favorite again pressed tiburtius we consider this and similar paintings to belong chiefly to the time when the novatian heresy so much plagued the church answered severus and pray what heresy is that asked torquatus carelessly for he thought he was losing time it was and indeed is the heresy answered pancratius that teaches that there are sins which the church has not power to forgive which are too great for god to pardon pancratius was not aware of the effect of his words but severus who never took off his eye from torquatus saw the blood come and go violently in his countenance is that a heresy asked the traitor confused surely a dreadful one replied pancratius to limit the mercy and forgiveness of him who came to call not the just but sinners to repentance the catholic church has always held that a sinner however dark the dye however huge the mass of his crimes on truly repenting may receive forgiveness through the penitential remedy left in her hands and therefore she has always so much loved this type of the good shepherd ready to run into the wilderness to bring back a lost sheep but suppose said torquatus evidently moved that one who had become a christian and received the sacred gift were to fall away and plunge into vice and and his voice faltered almost betray his brethren would not the church reject such a one from hope illustration the blessed virgin and the magi from a picture in the cemetery of callistus no no answered the youth these are the very crimes which the novatians insult the catholics for admitting to pardon the church is a mother with her arms ever open to re embrace her erring children there was a tear trembling in torquatuss eye his lips quivered with the confession of his guilt which ascended to them for a moment but as if a black poisonous drop rose up his throat with it and choked him he changed in a moment to a hard obstinate look bit his lip and said with an effort at coolness it is certainly a consoling doctrine for those that need it severus alone observed that a moment of grace had been forfeited and that some despairing thought had quenched a flash of hope in that mans heart diogenes and majus who had been absent looking at a new place for opening a gallery near now returned torquatus addressed the old master digger we have now seen the galleries and the chambers i am anxious to visit the church in which we shall have to assemble the unconscious excavator was going to lead the way when the inexorable artist interposed i think father it is too late for to day you know we have got our work to do these young friends will excuse us especially as they will see the church in good time and in better order also as the holy pontiff intends to officiate in it they assented and when they arrived at the point where they had turned off from the first straight gallery to visit the ornamented chamber diogenes stopped the party turned a few steps along an opposite passage and said if you pursue this corridor and turn to the right you come to the church i have merely brought you here to show you an arcosolium with a beautiful painting you here see the virgin mother holding her divine infant in her arms while the wise easterns here represented as four though generally we only reckon three are adoring him all admired the painting but poor severus was much chagrined at seeing how his good father had unwittingly supplied the information desired by torquatus and had furnished him with a sure clue to the desired turn by calling his attention to the tomb close round it distinguishable by so remarkable a picture when their company was departed he told all that he had observed to his brother remarking that man will give us trouble yet i strongly suspect him in a short time they had removed every mark which torquatus had made at the turnings but this was no security against his reckonings and they determined to prepare for changing the road by blocking up the present one and turning off at another point for this purpose they had the sand of new excavations brought to the ends of a gallery which crossed the main avenue where this was low and left it heaped up there till the faithful could be instructed of the intended change illustration moses striking the rock from the cemetery of inter duos lauros chapter v above ground to recover our reader from his long subterranean excursion we must take him with us on another visit to the happy campania or campany the blest as an old writer might have called it there we left fabiola perplexed by some sentences which she had found they came to her like a letter from another world she hardly knew of what character she wished to learn more about them but she hardly durst inquire many visitors called the next day and for several days after and she often thought of putting before some or other of them the mysterious sentences but she could not bring herself to do it a lady whose life was like her own philosophically correct and coldly virtuous came and they talked together over the fashionable opinions of the day she took out her vellum page to puzzle her but she shrank from submitting it to her it felt profane to do so a learned man well read in all branches of science and literature paid her a long visit and spoke very charmingly on the sublimer views of the older schools she was tempted to consult him about her discovery but it seemed to contain something higher than he could comprehend it was strange that after all when wisdom or consolation was to be sought the noble and haughty roman lady should turn instinctively to her christian slave and so it was now the first moment they were alone after several days of company and visits fabiola produced her parchment and placed it before syra there passed over her countenance an emotion not observable to her mistress but she was perfectly calm as she looked up from reading that writing said her mistress i got at chromatiuss villa on the back of a note probably by mistake i cannot drive it out of my mind which is quite perplexed by it why should it be so my noble lady its sense seems plain enough yes and that very plainness gives me trouble my natural feelings revolt against this sentiment i fancy i ought to despise a man who does not resent an injury and return hatred for hatred to forgive at most would be much but to do good in return for evil seems to me an unnatural exaction from human nature now while i feel all this i am conscious that i have been brought to esteem you for conduct exactly the reverse of what i am naturally impelled to expect oh do not talk of me my dear mistress but look at the simple principle you honor it in others too do you despise or do you respect aristides for obliging a boorish enemy by writing when asked his own name on the shell that voted his banishment do you as a roman lady contemn or honor the name of coriolanus for his generous forbearance to your city i venerate both most truly syra but then you know those were heroes and not every day men and why should we not all be heroes asked syra laughing bless me child what a world we should live in if we were it is very pleasant reading about the feats of such wonderful people but one would be very sorry to see them performed by common men every day why so pressed the servant why so who would like to find a baby she was nursing playing with or strangling serpents in the cradle i should be very sorry to have a gentleman whom i invited to dinner telling me coolly he had that morning killed a minotaur or strangled a hydra or to have a friend offering to send the tiber through my stables to cleanse them preserve us from a generation of heroes say i and fabiola laughed heartily at the conceit in the same good humor syra continued but suppose we had the misfortune to live in a country where such monsters existed centaurs and minotaurs hydras and dragons would it not be better that common men should be heroes enough to conquer them than that we should have to send off to the other side of the world for a theseus or a hercules to destroy them in fact in that case a man would be no more a hero if he fought them than a lion slayer is in my country quite true syra but i do not see the application of your idea it is this anger hatred revenge ambition avarice are to my mind as complete monsters as serpents or dragons and they attack common men as much as great ones why should not i try to be as able to conquer them as aristides or coriolanus or cincinnatus why leave it to heroes only to do what we can do as well and do you really hold this as a common moral principle if so i fear you will soar too high no dear lady you were startled when i ventured to maintain that inward and unseen virtue was as necessary as the outward and visible i fear i must surprise you still more go on and do not fear to tell me all well then the principle of that system which i profess is this that we must treat and practise as every day and common virtue nay as simple duty whatever any other code the purest and sublimest that may be considers heroic and proof of transcendent virtue that is indeed a sublime standard to form of moral elevation but mark the difference between the two cases the hero is supported by the praises of the world his act is recorded and transmitted to posterity when he checks his passions and performs a sublime action but who sees cares for or shall requite the poor obscure wretch who in humble secrecy imitates his conduct syra with solemn reverential look and gesture raised her eyes and her right hand to heaven and slowly said his father who is in heaven who maketh his sun to rise on the good and the bad and raineth on the just and the unjust fabiola paused for a time overawed then said affectionately and respectfully again syra you have conquered my philosophy your wisdom is consistent as it is sublime a virtue heroic even when unseen you propose as the ordinary daily virtue of every one men must indeed become more than what gods have been thought to be to attempt it but the very idea is worth a whole philosophy can you lead me higher than this oh far far higher still and where at length would you leave me illustration monogram of christ found in the catacombs where your heart should tell you that it had found peace chapter vi deliberations the persecution had now been some time raging in the east under dioclesian and galerius and the decree for enkindling it throughout the west had reached maximian but it had been resolved to make this a work not of repression but of extermination of the christian name it had been determined to spare no one but cutting off the chiefs of the religion first to descend down to the wholesale butchery of the poorest classes it was necessary for this purpose to concert measures that the various engines of destruction might work in cruel harmony that every possible instrument should be employed to secure completeness to the effort and also that the majesty of imperial command should add its grandeur and its terror to the crushing blow for this purpose the emperor though impatient to begin his work of blood had yielded to the opinion of his counsellors that the edict should be kept concealed till it could be published simultaneously in every province and government of the west the thundercloud fraught with vengeance would thus hang for a time in painful mystery over its intended victims and then burst suddenly upon them discharging upon their heads its mingled elements and its fire hail snow ice and boisterous blast it was in the month of november that maximian herculeus convoked the meeting in which his plans had finally to be adjusted to it were summoned the leading officers of his court and of the state the principal one the prefect of the city had brought with him his son corvinus whom he had proposed to be captain of a body of armed pursuivants picked out for their savageness and hatred of christians who should hunt them out or down with unrelenting assiduity the chief prefects or governors of sicily italy spain and gaul were present to receive their orders in addition to these several learned men philosophers and orators among whom was our old acquaintance calpurnius had been invited and many priests who had come from different parts to petition for heavier persecution were commanded to attend illustration maximian herculeus holding his horse by the bridle and protected by a shield bearing a she wolf from a bronze medal in the collection of france the usual residence of the emperors as we have seen was the palatine there was however another much esteemed by them which maximian herculeus in particular preferred during the reign of nero the wealthy senator plautius lateranus was charged with conspiracy and of course punished with death his immense property was seized by the emperor and part of this was his house described by juvenal and other writers as of unusual size and magnificence it was beautifully situated on the clian hill and on the southern verge of the city so that from it was a view unequalled even in the vicinity of rome stretching across the wavy campagna here bestrided by colossal aqueducts crossed by lines of roads with their fringes of marble tombs and bespangled all over with glittering villas set like gems in the dark green enamel of laurel and cypress the eye reached at evening the purple slope of hills on which as on a couch lay stretched luxuriously alba and tusculum with their daughters according to oriental phrase illustration the claudian aqueduct basking brightly in the setting sun the craggy range of sabine mountains on the left and the golden expanse of the sea on the right of the beholder closed in this perfect landscape it would be attributing to maximian a quality which he did not possess were we to give him credit for loving a residence so admirably situated through any taste for the beautiful the splendor of the buildings which he had still further adorned or possibly the facility of running out of the city for the chase of boar and wolf was the motive of this preference a native of sirmium in sclavonia a reputed barbarian therefore of the lowest extraction a mere soldier of fortune without any education endowed with little more than a brute strength which made his surname of herculeus most appropriate he had been raised to the purple by his brother barbarian diocles known as the emperor dioclesian like him covetous to meanness and spendthrift to recklessness addicted to the same coarse vices and foul crimes which a christian pen refuses to record without restraint of any passion without sense of justice or feeling of humanity this monster had never ceased to oppress persecute and slay whoever stood in his way to him the coming persecution looked like an approaching feast does to a glutton who requires the excitement of a surfeit to relieve the monotony of daily excess gigantic in frame with the well known features of his race with the hair on his head and face more yellow than red shaggy and wild like tufts of straw with eyes restlessly rolling in a compound expression of suspicion profligacy and ferocity this almost last of romes tyrants struck terror into the heart of any beholder except a christian is it wonderful that he hated the race and its name in the large basilica or hall then of the des lateran maximian met his motley council in which secrecy was ensured by penalty of death in the semicircular apse at the upper end of the hall sat the emperor on an ivory throne richly adorned and before him were arranged his obsequious and almost trembling advisers a chosen body of guards kept the entrance and the officer in command sebastian was leaning negligently against it on the inside but carefully noted every word that was spoken little did the emperor think that the hall in which he sat and which he afterwards gave with the contiguous palace to constantine as part of the dowry of his daughter fausta would be transferred by him to the head of the religion he was planning to extirpate and become retaining its name of the lateran basilica the cathedral of rome of all the churches of the city and of the world the mother and chief little did he imagine that on the spot whereon rested his throne would be raised a chair whence commands should issue to reach worlds unknown to roman sway from an immortal race of sovereigns spiritual and temporal precedence was granted by religious courtesy to the priests each of whom had his tale to tell here a river had overflowed its banks and done much mischief to the neighboring plains there an earthquake had thrown down part of a town on the northern frontiers the barbarians threatened invasion at the south the plague was ravaging the pious population in every instance the oracles had declared that it was all owing to the christians whose toleration irritated the gods and whose evil charms brought calamity on the empire nay some had afflicted their votaries by openly proclaiming that they would utter no more till the odious nazarenes had been exterminated and the great delphic oracle had not hesitated to declare that the just did not allow the gods to speak next came the philosophers and orators each of whom made his own long winded oration during which maximian gave unequivocal signs of weariness but as the emperors in the east had held a similar meeting he considered it his duty to sit out the annoyance the usual calumnies were repeated for the ten thousandth time to an applauding assembly the stories of murdering and eating infants of committing foul crimes of worshipping martyrs bodies of adoring an asss head and inconsistently enough of being unbelievers and serving no god these tales were all most firmly believed though probably their reciters knew perfectly well they were but good sound heathen lies very useful in keeping up a horror of christianity but at length up rose the man who was considered to have most deeply studied the doctrines of the enemy and best to know their dangerous tactics he was supposed to have read their own books and to be drawing up a confutation of their errors which would fairly crush them indeed so great was his weight with his own side that when he asserted that christians held any monstrous principle had their supreme pontiff in person contradicted it every one would have laughed at the very idea of taking his word for his own belief against the assertion of calpurnius he struck up a different strain and his learning quite astonished his fellow sophists he had read the original books he said not only of the christians themselves but of their forefathers the jews who having come into egypt in the reign of ptolemy philadelphus to escape from a famine in their own country through the arts of their leader josephus bought up all the corn there and sent it home upon which ptolemy imprisoned them telling them that as they had eaten up all the corn they should live on the straw by making bricks with it for building a great city then demetrius phalerius hearing from them of a great many curious histories of their ancestors shut up moses and aaron their most learned men in a tower having shaved half their beards till they should write in greek all their records these rare books calpurnius had seen and he would build his argument entirely on them this race made war upon every king and people that came in their way and destroyed them all it was their principle if they took a city to put every one to the sword and this was all because they were under the government of their ambitious priests so that when a certain king saul called also paul spared a poor captive monarch whose name was agag the priests ordered him to be brought out and hewed in pieces now continued he these christians are still under the domination of the same priesthood and are quite as ready to day under their direction to overthrow the great roman empire burn us all in the forum and even sacrilegiously assail the sacred and venerable heads of our divine emperors a thrill of horror ran through the assembly at this recital it was soon hushed as the emperor opened his mouth to speak for my part he said i have another and a stronger reason for my abhorrence of these christians they have dared to establish in the heart of the empire and in this very city a supreme religious authority unknown here before independent of the government of the state and equally powerful over their minds as this formerly all acknowledged the emperor as supreme in religious as in civil rule hence he bears still the title of pontifex maximus but these men have raised up a divided power and consequently bear but a divided loyalty i hate therefore as a usurpation in my dominions this sacerdotal sway over my subjects for i declare that i would rather hear of a new rival starting up to my throne than of the election of one of these priests in rome this speech delivered in a harsh grating voice and with a vulgar foreign accent was received with immense applause and plans were formed for the simultaneous publication of the edict through the west and for its complete and exterminating execution then turning sharp upon tertullus the emperor said prefect you said you had some one to propose for superintending these arrangements and for merciless dealings with these traitors he is here sire my son corvinus and tertullus handed the youthful candidate to the grim tyrants footstool where he knelt maximian eyed him keenly burst into a hideous laugh and said upon my word i think hell do why prefect i had no idea you had such an ugly son i should think he is just the thing every quality of a thoroughpaced unconscientious scape grace is stamped upon his features then turning to corvinus who was scarlet with rage terror and shame he said to him mind you sirrah i must have clean work of it no hacking and hewing no blundering i pay up well if i am well served but i pay off well too if badly served so now go and remember that if your back can answer for a small fault your head will for a greater the lictors fasces contain an axe as well as rods the emperor rose to depart when his eye caught fulvius who had been summoned as a paid court spy but who kept as much in the back ground as possible ho there my eastern worthy he called out to him draw nearer fulvius obeyed with apparent cheerfulness but with real reluctance much the same as if he had been invited to go very near a tiger the strength of whose chain he was not quite sure about he had seen from the beginning that his coming to rome had not been acceptable to maximian though he knew not fully the cause it was not merely that the tyrant had plenty of favorites of his own to enrich and spies to pay without dioclesians sending him more from asia though this had its weight but it was more he believed in his heart that fulvius had been sent principally to act the spy upon himself and to report to nicomedia the sayings and doings of his court while therefore he was obliged to tolerate him and employ him he mistrusted and disliked him which in him was equivalent to hating him it was some compensation therefore to corvinus when he heard his more polished confederate publicly addressed as rudely as himself in the following terms none of your smooth put on looks for me fellow i want deeds not smirks you came here as a famous plothunter a sort of stoat to pull conspirators out of their nests or suck their eggs for me i have seen nothing of this so far and yet you have had plenty of money to set you up in business these christians will afford you plenty of game so make yourself ready and let us see what you can do you know my ways you had better look sharp about you therefore or you may have to look at something very sharp before you the property of the convicted will be divided between the accusers and the treasury unless i see particular reasons for taking the whole to myself now you may go illustration monogram of christ found in the catacombs most thought that these particular reasons would turn out to be very general chapter vii dark death a few days after fabiolas return from the country sebastian considered it his duty to wait upon her to communicate so much of the dialogue between corvinus and her black slave as he could without causing unnecessary suffering we have already observed that of the many noble youths whom fabiola had met in her fathers house none had excited her admiration and respect except sebastian so frank so generous so brave yet so unboasting so mild so kind in act and speech so unselfish and so careful of others blending so completely in one character nobleness and simplicity high wisdom and practical sense he seemed to her the most finished type of manly virtue one which would not easily suffer by time nor weary by familiarity when therefore it was announced to her that the officer sebastian wished to speak to her alone in one of the halls below her heart beat at the unusual tidings and conjured up a thousand strange fancies about the possible topics of his interview this agitation was not diminished when after apologizing for his seeming intrusion he remarked with a smile that well knowing how sufficiently she was already annoyed by the many candidates for her hand he felt regret at the idea that he was going to add another yet undeclared to her list if this ambiguous preface surprised and perhaps elated her she was soon depressed again upon being told it was the vulgar and stupid corvinus for her father even little as he knew how to discriminate characters out of business had seen enough of him at his late banquet to characterize him to his daughter by those epithets sebastian fearing rather the physical than the moral activity of afras drugs thought it right to inform her of the compact between the two dabblers in the black art the principal efficacy of which however seemed to consist in drawing money from the purse of a reluctant dupe he of course said nothing of what related to the christians in that dialogue he put her on her guard and she promised to prevent the nightly excursions of her necromancer slave what afra had engaged to do she did not for a moment believe it was ever her intention to attempt neither did she fear arts which she utterly despised indeed afras last soliloquy seemed satisfactorily to prove that she was only deceiving her victim but she certainly felt indignant at having been bargained about by two such vile characters and having been represented as a grasping avaricious woman whose price was gold i feel she said at last to sebastian how very kind it is of you to come thus to put me on my guard and i admire the delicacy with which you have unfolded so disagreeable a matter and the tenderness with which you have treated every one concerned i have only done in this instance replied the soldier what i should have done for any human being save him if possible from pain or danger your friends i hope you mean said fabiola smiling otherwise i fear your whole life would go in works of unrequited benevolence and so let it go it could not be better spent surely you are not in earnest sebastian if you saw one who had ever hated you and sought your destruction threatened with a calamity which would make him harmless would you stretch out your hand to save or succor him certainly i would while god sends his sunshine and his rain equally upon his enemies as upon his friends shall weak man frame another rule of justice at these words fabiola wondered they were so like those of her mysterious parchment identical with the moral theories of her slave you have been in the east i believe sebastian she asked him rather abruptly was it there that you learnt these principles for i have one near me who is yet by her own choice a servant a woman of rare moral perceptions who has propounded to me the same ideas and she is an asiatic it is not in any distant country that i learnt them for here i sucked them in with my mothers milk though originally they doubtless came from the east they are certainly beautiful in the abstract remarked fabiola but death would overtake us before we could half carry them out were we to make them our principles of conduct and how better could death find us though not surprise us than in thus doing our duty even if not to its completion for my part resumed the lady i am of the old epicurean poets mind this world is a banquet from which i shall be ready to depart when i have had my fill ut conviva satur and not till then i wish to read lifes book through and close it calmly only when i have finished its last page sebastian shook his head smiling and said the last page of this worlds book comes but in the middle of the volume wherever death may happen to be written but on the next page begins the illuminated book of a new life without a last page i understand you replied fabiola good humoredly you are a brave soldier and you speak as such you must be always prepared for death from a thousand casualties we seldom see it approach suddenly it comes more mercifully and stealthily upon the weak you no doubt are musing on a more glorious fate on receiving in front full sheaves of arrows from the enemy and falling covered with honor you look to the soldiers funeral pile with trophies erected over it to you after death opens its bright page the book of glory no no gentle lady exclaimed sebastian emphatically i mean not so i care not for glory which can only be enjoyed by an anticipating fancy i speak of vulgar death as it may come to me in common with the poorest slave consuming me by slow burning fever wasting me by long lingering consumption racking me by slowly eating ulcers nay if you please by the still crueller inflictions of mens wrath in any form let it come it comes from a hand that i love and do you really mean that death so contemplated would be welcomed by you as joyful as is the epicure when the doors of the banqueting hall are thrown wide open and he sees beyond them the brilliant lamps the glittering table and its delicious viands with its attendant ministers well girt and crowned with roses as blithe as is the bride when the bridegroom is announced coming with rich gifts to conduct her to her new home will my exulting heart be when death under whatever form throws back the gates iron on this side but golden on the other which lead to a new and perennial life and i care not how grim the messenger may be that proclaims the approach of him who is celestially beautiful and who is he asked fabiola eagerly can he not be seen save through the fleshless ribs of death no replied sebastian for it is he who must reward us not only for our lives but for our deaths also happy they whose inmost hearts which he has ever read have been kept pure and innocent as well as their deeds have been virtuous for them is this bright vision of him whose true rewards only then begin how very like syras doctrines she thought but before she could speak again to ask whence they came a slave entered stood on the threshold and respectfully said a courier madam is just arrived from bai pardon me sebastian she exclaimed let him enter immediately the messenger came in covered with dust and jaded having left his tired horse at the gate and offered her a sealed packet her hand trembled as she took it and while she was unloosening its bands she hesitatingly asked from my father about him at least was the ominous reply she opened the sheet glanced over it shrieked and fell sebastian caught her before she reached the ground laid her on a couch and delicately left her in the hands of her handmaids who had rushed in at the cry illustration monogram of christ found in the catacombs one glance had told her all her father was dead chapter viii darker still when sebastian came into the court he found a little crowd of domestics gathered round the courier listening to the details of their masters death the letter of which torquatus was the bearer to him had produced its desired effect he called at his villa and spent a few days with his daughter on his way to asia he was more than usually affectionate and when they parted both father and daughter seemed to have a melancholy foreboding that they would meet no more he soon however recovered his spirits at bai where a party of good livers anxiously awaited him and where he considered himself obliged to stay while his galley was being fitted up and stored with the best wines and provisions which campania afforded for his voyage he indulged however his luxurious tastes to excess and on coming out of a bath after a hearty supper he was seized with a chill and in four and twenty hours was a corpse he had left his undivided wealth to his only child in fine the body was being embalmed when the courier started and was to be brought by his galley to ostia on hearing this sad tale sebastian was almost sorry that he had spoken as he had done of death and left the house with mournful thoughts fabiolas first plunge into the dark abyss of grief was deep and dismal down into unconsciousness then the buoyancy of youth and mind bore her up again to the surface and her view of life to the horizon was as of a boundless ocean of black seething waves on which floated no living thing save herself her woe seemed utter and unmeasured and she closed her eyes with a shudder and suffered herself to sink again into obliviousness till once more roused to wakefulness of mind again and again she was thus tossed up and down between transient death and life while her attendants applied remedies to what they deemed a succession of alarming fits and convulsions at length she sat up pale staring and tearless gently pushing aside the hand that tried to administer restoratives to her in this state she remained long a stupor fixed and deadly seemed to have entranced her the pupils were almost insensible to the light and fears were whispered of her brain becoming oppressed the physician who had been called uttered distinctly and forcibly into her ears the question fabiola do you know that your father is dead she started fell back and a bursting flood of tears relieved her heart and head she spoke of her father and called for him amidst her sobs and said wild and incoherent but affectionate things about and to him sometimes she seemed to think him still alive then she remembered he was dead and so she wept and moaned till sleep took the turn of tears in nursing her shattered mind and frame euphrosyne and syra alone watched by her the former had from time to time put in the commonplaces of heathen consolation had reminded her too how kind a master how honest a man how loving a father he had been but the christian sat in silence except to speak gentle and soothing words to her mistress and served her with an active delicacy which even then was not unnoticed what could she do more unless it was to pray what hope for else than that a new grace was folded up like a flower in this tribulation that a bright angel was riding in the dark cloud that overshadowed her humbled lady as grief receded it left some room for thought this came to fabiola in a gloomy and searching form what was become of her father whither was he gone had he melted into unexistence or had he been crushed into annihilation had his life been searched through by that unseen eye which sees the invisible had he stood the proof of that scrutiny which sebastian and syra had described impossible then what had become of him she shuddered as she thought and put away the reflection from her mind oh for a ray from some unknown light that would dart into the grave and show her what it was poetry had pretended to enlighten it and even glorify it but had only in truth remained at the door as a genius with drooping head and torch reversed science had stepped in and come out scared with tarnished wings and lamp extinguished in the fetid air for it had only discovered a charnel house and philosophy had barely ventured to wander round and round and peep in with dread and recoil and then prate or babble and shrugging its shoulders own that the problem was yet unsolved the mystery still veiled oh for something or some one better than all these to remove the dismal perplexity while these thoughts dwell like gloomy night on the heart of fabiola her slave is enjoying the vision of light clothed in mortal form translucid and radiant rising from the grave as from an alembic in which have remained the grosser qualities of matter without impairing the essence of its nature spiritualized and free lovely and glorious it springs from the very hot bed of corruption and another and another from land and sea from reeking cemetery and from beneath consecrated altar from the tangled thicket where solitary murder has been committed on the just and from fields of ancient battle done by israel for god like crystal fountains springing into the air like brilliant signal lights darted from earth to heaven till a host of millions side by side repeoples creation with joyous and undying life and how knows she this because one greater and better than poet sage or sophist had made the trial had descended first into the dark couch of death had blessed it as he had done the cradle and made infancy sacred rendering also death a holy thing and its place a sanctuary he went into it in the darkest of evening and he came forth from it in the brightest of morning he was laid there wrapped in spices and he rose again robed in his own fragrant incorruption and from that day the grave had ceased to be an object of dread to the christian soul for it continued what he had made it the furrow into which the seed of immortality must needs be cast the time was not come for speaking of these things to fabiola she mourned still as they must mourn who have no hope day succeeded day in gloomy meditation on the mystery of death till other cares mercifully roused her the corpse arrived and such a funeral followed as rome then seldom witnessed processions by torch light in which the waxen effigies of ancestors were borne and a huge funeral pile built up of aromatic wood and scented by the richest spices of arabia ended in her gathering up a few handfuls of charred bones which were deposited in an alabaster urn and placed in a niche of the family sepulchre with the name inscribed of their former owner calpurnius spoke the funeral oration in which according to the fashionable ideas of the day he contrasted the virtues of the hospitable and industrious citizen with the false morality of those men called christians who fasted and prayed all day and were stealthily insinuating their dangerous principles into every noble family and spreading disloyalty and immorality in every class fabius he could have no doubt if there was any future existence whereon philosophers differed was now basking on a green bank in elysium and quaffing nectar and oh concluded the old whining hypocrite who would have been sorry to exchange one goblet of falernian for an amphora of that beverage oh that the gods would hasten the day when i his humble client may join him in his shady repose and sober banquets this noble sentiment gained immense applause to this care succeeded another fabiola had to apply her vigorous mind to examine and close her fathers complicated affairs how often was she pained at the discovery of what to her seemed injustice fraud over reaching and oppression in the transactions of one whom the world had applauded as the most honest and liberal of public contractors illustration the peacock as an emblem of the resurrection found in the catacombs in a few weeks more in the dark attire of a mourner fabiola went forth to visit her friends the first of these was her cousin agnes chapter ix the false brother we must take our reader back a few steps in the history of torquatus on the morning after his fall he found on awaking fulvius at his bed side it was the falconer who having got hold of a good hawk was come to tame him and train him to strike down the dove for him in return for a well fed slavery with all the coolness of a practised hand he brought back to his memory every circumstance of the preceding nights debauch his utter ruin and only means of escape with unfeeling precision he strengthened every thread of the last evenings web and added many more meshes to it the position of torquatus was this if he made one step towards christianity which fulvius assured him would be fruitless he would be at once delivered to the judge and cruelly punished with death if he remained faithful to his compact of treason he should want for nothing you are hot and feverish at last concluded fulvius an early walk and fresh air will do you good the poor wretch consented and they had hardly reached the forum when corvinus as if by accident met them after mutual salutations he said i am glad to have fallen in with you i should like to take you and show you my fathers workshop workshop asked torquatus with surprise yes where he keeps his tools it has just been beautifully fitted up here it is and that grim old foreman catulus is opening the doors they entered into a spacious court with a shed round it filled with engines of torture of every form torquatus shrunk back come in masters dont be afraid said the old executioner there is no fire put on yet and nobody will hurt you unless you happen to be a wicked christian its for them we have been polishing up of late now catulus said corvinus tell this gentleman who is a stranger the use of these pretty toys you have here catulus with good heart showed them round his museum of horrors explaining every thing with such hearty good will and no end of jokes not quite fit for record that in his enthusiasm he nearly gave torquatus practical illustrations of what he described having once almost caught his ear in a pair of sharp pincers and another time brought down a mallet within an inch of his teeth the rack a large gridiron an iron chair with a furnace in it for heating it large boilers for hot oil or scalding water baths ladles for melting lead and pouring it neatly into the mouth pincers hooks and iron combs of varied shapes for laying bare the ribs scorpions or scourges armed with iron or leaden knobs iron collars manacles and fetters of the most tormenting make in fine swords knives and axes in tasteful varieties were all commented upon with true relish and an anticipation of much enjoyment illustration plumbat whips made of brass chains to which are attached leaden balls illustration volsell tweezers or tongs illustration uncus or hook illustration pectines ferrei iron comb illustration uncus or hook illustration instruments of torture used against the christians from rollers catacombes de rome in seeing them used on those hard headed and thick skinned christians torquatus was thoroughly broken down he was taken to the baths of antoninus where he caught the attention of old cucumio the head of the wardrobe department or capsarius and his wife victoria who had seen him at church after a good refection he was led to a gambling hall in the therm and lost of course fulvius lent him money but for every farthing exacted a bond by these means he was in a few days completely subdued their meetings were early and late during the day he was left free lest he should lose his value through being suspected by christians corvinus had determined to make a tremendous dash at them so soon as the edict should have come out he therefore exacted from torquatus as his share of the compact that the spy should study the principal cemetery where the pontiff intended to officiate this torquatus soon ascertained and his visit to the cemetery of callistus was in fulfilment of his engagement when that struggle between grace and sin took place in his soul which severus noticed it was the image of catulus and his hundred plagues with that of fulvius and his hundred bonds that turned the scale in favor of perdition corvinus after receiving his report and making from it a rough chart of the cemetery determined to assail it early the very day after the publication of the decree fulvius took another course he determined to become acquainted by sight with the principal clergy and leading christians of rome once possessed of this knowledge he was sure no disguise would conceal them from his piercing eyes and he would easily pick them up one by one he therefore insisted upon torquatuss taking him as his companion to the first great function that should collect many priests and deacons round the pope he overruled illustration christ and his apostles from a picture in the catacombs every remonstrance dispelled every fear and assured torquatus that once in by his password he should behave perfectly like any christian torquatus soon informed him that there would be an excellent opportunity at the coming ordination in that very month of december chapter x the ordination in december whoever has read the history of the early popes will have become familiar with the fact recorded almost invariably of each that he held certain ordinations in the month of december wherein he created so many priests and deacons and so many bishops for different places the first two orders were conferred to supply clergy for the city the third was evidently to furnish pastors for other dioceses in later times the ember days in december regulated by the festival of st lucy were those on which the supreme pontiff held his consistories in which he named his cardinal priests and deacons and preconized as it is called the bishops of all parts of the world and though this function is not now coincident with the periods of ordination still it is continued essentially for the same purpose marcellinus under whose pontificate our narrative is placed is stated to have held two ordinations in this month that is of course in different years it was to one of these that we have alluded as about to take place where was this solemn function to be performed was fulviuss first inquiry and we cannot but think that the answer will be interesting to the christian antiquary nor can our acquaintance with the ancient roman church be complete without our knowing the favored spot where pontiff after pontiff preached and celebrated the divine mysteries and held his councils or those glorious ordinations which sent forth not only bishops but martyrs to govern other churches and gave to a st laurence his diaconate or to st novatus or st timotheus his priesthood there too a polycarp or irenus visited the successor of st peter and thence received their commission the apostles who converted our king lucius to the faith the house which the roman pontiffs inhabited and the church in which they officiated till constantine installed them in the lateran palace and basilica the residence and cathedral of the illustrious line of martyr popes for years can be no ignoble spot and that in tracing it out we may not be misguided by national or personal prepossession we will follow a learned living antiquarian who intent upon another research accidentally has put together all the data requisite for our purpose we have described the house of agness parents as situated in the vicus patricius or the patrician street this had another name for it was also called the street of the cornelii vicus corneliorum because in it lived the illustrious family of that name the centurion whom st peter converted belonged to this family and possibly to him the apostle owed his introduction at rome to the head of his house cornelius pudens this senator married claudia a noble british lady and it is singular how the unchaste poet martial vies with the purest writers when he sings the wedding song of these two virtuous spouses it was in their house that st peter lived and his fellow apostle st paul enumerates them among his familiar friends as well eubulus and pudens and linus and claudia illustration st pudentiana st priscilla and st praxedes and all the brethren salute thee from that house then went forth the bishops whom the prince of the apostles sent in every direction to propagate and die for the faith of christ after the death of pudens the house became the property of his children or grandchildren two sons and two daughters the latter are better known because they have found a place in the general calendar of the church and because they have given their names to two of the most illustrious churches of rome those of st praxedes and st pudentiana it is the latter which alban butler calls the most ancient church in the world that marks at once the vicus patricius and the house of pudens as in every other city so in rome the eucharistic sacrifice was offered originally in only one place by the bishop and even after more churches were erected and the faithful met in them communion was brought to them from the one altar by the deacons and distributed by the priests it was pope evaristus the fourth successor of st peter who multiplied the churches of rome with circumstances peculiarly interesting this pope then did two things first he enacted that from thenceforward no altars should be erected except of stone and that they should be consecrated and secondly he distributed the titles that is he divided rome into parishes to the churches of which he gave the name of title the connection of these two acts will be apparent to any one looking at genesis xxviii where after jacob had enjoyed an angelic vision while sleeping with a stone for his pillow we are told that trembling he said how terrible is this place this is no other than the house of god and the gate of heaven and jacob arising in the morning took the stone and set it up for a title pouring oil on the top of it the church or oratory where the sacred mysteries were celebrated was truly to the christian the house of god and the stone altar set up in it was consecrated by the pouring of oil upon it as is done to this day for the whole law of evaristus remains in full force and thus became a title or monument two interesting facts are elicited from this narrative one is that to that time there was only one church with an altar in rome and no doubt has ever been raised that this was the church afterwards and yet known by the name of st pudentiana another is that the one altar till then existing was not of stone it was in fact the wooden altar used by st peter and kept in that church till transferred by st sylvester to the lateran basilica of which it forms the high altar we further conclude that the law was not retrospective and that the wooden altar of the popes was preserved at that church where it had been first erected though from time to time it might be carried and used elsewhere the church in the vicus patricius therefore which existed previous to the creation of titles was not itself a title it continued to be the episcopal or rather the pontifical church of rome the pontificate of st pius i from to forms an interesting period in its history for two reasons first that pope without altering the character of the church itself added to it an oratory which he made a title and having collated to it his brother pastor it was called the titulus pastoris the designation for a long time of the cardinalate attached to the church this shows that the church itself was more than a title secondly in this pontificate came to rome for the second time and suffered martyrdom the holy and learned apologist st justin by comparing his writings with his acts we come to some interesting conclusions respecting christian worship in times of persecution in what place do the christians meet he is asked by the judge do you think he replies that we all meet in one place it is not so but when interrogated where he lived and where he held meetings with his disciples he answered i have lived till now near the house of a certain martin at the bath known as the timotine i have come to rome for the second time nor do i know any other place but the one i have mentioned the timotine or timothean baths were part of the house of the pudens family and are those at which we have said that fulvius and corvinus met early one morning novatus and timotheus were the brothers of the holy virgins praxedes and pudentiana and hence the baths were called the novatian and the timotine as they passed from one brother to another st justin therefore lived on this spot and as he knew no other in rome attended divine worship there the very claims of hospitality would suggest it now in his apology describing the christian liturgy of course such as he saw it he speaks of the officiating priest in terms that sufficiently describe the bishop or supreme pastor of the place not only by giving him a title applied to bishops in antiquity but by describing him as the person who has the care of orphans and widows and succors the sick the indigent prisoners strangers who come as guests who in one word undertakes to provide for all in want this could be no other than the bishop or pope himself we must further observe that st pius is recorded to have erected a fixed baptismal font in this church another prerogative of the cathedral transferred with the papal altar to the lateran it is related that the holy pope stephen ad baptized the tribune nemesius and his family with many others in the title of pastor and here it was that the blessed deacon laurentius distributed the rich vessels of the church to the poor in time this name has given way to another but the place is the same and no doubt can exist that the church of st pudentiana was for the first three centuries the humble cathedral of rome it was to this spot therefore that torquatus unwillingly consented to lead fulvius that he might witness the december ordination we find either in sepulchral inscriptions in martyrologies or in ecclesiastical history abundant traces of all the orders as still conferred in the catholic church inscriptions perhaps more commonly record those of lector or reader and of exorcist we will give one interesting example of each of a lector cinnamivs opas lector titvli fasciole amicvs pavpervm qvi vixit ann xlvi mens vii d viii deposit in pace x kal mart of an exorcist macedonivs exorcista de katolica a difference was however that one order was not necessarily a passage or step to another but persons remained often for life in one of these lesser orders there was not therefore that frequent administration of these nor probably was it publicly performed with the higher orders torquatus having the necessary pass word entered accompanied by fulvius who soon showed himself expert in acting as others did around him the assembly was not large it was held in a hall of the house converted into a church or oratory which was mainly occupied by the clergy and the candidates for orders among the latter were marcus and marcellianus the twin brothers fellow converts of torquatus who received the deaconship and their father tranquillinus who was ordained priest of these fulvius impressed well in his mind the features and figure and still more did he take note of the clergy the most eminent of rome there assembled but on one more than the rest he fixed his piercing eye studying his every gesture look voice and lineament this was the pontiff who performed the august rite marcellinus had already governed the church six years and was of a venerable old age his countenance benign and mild scarcely seemed to betoken the possession of that nerve which martyrdom required and which he exhibited in his death for christ in those days every outward characteristic which could have betrayed the chief shepherd to the wolves was carefully avoided the ordinary simple garb of respectable men was worn but there is no doubt that when officiating at the altar a distinctive robe the forerunner of the ample chasuble of spotless white was cast over the ordinary garment to this the bishop added a crown or infula the origin of the later mitre while in his hand he held the crosier emblem of his pastoral office and authority on him who now stood facing the assembly before the sacred altar of peter which was between him and the illustration our saviour represented as the good shepherd with a milk can at his side as found in the catacombs people the eastern spy steadied his keenest glance he scanned him minutely measured with his eye his height defined the color of his hair and complexion observed every turn of his head his walk his action his tones almost his breathing till he said to himself if he stirs abroad disguised as he may choose that man is my prize and i know his worth chapter xi the virgins prie ivn pavsa bet praetiosa annorvm pvlla virgo xii tantvm ancilla dei et xpi fl vincentio et fravito vc conss if the learned thomassinus had known this lately discovered inscription when he proved with such abundance of learning that virginity could be professed in the early church at the age of twelve he would certainly have quoted it for can we doubt that the girl who was a virgin of only twelve years old a handmaid of god and christ was such by consecration to god otherwise the more tender her age the less wonderful her state of maidenhood but although this the nubile age according to roman law was the one at which such dedication to god was permitted by the church she reserved to a maturer period that more solemn consecration when the veil of virginity was given by the bishop generally on easter sunday that first act probably consisted of nothing more than receiving from the hands of parents a plain dark dress but when any danger threatened the church permitted the anticipation by many years of that period and fortified the spouses of christ in their holy purpose by her more solemn blessing a persecution of the most savage character was on the point of breaking out which would not spare the most tender of the flock and it was no wonder that they who in their hearts had betrothed themselves to the lamb as his chaste spouses forever should desire to come to his nuptials before death they longed naturally to bear the full grown lily entwined round the palm should this be their portion agnes had from her infancy chosen for herself this holiest state the superhuman wisdom which had ever exhibited itself in her words and actions blending so gracefully with the simplicity of an innocent and guileless childhood rendered her ripe beyond her years for any measure of indulgence which could be granted to hearts that panted for their chaste bridal hour she eagerly seized on the claim that coming danger gave her to a more than usual relaxation of that law which prescribed a delay of more than ten years in the fulfilling of her desire another postulant joined her in this petition we may easily imagine that a holy friendship had been growing between her and syra from the first interview which we have described between them this feeling had been increased by all that agnes had heard fabiola say in praise of her favorite servant from this and from the slaves more modest reports she was satisfied that the work to which she had devoted herself of her mistresss conversion must be entirely left in her hands it was evidently prospering owing to the prudence and grace with which it was conducted in her frequent visits to fabiola she contented herself with admiring and approving what her cousin related of syras conversations but she carefully avoided every expression that could raise suspicion of any collusion between them syra as a dependant and agnes as a relation had put on mourning upon fabiuss death and hence no change of habit would raise suspicion in his daughters mind of their having taken some secret or some joint step thus far they could safely ask to be admitted at once to receive the solemn consecration to perpetual virginity their petition was granted but for obvious reasons was kept carefully concealed it was only a day or two before the happy one of their spiritual nuptials that syra told it as a great secret to her blind friend and so said the latter pretending to be displeased you want to keep all the good things to yourself do you call that charitable now my dear child said syra soothingly dont be offended it was necessary to keep it quite a secret and therefore i suppose poor i must not even be present oh yes ccilia to be sure you may and see all that you can replied syra laughing never mind about the seeing but tell me how will you be dressed what have you to get ready syra gave her an exact description of the habit and veil their color and form how very interesting she said and what have you to do the other amused at her unwonted curiosity described minutely the short ceremonial well now one question more resumed the blind girl when and where is all this to be you said i might come so i must know the time and place syra told her it would be at the title of pastor at daybreak on the third day from that but what has made you so inquisitive dearest i never saw you so before i am afraid you are becoming quite worldly never you mind replied ccilia if people choose to have secrets from me i do not see why i should not have some of my own syra laughed at her affected pettishness for she knew well the humble simplicity of the poor childs heart they embraced affectionately and parted ccilia went straight to the kind lucina for she was a favorite in every house no sooner was she admitted to that pious matrons presence than she flew to her threw herself upon her bosom and burst into tears lucina soothed and caressed her and soon composed her in a few minutes she was again bright and joyous and evidently deep in conspiracy with the cheerful lady about something which delighted her when she left she was all buoyant and blithe and went to the house of agnes in the hospital of which the good priest dyonisius lived she found him at home and casting herself on her knees before him talked so fervently to him that he was moved to tears and spoke kindly and consolingly to her the te deum had not yet been written but something very like it rang in the blind girls heart as she went to her humble home the happy morning at length arrived and before daybreak the more solemn mysteries had been celebrated and the body of the faithful had dispersed only those remained who had to take part in the more private function or who were specially asked to witness it these were lucina and her son the aged parents of agnes and of course sebastian but syra looked in vain for her blind friend she had evidently retired with the crowd and the gentle slave feared she might have hurt her feelings by her reserve before their last interview the hall was still shrouded in the dusk of a winters twilight although the glowing east without foretold a bright december day on the altar burned perfumed tapers of large dimensions and round it were gold and silver lamps of great value throwing an atmosphere of mild radiance upon the sanctuary in front of the altar was placed the chair no less venerable than itself now enshrined in the vatican the chair of peter on this was seated the venerable pontiff with staff in hand and crown on head and round him stood his ministers scarcely less worshipful than himself illustration chair of st peter from the gloom of the chapel there came forth first the sound of sweet voices like those of angels chanting in soft cadence a hymn which anticipated the sentiments soon after embodied in the jesu corona virginum then there emerged into the light of the sanctuary the procession of already consecrated virgins led by the priests and deacons who had charge of them and in the midst of them appeared two whose dazzling white garments shone the brighter amidst their dark habits these were the two new postulants who as the rest defiled and formed a line on either side were conducted each by two professed to the foot of the altar where they knelt at the pontiffs feet their bridesmaids or sponsors stood near to assist in the function each as she came was asked solemnly what she desired and expressed her wish to receive the veil and practise its duties under the care of those chosen guides for although consecrated virgins had begun to live in community before this period yet many continued to reside at home and persecution interfered with enclosure still there was a place in church boarded off for the consecrated virgins and they often met apart for particular instruction and devotions the bishop then addressed the young aspirants in glowing and affectionate words he told them how high a call it was to lead on earth the lives of angels who neither marry nor give in marriage to tread the same chaste path to heaven which the incarnate word chose for his own mother and arrived there to be received into the pure ranks of that picked host that follows the lamb whithersoever he goeth he expatiated on the doctrine of st paul writing to the corinthians on the superiority of virginity to every other state and he feelingly described the happiness of having no love on earth but one which instead of fading opens out into immortality in heaven for bliss he observed is but the expanded flower which divine love bears on earth after this brief discourse and an examination of the candidates for this great honor the holy pontiff proceeded to bless the different portions of their religious habits by prayers probably nearly identical with those now in use and these were put on them by their respective attendants the new religious laid their heads upon the altar in token of their oblation of self but in the west the hair was not cut as it was in the east but was always left long a wreath of flowers was then placed upon the head of each and though it was winter the well guarded terrace of fabiola had been made to furnish bright and fragrant blossoms all seemed ended and agnes kneeling at the foot of the altar was motionless in one of her radiant raptures gazing fixedly upwards while syra near her was bowed down sunk into the depths of her gentle humility wondering how she should have been found worthy of so much favor so absorbed were both in their thanksgiving that they perceived not a slight commotion through the assembly as if something unexpected was occurring they were aroused by the bishop repeating the question my daughter what dost thou seek when before they could look round each felt a hand seized and heard the answer returned in a voice dear to both holy father to receive the veil of consecration to jesus christ my only love on earth under the care of these two holy virgins already his happy spouses they were overwhelmed with joy and tenderness for it was the poor blind ccilia when she heard of the happiness that awaited syra she had flown as we have seen to the kind lucina who soon consoled her by suggesting to her the possibility of obtaining a similar grace she promised to furnish all that was necessary only ccilia insisted that her dress should be coarse as became a poor beggar girl the priest dionysius presented to the pontiff and obtained the grant of her prayer and as she wished to have her two friends for sponsors it was arranged that he should lead her up to the altar after their consecration ccilia however kept her secret the blessings were spoken and the habit and veil put on when they asked her if she had brought no wreath or flowers timidly she drew from under her garment the crown she had provided a bare thorny branch twisted into a circle and presented it saying i have no flowers to offer to my bridegroom neither did he wear flowers for me i am but a poor girl and do you think my lord will be offended if i ask him to crown me as he was pleased to be crowned himself and then flowers represent virtues in those that wear them but my barren heart has produced nothing better than these illustration the anchor and fishes an emblem of christianity found in the catacombs she saw not with her blind eyes how her two companions snatched the wreaths from their heads to put on hers but a sign from the pontiff checked them and amidst moistened eyes she was led forth all joyous in her thorny crown emblem of what the church has always taught that the very queenship of virtue is innocence crowned by penance chapter xii the nomentan villa the nomentan road goes from rome eastward and between it and the salarian is a deep ravine beyond which on the side of the nomentan way lies a gracefully undulating ground amidst this is situated a picturesque round temple and near it a truly beautiful basilica dedicated to st agnes here was the villa belonging to her situated about a mile and a half from the city and thither it had been arranged that the two now the three newly consecrated should repair to spend the day in retirement and tranquil joy few more such days perhaps would ever be granted them we need not describe this rural residence except to say that everything in it breathed contentment and happiness it was one of those genial days which a roman winter supplies the rugged apennines were slightly powdered with snow the ground was barely crisp the atmosphere transparent the sunshine glowing and the heavens cloudless a few greyish curls of melting smoke from the cottages and the leafless vines alone told that it was december everything living seemed to know and love the gentle mistress of the place the doves came and perched upon her shoulder or her hand the lambs in the paddock frisked and ran to her the moment she approached and took the green fragrant herbs which she brought them with evident pleasure but none owned her kindly sway so much as old molossus the enormous watchdog chained beside the gate so fierce was he that none but a few favorite domestics durst go near him but no sooner did agnes appear than he crouched down and wagged his bushy tail and whined till he was let loose for now a child might approach him he never left his mistresss side he followed her like a lamb and if she sat down he would lie at her feet looking into her face delighted to receive on his huge head the caresses of her slender hand it was indeed a peaceful day sometimes calm and quiet soft and tender as the three spoke together of the mornings happiness and of the happier morning of which it was a pledge above the liquid amber of their present skies sometimes cheerful and even merry as the two took ccilia to task for the trick she had played them and she laughed cheerily as she always did and told them she had a better trick in store for them yet which was that she would cut them out when that next morning came for she intended to be the first at it and not the last fabiola had in the meantime come to the villa to pay her first visit to agnes after her calamity and to thank her for her sympathy she walked forward but stopped suddenly on coming near the spot where this happy group were assembled for when she beheld the two who could see the outward brightness of heaven hanging over her who seemed to hold all its splendor within her soul she saw at once in the scene the verification of her dream yet unwilling to intrude herself unexpectedly upon them and anxious to find agnes alone and not with her own slave and a poor blind girl she turned away before she was noticed and walked towards a distant part of the grounds still she could not help asking herself why she could not be cheerful and happy as they why was there a gulf between them but the day was not destined to finish without its clouds it would have been too blissful for earth besides fabiola another person had started from rome to pay a less welcome visit to agnes this was fulvius who had never forgotten the assurances of fabius that his fascinating address and brilliant ornaments had turned the weak head of agnes he had waited till the first days of mourning were over and he respected the house in which he had once received such a rude reception or rather suffered such a summary ejectment having ascertained that for the first time she had gone without her parents or any male attendants to her suburban villa he considered it a good opportunity for pressing his suit he rode out of the nomentan gate and was soon at agness he dismounted said he wished to see her on important business and after some importunity was admitted by the porter he was directed along a walk at the end of which she would be found the sun was declining and her companions had strolled to a distance and she was sitting alone in a bright sunny spot with old molossus crouching at her feet the slightest approach to a growl from him rare when he was with her made her look up from her work of tying together such winter flowers as the others brought her while she suppressed by raising a finger this expression of instinctive dislike fulvius came near with a respectful but freer air than usual as one already assured of his request i have come lady agnes he said to renew to you the expression of my sincere regard and i could not have chosen a better day for brighter or fairer scarcely the summer sun could have bestowed fair indeed and bright it has been to me replied agnes borne back in mind to the mornings scene and no sun in my life has ever given me fairer it can only give me one more fair fulvius was flattered as if the compliment was to his presence and answered the day no doubt you mean of your espousals with one who may have won your heart that is indeed done she replied as if unconsciously and this is his own precious day and was that wreathed veil upon your head placed there in anticipation of this happy hour yes it is the sign my beloved has placed upon my countenance that i recognize no lover but himself and who is this happy being i was not without hopes nor will i renounce them yet that i have a place in your thoughts perhaps in your affections agnes seemed scarcely to heed his words there was no appearance of shyness or timidity in her looks or manner no embarrassment even spotless without and innocent within she feared no danger for she knew no sin her childlike countenance remained bright open and guileless her eyes mildly beaming looked straight upon fulviuss face with an earnest simplicity that made him almost quail before her she stood up now with graceful dignity as she replied milk and honey exhaled from his lips as the blood from his stricken cheek impressed itself on mine she is crazed fulvius was just beginning to think when the inspired look of her countenance and the clear brightness of her eye as she gazed forwards towards some object seen by herself alone overawed and subdued him she recovered in an instant and again he took heart he resolved at once to pursue his demand madam he said you are trifling with one who sincerely admires and loves you i know from the best authority yes the best authority that of a mutual friend departed that you have been pleased to think favorably of me and to express yourself not opposed to my urging my claims to your hand i now therefore seriously and earnestly solicit it i may seem abrupt and informal but i am sincere and warm begone from me food of corruption she said with calm majesty for already a lover has secured my heart for whom alone i keep my troth to whom i intrust myself with undivided devotion one whose love is chaste whose caress is pure whose brides never put off their virginal wreaths fulvius who had dropped on his knee as he concluded his last sentence and had thus drawn forth that severe rebuke rose filled with spite and fury at having been so completely deluded is it not enough to be rejected he said after having been encouraged but must insult be heaped on me too and must i be told to my face that another has been before me to day sebastian i suppose again who are you exclaimed an indignant voice behind him that dare to utter with disdain the name of one whose honor is untarnished and whose virtue is as unchallenged as his courage he turned round and stood confronted with fabiola who having walked for some time about the garden thought she would now probably find her cousin disengaged and by herself she had come upon him suddenly and had caught his last words fulvius was abashed and remained silent fabiola with a noble indignation continued and who too are you who not content with having once thrust yourself into my kinswomans house to insult her presume now to intrude upon the privacy of her rural retreat illustration haughty roman dame thou shalt bitterly rue this day and hour and who are you retorted fulvius who take upon yourself to be imperious mistress in anothers house one replied the lady who by allowing my cousin to meet you first at her table and there discovering your designs upon an innocent child feels herself bound in honor and duty to thwart them and to shield her from them she took agnes by the hand and was leading her away and molossus required what he never remembered to have received before but what he took delightedly a gentle little tap to keep him from more than growling when fulvius gnashing his teeth muttered audibly haughty roman dame thou shalt bitterly rue this day and hour thou shalt know and feel how asia can revenge illustration a lamb between wolves emblematic of the church from a picture in the cemetery of st prtextatus chapter xiii the edict the day being at length arrived for its publication in rome corvinus fully felt the importance of the commission intrusted to him of affixing in its proper place in the forum the edict of extermination against the christians or rather the sentence of extirpation of their very name news had been received from nicodemia that a brave christian soldier named george had torn down a similar imperial degree and had manfully suffered death for his boldness corvinus was determined that nothing of the sort should happen in rome for he feared too seriously the consequences of such an occurrence to himself he therefore took every precaution in his power the edict had been written in large characters upon sheets of parchment joined together and these were nailed to a board firmly supported by a pillar against which it was hung not far from the puteal libonis the magistrates chair in the forum this however was not done till the forum was deserted and night had well set in it was thus intended that the edict should meet the eyes of the citizens early in the morning and strike their minds with more tremendous effect to prevent the possibility of any nocturnal attempt to destroy the precious document corvinus with much the same cunning precaution as was taken by the jewish priests to prevent the resurrection obtained for a night guard to the forum a company of the pannonian cohort a body composed of soldiers belonging to the fiercest races of the north dacians pannonians sarmatians and germans whose uncouth features savage aspect matted sandy hair and bushy red moustaches made them appear absolutely ferocious to roman eyes these men could scarcely speak latin but were ruled by officers of their own countries and formed in the decline of the empire the most faithful body guard of the reigning tyrants often their fellow countrymen for there was no excess too monstrous for them to commit if duly commanded to execute it a number of these savages ever rough and ready were distributed so as to guard every avenue of the forum with strict orders to pierce through or hew down any one who should attempt to pass without the watchword or symbolum this was every night distributed by the general in command through his tribunes and centurions to all the troops but to prevent all possibility of any christian making use of it that night if he should chance to discover it the cunning corvinus had one chosen which he felt sure no christian would use it was numen imperatorum the divinity of the emperors the last thing which he did was to make his rounds giving to each sentinel the strictest injunctions and most minutely to the one whom he had placed close to the edict this man had been chosen for his post on account of his rude strength and huge bulk and the peculiar ferocity of his looks and character corvinus gave him the most rigid instructions how he was to spare nobody but to prevent any ones interference with the sacred edict he repeated to him again and again the watchword and left him already half stupid with sabaia or beer in the merest animal consciousness that it was his business not an unpleasant one to spear or sabre some one or other before morning the night was raw and gusty with occasional sharp and slanting showers and the dacian wrapped himself in his cloak and walked up and down occasionally taking a long pull at a flask concealed about him containing a liquor said to be distilled from the wild cherries of the thuringian forests and in the intervals muddily meditating not on the wood or river by which his young barbarians were at play but how soon it would be time to cut the present emperors throat and sack the city while all this was going on old diogenes and his hearty sons were in their poor house in the suburra not far off making preparations for their frugal meal they were interrupted by a gentle tap at the door followed by the lifting of the latch and the entrance of two young men whom diogenes at once recognized and welcomed come in my noble young masters how good of you thus to honor my poor dwelling i hardly dare offer you our plain fare but if you will partake of it you will indeed give us a christian love feast thank you most kindly father diogenes answered the elder of the two quadratus sebastians sinewy centurion pancratius and i have come expressly to sup with you but not as yet we have some business in this part of the town and after it we shall be glad to eat something in the meantime one of your youths can go out and cater for us come we must have something good and i want you to cheer yourself with a moderate cup of generous wine saying this he gave his purse to one of the sons with instructions to bring home some better provisions than he knew the simple family usually enjoyed they sat down and pancratius by way of saying something addressed the old man good diogenes i have heard sebastian say that you remember seeing the glorious deacon laurentius die for christ tell me something about him with pleasure answered the old man it is now nearly forty five years since it happened and as i was older then than you are now you may suppose i remember all quite distinctly he was indeed a beautiful youth to look at so mild and sweet so fair and graceful and his speech was so gentle so soft especially when speaking to the poor how they all loved him i followed him everywhere i stood by as the venerable pontiff sixtus was going to death and laurentius met him and so tenderly reproached him just as a son might a father for not allowing him to be his companion in the sacrifice of himself as he had ministered to him in the sacrifice of our lords body and blood those were splendid times diogenes were they not interrupted the youth how degenerate we are now what a different race are we not quadratus the rough soldier smiled at the generous sincerity of his complaint and bid diogenes go on i saw him too as he distributed the rich plate of the church to the poor we have never had any thing so splendid since there were golden lamps and candlesticks censors chalices and patens besides an immense quantity of silver melted down and distributed to the blind the lame and the indigent but tell me asked pancratius how did he endure his last dreadful torment it must have been frightful i saw it all answered the old fossor and it would have been intolerably frightful in another he had been first placed on the rack and variously tormented and he had not uttered a groan when the judge ordered that horrid bed or gridiron to be prepared and heated to look at his tender flesh blistering and breaking over the fire and deeply scored with red burning gashes that cut to the bone where the iron bars went across to see the steam thick as from a cauldron rise from his body and hear the fire hiss beneath him as he melted away into it and every now and then to observe the tremulous quivering that crept over the surface of his skin the living motion which the agony gave to each separate muscle and the sharp spasmodic twitches which convulsed and gradually contracted his limbs all this i own was the most harrowing spectacle i have ever beheld in all my life but to look into his countenance was to forget all this his head was raised up from the burning body and stretched out as if fixed on the contemplation of some most celestial vision like that of his fellow deacon stephen his face glowed indeed with the heat below and the perspiration flowed down it but the light from the fire shining upwards and passing through his golden locks created a glory round his beautiful head and countenance which made him look as if already in heaven and every feature serene and sweet as ever was so impressed with an eager longing look accompanying the upward glancing of his eye that you would willingly have changed places with him that i would again broke in pancratius and as soon as god pleases i dare not think that i could stand what he did for he was indeed a noble and heroic levite while i am only a weak imperfect boy but do you not think dear quadratus that strength is given in that hour proportionate to our trials whatever they may be you i know would stand any thing for you are a fine stout soldier accustomed to toil and wounds but as for me i have only a willing heart to give is that enough think you quite quite my dear boy exclaimed the centurion full of emotion and looking tenderly on the youth who with glistening eyes having risen from his seat had placed his hands upon the officers shoulders god will give you strength as he has already given you courage but we must not forget our nights work wrap yourself well up in your cloak and bring your toga quite over your head so it is a wet and bitter night now good diogenes put more wood on the fire and let us find supper ready on our return we shall not be long absent and just leave the door ajar go go my sons said the old man and god speed you whatever you are about i am sure it is something praiseworthy quadratus sturdily drew his chlamys or military cloak around him and the two youths plunged into the dark lanes of the suburra and took the direction of the forum while they were absent the door was opened with the well known salutation of thanks to god and sebastian entered and inquired anxiously if diogenes had seen any thing of the two young men for he had got a hint of what they were going to do he was told they were expected in a few moments a quarter of an hour had scarcely elapsed when hasty steps were heard approaching the door was pushed open and was as quickly shut and then fast barred behind quadratus and pancratius here it is said the latter producing with a hearty laugh a bundle of crumpled parchment what asked all eagerly why the grand decree of course answered pancratius with boyish glee look here domini nostri diocletianus et maximianus invicti seniores augusti patres imperatorum et csarum and so forth here it goes and he thrust it into the blazing fire while the stalwart sons of diogenes threw illustration here it goes and he thrust it into the blazing fire a faggot over it to keep it down and drown its crackling there it frizzled and writhed and cracked and shrunk first one letter or word coming up then another first an emperors praise and then an anti christian blasphemy till all had subsided into a black ashy mass and what else or more would those be in a few years who had issued that proud document when their corpses should have been burnt on a pile of cedar wood and spices and their handful of ashes be scraped together hardly enough to fill a gilded urn and what also in very few years more would that heathenism be which it was issued to keep alive but a dead letter at most and as worthless a heap of extinguished embers as lay on that hearth and the very empire which these unconquered augusti were bolstering up by cruelty and injustice how in a few centuries would it resemble that annihilated decree the monuments of its grandeur lying in ashes or in ruins and proclaiming that there is no true lord but one stronger than csars the lord of lords and that neither counsel nor strength of man shall prevail against him something like this did sebastian think perhaps as he gazed abstractedly on the expiring embers of the pompous and cruel edict which they had torn down not for a wanton frolic but because it contained blasphemies against god and his holiest truths they knew that if they should be discovered tenfold tortures would be their lot but christians in those days when they contemplated and prepared for martyrdom made no calculation on that head death for christ whether quick and easy or lingering and painful was the end for which they looked and like brave soldiers going to battle they did not speculate where a shaft or a sword might strike them whether a death blow would at once stun them out of existence or they should have to writhe for hours upon the ground mutilated or pierced to die by inches among the heaps of unheeded slain sebastian soon recovered and had hardly the heart to reprove the perpetrators of this deed in truth it had its ridiculous side and he was inclined to laugh at the morrows dismay this view he gladly took for he saw pancratius watched his looks with some trepidation and his centurion looked a little disconcerted so after a hearty laugh they sat down cheerfully to their meal for it was not midnight and the hour for commencing the fast preparatory to receiving the holy eucharist was not arrived quadratuss object besides kindness in this arrangement was partly that if surprised a reason for their being there might be apparent partly to keep up the spirits of his younger companion and of diogeness household if alarmed at the bold deed just performed but there was no appearance of any such feeling the conversation soon turned upon recollections of diogeness youth and the good old fervent times as pancratius would persist in calling them sebastian saw his friend home and then took a round to avoid the forum in seeking his own abode if any one had seen pancratius that night when alone in his chamber preparing to retire to rest he would have seen him every now and then almost laughing at some strange but pleasant adventure illustration a monogram of christ found in the catacombs chapter xiv the discovery at the first dawn of morning corvinus was up and notwithstanding the gloominess of the day proceeded straight to the forum he found his outposts quite undisturbed and hastened to the principal object of his care it would be useless to attempt describing his astonishment his rage his fury when he saw the blank board with only a few shreds of parchment left round the nails and beside it standing in unconscious stolidity his dacian sentinel he would have darted at his throat like a tiger if he had not seen in the barbarians twinkling eye a sort of hyena squint which told him he had better not but he broke out at once into a passionate exclamation sirrah how has the edict disappeared tell me directly softly softly herr kornweiner answered the imperturbable northern there it is as you left it in my charge where you fool come and look at it the dacian went to his side and for the first time confronted the board and after looking at it for some moments exclaimed well is not that the board you hung up last night yes you blockhead but there was writing on it which is gone that is what you had to guard why look you captain as to writing you see i know nothing having never been a scholar but as it was raining all night it may have been washed out and as it was blowing i suppose the parchment on which it was written was blown off no doubt herr kornweiner you are quite right come sir this is no joking matter tell me at once who came here last night why two of them came two of what two wizards or goblins or worse none of that nonsense for me the dacians eye flashed drunkenly again well tell me arminius what sort of people they were and what they did why one of them was but a stripling a boy tall and thin who went round the pillar and i suppose must have taken away what you miss while i was busy with the other and what of him what was he like the soldier opened his mouth and eyes and stared at corvinus for some moments then said with a sort of stupid solemnity what was he like why if he was not thor himself he wasnt far from it i never felt such strength what did he do to show it he came up first and began to chat quite friendly asked me if it was not very cold and that sort of thing at last i remembered that i had to run through any one that came near me exactly interrupted corvinus and why did you not do it only because he wouldnt let me i told him to be off or i should spear him and drew back and stretched out my javelin when in the quietest manner but i dont know how he twisted it out of my hand broke it over his knee as if it had been a mountebanks wooden sword and dashed the iron headed piece fast into the ground where you see it fifty yards off then why did you not rush on him with your sword and despatch him at once but where is your sword it is not in your scabbard the dacian with a stupid grin pointed to the roof of the neighboring basilica and said there dont you see it shining on the tiles in the morning light corvinus looked and there indeed he saw what appeared like such an object but he could hardly believe his own eyes how did it get there you stupid booby he asked the soldier twisted his moustache in an ominous way which made corvinus ask again more civilly and then he was answered he or it whatever it was without any apparent effort by a sort of conjuring whisked it out of my hand and up where you see it as easily as i could cast a quoit a dozen yards and then and then he and the boy who came from round the pillar walked off in the dark what a strange story muttered corvinus to himself yet there are proofs of the fellows tale it is not every one who could have performed that feat but pray sirrah why did you not give the alarm and rouse the other guards to pursuit first master kornweiner because in my country we will fight any living men but we do not choose to pursue hobgoblins and secondly what was the use i saw the board that you gave into my care all safe and sound stupid barbarian growled corvinus but well within his teeth then added this business will go hard with you you know it is a capital offence what is why to let a man come up and speak to you without giving the watchword gently captain who says he did not give it i never said so but did he though then it could be no christian oh yes he came up and said quite plainly nomen imperatorum what roared out corvinus nomen imperatorum numen imperatorum was the watchword shrieked the enraged roman nomen or numen its all the same i suppose a letter cant make any difference you call me arminius and i call myself hermann and they mean the same how should i know your nice points of language corvinus was enraged at himself for he saw how much better he would have gained his ends by putting a sharp intelligent prtorian on duty instead of a sottish savage foreigner well he said in the worst of humors you will have to answer to the emperor for all this and you know he is not accustomed to pass over offences look you now herr krummbeiner returned the soldier with a look of sly stolidity as to that we are pretty well in the same boat corvinus turned pale for he knew this was true and you must contrive something to save me if you want to save yourself it was you the emperor made responsible for the what dye call it that board you are right my friend i must make it out that a strong body attacked you and killed you at your post so shut yourself up in quarters for a few days and you shall have plenty of beer till the thing blows over the soldier went off and concealed himself a few days after the dead body of a dacian evidently murdered was washed on the banks of the tiber it was supposed he had fallen in some drunken row and no further trouble was taken about it the fact was indeed so but corvinus could have given the best account of the transaction before however leaving the ill omened spot in the forum he had carefully examined the ground for any trace of the daring act when he picked up close under the place of the edict a knife which he was sure he had seen at school in possession of one of his companions he treasured it up as an implement of future vengeance and hastened to provide another copy of the decree illustration an emblem of paradise found in the catacombs chapter xv explanations when morning had fairly broken crowds streamed from every side into the forum curious to read the tremendous edict so long menaced but when they found only a bare board there was a universal uproar some admired the spirit of the christians so generally reckoned cowardly others were indignant at the audacity of such an act some ridiculed the officials concerned in the proclamation others were angry that the expected sport of the day might be delayed at an early hour the places of public fashionable resort were all occupied with the same theme in the great antonian therm a group of regular frequenters were talking it over there were scaurus the lawyer and proculus and fulvius and the philosopher calpurnius who seemed very busy with some musty volumes and several others what a strange affair this is about the edict said one say rather what a treasonable outrage against the divine emperors answered fulvius how was it done asked a third have you not heard said proculus that the dacian guard stationed at the puteal was found dead with twenty seven poniard wounds on him nineteen of which would have sufficed each by itself to cause death no that is quite a false report interrupted scaurus it was not done by violence but entirely by witchcraft two women came up to the soldier who drove his lance at one and it passed clean through her and stuck in the ground on the other side without making any wound in her he then hacked at the other with his sword but he might as well have struck at marble she then threw a pinch of powder upon him and he flew into the air and was found asleep and unhurt this morning on the roof of the milian basilica a friend of mine who was out early saw the ladder up by which he had been brought down wonderful many exclaimed what extraordinary people these christians must be i dont believe a word of it observed proculus there is no such power in magic and certainly i dont see why these wretched men should possess it more than their betters come calpurnius he continued put by that old book and answer these questions i learnt more one day after dinner about these christians from you than i had heard in all my life before what a wonderful memory you must have to remember so accurately the genealogy and history of that barbarous people is what scaurus has just told us possible or not calpurnius delivered himself with great pompousness as follows there is no reason to suppose such a thing impossible for the power of magic has no bounds to prepare a powder that would make a man fly in the air it would be only necessary to find some herbs in which air predominates more than the other three elements such for instance are pulse or lentils according to pythagoras these being gathered when the sun is in libra the nature of which is to balance even heavy things in the air at the moment of conjunction with mercury a winged power as you know and properly energized by certain mysterious words by a skilful magician then reduced to powder in a mortar made out of an aerolite or stone that had flown up into the sky and come down again would no doubt when rightly used enable or force a person to fly up into the air it is well known indeed that the thessalian witches go at pleasure through the clouds from place to place which must be done by means of some such charm then as to the christians you will remember excellent proculus that in the account to which you have done me the honor to allude which was at the deified fabiuss table if i remember right i mentioned that the sect came originally from chalda a country always famous for its occult arts but we have a most important evidence bearing on this matter recorded in history it is quite certain that here in rome a certain simon who was sometimes called simon peter and at other times simon magus actually in public flew up high into the air but his charm having slipped out of his belt he fell and broke both his legs for which reason he was obliged to be crucified with his head downwards then are all christians necessarily sorcerers asked scaurus necessarily it is part of their superstition they believe their priests to have most extraordinary power over nature thus for example they think they can bathe the bodies of people in water and their souls acquire thereby wonderful gifts and superiority should they be slaves over their masters and the divine emperors themselves dreadful all cried out then again resumed calpurnius we all know what a frightful crime some of them committed last night in tearing down a supreme edict of the imperial deities and even suppose which the gods avert that they carried their treasons still further and attempted their sacred lives they believe that they have only to go to one of those priests own the crime and ask for pardon and if he gives it they consider themselves as perfectly guiltless fearful joined in the chorus such a doctrine said scaurus is incompatible with the safety of the state a man who thinks he can be pardoned by another man of every crime is capable of committing any and that no doubt observed fulvius is the cause of this new and terrible edict against them after what calpurnius has told us about these desperate men nothing can be too severe against them fulvius had been keenly eyeing sebastian who had entered during the conversation and now pointedly addressed him and you no doubt think so too sebastian do you not i think he calmly replied that if the christians be such as calpurnius describes them infamous sorcerers they deserve to be exterminated from the face of the earth but even so i would gladly give them one chance of escape and what is that sneeringly asked fulvius that no one should be allowed to join in destroying them who could not prove himself freer from crime than they i would have no one raise his hand against them who cannot show that he has never been an adulterer an extortioner a deceiver a drunkard a bad husband father or child a profligate or a thief for with being any of these no one charges the poor christians fulvius winced under the catalogue of vices and still more under the indignant but serene glance of sebastian but at the word thief he fairly leapt had the soldier seen him pick up the scarf in fabiuss house be it so or not the dislike he had taken to sebastian at their first meeting had ripened into hatred at their second and hatred in that heart was only written in blood he had only intensity now to add to that feeling sebastian went out and his thoughts got vent in familiar words of prayer how long o lord how long what hopes can we entertain of the conversion of many to the truth still less of the conversion of this great empire so long as we find even honest and learned men believing at once every calumny spoken against us treasuring up from age to age every fable and fiction about us and refusing even to inquire into our doctrines because they have made up their minds that they are false and contemptible he spoke aloud believing himself alone when a sweet voice answered him at his side good youth whoever thou art that speakest thus and methinks i know thy voice remember that the son of god gave light to the dark eye of the body by spreading thereon clay which in mans hands would have only blinded the seeing let us be as dust beneath his feet if we wish to become his means of enlightening the eyes of mens souls let us be trampled on a little longer in patience perhaps even from our ashes may come out the spark to blaze thank you thank you ccilia said sebastian for your just and kind rebuke whither tripping on so gaily on this first day of danger do you not know that i have been named guide of the cemetery of callistus i am going to take possession pray that i may be the first flower of this coming spring illustration a monogram of christ found in the catacombs and she passed on singing blithely but sebastian begged her to stay one moment chapter xvi the wolf in the fold after the adventures of the night our youths had not much time for rest long before daybreak the christians had to be up and assemble at their several titles so as to disperse before day it was to be their last meeting there the oratories were to be closed and divine worship had to begin from that day in the subterranean churches of the cemeteries it could not indeed be expected that all would be able to travel with safety even on the sunday some miles beyond the gate a great privilege was consequently granted to the faithful at such times of trouble that of preserving the blessed eucharist in their houses and communicating themselves privately in the morning before taking other food as tertullian expresses it the faithful felt not as sheep going to the slaughter not as criminals preparing for execution but as soldiers arming for fight their weapons their food their strength their courage were all to be found in their lords table even the lukewarm and the timid gathered fresh spirit from the bread of life in churches as yet may be seen in the cemeteries were chairs placed for the penitentiaries before whom the sinner knelt and confessed his sins and received absolution in moments like this the penitential code was relaxed and the terms of public expiation shortened and the whole night had been occupied by the zealous clergy in preparing their flocks for to many their last public communion on earth we need not remind our readers that the office then performed was essentially and in many details the same as they daily witness at the catholic altar not only was it considered as now to be the sacrifice of our lords body and blood not only were the oblation the consecration the communion alike but many of the prayers were identical so that the catholic hearing them recited and still more the priest reciting them in the same language as the roman church of the catacombs spoke may feel himself in active and living communion with the martyrs who celebrated and the martyrs who assisted at those sublime mysteries on the occasion which we are describing when the time came for giving the kiss of peace a genuine embrace of brotherly love sobs could be heard and bursts of tears for it was to many a parting salutation many a youth clung to his fathers neck scarcely knowing whether that day might not sever them till they waved their palm branches together in heaven and how would mothers press their daughters to their bosom in the fervor of that new love which fear of long separation enkindled then came the communion more solemn than usual more devout more hushed to stillness the body of our lord jesus christ said the priest to each as he offered him the sacred food amen replied the receiver with thrilling accents of faith and love then extending in his hand an orarium or white linen cloth he received in it a provision of the bread of life sufficient to last him till some future feast this was most carefully and illustration the blessed eucharist in the early ages of the church reverently folded and laid in the bosom wrapped up often in another and more precious covering or even placed in a gold locket it was now that for the first time poor syra regretted the loss of her rich embroidered scarf which would long before have been given to the poor had she not studiously reserved it for such an occasion and such a use nor had her mistress been able to prevail upon her to accept any objects of value without a stipulation that she might dispose of them as she liked that was in charitable gifts the various assemblies had broken up before the discovery of the violated edict but they may rather be said to have adjourned to the cemeteries the frequent meetings of torquatus with his two heathen confederates in the baths of caracalla had been narrowly watched by the capsarius and his wife as we have already remarked and victoria had overheard the plot to make an inroad into the cemetery of callistus on the day after publication the christians therefore considered themselves safer the first day and took advantage of the circumstance to inaugurate by solemn offices the churches of the catacombs which after some years disuse had been put into good repair and order by the fossores had been in some places repainted and furnished with all requisites for divine worship but corvinus after getting over his first dismay and having as speedily as possible another though not so grand a copy of the edict affixed began better to see the dismal probabilities of serious consequences from the wrath of his imperial master the dacian was right he would have to answer for the loss he felt it necessary to do something that very day which might wipe off the disgrace he had incurred before again meeting the emperors look he determined to anticipate the attack on the cemetery intended for the following day he repaired therefore while it was still early to the baths where fulvius ever jealously watchful over torquatus kept him in expectation of corvinuss coming to hold council with them the worthy trio concerted their plans corvinus guided by the reluctant apostate at the head of a chosen band of soldiers who were at his disposal had to make an incursion into the cemetery of callistus and drive or drag thence the clergy and principal christians while fulvius remaining outside with another company would intercept them and cut off all retreat securing the most important prizes and especially the pontiff and superior clergy whom his visit to the ordination would enable him to recognize this was his plan let fools he said to himself act the part of ferrets in the warren i will be the sportsman outside in the meantime victoria overheard sufficient to make her very busy dusting and cleaning in the retired room where they were consulting without appearing to listen she told all to cucumio and he after much scratching of his head hit upon a notable plan for conveying the discovered information to the proper quarter sebastian after his early attendance on divine worship unable from his duties at the palace to do more had proceeded according to almost universal custom to the baths to invigorate his limbs by their healthy refreshment and also to remove from himself the suspicion which his absence on that morning might have excited while he was thus engaged the old capsararius as he had had himself rattlingly called in his ante posthumous inscription wrote on a slip of parchment all that his wife had heard about the intention of an immediate assault and of getting possession of the holy pontiffs person this he fastened with a pin or needle to the inside of sebastians tunic of which he had charge as he durst not speak to him in the presence of others the officer after his bath went into the hall where the events of the morning were being discussed and where fulvius was waiting till corvinus should tell him that all was ready upon going out disgusted he felt himself as he walked pricked by something on his chest he examined his garments and found the paper it was written in about as elegant a latinity as cucumios epitaph but he made it out sufficiently to consider it necessary for him to turn his steps towards the via appia instead of the palatine and convey the important information to the christians assembled in the cemetery having however found a fleeter and surer messenger than himself in the poor blind girl who would not attract the same attention he stopped her gave her the note after adding a few words to it with the pen and ink which he carried and bade her bear it as speedily as possible to its destination but in fact he had hardly left the baths when fulvius received information that corvinus and his troop were by that time hastening across the fields so as to avoid suspicion towards the appointed spot he mounted his horse immediately and went along the high road while the christian soldier in a by way was instructing his blind messenger when we accompanied diogenes and his party through the catacombs we stopped short of the subterranean church because severus would not let it be betrayed to torquatus in this the christian congregation was now assembled under its chief pastor it was constructed on the principle common to all such excavations for we can hardly call them edifices the reader may imagine two of the cubicula or chambers which we have before described placed one on each side of a gallery or passage so that their doors or rather wide entrances are opposite one another at the end of one will be found an arcosolium or altar tomb and the probable conjecture is that in this division the men under charge of the ostiarii and in the other the women under the care of the deaconesses were assembled this division of the sexes at divine worship was a matter of jealous discipline in the early church illustration ruins of the basilica of st alexander on the nomentan way from rollers catacombes de rome often these subterranean churches were not devoid of architectural decoration the walls especially near the altar were plastered and painted and half columns with their bases and capitals not ungracefully cut out of the sandstone divided illustration confirmation in the early ages of the church the different parts or ornamented the entrances in one instance indeed in the chief basilica yet discovered in the cemetery of callistus there is a chamber without any altar communicating with the church by means of a funnel shaped opening piercing the earthen wall here some twelve feet thick and entering the chamber which is at a lower level at the height of five or six feet in a slanting direction so that all that was spoken in the church could be heard yet nothing that was done there could be seen by those assembled in the chamber this is very naturally supposed to have been the place reserved for the class of public penitents called audientes or hearers and for the catechumens not yet initiated by baptism illustration plan of subterranean church in the cemetery of st agnes a choir or chancel with episcopal chair a and benches for the clergy b b b division for the men separated from the choir by two pillars supporting an arch c corridor of the catacomb affording entrance to the church d division for the women with a tomb in it each portion is subdivided by projections in the wall the basilica in which the christians were assembled when sebastian sent his message was like the one discovered in the cemetery of st agnes each of the two divisions was double that is consisted of two large chambers slightly separated by half columns in what we may call the womens church and by flat pilasters in the mens one of these surfaces having in it a small niche for an image or lamp but the most remarkable feature of this basilica is a further prolongation of the structure so as to give it a chancel or presbytery this is about the size of half each other division from which it is separated by two columns against the wall as well as by its lesser height after the manner of modern chancels for while each portion of each division has first a lofty arched tomb in its wall and four or five tiers of graves above it the elevation of the chancel is not much greater than that of those arcosolia or altar tombs at the end of the chancel against the middle of the wall is a chair with back and arms cut out of the solid stone and from each side proceeds a stone bench which thus occupies the end and two sides of the chancel as the table of the arched tomb behind the chair is higher than the back of the throne and as this is immovable it is clear that the divine mysteries could not have been celebrated upon it a portable altar must therefore have been placed before the throne in an isolated position in the middle of the sanctuary and this tradition tell us was the wooden altar of st peter illustration a cathedra or episcopal chair in the catacomb of saint agnes we have thus the exact arrangements to be found in the churches built after the peace and yet to be seen in all the ancient basilicas in rome the episcopal chair in the centre of the apse the presbytery or seat for the clergy on either hand and the altar between the throne and the people the early christians thus anticipated underground or rather gave the principles which directed the forms of ecclesiastical architecture it was in such a basilica then that we are to imagine the faithful assembled when corvinus and his satellites arrived at the entrance of the cemetery this was the way which torquatus knew leading down by steps from a half ruinous building choked up with faggots they found the coast clear and immediately made their arrangements fulvius with one body of ten or twelve men lurked to guard the entrance and seize all who attempted to come out or go in corvinus with torquatus and a smaller body of eight prepared to descend i dont like this underground work said an old grey bearded legionary i am a soldier and not a rat catcher bring me my man into the light of day and i will fight him hand to hand and foot to foot but i have no love for being stifled or poisoned like vermin in a drain this speech found favor with the soldiers one said there may be hundreds of these skulking christians down there and we are little more than half a dozen this is not the sort of work we receive our pay for added another its their sorceries i care for continued a third and not their valor it required all the eloquence of fulvius to screw up their resolution he assured them there was nothing to fear that the cowardly christians would run before them like hares and that they would find more gold and silver in the church than a years pay would give them thus encouraged they went groping down to the bottom of the stairs they could distinguish lamps at intervals stretching into the gloomy length before them hush said one listen to that voice illustration an altar with its episcopal chair in the cemetery of saint agnes from far away its accents came softened by distance but they were the notes of a fresh youthful voice that quailed not with fear so clear that the very words could be caught as it intoned the following verses dominus illuminatio mea et salus mea quem timebo illustration an attack in the catacombs dominus protector vit me a quo trepidabo then came a full chorus of voices singing like the sound of many waters dum appropriant super me nocentes ut edant carnes meas qui tribulant me inimici mei ipsi infirmati sunt et ceciderunt a mixture of shame and anger seized on the assailants as they heard these words of calm confidence and defiance the single voice again sang forth but in apparently fainter accents si consistant adversum me castra non timebit cor meum i thought i knew that voice muttered corvinus i ought to know it out of a thousand it is that of my bane the cause of all last nights curse and this days trouble it is that of pancratius who pulled down the edict on on my men any reward for him dead or alive but stop said one let us light our torches hark said a second while they were engaged in this operation what is that strange noise as if of scratching and hammering at a distance i have heard it for some time and look added a third the distant lights have disappeared and the music has ceased we are certainly discovered no danger said torquatus putting on a boldness which he did not feel that noise only comes from those old moles diogenes and his sons busy preparing graves for the christians we shall seize illustration an altar in the cemetery of st sixtus torquatus had in vain advised the troop not to bring torches but to provide themselves with such lamps as we see diogenes represented carrying in his picture or waxen tapers which he had brought for himself but the men swore they would not go down without plenty of light and such means for it as could not be put out by a draught of wind or a stroke on the arm the effects were soon obvious as they advanced silently and cautiously along the low narrow gallery the resinous torches crackled and hissed with a fierce glare which heated and annoyed them while a volume of thick pitchy smoke from each rolled downwards on to the bearers from the roof half stifled them and made a dense atmosphere of cloud around themselves which effectually dimmed their light torquatus kept at the head of the party counting every turning right and left as he had noted them though he found every mark which he had made carefully removed he was staggered and baulked when after having counted little more than half the proper number he found the road completely blocked up the fact was that keener eyes than he was aware of had been on the look out severus had never relaxed his watchfulness determined not to be surprised he was near the entrance to the cemetery below when the soldiers reached it above and he ran forward at once to the place where the sand had been prepared for closing the road near which his brother and several other stout workmen were stationed in case of danger in a moment with that silence and rapidity to which they were trained they set to work lustily shovelling the sand across the narrow and low corridor from each side while well directed blows of the pick brought from the low roof behind huge flakes of sandstone which closed up the opening behind this barrier they stood hardly suppressing a laugh as they heard their enemies through its loose separation their work it was which had been heard and which had screened off the lights and deadened the song torquatuss perplexity was not diminished by the volley of oaths and imprecations and the threats of violence which were showered upon him for a fool or a traitor stay one moment i entreat you he said it is possible i have mistaken my reckoning i know the right turn by a remarkable tomb a few yards within it i will just step into one or two of the last corridors and see with these words he ran back to the next gallery on the left advanced a few paces and totally disappeared though his companions had followed him to the very mouth of the gallery they could not see how this happened it appeared like witchcraft in which they were quite ready to believe his light and himself seemed to have vanished at once we will have no more of this work they said either torquatus is a traitor or he has been carried off by magic worried heated in the close atmosphere almost inflamed by their lights begrimed blinded and choked by the pitchy smoke crest fallen and disheartened they turned back and since their road led straight to the entrance they flung away their blazing torches into the side galleries one here and one there as they passed by to get rid of them when they looked back it seemed as if a triumphal illumination was kindling up the very atmosphere of the gloomy corridor from the mouths of the various caverns came forth a fiery light which turned the dull sandstone into a bright crimson while the volumes of smoke above hung like amber clouds along the whole gallery the sealed tombs receiving the unusual reflection on their yellow tiles or marble slabs appeared covered with golden or silver plates set in the red damask of the walls it looked like a homage paid to martyrdom by the very furies of heathenism on the first day of persecution the torches which they had kindled to destroy only served to shed brightness on monuments of that virtue which had never failed to save the church but before these foiled hounds with drooping heads had reached the entrance they recoiled before the sight of a singular apparition at first they thought they had caught a glimpse of daylight but they soon perceived it was the glimmering of a lamp this was held steadily by an upright immovable figure which thus received its light upon itself it was clothed in a dark dress so as to resemble one of those bronze statues which have the head and extremities of white marble and startle one when first seen so like are they to living forms who can it be what is it the men whispered to one another a sorceress replied one the genius loci observed another a spirit suggested a third still as they approached stealthily towards it it did not appear conscious of their presence there was no speculation in its eyes it remained unmoved and unscared at length two got sufficiently near to seize the figure by its arms who are you asked corvinus in a rage a christian answered ccilia with her usual cheerful gentleness illustration the cure of the man born blind from a picture in the catacombs bring her along he commanded some one at least shall pay for our disappointment chapter xvii the first flower ccilia already forewarned had approached the cemetery by a different but neighboring entrance no sooner had she descended than she snuffed the strong odor of the torches this is none of our incense i know she said to herself the enemy is already within she hastened therefore to the place of assembly and delivered sebastians note adding also what she had observed it warned them to disperse and seek the shelter of the inner and lower galleries and begged of the pontiff not to leave till he should send for him as his person was particularly sought for pancratius urged the blind messenger to save herself too no she replied my office is to watch the door and guide the faithful safe but the enemy may seize you no matter she answered laughing my being taken may save much worthier lives give me a lamp pancratius why you cannot see by it observed he smiling true but others can they may be your enemies even so she answered i do not wish to be taken in the dark if my bridegroom come to me in the night of this cemetery must he not find me with my lamp trimmed off she started reached her post and hearing no noise except that of quiet footsteps she thought they were those of friends and held up her lamp to guide them when the party came forth with their only captive fulvius was perfectly furious it was worse than a total failure it was ridiculous a poor mouse come out of the bowels of the earth he rallied corvinus till the wretch winced and foamed then suddenly he asked and where is torquatus he heard the account of his sudden disappearance told in as many ways as the dacian guards adventure but it annoyed him greatly he had no doubt whatever in his own mind that he had been duped by his supposed victim who had escaped into the unsearchable mazes of the cemetery if so this captive would know and he determined to question her he stood before her therefore put on his most searching and awful look and said to her sternly look at me woman and tell me the truth i must tell you the truth without looking at you sir answered the poor girl with her cheerfullest smile and softest voice do you not see that i am blind blind all exclaimed at once as they crowded to look at her but over the features of fulvius there passed the slightest possible emotion just as much as the wave that runs pursued by a playful breeze over the ripe meadow a knowledge had flashed into his mind a clue had fallen into his hand it will be ridiculous he said for twenty soldiers to march through the city guarding a blind girl return to your quarters and i will see you are well rewarded you corvinus take my horse and go before to your father and tell him all i will follow in a carriage with the captive no treachery fulvius he said vexed and mortified mind you bring her the day must not pass without a sacrifice do not fear was the reply fulvius indeed was pondering whether having lost one spy he should not try to make another but the placid gentleness of the poor beggar perplexed him more than the boisterous zeal of the gamester and her sightless orbs defied him more than the restless roll of the topers still the first thought that had struck him he could yet pursue when alone in a carriage with her he assumed a soothing tone and addressed her he knew she had not overheard the last dialogue my poor girl he said how long have you been blind all my life she replied what is your history whence do you come i have no history my parents were poor and brought me to rome when i was four years old as they came to pray in discharge of a vow made for my life in early sickness to the blessed martyrs chrysanthus and daria they left me in charge of a pious lame woman at the door of the title of fasciola while they went to their devotions it was on that memorable day when many christians were buried at their tomb by earth and stones cast down upon them my parents had the happiness to be of the number and how have you lived since god became my only father then and his catholic church my mother the one feeds the birds of the air the other nurses the weaklings of the flock i have never wanted for any thing since but you can walk about the streets freely and without fear as well as if you saw how do you know that i have seen you do you remember very early one morning in the autumn leading a poor lame man along the vicus patricius she blushed and remained silent could he have seen her put into the poor old mans purse her own share of the alms you have owned yourself a christian he asked negligently oh yes how could i deny it then that meeting was a christian meeting certainly what else could it be he wanted no more his suspicions were verified agnes about whom torquatus had been able or willing to tell him nothing was certainly a christian his game was made she must yield or he would be avenged after a pause looking at her steadfastly he said do you know whither you are going before the judge of earth i suppose who will send me to my spouse in heaven and so calmly he asked in surprise for he could see no token from the soul to the countenance but a smile so joyfully rather was her brief reply having got all that he desired he consigned his prisoner to corvinus at the gates of the milian basilica and left her to her fate it had been a cold and drizzling day like the preceding evening the weather and the incident of the night had kept down all enthusiasm and while the prefect had been compelled to sit in doors where no great crowd could collect as hours had passed away without any arrest trial or tidings most of the curious had left and only a few more persevering remained past the hour of afternoon recreation in the public gardens but just before the captive arrived a fresh knot of spectators came in and stood near one of the side doors from which they could see all as corvinus had prepared his father for what he was to expect tertullus moved with some compassion and imagining there could be little difficulty in overcoming the obstinacy of a poor ignorant blind beggar requested the spectators to remain perfectly still that he might try his persuasion on her alone as she would imagine with him and he threatened heavy penalties on any one who should presume to break the silence it was as he had calculated ccilia knew not that any one else was there as the prefect thus kindly addressed her what is thy name child ccilia it is a noble name hast thou it from thy family no i am not noble except because my parents though poor died for christ as i am blind those who took care of me called me cca and then out of kindness softened it into ccilia but now give up all this folly of the christians who have kept thee only poor and blind honor the decrees of the divine emperors and offer sacrifice to the gods and thou shalt have riches and fine clothes and good fare and the best physicians shall try to restore thee thy sight you must have better motives to propose to me than these for the very things for which i most thank god and his divine son are those which you would have me put away how dost thou mean i thank god that i am poor and meanly clad and fare not daintily because by all these things i am the more like jesus christ my only spouse foolish girl interrupted the judge losing patience a little hast thou learnt all these silly delusions already at least thou canst not thank thy god that he has made thee sightless for that more than all the rest i thank him daily and hourly with all my heart how so dost thou think it a blessing never to have seen the face of a human being or the sun or the earth what strange fancies are these they are not so most noble sir for in the midst of what you call darkness i see a spot of what i must call light it contrasts so strongly with all around it is to me what the sun is to you which i know to be local from the varying direction of its rays and this object looks upon me as with a countenance of intensest beauty and smiles upon me ever and i know it to be that of him whom i love with undivided affection i would not for the world have its splendor dimmed by a brighter sun nor its wondrous loveliness confounded with the diversities of others features nor my gaze on it drawn aside by earthly visions i love him too much not to wish to see him always alone come come let me have no more of this silly prattle obey the emperors at once or i must try what a little pain will do that will soon tame thee pain she echoed innocently yes pain hast thou never felt it hast thou never been hurt by any one in thy life oh no christians never hurt one another the rack was standing as usual before him and he made a sign to catulus to place her upon it the executioner pushed her back on it by her arms and as she made no resistance she was easily laid extended on its wooden couch the loops of the ever ready ropes were in a moment passed round her ankles and arms drawn over the head the poor sightless girl saw not who did all this she knew not but it might be the same person who had been conversing with her if there had been silence hitherto men now held their very breath while ccilias lips moved in earnest prayer once more before proceeding further i call on thee to sacrifice to the gods and escape cruel torments said the judge with a sterner voice neither torments nor death firmly replied the victim tied to the altar shall separate me from the love of christ i can offer up no sacrifice but to the one living god and its ready oblation is myself the prefect made a signal to the executioner and he gave one rapid whirl to the two wheels of the rack round the windlasses of which the ropes were wound and the limbs of the maiden were stretched with a sudden jerk which though not enough to wrench them from their sockets as a further turn would have done sufficed to inflict an excruciating or more truly a racking pain through all her frame far more grievous was this from the preparation and the cause of it being unseen and from that additional suffering which darkness inflicts a quivering of her features and a sudden paleness alone gave evidence of her torture ha ha the judge exclaimed thou feelest that come let it suffice obey and thou shalt be freed she seemed to take no heed of his words but gave vent to her feelings in prayer i thank thee o lord jesus christ that thou hast made me suffer pain the first time for thy sake i have loved thee in peace i have loved thee in comfort i have loved thee in joy and now in pain i love thee still more how much sweeter it is to be like thee stretched upon thy cross even than resting upon the hard couch at the poor mans table thou triflest with me exclaimed the judge thoroughly vexed and makest light of my lenity we will try something stronger here catulus apply a lighted torch to her sides illustration the martyr ccilia a thrill of disgust and horror ran through the assembly which could not help sympathizing with the poor blind creature a murmur of suppressed indignation broke out from all sides of the hall ccilia for the first time learnt that she was in the midst of a crowd a crimson glow of modesty rushed into her brow her face and neck just before white as marble the angry judge checked the rising gush of feeling and all listened in silence as she spoke again with warmer earnestness than before o my dear lord and spouse i have been ever true and faithful to thee let me suffer pain and torture for thee but spare me confusion from human eyes let me come to thee at once not covering my face with my hands in shame when i stand before thee another muttering of compassion was heard catulus shouted the baffled judge in fury do your duty sirrah what are you about fumbling all day with that torch the executioner advanced and stretched forth his hand to her robe to withdraw it for the torture but he drew back and turning to the prefect exclaimed in softened accents it is too late she is dead dead cried out tertullus dead with one turn of the wheel impossible catulus gave the rack a turn backwards and the body remained motionless it was true she had passed from the rack to the throne from the scowl of the judges countenance to her spouses welcoming embrace had she breathed out her pure soul as a sweet perfume in the incense of her prayer or had her heart been unable to get back its blood from the intensity of that first virginal blush in the stillness of awe and wonder a clear bold voice cried out from the group near the door impious tyrant dost thou not see that a poor blind christian hath more power over life and death than thou or thy cruel masters what a third time in twenty four hours wilt thou dare to cross my path this time thou shalt not escape these were corvinuss words garnished with a furious imprecation as he rushed from his fathers side round the enclosure before the tribunal towards the group but as he ran blindly on he struck against an officer of herculean build who no doubt quite accidentally was advancing from it he reeled and the soldier caught hold of him saying you are not hurt i hope corvinus no no let me go quadratus let me go where are you running to in such a hurry can i help you asked his captor still holding him fast let me loose i say or he will be gone who will be gone pancratius answered corvinus who just now insulted my father pancratius said quadratus looking round and seeing that he had got clear off i do not see him and he let him go but it was too late the youth was safe at diogeness in the suburra while this scene was going on the prefect mortified ordered catulus to see the body thrown into the tiber but another officer muffled in his cloak stepped aside and beckoned to catulus who understood the sign and stretched out his hand to receive a purse held out to him out of the porta capena at lucinas villa an hour after sunset said sebastian it shall be delivered there safe said the executioner of what do you think did that poor girl die asked a spectator from his companion as they went out of fright i fancy he replied illustration the woman of samaria from a picture in the cemetery of st domitilla of christian modesty interposed a stranger who passed them chapter xviii retribution the prefect of the city went to give his report on the untoward events of the day and do what was possible to screen his worthless son he found the emperor in the worst of moods had corvinus come in his way early in the day nobody could have answered for his head and now the result of the inroad into the cemetery had revived his anger when tertullus entered into the audience chamber sebastian contrived to be on guard where is your booby of a son was the first salutation which the prefect received humbly waiting your divinitys pleasure outside and anxious to propitiate your godlike anger for the tricks which fortune has played upon his zeal fortune exclaimed the tyrant fortune indeed his own stupidity and cowardice a pretty beginning forsooth but he shall smart for it bring him in the wretch whining and trembling was introduced and cast himself at the emperors feet from which he was spurned and sent rolling like a lashed hound into the midst of the hall this set the imperial divinity a laughing and helped to mollify its wrath come sirrah stand up he said and let me hear an account of yourself how did the edict disappear corvinus told a rambling tale which occasionally amused the emperor for he was rather taken with the trick this was a good symptom well he said at last i will be merciful to you lictors bind your fasces they drew their axes forth and felt their edges corvinus again threw himself down and exclaimed spare my life i have important information to furnish if i live who wants your worthless life responded the gentle maximian lictors put aside your axes the rods are good enough for him in a moment his hands were seized and bound his tunic was stripped off his shoulders and a shower of blows fell upon them delivered with well regulated skill till he roared and writhed to the great enjoyment of his imperial master smarting and humbled he had to stand again before him now sir said the latter what is the wonderful information you have to give that i know who perpetrated the outrage of last night on your imperial edict who was it a youth named pancratius whose knife i found under where the edict had been cut away and why have you not seized him and brought him to justice twice this day he has been almost within my grasp for i have heard his voice but he has escaped me then let him not escape a third time or you may have to take his place but how do you know him or his knife he was my school fellow at the school of cassianus who turned out to be a christian a christian presume to teach my subjects to make them enemies of their country disloyal to their sovereigns and contemners of the gods i suppose it was he who taught that young viper pancratius to pull down our imperial edict do you know where he is yes sire torquatus who has abandoned the christian superstition has told me and pray who is this torquatus he is one who has been staying some time with chromatius and a party of christians in the country why this is worse and worse is the ex prefect then too become a christian yes and lives with many others of that sect in campania what perfidy what treachery i shall not know whom to trust next prefect send some one immediately to arrest all these men and the school master and torquatus he is no longer a christian interposed the judge well what do i care replied the emperor peevishly arrest as many as you can and spare no one and make them smart well do you understand me now begone all it is time for my supper corvinus went home and in spite of medicinal applications was feverish sore and spiteful all night and next morning begged his father to let him go on the expedition into campania that so he might retrieve his honor gratify his revenge and escape the disgrace and sarcasm that was sure to be heaped on him by roman society when fulvius had deposited his prisoner at the tribunal he hastened home to recount his adventures as usual to eurotas the old man listened with imperturbable sternness to the barren recital and at last said coldly very little profit from all this fulvius no immediate profit indeed but a good prospect in view at least how so why the lady agnes is in my power i have made sure at last that she is a christian i can now necessarily either win her or destroy her in either case her property is mine take the second alternative said the old man with a keen glow in his eye but no change of face it is the shorter and less troublesome way but my honor is engaged i cannot allow myself to be spurned in the manner i told you you have been spurned however and that calls for vengeance you have no time to lose remember in foolery your funds are nearly exhausted and nothing is coming in you must strike a blow surely eurotas you would prefer my trying to get this wealth by honorable eurotas smiled at the idea coming into either of their minds rather than by foul means get it get it any way provided it be the surest and the speediest you know our compact either the family is restored to wealth and splendor or it ends in and with you it shall never linger on in disgrace that is in poverty i know i know without your every day reminding me of the bitter condition said fulvius wringing his hands and writhing in all his body give me time enough and all will be well i give you time till all is hopeless things do not look bright at present but fulvius it is time that i tell you who i am why were you not my fathers faithful dependant to whose care he intrusted me i was your fathers elder brother fulvius and am the head of the family i have had but one thought but one aim in life the restoring of our house to that greatness and splendor from which my fathers negligence and prodigality had brought it down thinking that your father my brother had greater ability than myself for this work i resigned my rights and gains to him upon certain terms one of which was your guardianship and the exclusive forming of your mind you know how i have trained you to care nothing about the means so that our great ends be carried fulvius who had been riveted with amazement and deep attention on the speaker shrunk into himself with shame at this baring of both their hearts the dark old man fixed his eyes more intently than ever and went on you remember the black and complicated crime by which we concentrated in your hands the divided remnant of family wealth fulvius covered his face with his hands and shuddered then said entreatingly oh spare me that eurotas for heavens sake spare me well then resumed the other unmoved as ever i will be brief remember nephew that he who does not recoil from a brilliant future to be gained by guilt must not shrink from a past that prepared it by crime for the future will one day be the past let our compact therefore be straightforward and honest for there is an honesty even in sin nature has given you abundance of selfishness and cunning and she has given me boldness and remorselessness in directing and applying them our lot is cast by the same throw we become rich or die together fulvius in his heart cursed the day that he came to rome or bound himself to his stern master whose mysterious tie was so much stronger than he had known before but he felt himself spell bound to him and powerless as the kid in the lions paws he retired to his couch with a heavier heart than ever for a dark impending fate never failed to weigh upon his soul every returning night the reader will perhaps be curious to know what has become of the third member of our worthy trio the apostate torquatus when confused and bewildered he ran to look for the tomb which was to guide him it so happened that just within the gallery which he entered was a neglected staircase cut in the sandstone down to a lower story of the cemetery the steps had been worn round and smooth and the descent was precipitous torquatus carrying his light before him and running heedlessly fell headlong down the opening and remained stunned and insensible at the bottom till long after his companions had retired he then revived and for some time was so confused that he knew not where he was he arose and groped about till consciousness completely returning he remembered that he was in a catacomb but could not make out how he was alone and in the dark it then struck him that he had a supply of tapers about him and means of lighting them he employed these and was cheered by finding himself again in light but he had wandered from the staircase of which indeed he recollected nothing and went on and on entangling himself more inextricably in the subterranean labyrinth he felt sure that before he had exhausted his strength or his tapers he should come to some outlet but by degrees he began to feel serious alarm one after the other his lights were burnt out and his vigor began to fail for he had been fasting from early morning and he found himself coming back to the same spot after he had wandered about apparently for hours at first he had looked negligently around him and had carelessly read the inscriptions on the tombs but as he grew fainter and his hope of relief weaker these solemn monuments of death began to speak to his soul in a language that it could not refuse to hear nor pretend to misunderstand deposited in peace was the inmate of one resting in christ was another and even the thousand nameless ones around them reposed in silent calm each with the seal of the churchs motherly care stamped upon his place of rest and within the embalmed remains awaited the sound of angelic trumpet notes to awaken them to a happy resurrection and he in a few more hours would be dead like them he was lighting his last taper and had sunk down upon a heap of mould but would he be laid in peace by pious hands as they on the cold ground alone he should die unpitied unmourned unknown there he should rot and drop to pieces and if in after years his bones cast out from christian sepulture should be found tradition might conjecture that they were the accursed remains of an apostate lost in the cemetery and even they might be cast out as he was from the communion of that hallowed ground it was coming on fast he could feel it his head reeled his heart fluttered the taper was getting too short for his fingers and he placed it on a stone beside him it might burn three minutes longer but a drop filtering through the ceiling fell upon it and extinguished it so covetous did he feel of those three minutes more of light so jealous was he of that little taper end as his last link with earths joys so anxious was he to have one more look at things without lest he should be forced to look at those within that he drew forth his flint and steel and labored for a quarter of an hour to get a light from tinder damped by the cold perspiration on his body and when he had lighted his remnant of candle instead of profiting by its flame to look around him he fixed his eyes upon it with an idiotic stare watching it burn down as though it were the charm which bound his life and this must expire with it and soon the last spark gleamed smouldering like a glow worm on the red earth and died was he dead too he thought why not darkness complete and perpetual had come upon him he was cut off for ever from consort with the living his mouth would no more taste food his ears never again hear a sound his eyes behold no light or thing again he was associated with the dead only his grave was much larger than theirs but for all that it was as dark and lonely and closed for ever what else is death no it could not be death as yet death had to be followed by something else but even this was coming the worm was beginning to gnaw his conscience and it grew apace to a vipers length and twisted itself round his heart he tried to think of pleasant things and they came before him the quiet hours in the villa with chromatius and polycarp their kind words and last embrace but from the beautiful vision darted a withering flash he had betrayed them he had told of them to whom to fulvius and corvinus the fatal chord was touched like the tingling nerve of a tooth that darts its agony straight to the centre of the brain the drunken debauch the dishonest play the base hypocrisy the vile treachery the insincere apostasy the remorseful sacrileges of the last days and the murderous attempt of that morning now came dancing like demons hand in hand in the dark before him shouting laughing jibing weeping moaning gnashing their teeth and sparks of fire flying before his eyes from his enfeebled brain seemed to dart from glaring torches in their hands he sunk down and covered his eyes i may be dead after all he said to himself for the infernal pit can have nothing worse than this his heart was too weak for rage it sunk within him in the impotence of despair his strength was ebbing fast when he fancied he heard a distant sound he put away the thought but the wave of a remote harmony beat again upon his ear he raised himself up it was becoming distinct so sweet it sounded so like a chorus of angelic voices but in another sphere that he said to himself who would have thought that heaven was so near to hell or are they accompanying the fearful judge to try me and now a faint glimmer of light appeared at the same distance as the sounds and the words of the strain were clearly heard in pace in idipsum dormiam et requiescam those words are not for me they might do at a martyrs entombment they cannot at a reprobates burial the light increased it was like a dawn glowing into day it entered the gallery and passed across it bearing in it as in a mirror a vision too distinct to be unreal first there came virgins robed and holding lamps then four who carried between them a form wrapped up in a white linen cloth with a crown of thorns upon the head after them the youthful acolyte tarcisius bearing a censer steaming with perfumed smoke and after others of the clergy the venerable pontiff himself attended by reparatus and another deacon diogenes and his sons with sorrowful countenances and many others among whom he could distinguish sebastian closed the procession as many bore lamps or tapers the figures seemed to move in an unchanging atmosphere of mildest light and as they passed before him they chanted the next verse of the psalm quoniam tu domine singulariter in spe constituisti me that he exclaimed rousing himself up that is for me with this thought he had sprung upon his knees and by an instinct of grace words which he had before heard came back to him like an echo words suited to the moment words which he felt that he must speak he crept forward faint and feeble turned along the gallery through which the funeral procession was passing and followed it unobserved at a distance it entered a chamber and lighted it up so that a picture illustration the martyrs burial of the good shepherd looked brightly down on him but he would not pass the threshold where he stood striking his breast and praying for mercy the body had been laid upon the ground and other psalms and hymns were sung and prayers recited all in that cheerful tone and joyous mood of hopefulness with which the church has always treated of death at length it was placed in the tomb prepared for it under an arch while this was being done torquatus drew nigh to one of the spectators and whispered to him the question whose funeral is this it is the deposition he answered of the blessed ccilia a blind virgin who this morning fell into the hands of the soldiers in this cemetery and whose soul god took to himself then i am her murderer he exclaimed with a hollow moan and staggering forward to the holy bishops feet fell prostrate before him it was some time before his feelings could find vent in words when these came they were the ones he had resolved to utter father i have sinned before heaven and against thee and i am not worthy to be called thy child the pontiff raised him up kindly and pressed him to his bosom saying welcome back my son whoever thou art to thy fathers house but thou art weak and faint and needest rest some refreshment was immediately procured but torquatus would not rest till he had publicly avowed the whole of his guilt including the days crimes for it was still the evening of the same day all rejoiced at the prodigals return at the lost sheeps recovery agnes looked up to heaven from her last affectionate glance on the blind virgins shroud and thought that she could almost see her seated at the feet of her spouse smiling with her eyes wide open as she cast down a handful of flowers on the head of the penitent the first fruits of her intercession in heaven illustration jesus cures the blind man from a picture in the cemetery of st domitilla diogenes and his sons took charge of him an humble lodging was procured for him in a christian cottage near that he might not be within the reach of temptation or of vengeance and he was enrolled in the class of penitents where years of expiation shortened by the intercession of confessors that is future martyrs would prepare him for full re admission to the privileges he had forfeited chapter xix twofold revenge sebastians visit to the cemetery had been not merely to take thither for sepulture the relics of the first martyr but also to consult with marcellinus about his safety his life was too valuable to the church to be sacrificed so early and sebastian knew how eagerly it was sought torquatus now confirmed this by communicating fulviuss designs and the motive of his attendance at the december ordination the usual papal residence was no longer safe and a bold idea had been adopted by the courageous soldier the protector of the christians as his acts tell us he had been authoritatively called it was to lodge the pontiff where no one could suspect him to be and where no search would be dreamt of in the very palace of the csars efficiently disguised the holy bishop left the cemetery and escorted by sebastian and quadratus was safely housed in the apartments of irene a christian lady of rank who lived in a remote part of the palatine in which her husband held a household office early next morning sebastian was with pancratius my dear boy he said you must leave rome instantly and go into campania i have horses ready for you and quadratus and there is no time to be lost and why sebastian replied the youth with sorrowful face and tearful eye have i done something wrong or are you doubtful of my fortitude neither i assure you but you have promised to be guided by me in all things and i never considered your obedience more necessary than now tell me why good sebastian i pray it must be a secret as yet what another secret call it the same to be revealed at the same time but i can tell you what i want you to do and that i think will satisfy you corvinus has got orders to seize on chromatius and all his community yet young in the faith as the wretched example of torquatus has shown us and what is worse to put your old master cassianus at fundi to a cruel death i want you to hasten before his messenger perhaps he may go himself and put them on their guard pancratius looked up brightly again he saw that sebastian trusted him your wish is enough reason for me said he smiling but i would go the worlds end to save my good cassianus or any other fellow christians he was soon ready took an affectionate leave of his mother and before rome had fully shaken off sleep he and quadratus each with well furnished saddle bags on their powerful steeds were trotting across the campagna of rome to reach the less frequented and safer track of the latin way corvinus having resolved to keep the hostile expedition in his own hands as honorable lucrative and pleasant it was delayed a couple of days both that he might feel more comfortable about his shoulders and that he might make proper preparations he had a chariot hired and engaged a body of numidian runners who could keep up with a carriage at full speed but he was thus two days behind our christians though he of course travelled by the shorter and more beaten appian road when pancratius arrived at the villa of statues he found the little community already excited by the rumors which had reached it of the edicts publication he was welcomed most warmly by all and sebastians letter of advice was received with deep respect prayer and deliberation succeeded its perusal and various resolutions were taken marcus and marcellianus with their father tranquillinus had already gone to rome for the ordination nicostratus zo and others followed them now chromatius who was not destined for the crown of martyrdom though commemorated by the church with his son on the th of august found shelter for a time in fabiolas villa for which letters had been procured from its mistress without her knowing the reason why for he wished to remain in the neighborhood a little while longer in fine the villa ad statuas was left in charge of a few faithful servants fully to be depended upon when the two messengers had given themselves and their horses a good rest they travelled by the same road as torquatus had lately trodden to fundi where they put up at an obscure inn out of the town on the roman road pancratius soon found out his old master who embraced him most affectionately he told him his errand and entreated him to fly or at least conceal himself no said the good man it must not be i am already old and i am weary of my unprofitable profession i and my servant are the only two christians in the town the best families have indeed sent their children to my school because they knew it would be kept as moral as paganism will permit but i have not a friend among my scholars by reason of this very strictness and they want even the natural refinement of roman heathens they are rude provincials and i believe there are some among the elder ones who would not scruple to take my life if they could do so with impunity what a wretched existence indeed cassianus you must be leading have you made no impression on them little or none dear pancratius and how can i while i am obliged to make them read those dangerous books full of fables which roman and greek literature contain no i have done little by my words perhaps my death may do more for them pancratius found all expostulation vain and would have almost joined him in his resolution to die only he had promised sebastian not to expose his life during the journey he however determined to remain about the town till he saw the end corvinus arrived with his men at the villa of chromatius and early in the morning rushed suddenly through the gates and to the house he found it empty he searched it through and through but discovered neither a person a book nor a symbol of christianity he was confounded and annoyed he looked about and having found a servant working in the garden asked him where his master was master no tell slave where he go was the reply in a latinity corresponding to such a rude phraseology you are trifling with me which way did he and his companions go through yonder gate and then look that way answered the servant you see gate very well you see no more me work here me see gate me see no more when did they go at least you can answer that after the two come from rome what two always two it seems one good youth very handsome sing so sweet the other very big very strong oh very see that young tree pulled up by the roots he do that as easy as me pull my spade out of the ground the very two exclaimed corvinus thoroughly enraged again that dastardly boy has marred my plans and destroyed my hopes he shall suffer well for it as soon as he was a little rested he resumed his journey and determined to vent all his fury on his old master unless indeed he whom he considered his evil genius should have been there before him he was engaged during his journey in plotting vengeance upon master and fellow student and he was delighted to find that one at least was at fundi when he arrived he showed the governor his order for the arrest and punishment of cassianus as a most dangerous christian but that officer a humane man remarked that the commission superseded ordinary jurisdiction in the matter and gave corvinus full power to act he offered him the assistance of an executioner and other requisites but they were declined corvinus had brought an abundant supply of strength and cruelty in his own body guard he took however a public officer with him he proceeded to the school house when filled with scholars shut the doors and reproached cassianus who advanced with open hand and countenance to greet him as a conspirator against the state and a perfidious christian a shout arose from the boyish mob and by its tone and by the look which he cast around corvinus learnt there were many present like himself young bears cubs with full grown hyenas hearts within them boys he shouted out do you love your master cassianus he was once mine too and i owe him many a grudge a yell of execration broke out from the benches then i have good news for you here is permission from the divine emperor maximian for you to do what you like to him a shower of books writing tablets and other school missiles was directed against the master who stood unmoved with his arms folded before his persecutor then came a rush from all sides with menacing attitudes of a brutal onslaught stop stop cried out corvinus we must go more systematically to work than this he had reverted in thought to the recollection of his own sweet school boy days that time which most look back on from hearts teeming with softer feelings than the contemplation of present things can suggest he indulged in the reminiscence of that early season in which others find but the picture of unselfish joyous happy hours and he sought in the recollection what would most have gratified him then that he might bestow it as a boon on the hopeful youths around him but he could think of nothing that would have been such a treat to him as to pay back to his master every stroke of correction and write in blood upon him every word of reproach that he had received delightful thought now to be fulfilled it is far from our intention to harrow the feelings of our gentle readers by descriptions of the cruel and fiendish torments inflicted by the heathen persecutors on our christian forefathers few are more horrible yet few better authenticated than the torture practised on the martyr cassianus placed bound in the midst of his ferocious young tigers he was left to be the lingering victim of their feeble cruelty some as the christian poet prudentius tells us cut their tasks upon him with the steel points used in engraving writing on wax covered tablets others exercised the ingenuity of a precocious brutality by inflicting every possible torment on his lacerated body loss of blood and acute pain at length exhausted him and he fell on the floor without power to rise a shout of exultation followed new insults were inflicted and the troop of youthful demons broke loose to tell the story of their sport at their respective homes to give christians decent burial never entered into the minds of their persecutors and corvinus who had glutted his eyes with the spectacle of his vengeance and had urged on the first efforts at cruelty of his ready instruments left the expiring man where he lay to die unnoticed his faithful servant however raised him up and laid him on his bed and sent a token as he had preconcerted to pancratius who was soon at his side while his companion looked after preparations for their departure the youth was horrified at what he beheld and at the recital of his old masters exquisite torture as he was edified by the account of his patience for not a word of reproach had escaped him and prayer alone had occupied his thoughts and tongue cassianus recognized his dear pupil smiled upon him pressed his hand in his own but could not speak after lingering till morning he placidly expired the last rites of christian sepulture were modestly paid to him on the spot for the house was his and pancratius hurried from the scene with a heavy heart and a no slight rising of its indignation against the heartless savage who had devised and witnessed without remorse such a tragedy he was mistaken however no sooner was his revenge fulfilled than corvinus felt all the disgrace and shame of what he had done he feared it should be known to his father who had always esteemed cassianus he feared the anger of the parents whose children he had that day effectually demoralized and fleshed to little less than parricide he ordered his horses to be harnessed but was told they must have some more hours rest this increased his displeasure remorse tormented him and he sat down to drink and so drown care and pass time at length he started on his journey and after baiting for an hour or two pushed on through the night the road was heavy from continued rain and ran along the side of the great canal which drains the pontine marshes and between two rows of trees corvinus had drunk again at his halt and was heated with wine vexation and remorse the dragging pace of his jaded steeds provoked him and he kept lashing them furiously on while they were thus excited they heard the tramp of horses coming fast on behind and dashed forward at an uncontrollable speed the attendants were soon left at a distance and the frightened horses passed between the trees on to the narrow path by the canal and galloped forward rocking the chariot from side to side at a reckless rate the horsemen behind hearing the violent rush of hoofs and wheels and the shout of the followers clapped spurs to their horses and pushed gallantly forward they had passed the runners some way when they heard a crash and a plunge the wheel had struck the trunk of a tree the chariot had turned over and its half drunken driver had been tossed head over heels into the water in a moment pancratius was off his horse and by the side of the canal together with his companion by the faint light of the rising moon and by the sound of his voice the youth recognized corvinus struggling in the muddy stream the side was not deep but the high clayey bank was wet and slimy and every time he attempted to climb it his foot slipped and he fell back into the deep water in the middle he was in fact already becoming benumbed and exhausted by his wintry bath it would serve him right to leave him there muttered the rough centurion hush quadratus how can you say so give me hold of your hand so said the youth leaning over the bank and seizing his enemy by his arm just as he was relaxing his hold on a withered shrub and falling back fainting into the stream it would have been his last plunge they pulled him out and laid him on the road a pitiable figure for his greatest foe they chafed his temples and hands and he had begun to revive when his attendants came up to their care they consigned him together with his purse which had fallen from his belt as they drew him from the canal but pancratius took possession of his own pen knife which dropped out with it and which corvinus carried about him as evidence to convict him of having cut down the edict the servants pretended to corvinus when he had regained consciousness that they had drawn him out of the water but that his purse must have been lost in it and lay still buried in the deep mud they bore him to a neighboring cottage while the carriage was being repaired and had a good carouse with his money while he slept illustration the anchor and fish emblematic of christianity found in the catacombs two acts of revenge had been thus accomplished in one day the pagan and the christian chapter xx the public works if before the edict the therm of dioclesian were being erected by the labor and sweat of christian prisoners it will not appear surprising that their number and their sufferings should have greatly increased with the growing intensity of a most savage persecution that emperor himself was expected for the inauguration of his favorite building and hands were doubled on the work to expedite its completion chains of supposed culprits arrived each day from the port of luna from sardinia and even from the crimea or chersonesus where they had been engaged in quarries or mines and were put to labor in the harder departments of the building art to transport materials to saw and cut stone and marble to mix the mortar and to build up the walls were the duties allotted to the religious culprits many of whom were men little accustomed to such menial toil the only recompense which they received for their labor was that of the mules and oxen which shared their occupation little better if better than a stable to sleep in food sufficient in quantity to keep up their strength clothing enough to guard them from the inclemency of the season this was all they had to expect fetters on their ankles heavy chains to prevent their escape increased their sufferings and task masters acceptable in proportion as they were unreasonable watched every gang with lash or stick in hand ever ready to add pain to toil whether it were to vent their own wanton cruelty upon unresisting objects or to please their crueller masters but the christians of rome took peculiar care of these blessed confessors who were particularly venerated by them their deacons visited them by bribing their guards and young men would boldly venture among them and distribute more nourishing food or warmer clothing to them or give them the means of conciliating their keepers so as to obtain better treatment at their hands they would then also recommend themselves to their prayers as they kissed the chains and the bruises which these holy confessors bore for christ this assemblage of men convicted of serving faithfully their divine master was useful for another purpose like the stew in which the luxurious lucullus kept his lampreys ready fattened for a banquet like the cages in which rare birds the pens in which well fed cattle were preserved for the sacrifice or the feast of an imperial anniversary like the dens near the amphitheatre in which ferocious beasts were fed for exhibition at the public games just so were the public works the preserves from which at any time could be drawn the materials for a sanguinary hecatomb or a gratification of the popular appetite for cruel spectacles on any occasion of festivity public stores of food for those fierce animals whenever the roman people wished to share in their savage propensities such an occasion was now approaching the persecution had lingered no person of note had been yet captured the failures of the first day had not been fully repaired and something more wholesale was expected the people demanded more sport and an approaching imperial birthday justified their gratification the wild beasts which sebastian and pancratius had heard yet roared for their lawful prey christianos ad leones might seem to have been interpreted by them as meaning that the christians of right belonged to them one afternoon towards the end of december corvinus proceeded to the baths of dioclesian accompanied by catulus who had an eye for proper combatants in the amphitheatre such as a good dealer would have for cattle at a fair he called for rabirius the superintendent of the convict department and said to him rabirius i am come by order of the emperor to select a sufficient number of the wicked christians under your charge for the honor of fighting in the amphitheatre on occasion of the coming festival really answered the officer i have none to spare i am obliged to finish the work in a given time and i cannot do so if i am left short of hands i cannot help that others will be got to replace those that are taken from you you must walk catulus and myself through your works and let us choose those that will suit us rabirius grumbling at this unreasonable demand submitted nevertheless to it and took them into a vast area just vaulted over it was entered by a circular vestibule lighted from above like the pantheon this led into one of the shorter arms of a cruciform hall of noble dimensions into which opened a number of lesser though still handsome chambers at each angle of the hall where the arms intersected one another a huge granite pillar of one block had to be erected two were already in their places one was girt with ropes delivered round capstans ready to be raised on the morrow a number of men were actively employed in making final preparations catulus nudged corvinus and pointed with his thumb to two fine youths who stripped slave fashion to their waists were specimens of manly athletic forms i must have those two rabirius said the willing purveyor to wild beasts they will do charmingly i am sure they are christians they work so cheerfully i cannot possibly spare them at present they are worth six men or a pair of horses at least to me wait till the heavy work is over and then they are at your service what are their names that i may take a note of them and mind keep them up in good condition they are called largus and smaragdus they are young men of excellent family but work like plebeians and will go with you nothing loth they shall have their wish said corvinus with great glee and so they had later as they went through the works however they picked out a number of captives for many of whom rabirius made resistance but generally in vain at length they came near one of those chambers which flanked the eastern side of the longer arm of the hall in one of them they saw a number of convicts if we must use the term resting after their labor the centre of the group was an old man most venerable in appearance with a long white beard streaming on his breast mild in aspect gentle in word cheerful in his feeble action it was the confessor saturninus now in his eightieth year yet loaded with two heavy chains at each side were the more youthful laborers cyriacus and sisinnius of whom it is recorded that in addition to their own task work one on each side they bore up his bonds indeed we are told that their particular delight was over and above their own assigned portion of toil to help their weaker brethren and perform their work for them but their time was not yet come for both of them before they received their crowns were ordained deacons in the next pontificate several other captives lay on the ground about the old mans feet as he seated on a block of marble was talking to them with a sweet gravity which riveted their attention and seemed to make them forget their sufferings what was he saying to them was he requiting cyriacus for his extraordinary charity by telling him that in commemoration of it a portion of the immense pile which they were toiling to raise would be dedicated to god under his invocation become a title and close its line of titulars by an illustrious name or was he recounting another more glorious vision how this smaller oratory was to be superseded and absorbed by a glorious temple in honor of the queen of angels which should comprise the entire of that superb hall with its vestibule under the directing skill of the mightiest artistic genius that the world should ever see what more consoling thought could have been vouchsafed to those poor oppressed captives than that they were not so much erecting baths for the luxury of a heathen people or the prodigality of a wicked emperor as in truth building up one of the stateliest churches in which the true god is worshipped and the virgin mother who bore him incarnate is affectionately honored from a distance corvinus saw the group and pausing asked the superintendent the names of those who composed it he enumerated them readily then added you may as well take that old man if you like for he is not worth his keep as far as work goes thank you replied corvinus a pretty figure he would cut in the amphitheatre the people are not to be put off with decrepit old creatures whom a single stroke of a bears or tigers paw kills outright they like to see young blood flowing and plenty of life struggling against wounds and blows before death comes to decide the contest but there is one there whom you have not named his face is turned from us he has not the prisoners garb nor any kind of fetter who can it be i do not know his name answered rabirius but he is a fine youth who spends much of his time among the convicts relieves them and even at times helps them in their work he pays of course well for being allowed all this so it is not our business to ask questions but it is mine though said corvinus sharply and he advanced for this purpose the voice caught the strangers ear and he turned round to look illustration a monogram of christ found in the catacombs corvinus sprung upon him with the eye and action of a wild beast seized him and called out with exultation fetter him instantly this time at least pancratius thou shalt not escape chapter xxi the prison if a modern christian wishes really to know what his forefathers underwent for the faith during three centuries of persecution we would not have him content himself with visiting the catacombs as we have tried to make him do and thus learning what sort of life they were compelled to lead but we would advise him to peruse those imperishable records the acts of the martyrs which will show him how they were made to die we know of no writings so moving so tender so consoling and so ministering of strength to faith and to hope after gods inspired words as these venerable monuments and if our reader so advised have not leisure sufficient to read much upon this subject we would limit him willingly to one specimen the genuine acts of ss perpetua and felicitas it is true that they will be best read by the scholar in their plain african latinity but we trust that some one will soon give us a worthy english version of these and some other similar early christian documents the ones which we have singled out are the same as were known to st augustine and cannot be read by any one without emotion if the reader would compare the morbid sensibility and the overstrained excitement endeavored to be produced by a modern french writer in the imaginary journal of a culprit condemned to death down to the immediate approach of execution with the unaffected pathos and charming truthfulness which pervades the corresponding narrative of vivia perpetua a delicate lady of twenty one years of age he would not hesitate in concluding how much more natural graceful and interesting are the simple recitals of christianity than the boldest fictions of romance and when our minds are sad or the petty persecutions of our times incline our feeble hearts to murmur we cannot do better than turn to that really golden because truthful legend or to the history of the noble martyrs of vienne or lyons or to the many similar still extant records to nerve our courage by the contemplation of what children and women catechumens and slaves suffered unmurmuring for christ but we are wandering from our narrative pancratius with some twenty more fettered and chained together were led through the streets to prison as they were thus dragged along staggering and stumbling helplessly they were unmercifully struck by the guards who conducted them and any persons near enough to reach them dealt them blows and kicks without remorse those further off pelted them with stones or offal and assailed them with insulting ribaldry they reached the mamertine prison at last and were thrust down into it and found there already other victims of both sexes awaiting their time of sacrifice the youth had just time while he was being handcuffed to request one of the captors to inform his mother and sebastian of what had happened and he slipped his purse into his hand a prison in ancient rome was not the place to which a poor man might court committal hoping there to enjoy better fare and lodging than he did at home two or three of these dungeons for they are nothing better still remain and a brief description of the one which we have mentioned will give our readers some idea of what confessorship cost independent of martyrdom illustration the mamertine prison the mamertine prison is composed of two square subterranean chambers one below the other with only one round aperture in the centre of each vault through which alone light air food furniture and men could pass when the upper story was full we may imagine how much of the two first could reach the lower no other means of ventilation drainage or access could exist the walls of large stone blocks had or rather have rings fastened into them for securing the prisoners but many used to be laid on the floor with their feet fastened in the stocks and the ingenious cruelty of the persecutors often increased the discomfort of the damp stone floor by strewing with broken potsherds this only bed allowed to the mangled limbs and welted backs of the tortured christians hence we have in africa a company of martyrs headed by ss saturninus and dativus who all perished through their sufferings in prison and the acts of the lyonese martyrs inform us that many new comers expired in the jail killed by severities before their bodies had endured any torments while on the contrary some who returned to it so cruelly tortured that their recovery appeared hopeless without any medical or other assistance there regained their health at the same time the christians bought access to these abodes of pain but not of sorrow and furnished whatever could under such circumstances relieve the sufferings and increase the comforts temporal and spiritual of these most cherished and venerated of their brethren roman justice required at least the outward forms of trial and hence the christian captives were led from their dungeons before the tribunal where they were subjected to an interrogatory of which most precious examples have been preserved in the proconsular acts of martyrs just as they were entered by the secretary or registrar of the court when the bishop of lyons pothinus now in his ninetieth year was asked who is the god of the christians he replied with simple dignity if thou shalt be worthy thou shalt know sometimes the judge would enter into a discussion with his prisoner and necessarily get the worst of it though the latter would seldom go further with him than simply reiterating his plain profession of the christian faith often as in the case of one ptolomus beautifully recited by st justin and in that of st perpetua he was content to ask the simple question art thou a christian and upon an affirmative reply proceeded to pronounce capital sentence pancratius and his companion stood before the judge for it wanted only three days to the munus or games at which they were to fight with wild beasts what art thou he asked of one i am a christian by the help of god was the rejoinder and who art thou said the prefect to rusticus i am indeed a slave of csars answered the prisoner but becoming a christian i have been freed by christ himself and by his grace and mercy i have been made partaker of the same hope as those whom you see then turning to a holy priest lucianus venerable for his years and his virtues the judge thus addressed him come be obedient to the gods themselves and to the imperial edicts no one answered the old man can be reprehended or condemned who obeys the precepts of jesus christ our saviour what sort of learning and studies dost thou pursue i have endeavored to master every science and have tried every variety of learning but finally i adhered to the doctrines of christianity although they do not please those who follow the wanderings of false opinions wretch dost thou find delight in that learning the greatest because i follow the christians in right doctrine and what is that doctrine the right doctrine which we christians piously hold is to believe in one god the maker and creator of all things visible and invisible and to confess the lord jesus christ the son of god anciently foretold by the prophets who will come to judge mankind and is the preacher and master of salvation to those who will learn well under him i indeed as a mere man am too weak and insignificant to be able to utter any thing great of his infinite deity this office belongs to the prophets thou art methinks a master of error to others and deservest to be more severely punished than the rest let this lucianus be kept in the nerve stocks with his feet stretched to the fifth hole and you two women what are your names and condition i am a christian who have no spouse but christ my name is secunda replied the one and i am a widow named rufina professing the same saving faith continued the other at length after having put similar questions and receiving similar answers from all the others except from one wretched man who to the grief of the rest wavered and agreed to offer sacrifice the prefect turned to pancratius and thus addressed him and now insolent youth who hadst the audacity to tear down the edict of the divine emperors even for thee there shall be mercy if yet thou wilt sacrifice to the gods show thus at once thy piety and thy wisdom for thou art yet but a stripling pancratius signed himself with the sign of the saving cross and calmly replied i am the servant of christ him i acknowledge by my mouth hold firm in my heart incessantly adore this youth which you behold in me has the wisdom of grey hairs if it worship but one god but your gods with those who adore them are destined to eternal destruction strike him on the mouth for his blasphemy and beat him with rods exclaimed the angry judge i thank thee replied meekly the noble youth that thus i suffer some of the same punishment as was inflicted on my lord the prefect then pronounced sentence in the usual form lucianus pancratius rusticus and others and the women secunda and rufina who have all owned themselves christians and refuse to obey the sacred emperor or worship the gods of rome we order to be exposed to wild beasts in the flavian amphitheatre illustration the blessed virgin from a portrait found in the cemetery of st agnes the mob howled with delight and hatred and accompanied the confessors back to their prison with this rough music but they were gradually overawed by the dignity of their gait and the shining calmness of their countenances some men asserted that they must have perfumed themselves for they could perceive a fragrant atmosphere surrounding their persons chapter xxii the viaticum a true contrast to the fury and discord without was the scene within the prison peace serenity cheerfulness and joy reigned there and the rough stone walls and vaults re echoed to the chant of psalmody in which pancratius was precentor and in which depth called out to depth for the prisoners in the lower dungeon responded to those above and kept up the alternation of verses in those psalms which the circumstances naturally suggested the eve of fighting with that is being torn to pieces by wild beasts was always a day of greater liberty the friends of the intended victims were admitted to see them and the christians boldly took full advantage of the permission to flock to the prison and commend themselves to the prayers of the blessed confessors of christ at evening they were led forth to enjoy what was called the free supper that is an abundant and even luxurious public feast the table was surrounded by pagans curious to watch the conduct and looks of the morrows combatants but they could discern neither the bravado and boisterousness nor the dejection and bitterness of ordinary culprits to the guests it was truly an agape or love feast for they supped with calm joyfulness amidst cheerful conversation pancratius however once or twice reproved the unfeeling curiosity and rude remarks of the crowd saying to morrow is not sufficient for you because you love to look upon the objects of your future hatred to day you are our friends to morrow our foes but mark well our countenances that you may know them again in the day of judgment many retired at this rebuke and not a few were led by it to conversion but while the persecutors thus prepared a feast for the bodies of their victims the church their mother had been preparing a much more dainty banquet for the souls of her children they had been constantly attended on by the deacons particularly reparatus who would gladly have joined their company but his duty forbade this at present after therefore having provided as well as possible for their temporal wants he had arranged with the pious priest dionysius who still dwelt in the house of agnes to send towards evening sufficient portions of the bread of life to feed early in the morning of their battle the champions of christ although the deacons bore the consecrated elements from the principal church to others where they were only distributed by the titulars the office of conveying them to the martyrs in prison and even to the dying was committed to inferior ministers on this day that the hostile passions of heathen rome were unusually excited by the coming slaughter of so many christian victims it was a work of more than common danger to discharge this duty for the revelations of torquatus had made it known that fulvius had carefully noted all the ministers of the sanctuary and given a description of them to his numerous active spies hence they could scarcely venture out by day unless thoroughly disguised the sacred bread was prepared and the priest turned round from the altar on which it was placed to see who would be its safest bearer before any other could step forward the young acolyte tarcisius knelt at his feet with his hands extended before him ready to receive the sacred deposit with a countenance beautiful in its lovely innocence as an angels he seemed to entreat for preference and even to claim it thou art too young my child said the kind priest filled with admiration of the picture before him my youth holy father will be my best protection oh do not refuse me this great honor the tears stood in the boys eyes and his cheeks glowed with a modest emotion as he spoke these words he stretched forth his hands eagerly and his entreaty was so full of fervor and courage that the plea was irresistible the priest took the divine mysteries wrapped up carefully in a linen cloth then in an outer covering and put them on his palms saying remember tarcisius what a treasure is intrusted to thy feeble care avoid public places as thou goest along and remember that holy things must not be delivered to dogs nor pearls be cast before swine thou wilt keep safely gods sacred gifts i will die rather than betray them answered the holy youth as he folded the heavenly trust in the bosom of his tunic and with cheerful reverence started on his journey there was a gravity beyond the usual expression of his years stamped upon his countenance as he tripped lightly along the streets avoiding equally the more public and the too low thoroughfares as he was approaching the door of a large mansion its mistress a rich lady without children saw him coming and was struck with his beauty and sweetness as with arms folded on his breast he was hastening on stay one moment dear child she said putting herself in his way tell me thy name and where do thy parents live i am tarcisius an orphan boy he replied looking up smilingly and i have no home save one which it might be displeasing to thee to hear then come into my house and rest i wish to speak to thee oh that i had a child like thee not now noble lady not now i have intrusted to me a most solemn and sacred duty and i must not tarry a moment in its performance then promise to come to me to morrow this is my house if i am alive i will answered the boy with a kindled look which made him appear to her as a messenger from a higher sphere she watched him a long time and after some deliberation determined to follow him soon however she heard a tumult with horrid cries which made her pause on her way until they had ceased when she went on again in the meantime tarcisius with his thoughts fixed on better things than her inheritance hastened on and shortly came into an open space where boys just escaped from school were beginning to play we just want one to make up the game where shall we get him said their leader capital exclaimed another here comes tarcisius whom i have not seen for an age he used to be an excellent hand at all sports come tarcisius he added stopping him by seizing his arm whither so fast take a part in our game thats a good fellow i cant petilius now i really cant i am going on business of great importance but you shall exclaimed the first speaker a strong and bullying youth laying hold of him i will have no sulking when i want any thing done so come join us at once i entreat you said the poor boy feelingly do let me go no such thing replied the other what is that you seem to be carrying so carefully in your bosom a letter i suppose well it will not addle by being for half an hour out of its nest give it to me and i will put it by safe while we play and he snatched at the sacred deposit in his breast never never answered the child looking up towards heaven i will see it insisted the other rudely i will know what is this wonderful secret and he commenced pulling him roughly about a crowd of men from the neighborhood soon got round and all asked eagerly what was the matter they saw a boy who with folded arms seemed endowed with a supernatural strength as he resisted every effort of one much bigger and stronger to make him reveal what he was bearing cuffs pulls blows kicks seemed to have no effect he bore them all without a murmur or an attempt to retaliate but he unflinchingly kept his purpose what is it what can it be one began to ask the other when fulvius chanced to pass by and joined the circle round the combatants he at once recognized tarcisius having seen him at the ordination and being asked as a better dressed man the same question he replied contemptuously as he turned on his heel what is it why only a christian ass bearing the mysteries this was enough fulvius while he scorned such unprofitable prey knew well the effect of his word heathen curiosity to see the mysteries of the christians revealed and to insult them was aroused and a general demand was made to tarcisius to yield up his charge never with life was his only reply a heavy blow from a smiths fist nearly stunned him while the blood flowed from the wound another and another followed till covered with bruises but with his arms crossed fast upon his breast he fell heavily on the ground the mob closed upon him and were just seizing him to tear open his thrice holy trust when they felt themselves pushed aside right and left by some giant strength some went reeling to the further side of the square others were spun round and round they knew not how till they fell where they were and the rest retired before a tall athletic officer who was the author of this overthrow he had no sooner cleared the ground than he was on his knees and with tears in his eyes raised up the bruised and fainting boy as tenderly as a mother could have done and in most gentle tones asked him are you much hurt tarcisius never mind me quadratus answered he opening his eyes with a smile but i am carrying the divine mysteries take care of them the soldier raised the boy in his arms with tenfold reverence as if bearing not only the sweet victim of a youthful sacrifice a martyrs relics but the very king and lord of martyrs and the divine victim of eternal salvation the childs head leaned in confidence on the stout soldiers neck but his arms and hands never left their watchful custody of the confided gift and his gallant bearer felt no weight in the hallowed double burden which he carried no one stopped him till a lady met him and stared amazedly at him she drew nearer and looked closer at what he carried is it possible she exclaimed with terror is that tarcisius whom i met a few moments ago so fair and lovely who can have done this madam replied quadratus they have murdered him because he was a christian the lady looked for an instant on the childs countenance he opened his eyes upon her smiled and expired from that look came the light of faith she hastened to be a christian likewise the venerable dionysius could hardly see for weeping as he removed the childs hands and took from his bosom unviolated the holy of holies and he thought he looked more like illustration is it possible she exclaimed with terror is that tarcisius whom i met a few moments ago so fair and lovely an angel now sleeping the martyrs slumber than he did when living scarcely an hour before quadratus himself bore him to the cemetery of callistus where he was buried amidst the admiration of older believers and later the holy pope damasus composed for him an epitaph which no one can read without concluding that the belief in the real presence of our lords body in the blessed eucharist was the same then as now tarcisium sanctum christi sacramenta gerentem cum male sana manus peteret vulgare profanis ipse animam potius voluit dimittere csus prodere quam canibus rabidis clestia membra he is mentioned in the roman martyrology on the th of august as commemorated in the cemetery of callistus whence his relics were in due time translated to the church of st sylvester in campo as an old inscription declares news of this occurrence did not reach the prisoners till after their feast and perhaps the alarm that they were to be deprived of the spiritual food to which they looked forward for strength was the only one that could have overcast even slightly the serenity of their souls at this moment sebastian entered and perceived at once that some unpleasant news had arrived and as quickly divined what it was for quadratus had already informed him of all he cheered up therefore the confessors of christ assured them that they should not be deprived of their coveted food then whispered a few words to reparatus the deacon who flew out immediately with a look of bright intelligence sebastian being known to the guards had passed freely in and out of the prison daily and had been indefatigable in his care of its inmates but now he was come to take his last farewell of his dearest friend pancratius who had longed for this interview they drew to one side when the youth began well sebastian do you remember when we heard the wild beasts roar from your window and looked at the many gaping arches of the amphitheatre as open for the christians triumph yes my dear boy i remember that evening well and it seemed to me as if your heart anticipated then the scenes that await you to morrow it did in truth i felt an inward assurance that i should be one of the first to appease the roaring fury of those deputies of human cruelty but now that the time is come i can hardly believe myself worthy of so immense an honor what can i have done sebastian not indeed to deserve it but to be chosen out as the object of so great a grace you know pancratius that it is not he who willeth nor he that runneth but god who hath mercy that maketh the election but tell me rather how do you now feel about to morrows glorious destiny to tell the truth it seems to me so magnificent so far beyond my right to claim that sometimes it appears more like a vision than a certainty does it not sound almost incredible to you that i who this night am in a cold dark and dismal prison shall be before another sun has set listening to the harping of angelic lyres walking in the procession of white robed saints inhaling the perfume of celestial incense and drinking from the crystal waters of the stream of life is it not too like what one may read or hear about another but hardly dares to think is to be in a few hours real of himself and nothing more than you have described pancratius oh yes far more far more than one can name without presumption that i a boy just come out of school who have done nothing for christ as yet should be able to say sometime to morrow i shall see him face to face and adore him and shall receive from him a palm and a crown yea and an affectionate embrace i feel is so like a beautiful hope that it startles me to think it will soon be that no longer and yet sebastian he continued fervently seizing both his friends hands it is true it is true and more still pancratius yes sebastian more still and more to close ones eyes upon the faces of men and open them in full gaze on the face of god to shut them upon ten thousand countenances scowling on you with hatred contempt and fury from every step of the amphitheatre and unclose them instantly upon that one sunlike intelligence whose splendor would dazzle or scorch did not its beams surround and embrace and welcome us to dart them at once into the furnace of gods heart and plunge into its burning ocean of mercy and love without fear of destruction surely sebastian it sounds like presumption in me to say that to morrow nay hush the watchman from the capitol is proclaiming midnight that to day to day i shall enjoy all this happy pancratius exclaimed the soldier you anticipate already by some hours the raptures to come and do you know dear sebastian continued the youth as if unconscious of the interruption it looks to me so good and merciful in god to grant me such a death how much more willingly must one at my age face it when it puts an end to all that is hateful on earth when it extinguishes but the sight of hideous beasts and sinning men scarcely less frightful than they and hushes only the fiend like yells of both how much more trying would it be to part with the last tender look of a mother like mine and shut ones ears to the sweet plaint of her patient voice true i shall see her and hear her for the last time as we have arranged to day before my fight but i know she will not unnerve me a tear had made its way into the affectionate boys eye but he suppressed it and said with a gay tone but sebastian you have not fulfilled your promise your double promise to me to tell me the secrets you concealed from me this is your last opportunity so come let me know all do you remember well what the secrets were right well indeed for they have much perplexed me first on that night of the meeting in your apartments you said there was one motive strong enough to check your ardent desire to die for christ and lately you refused to give me your reason for despatching me hastily to campania and joined this secret to the other how i cannot conceive yet they form but one i had promised to watch over your true welfare pancratius it was a duty of friendship and love that i had assumed i saw your eagerness after martyrdom i knew the ardent temperament of your youthful heart i dreaded lest you should commit yourself by some over daring action which might tarnish even as lightly as a breath does finely tempered steel the purity of your desire or tip with a passing blight one single leaf of your palm i determined therefore to restrain my own earnest longings till i had seen you safe through danger was this right oh it was too kind of you dear sebastian it was nobly kind but how is this connected with my journey if i had not sent you away you would have been seized for your boldly tearing down the edict or your rebuke of the judge in his court you would have been certainly condemned and illustration each one approaching devoutly and with tears of gratitude received from his consecrated hand his share that is the whole of the mystical food would have suffered for christ but your sentence would have proclaimed a different and a civil offence that of rebellion against the emperors and moreover my dear boy you would have been singled out for a triumph you would have been pointed at by the very heathens with honor as a gallant and daring youth you might have been disturbed even in your conflict by a transient cloud of pride at any rate you would have been spared that ignominy which forms the distinctive merit and the special glory of dying for simply being a christian quite true sebastian said pancratius with a blush but when i saw you continued the soldier taken in the performance of a generous act of charity towards the confessors of christ when i saw you dragged through the streets chained to a galley slave as a common culprit when i saw you pelted and hooted like other believers when i heard sentence pronounced on you in common with the rest because you are a christian and for nothing else i felt that my task was ended i would not have raised a finger to save you how like gods love has yours been to me so wise so generous and so unsparing sobbed out pancratius as he threw himself on the soldiers neck then continued promise me one thing more that this day you will keep near me to the end and will secure my last legacy to my mother even if it cost my life i will not fail we shall not be parted long pancratius the deacon now gave notice that all was ready for offering up the holy oblation in the dungeon itself the two youths looked round and pancratius was indeed amazed the holy priest lucianus was laid stretched on the floor with his limbs painfully distended in the catasta or stocks so that he could not rise upon his breast reparatus had spread the three linen cloths requisite for the altar on them was laid the unleavened bread and the mingled chalice which the deacon steadied with his hand the head of the aged priest was held up as he read the accustomed prayers and performed the prescribed ceremonies of the oblation and consecration and then each one approaching devoutly and with tears of gratitude received from his consecrated hand his share that is the whole of the mystical food marvellous and beautiful instance of the power of adaptation in gods church fixed as are her laws her ingenious love finds means through their very relaxation to demonstrate their principles nay the very exception presents only a sublimer application of them here was a minister of god and a dispenser of his mysteries who for once was privileged to be more than others like him whom he represented at once the priest and the altar the church prescribed that the holy sacrifice should be offered only over the relics of martyrs here was a martyr by a singular prerogative permitted to offer it over his own body yet living he lay beneath the feet of god the bosom still heaved and the heart panted under the divine mysteries it is true but that was only part of the action of the minister while self was already dead and the sacrifice of life was in all but act completed in him there was only christs life within and without the sanctuary of the breast was ever viaticum for martyrs more worthily prepared chapter xxiii the fight the morning broke light and frosty and the sun glittering on the gilded ornaments of the temples and other public buildings seemed to array them in holiday splendor and the people too soon came forth into the streets in their gayest attire decked out with unusual richness the various streams converge towards the flavian amphitheatre now better known by the name of the coliseum each one directs his steps to the arch indicated by the number of his ticket and thus the huge monster keeps sucking in by degrees that stream of life which soon animates and enlivens its oval tiers over tiers of steps till its interior is tapestried all round with human faces and its walls seem to rock and wave to and fro by the swaying of the living mass and after this shall have been gorged with blood and inflamed with fury it will melt once more and rush out in a thick continuous flow through the many avenues by which it entered now bearing their fitting name of vomitoria for never did a more polluted stream of the dregs and pests of humanity issue from an unbecoming reservoir through ill assorted channels than the roman mob drunk with the blood of martyrs gushing forth from the pores of the splendid amphitheatre the emperor came to the games surrounded by his court with all the pomp and circumstance which befitted an imperial festival keen as any of his subjects to witness the cruel games and to feed his eyes with a feast of carnage his throne was on the eastern side of the amphitheatre where a large space called the pulvinar was reserved and richly decorated for the imperial court illustration the coliseum various sports succeeded one another and many a gladiator killed or wounded had sprinkled the bright sand with blood when the people eager for fiercer combats began to call or roar for the christians and the wild beasts it is time therefore for us to think of our captives before the citizens were astir they had been removed from the prison to a strong chamber called the spoliatorium the press room where their fetters and chains were removed an attempt was made to dress them gaudily as heathen priests and priestesses but they resisted urging that as they had come spontaneously to the fight it was unfair to make them appear in a disguise which they abhorred during the early part of the day they remained thus together encouraging one another and singing the divine praises in spite of the shouts which drowned their voices from time to time while they were thus engaged corvinus entered and with a look of insolent triumph thus accosted pancratius thanks to the gods the day is come which i have long desired it has been a tiresome and tough struggle between us who should fall uppermost i have won it how sayest thou corvinus when and how have i contended with thee always every where thou hast haunted me in my dreams thou hast danced before me like a meteor and i have tried in vain to grasp thee thou hast been my tormentor my evil genius i have hated thee devoted thee to the infernal gods cursed thee and loathed thee and now my day of vengeance is come methinks replied pancratius smiling this does not look like a combat it has been all on one side for i have done none of these things towards thee no thinkest thou that i believe thee when thou hast lain ever as a viper on my path to bite my heel and overthrow me where i again ask every where i repeat at school in the lady agness house in the forum in the cemetery in my fathers own court at chromatiuss villa yes every where and nowhere else but where thou hast named when thy chariot was dashed furiously along the appian way didst thou not hear the tramp of horses hoofs trying to overtake thee wretch exclaimed the prefects son in a fury and was it thy accursed steed which purposely urged forward frightened mine and nearly caused my death no corvinus hear me calmly it is the last time we shall speak together i was travelling quietly with a companion towards rome after having paid the last rites to our master cassianus corvinus winced for he knew not this before when i heard the clatter of a runaway chariot and then indeed i put spurs to my horse and it is well for thee that i did how so because i reached thee just in time when thy strength was nearly exhausted and thy blood almost frozen by repeated plunges in the cold canal and when thy arm already benumbed had let go its last stay and thou wast falling backwards for the last time into the water i saw thee i knew thee as i took hold of thee insensible i had in my grasp the murderer of one most dear to me divine justice seemed to have overtaken him there was only my will between him and his doom it was my day of vengeance and i fully gratified it ha and how pray by drawing thee out and laying thee on the bank and chafing thee till thy heart resumed its functions and then consigning thee to thy servants rescued from death thou liest screamed corvinus my servants told me that they drew me out and did they give thee my knife together with thy leopard skin purse which i found on the ground after i had dragged thee forth no they said the purse was lost in the canal it was a leopard skin purse the gift of an african sorceress what sayest thou of the knife that it is here see it still rusty with the water thy purse i gave to thy slaves my own knife i retained for myself look at it again dost thou believe me now have i been always a viper on thy path too ungenerous to acknowledge that he had been conquered in the struggle between them corvinus only felt himself withered degraded before his late school fellow crumbled like a clot of dust in his hands his very heart seemed to him to blush he felt sick and staggered hung down his head and sneaked away he cursed the games the emperor the yelling rabble the roaring beasts his horses and chariot his slaves his father himself every thing and every body except one he could not for his life curse pancratius he had reached the door when the youth called him back he turned and looked at him with a glance of respect almost approaching to love pancratius put his hand on his arm and said corvinus i have freely forgiven thee there is one above who cannot forgive without repentance seek pardon from him if not i foretell to thee this day that by whatsoever death i die thou too shalt one day perish corvinus slunk away and appeared no more that day he lost the sight on which his coarse imagination had gloated for days which he had longed for during months when the holiday was over he was found by his father completely intoxicated it was the only way he knew of drowning remorse as he was leaving the prisoners the lanista or master of the gladiators entered the room and summoned them to the combat they hastily embraced one another and took leave on earth they entered the arena or pit of the amphitheatre opposite the imperial seat and had to pass between two files of venatores or huntsmen who had the care of the wild beasts each armed with a heavy whip wherewith he inflicted a blow on every one as he went by him they were then brought forward singly or in groups as the people desired or the directors of the spectacle chose sometimes the intended prey was placed on an elevated platform to be more conspicuous at another time he was tied up to posts to be more helpless a favorite sport was to bundle up a female victim in a net and expose her to be rolled tossed or gored by wild cattle one encounter with a single wild beast often finished the martyrs course while occasionally three or four were successively let loose without their inflicting a mortal wound the confessor was then either remanded to prison for further torments or taken back to the spoliatorium where the gladiators apprentices amused themselves with despatching him but we must content ourselves with following the last steps of our youthful hero pancratius as he was passing through the corridor that led to the amphitheatre he saw sebastian standing on one side with a lady closely enwrapped in her mantle and veiled he at once recognized her stopped before her knelt and taking her hand affectionately kissed it bless me dear mother he said in this your promised hour see my child the heavens she replied and look up thither where christ with his saints expecteth thee fight the good fight for thy souls sake and show thyself faithful and steadfast in thy saviours love remember him too whose precious relic thou bearest round thy neck its price shall be doubled in thine eyes my sweet mother ere many hours are over on on and let us have none of this fooling exclaimed the lanista adding a stroke of his cane lucina retreated while sebastian pressed the hand of her son and whispered in his ear courage dearest boy may god bless you i shall be close behind the emperor give me a last look there and your blessing ha ha ha broke out a fiendish tone close behind him was it a demons laugh he looked behind and caught only a glimpse of a fluttering cloak rounding a pillar who could it be he guessed not it was fulvius who in those words had got the last link in a chain of evidence that he had long been weaving that sebastian was certainly a christian pancratius soon stood in the midst of the arena the last of the faithful band he had been reserved in hopes that the sight of others sufferings might shake his constancy but the effect had been the reverse he took his stand where he was placed and his yet delicate frame contrasted with the swarthy and brawny limbs of the executioners who surrounded him they now left him alone and we cannot better describe him than eusebius an eye witness does a youth a few years older you might have seen a tender youth who had not yet entered his twentieth year standing without fetters with his hands stretched forth in the form of a cross and praying to god most attentively with a fixed and untrembling heart not retiring from the place where he first stood nor swerving the least while bears and leopards breathing fury and death in their very snort were just rushing on to tear his limbs in pieces and yet i know not how their jaws seemed seized and closed by some divine and mysterious power and they drew altogether back such was the attitude and such the privilege of our heroic youth the mob were frantic as they saw one wild beast after another careering madly round him roaring and lashing its sides with its tail while he seemed placed in a charmed circle which they could not approach a furious bull let loose upon him dashed madly forward with his neck bent down then stopped suddenly as though he had struck his head against a wall pawed the ground and scattered the dust around him bellowing fiercely provoke him thou coward roared out still louder the enraged emperor pancratius awoke as from a trance and waving his arms ran towards his enemy but the savage brute as if a lion had been rushing on him turned round and ran away towards the entrance where meeting his keeper he tossed him high into the air all were disconcerted except the brave youth who had resumed his attitude of prayer when one of the crowd shouted out he has a charm round his neck he is a sorcerer the whole multitude re echoed the cry till the emperor having commanded silence called out to him take that amulet from thy neck and cast it from thee or it shall be done more roughly for thee sire replied the youth with a musical voice that rang sweetly through the hushed amphitheatre it is no charm that i wear but a memorial of my father who in this very place made gloriously the same confession which i now humbly make i am a christian and for love of jesus christ god and man i gladly give my life do not take from me this only legacy which i have bequeathed richer than i received it to another try once more it was a panther which gave him his crown perhaps it will bestow the same on me for an instant there was dead silence the multitude seemed softened won the graceful form of the gallant youth his now inspired countenance the thrilling music of his voice the intrepidity of his speech and his generous self devotion to his cause had wrought upon that cowardly herd pancratius felt it and his heart quailed before their mercy more than before their rage he had promised himself heaven that day was he to be disappointed tears started into his eyes as stretching forth his arms once more in the form of a cross he called aloud in a tone that again vibrated through every heart to day oh yes to day most blessed lord is the appointed day of thy coming tarry not longer enough has thy power been shown in me to them that believe not in thee show now thy mercy to me who in thee believe illustration pancratius was still standing in the same place facing the emperor apparently so absorbed in higher thoughts as not to heed the movements of his enemy the panther shouted out a voice the panther responded twenty the panther thundered forth a hundred thousand in a chorus like the roaring of an avalanche a cage started up as if by magic from the midst of the sand and as it rose its side fell down and freed the captive of the desert with one graceful bound the elegant savage gained its liberty and though enraged by darkness confinement and hunger it seemed almost playful as it leaped and turned about frisked and gambolled noiselessly on the sand at last it caught sight of its prey all its feline cunning and cruelty seemed to return and to conspire together in animating the cautious and treacherous movements of its velvet clothed frame the whole amphitheatre was as silent as if it had been a hermits dell while every eye was intent watching the stealthy approaches of the sleek brute to its victim pancratius was still standing in the same place facing the emperor apparently so absorbed in higher thoughts as not to heed the movements of his enemy the panther had stolen round him as if disdaining to attack him except in front crouching upon its breast slowly advancing one paw before another it had gained its measured distance and there it lay for some moments of breathless suspense a deep snarling growl an elastic spring through the air and it was seen gathered up like a leech with its hind feet on the chest and its fangs and fore claws on the throat of the martyr he stood erect for a moment brought his right hand to his mouth and looking up at sebastian with a smile directed to him by a graceful wave of his arm the last salutation of his lips and fell the arteries of the neck had been severed and the slumber of martyrdom at once settled on his eyelids his blood softened brightened enriched and blended inseparably with that of his father which lucina had hung about his neck the mothers sacrifice had been accepted illustration a lamp bearing a monogram of christ found in the catacombs chapter xxiv the christian soldier the body of the young martyr was deposited in peace on the aurelian way in the cemetery which soon bore his name and gave it as we have before observed to the neighboring gate in times of peace a basilica was raised over his tomb and yet stands to perpetuate his honor the persecution now increased its fury and multiplied its daily victims many whose names have appeared in our pages especially the community of chromatiuss villa rapidly fell the first was zo whose dumbness sebastian had cured she was surprised by a heathen rabble praying at st peters tomb and was hurried to trial and hung with her head over a smoky fire till she died her husband with three others of the same party was taken repeatedly tortured and beheaded tranquillinus the father of marcus and marcellianus jealous of zos crown prayed openly at st pauls tomb he was taken and summarily stoned to death his twin sons suffered also a cruel death the treachery of torquatus by his describing his former companions especially the gallant tiburtius who was now beheaded greatly facilitated this wholesale destruction sebastian moved in the midst of this slaughter not like a builder who saw his work destroyed by a tempest nor a shepherd who beheld his flock borne off by marauders he felt as a general on the battle field who looked only to the victory counting every one as glorious who gave his life in its purchase and as ready to give his own should it prove to be the required price every friend that fell before him was a bond less to earth and a link more to heaven a care less below a claim more above he sometimes sat lonely or paused silently on the spots where he had conversed with pancratius recalling to mind the buoyant cheerfulness the graceful thoughts and the unconscious virtue of the amiable and comely youth but he never felt as if they were more separated than when he sent him on his expedition to campania he had redeemed his pledge to him and now it was soon to be his own turn he knew it well he felt the grace of martyrdom swelling in his breast and in tranquil certainty he awaited its hour his preparation was simple whatever he had of value he distributed to the poor and he settled his property by sale beyond the reach of confiscation fulvius had picked up his fair share of christian spoils but on the whole he had been disappointed he had not been obliged to ask for assistance from the emperor whose presence he avoided but he had put nothing by he was not getting rich every evening he had to bear the reproachful and scornful interrogatory of eurotas on the days success now however he told his stern master for such he had become that he was going to strike at higher game the emperors favorite officer who must have made a large fortune in the service he had not long to wait for his opportunity on the th of january a court was held attended of course by all aspirants for favors or fearers of imperial wrath fulvius was there and as usual met with a cold reception but after bearing silently the muttered curses of the royal brute he boldly advanced dropped on one knee and thus addressed him sire your divinity has often reproached me with having made by my discoveries but a poor return for your gracious countenance and liberal subsidies but now i have found out the foulest of plots and the basest of ingratitudes in immediate contact with your divine person what dost thou mean booby asked impatiently the tyrant speak at once or ill have the words pulled out of thy throat by an iron hook fulvius rose and directing his hand in accompaniment to his words said with a bitter blandness of tone sebastian is a christian the emperor started from his throne in fury thou liest villain thou shalt prove thy words or thou shalt die such a piecemeal death as no christian dog ever endured i have sufficient proof recorded here he replied producing a parchment and offering it kneeling the emperor was about to make an angry answer when to his utter amazement sebastian with unruffled looks and noble mien stood before him and in the calmest accents said my liege i spare you all trouble of proof i am a christian and i glory in the name as maximian a rude though clever soldier without education could hardly when calm express himself in decent latin when he was in a passion his language was composed of broken sentences mingled with every vulgar and coarse epithet in this state he was now and he poured out on sebastian a torrent of abuse in which he reproached him with every crime and called him by every opprobrious name within his well stocked repertory of vituperation the two crimes however on which he rung his loudest changes were ingratitude and treachery he had nursed he said a viper in his bosom a scorpion an evil demon and he only wondered he was still alive the christian officer stood the volley as intrepidly as ever he had borne the enemys assault on the field of battle listen to me my royal master he replied perhaps for the last time i have said i am a christian and in this you have had the best pledge of your security how do you mean ungrateful man thus noble emperor that if you want a body guard around you of men who will spill their last drop of lifes blood for you go to the prison and take the christians from the stocks on the floor and from the fetter rings on the walls send to the courts and bear away the mutilated confessors from the rack and the gridiron issue orders to the amphitheatres and snatch the mangled half that lives from the jaws of tigers restore them to such shape as yet they are capable of put weapons into their hands and place them around you and in this maimed and ill favored host there will be more fidelity more loyalty more daring for you than in all your dacian and pannonian legions you have taken half their blood from them and they will give you willingly the other half folly and madness returned the sneering savage i would sooner surround myself with wolves than with christians your treachery proves enough for me and what would have prevented me at any time from acting the traitor if i had been one have i not had access to your royal person by night as by day and have i proved a traitor no emperor none has ever been more faithful than i to you but i have another and a higher lord to serve one who will judge us both and his laws i must obey rather than yours and why have you like a coward concealed your religion to escape perhaps the bitter death you have deserved no sire no more coward than traitor no one better than yourself knows that i am neither so long as i could do any good to my brethren i refused not to live amidst their carnage and my afflictions but hope had at last died within me and i thank fulvius with all my heart for having by his accusation spared me the embarrassment of choice between seeking death or enduring life i will decide that point for you death is your award and a slow lingering one it shall be but he added in a lower tone as if speaking to himself this must not get out all must be done quietly at home or treachery will spread here quadratus take your christian tribune under arrest do you hear dolt why do you not move because i too am a christian another burst of fury another storm of vile language which ended in the stout centurions being ordered at once to execution but sebastian was to be differently dealt with order hyphax to come hither roared the tyrant in a few minutes a tall half naked numidian made his appearance a bow of immense length a gaily painted quiver full of arrows and a short broad sword were at once the ornaments and the weapons of the captain of the african archers he stood erect before the emperor like a handsome bronze statue with bright enamelled eyes hyphax i have a job for you to morrow morning it must be well done said the emperor perfectly sire replied the dusky chief with a grin which showed another set of enamels in his face you see the captain sebastian the negro bowed assent he turns out to be a christian if hyphax had been on his native soil and had trodden suddenly on a hooded asp or a scorpions nest he could not have started more the thought of being so near a christian to him who worshipped every abomination believed every absurdity practised every lewdness committed any atrocity maximian proceeded and hyphax kept time to every member of his sentences by a nod and what he meant to be a smile it was hardly an earthly one you will take sebastian to your quarters and early to morrow morning not this evening mind for i know that by this time of day you are all drunk but to morrow morning when your hands are steady you will tie him to a tree in the grove of adonis and you will slowly shoot him to death slowly mind none of your fine shots straight through the heart or the brain but plenty of arrows till he die exhausted by pain and loss of blood do you understand me then take him off at once and mind silence or else illustration a monogram of christ found in the catacombs chapter xxv the rescue in spite of every attempt at concealment the news was soon spread among all connected with the court that sebastian had been discovered to be a christian and was to be shot to death on the morrow but on none did the double intelligence make such an impression as on fabiola sebastian a christian she said to herself the noblest purest wisest of romes nobility a member of that vile stupid sect impossible yet the fact seems certain have i then been deceived was he not that which he seemed was he a mean impostor who affected virtue but was secretly a libertine impossible too yes this was indeed impossible she had certain proofs of it he knew that he might have had her hand and fortune for the asking and he had acted most generously and most delicately towards her he was what he seemed that she was sure not gilded but gold then how account for this phenomenon of a christian being all that was good virtuous amiable one solution never occurred to fabiolas mind that he was all this because he was a christian she only saw the problem in another form how could he be all that he was in spite of being a christian she turned it variously in her mind in vain then it came to her thought thus perhaps after all good old chromatius was right and christianity may not be what i have fancied and i ought to have inquired more about it i am sure sebastian never did the horrible things imputed to christians yet every body charges them with them might there not be a more refined form of this religion and a more grovelling one just as she knew there was in her own sect epicureanism one coarse material wallowing in the very mire of sensualism the other refined sceptical and reflective sebastian would belong to the higher class and despise and loathe the superstitions and vices of the commoner christians such a hypothesis might be tenable but it was hard to reconcile to her intellect how a man like that noble soldier could any way have belonged to that hated race and yet he was ready to die for their faith as to zo and the others she had heard nothing for she had only returned the day before from a journey made into campania to arrange her fathers affairs what a pity she thought that she had not talked more to sebastian on such subjects but it was now too late to morrow morning he would be no more this second thought came with the sharp pang of a shaft shot into her heart she felt as if she personally were about to suffer a loss as if sebastians fate were going to fall on some one closely bound to her by some secret and mysterious tie her thoughts grew darker and sadder as she dwelt on these ideas amidst the deepening gloom she was suddenly disturbed by the entrance of a slave with a light it was afra the black servant who came to prepare her mistresss evening repast which she wished to take alone while busy with her arrangements she said have you heard the news madam what news only that sebastian is going to be shot with arrows to morrow morning what a pity he was such a handsome youth be silent afra unless you have some information to give me on the subject oh of course my mistress and my information is indeed very astonishing do you know that he turns out to be one of those wretched christians hold your peace i pray you and do not prate any more about what you do not understand certainly not if you so wish it i suppose his fate is quite a matter of indifference to you madam it certainly is to me he wont be the first officer that my countrymen have shot many they have killed and some they have saved but of course that was all chance there was a significance in her words and tones which did not escape the quick ear and mind of fabiola she looked up for the first time and fixed her eyes searchingly on her maids swarthy face there was no emotion in it she was placing a flagon of wine upon the table just as if she had not spoken at length the lady said to her afra what do you mean oh nothing nothing what can a poor slave know still more what can she do come come you meant by your words something that i must know the slave came round the table close to the couch on which fabiola rested looked behind her and around her then whispered do you want sebastians life preserved fabiola almost leaped up as she replied certainly the servant put her finger to her lip to enforce silence and said it will cost dear name your price a hundred sestertia and my liberty i accept your terms but what is my security for them they shall be binding only if twenty four hours after the execution he is still alive agreed and what is yours your word lady go afra lose not a moment there is no hurry quietly replied the slave as she completed unflurried the preparations for supper she then proceeded at once to the palace and to the mauritanian quarters and went in directly to the commander what dost thou want jubala he said at this hour there is no festival to night i know hyphax but i have important business with thee what is it about about thee about myself and about thy prisoner look at him there said the barbarian pointing across the court which his door commanded you would not think that he is going to be shot to morrow see how soundly he sleeps he could not do so better if he were going to be married instead as thou and i hyphax intend to be the next day come not quite so fast there are certain conditions to be fulfilled first well what are they first thy manumission i cannot marry a slave that is secured secondly a dowry a good dowry mind for i never wanted money more than now that is safe too how much dost thou expect certainly not less than three hundred pounds i bring thee six hundred excellent where didst thou get all this cash whom hast thou robbed whom hast thou poisoned my admirable priestess why wait till after to morrow let it be to morrow to night if it please thee be quiet now hyphax the money is all lawful gain but it has its conditions too i said i came to speak about the prisoner also well what has he to do with our approaching nuptials a great deal what now he must not die the captain looked at her with a mixture of fury and stupidity he seemed on the point of laying violent hands on her but she stood intrepid and unmoved before him and seemed to command him by the strong fascination of her eye as one of the serpents of their native land might do a vulture art mad he at last exclaimed thou mightest as well at once ask for my head if thou hadst seen the emperors face when he issued his orders thou wouldst have known he will have no trifling with him here pshaw pshaw man of course the prisoner will appear dead and will be reported as dead and if he finally recover his fellow christians will take care to keep him out of the way didst thou say twenty four hours alive i wish thou hadst made it twelve well but i know that thou canst calculate close let him die in the twenty fifth hour for what i care it is impossible jubala impossible he is too important a person very well then there is an end to our bargain the money is given only on this condition six hundred pounds thrown away and she turned off to go stay stay said hyphax eagerly the demon of covetousness coming uppermost let us see why my fellows will consume half the money in bribes and feasting well i have two hundred more in reserve for that sayest thou so my princess my sorceress my charming demon but that will be too much for my scoundrels we will give them half and add the other half to our marriage settlements shant we as it pleases thee provided the thing is done according to my proposal it is a bargain then he shall live twenty four hours and after that we will have a glorious wedding sebastian in the meantime was unconscious of these amiable negotiations for his safety for like peter between two guards he was slumbering soundly by the wall of the court fatigued with his days work he had enjoyed the rare advantage of retiring early to rest and the marble pavement was a good enough soldiers bed but after a few hours repose he awoke refreshed and now that all was hushed he silently rose and with outstretched arms gave himself up to prayer the martyrs prayer is not a preparation for death for his is a death that needs no preparation the soldier who suddenly declares himself a christian bends down his head and mingles his blood with that of the confessor whom he had come to execute or the friend of unknown name who salutes the martyr going to death is seized and made to bear him willing company is as prepared for martyrdom as he who has passed months in prison engaged in prayer it is not a cry therefore for the forgiveness of past sin for there is a consciousness of that perfect love which sendeth out fear an inward assurance of that highest grace which is incompatible with sin nor in sebastian was it a prayer for courage or strength for the opposite feeling which could suggest it was unknown to him it never entered into his mind to doubt that as he had faced death intrepidly for his earthly sovereign on the battle field so he should meet it joyfully for his heavenly lord in any place his prayer then till morning was a gladsome hymn of glory and honor to the king of kings a joining with the seraphs glowing eyes and ever shaking wings in restless homage then when the stars in the bright heavens caught his eyes he challenged them as wakeful sentinels like himself to exchange the watchword of divine praises and as the night wind rustled in the leafless trees of the neighboring court of adonis he bade its wayward music compose itself and its rude harping upon the vibrating boughs form softer hymns the only ones that earth could utter in its winter night hours now burst on him the thrilling thought that the morning hour approached for the cock had crowed and he would soon hear those branches murmuring over him to the sharp whistle of flying arrows unerring in their aim and he offered himself gladly to their sharp tongues hissing as the serpents to drink his blood he offered himself as an oblation for gods honor and for the appeasing of his wrath he offered himself particularly for the afflicted church and prayed that his death might mitigate her sufferings and then his thoughts rose higher from the earthly to the celestial church soaring like the eagle from the highest pinnacle of the mountain peak towards the sun clouds have rolled away and the blue embroidered veil of morning is rent in twain like the sanctuarys and he sees quite into its revealed depths far far inwards beyond senates of saints and legions of angels to what stephen saw of inmost and intensest glory and now his hymn was silent harmonies came to him too sweet and perfect to brook the jarring of a terrestrial voice they came to him requiring no return for they brought heaven into his soul and what could he give back it was as a fountain of purest refreshment more like gushing light than water flowing from the foot of the lamb and poured into his heart which could only be passive and receive the gift yet in its sparkling bounds as it rippled along towards him he could see the countenance now of one and then of another of the happy friends who had gone before him as if they were drinking and bathing and disporting and plunging and dissolving themselves in those living waters his countenance was glowing as with the very reflection of the vision and the morning dawn just brightening oh what a dawn that is caught his face as he stood up with his arms in a cross opposite the east so that when hyphax opened his door and saw him he could have crept across the court and worshipped him on his face sebastian awoke as from a trance and the chink of sesterces sounded in the mental ears of hyphax so he set scientifically about earning them he picked out of his troop of a hundred five marksmen who could split a flying arrow with a fleeter one called them into his room told them their reward concealing his own share and arranged how the execution was to be managed as to the body christians had already secretly offered a large additional sum for its delivery and two slaves were to wait outside to receive it among his own followers he could fully depend on secrecy sebastian was conducted into the neighboring court of the palace which separated the quarters of these african archers from his own dwelling it was planted with rows of trees and consecrated to adonis he walked cheerfully in the midst of his executioners followed by the whole band who were alone allowed to be spectators as they would have been of an ordinary exhibition of good archery the officer was stripped and bound to a tree while the chosen five took their stand opposite cool and collected it was at best a desolate sort of death not a friend not a sympathizer near not one fellow christian to bear his farewell to the faithful or to record for them his last accents and the constancy of his end to stand in the middle of the crowded amphitheatre with a hundred thousand witnesses of christian constancy to see the encouraging looks of many and hear the whispered blessings of a few loving acquaintances had something cheering and almost inspiring in it it lent at least the feeble aid of human emotions to the more powerful sustainment of grace the very shout of an insulting multitude put a strain upon natural courage as the hunters cry only nerves the stag at bay but this dead and silent scene at dawn of day shut up in the court of a house this being with most unfeeling indifference tied up like a truss of hay or a stuffed figure to be coolly aimed at according to the tyrants orders this being alone in the midst of a horde of swarthy savages whose very language was strange uncouth and unintelligible but who were no doubt uttering their rude jokes and laughing as men do before a match or a game which they are going to enjoy all this had more the appearance of a piece of cruelty about to be acted in a gloomy forest by banditti than open and glorious confession of christs name it looked and felt more like assassination than martyrdom but sebastian cared not for all this angels looked over the wall upon him and the rising sun which dazzled his eyes but made him a clearer mark for his bowmen shone not more brightly on him than did the countenance of the only witness he cared to have of suffering endured for his sake the first moor drew his bow string to his ear and an arrow trembled in the flesh of sebastian each chosen marksman followed in turn and shouts of applause accompanied each hit so cleverly approaching yet avoiding according to the imperial order every vital part and so the game went on every body laughing and brawling and jeering and enjoying it without a particle of feeling for the now drooping frame painted with blood all in sport except the martyr to whom all was sober earnest each sharp pang the enduring smart the exhaustion the weariness the knotty bonds the constrained attitude oh but earnest too was the steadfast heart the untiring spirit the unwavering faith the unruffled patience the unsated love of suffering for his lord earnest was the prayer earnest the gaze of the eye on heaven earnest the listening of the ear for the welcoming strain of the heavenly porters as they should open the gate it was indeed a dreary death yet this was not the worst after all death came not the golden gates remained unbarred the martyr in heart still reserved for greater glory even upon earth found himself not suddenly translated from death to life but sunk into unconsciousness in the lap of angels his tormentors saw when they had reached their intended measure they cut the cords that bound him and sebastian fell exhausted and to all appearance dead upon the carpet of blood which he had spread for himself on the pavement did he lie like a noble warrior as he now appears in marble under his altar in his own dear church we at least cannot imagine him as more beautiful and not only that church do we love but that ancient chapel which stands in the midst of the ruined palatine to mark the spot on which he fell illustration elias carried up to heaven from a picture found in the catacombs chapter xxvi the revival night was far advanced when the black slave having completed her marriage settlement quite to her own satisfaction was returning to her mistresss house it was indeed a cold wintry night so she was well wrapped up and in no humor to be disturbed but it was a lovely night and the moon seemed to be stroking with a silvery hand the downy robe of the meta sudans she paused beside it and after a silence of some moments broke out into a loud laugh as if some ridiculous recollection connected itself in her mind with that beautiful object she was turning round to proceed on her way when she felt herself roughly seized by the arm if you had not laughed said her captor bitterly i should not have recognized you but that hyena laugh of yours is unmistakable listen the wild beasts your african cousins are answering it from the amphitheatre what was it about pray about you how about me i was thinking of our last interview in this place and what a fool you made of yourself how kind of you afra to be thinking of me especially as i was not just then thinking of you but of your countrymen in those cells cease your impertinence and call people by their proper names i am not afra the slave any longer at least i shall not be so in a few hours but jubala the wife of hyphax commander of the mauritanian archers a very respectable man no doubt if he could speak any language besides his gibberish but these few hours of interval may suffice for the transaction of our business you made a mistake methinks in what you said just now it was you was it not that made a fool of me at our last meeting what has become of your fair promises and of my fairer gold which were exchanged on that occasion mine i know proved sterling yours i fear turned out but dust no doubt for so says a proverb in my language the dust on a wise mans skirts is better than the gold in the fools girdle but let us come to the point did you really ever believe in the power of my charms and philters to be sure i did do you mean they were all imposture not quite all you see we have got rid of fabius and the daughter is in possession of the fortune that was a preliminary step of absolute necessity what do you mean that your incantations removed the father asked corvinus amazed and shrinking from her it was only a sudden bright thought of afras so she pushed her advantage saying to be sure what else it is easy thus to get rid of any one that is too much in the way good night good night he replied in great fear stay a moment she answered somewhat propitiated corvinus i gave you two pieces of advice worth all your gold that night one you have acted against the other you have not followed how did i not tell you not to hunt the christians but to catch them in your toils fulvius has done the second and has gained something you have done the first and what have you earned nothing but rage confusion and stripes then i was a good counsellor in the one advice follow me in the second what was it when you had become rich enough by christian spoil to offer yourself with your wealth to fabiola she has till now coldly rejected every offer but i have observed one thing carefully not a single suit has been accompanied by riches every spendthrift has sought her fortune to repair his own depend upon it he that wins the prize must come on the principle that two and two make four do you understand me too well for where are my two to come from listen to me corvinus for this is our last interview and i rather like you as a hearty unscrupulous relentless and unfeeling good hater she drew him nearer and whispered i know from eurotas out of whom i can wheedle anything that fulvius has some splendid christian prizes in view one especially come this way into the shadow and i will tell you how surely you may intercept his treasure leave to him the cool murder that will be necessary for it may be troublesome but step in between him and the spoil he would do it to you any day she spoke to him for some minutes in a low and earnest tone and at the end he broke out into the loud exclamation excellent what a word in such a mouth she checked him by a pull and pointing to the building opposite exclaimed hush look there how are the tables turned or rather how has the world gone round in a brief space the last time these two wicked beings were on the same spot plotting bane to others the window above was occupied by two virtuous youths who like two spirits of good were intent on unravelling their web of mischief and countermining their dark approaches they are gone thence the one sleeping in his tomb the other slumbering on the eve of execution death looks to us like a holy power seeing how much he prefers taking to his society the good rather than the evil he snatches away the flower and leaves the weed its poisonous life till it drops into mature decay but at the moment that they looked up the window was occupied by two other persons that is fulvius said corvinus who just came to the window and the other is his evil demon eurotas added the slave they both watched and listened from their dark nook fulvius came again at that moment to the window with a sword in his hand carefully turning and examining the hilt in the bright moonlight he flung it down at last exclaiming with an oath it is only brass after all eurotas came with to all appearance a rich officers belt and examined it carefully all false stones why i declare the whole of the effects are not worth fifty pounds you have made but a poor job of this fulvius always reproaching me eurotas and yet this miserable gain has cost me the life of one of the emperors most favorite officers and no thanks probably from your master for it eurotas was right next morning the slaves who received the body of sebastian were surprised by a swarthy female figure passing by them and whispering to them he is still alive instead therefore of carrying him out for burial they bore him to the apartment of irene the early hour of the morning and the emperors having gone the evening before to his favorite lateran palace facilitated this movement instantly dionysius was sent for and he pronounced every wound curable not one arrow having touched a vital organ but loss of blood had taken place to such a fearful extent that he considered weeks must elapse before the patient would be fit to move for four and twenty hours afra assiduously called almost every hour to ask how sebastian was when the probationary term was finished she conducted fabiola to irenes apartment to receive herself assurance that he breathed though scarcely more the deed of her liberation from servitude was executed her dowry was paid and the whole palatine and forum rung with the mad carouse and hideous rites of her nuptials fabiola inquired after sebastian with such tender solicitude that irene doubted not that she was a christian the first few times she contented herself with receiving intelligence at the door and putting into the hands of sebastians hostess a large sum towards the expenses of his recovery but after two days when he was improving she was courteously invited to enter and for the first time in her life she found herself consciously in the bosom of a christian family irene we are told was the widow of castulus one of the chromatian band of converts her husband had just suffered death but she remained still unnoticed in the apartments held by him in the palace two daughters lived with her and a marked difference in their behavior soon struck fabiola as she became familiar with them one evidently thought sebastians presence an intrusion and seldom or never approached him her behavior to her mother was rude and haughty her ideas all belonged to the common illustration triumphal arch of severus temple of saturn ascent to the capitol temple of vespasian temple of concordia mamertine prison the northwest side of the forum world she was selfish light and forward the other who was the younger was a perfect contrast to her so gentle docile and affectionate so considerate about others so devoted to her mother so kind and attentive to the poor patient irene herself was a type of the christian matron in the middle class of life fabiola did not find her intelligent or learned or witty or highly polished but she saw her always calm active sensible and honest then she was clearly warm hearted generous deeply affectionate and sweetly patient the pagan lady had never seen such a household so simple frugal and orderly nothing disturbed it except the character of the elder sister in a few days it was ascertained that the daily visitor was not a christian but this caused no change in their treatment of her then she in her turn made a discovery which mortified her that the elder daughter was still heathen all that she saw made a favorable impression on her and softened the hard crust of prejudice on her mind for the present however her thoughts were all absorbed in sebastian whose recovery was slow she formed plans with irene for carrying him off to her campanian villa where she would have leisure to confer with him on religion an insuperable obstacle however rose to this project we will not attempt to lead our reader into the feelings of sebastian to have yearned after martyrdom to have prayed for it to have suffered all its pangs to have died in it as far as human consciousness went to have lost sight of this world and now to awaken in it again no martyr but an ordinary wayfaring man on probation who might yet lose salvation was surely a greater trial than martyrdom itself it was to be like a man who in the midst of a stormy night should try to cross an angry river or tempestuous arm of the sea and after struggling for hours and having his skiff twirled round and round and all but upset should find himself relanded on the same side as he started from or it was like st paul sent back to earth and to satans buffets after having heard the mysterious words which only one intelligence can utter yet no murmur escaped him no regret he adored in silence the divine will hoping that its purpose was only to give him the merit of a double martyrdom for this second crown he so earnestly longed that he rejected every proposal for flight and concealment i have now he generously said earned one privilege of a martyr that of speaking boldly to the persecutors this i will use the first day that i can leave my bed nurse me therefore well that it may be the sooner illustration moses receiving the law from a picture in the cemetery of inter duos lauros chapter xxvii the second crown the memorable plot which the black slave betrayed to corvinus was one to which allusion has already been made in the conversation between fulvius and his guardian he was convinced from the blind martyrs unsuspecting admissions that agnes was a christian and he believed he had now two strings to his bow either he could terrify her into marriage with himself or he could destroy her and obtain a good share of her wealth by confiscation he was nerved for this second alternative by the taunts and exhortations of eurotas but despairing of obtaining another interview he wrote her a respectful but pressing letter descriptive of his disinterested attachment to her and entreating her to accept his suit there was but the faintest hint at the end that duty might compel him to take another course if humble petition did not prevail to this application he received a calm well bred but unmistakable refusal a stern final and hopeless rejection but more the letter stated in clear terms that the writer was already espoused to the spotless lamb and could admit from no perishable being expressions of personal attachment this rebuff steeled his heart against pity but he determined to act prudently in the meantime fabiola seeing the determination of sebastian not to fly conceived the romantic idea of saving him in spite of himself by extorting his pardon from the emperor she did not know the depth of wickedness in mans heart she thought the tyrant might fume for a moment but that he would never condemn a man twice to death some pity and mercy she thought must linger in his breast and her earnest pleading and tears would extract them as heat does the hidden balsam from the hard wood she accordingly sent a petition for an audience and knowing the covetousness of the man presumed as she said to offer him a slight token of her own and her late fathers loyal attachment this was a ring with jewels of rare beauty and immense value the present was accepted but she was merely told to attend with her memorial at the palatine on the th in common with other petitioners and wait for the emperors descent by the great staircase on his way to sacrifice unencouraging as was this answer she resolved to risk any thing and do her best the appointed day came and fabiola in her mourning habits worn both as a suppliant and for her fathers death took her stand in a row of far more wretched creatures than herself mothers children sisters who held petitions for mercy for those clearest to them now in dungeons or mines she felt the little hope she had entertained die within her at the sight of so much wretchedness too much for it all to expect favor but fainter grew its last spark at every step that the tyrant took down the marble stairs though she saw her brilliant ring sparkling on his coarse hand for on each step he snatched a paper from some sorrowful suppliant looked at it scornfully and either tore it up or dashed it on the ground only here and there he handed one to his secretary a man scarcely less imperious than himself it was now nearly fabiolas turn the emperor was only two steps above her and her heart beat violently not from fear of man but from anxiety about sebastians fate she would have prayed had she known how or to whom maximian was stretching out his hand to take a paper offered to him when he drew back and turned round on hearing his name most unceremoniously and peremptorily called out fabiola looked up too for she knew the voice opposite to her high in the white marble wall she had observed an open window corniced in yellow marble which gave light to a back corridor leading to where irenes apartments were she now looked up guided by the voice and in the dark panel of the window a beautiful but awful picture was seen it was sebastian wan and thin who with features almost etherealized calm and stern as if no longer capable of passion or strong emotion stood there before them his lacerated breast and arms appearing amidst the loose drapery he had thrown around him for he had heard the familiar trumpet notes which told him of the emperors approach and he had risen and crept thus far to greet him maximian he cried out in a hollow but distinct voice who art thou sirrah that makest so free with thine emperors name asked the tyrant turning upon him i am come as from the dead to warn thee that the day of wrath and vengeance is fast approaching thou hast spilt the blood of gods saints upon the pavement of this city thou hast cast their holy bodies into the river or flung them away upon the dunghills at the gates thou hast pulled down gods temples and profaned his altars and rifled the inheritance of his poor for these and thine own foul crimes and lewdnesses thine injustices and oppressions thy covetousness and thy pride god hath judged thee and his wrath shall soon overtake thee and thou shalt die the death of the violent and god will give his church an emperor after his own heart and thy memory shall be accursed through the whole world till the end of time repent thee while thou hast time impious man and ask forgiveness of god in the name of him the crucified whom thou hast persecuted till now deep silence was held while these words were fully uttered the emperor seemed under the influence of a paralyzing awe for soon recognizing sebastian he felt as if standing in the presence of the dead but quickly recovering himself and his passion he exclaimed ho some of you go round instantly and bring him before me he did not like to pronounce his name hyphax here where is hyphax i saw him just now but the moor had at once recognized sebastian and run off to his quarters ha he is gone i see then here you dolt whats your name addressing corvinus who was attending his father go to the numidian court and summon hyphax here directly with a heavy heart corvinus went on his errand hyphax had told his tale and put his men in order of defence only one entrance at the end of the court was left open and when the messenger had reached it he durst not advance fifty men stood along each side of the space with hyphax and jubala at the opposite end silent and immovable with their dark chests and arms bare each with his arrow fixed and pointed to the door and the string ready drawn they looked like an avenue of basalt statues leading to an egyptian temple hyphax said corvinus in a tremulous voice the emperor sends for you tell his majesty respectfully from me replied the african that my men have sworn that no man passes that threshold coming in or going out without receiving through his breast or his back a hundred shafts into his heart until the emperor shall have sent us a token of forgiveness for every offence corvinus hastened back with this message and the emperor received it with a laugh they were men with whom he could not afford to quarrel for he relied on them in battle or insurrection for picking out the leaders the cunning rascals he exclaimed there take that trinket to hyphaxs black spouse and he gave him fabiolas splendid ring he hastened back delivered his gracious embassy and threw the ring across in an instant every bow dropt and every string relaxed jubala delighted sprang forward and caught the ring a heavy blow from her husbands fist felled her to the ground and was greeted with a shout of applause the savage seized the jewel and the woman rose to fear that she had only exchanged one slavery for a worse hyphax screened himself behind the imperial command if he said you had allowed us to send an arrow through his head or heart all would have been straight as it was we are not responsible at any rate i will myself see my work done properly this time said maximian two of you fellows with clubs come here two of his attendant executioners came from behind sebastian scarcely able to stand was also there mild and intrepid now my men said the barbarian i must not have any blood spilt on these stairs so you knock the life out of him with your cudgels make clean work of it madam what is your petition stretching out his hand to fabiola whom he recognized and so addressed more respectfully she was horrified and disgusted and almost fainting at the sight before her so she said sire i fear it is too late why too late looking at the paper a flash came from his eye as he said to her what you knew that sebastian was alive are you a christian no sire she replied why did the denial almost dry up in her throat she could not for her life have said she was any thing else ah fabiola thy day is not far off but as you said just now replied the emperor more serene returning her petition i fear it is too late i think that blow must have been the ictus gratiosus i feel faint sire said she respectfully may i retire by all means but by the bye i have to thank you for the beautiful ring which you sent and which i have given to hyphaxs wife lately her own slave it will look more brilliant on a black hand than even on mine adieu and he kissed his hand with a wicked smile as if there were no martyrs body near to witness against him he was right a heavy blow on the head had proved fatal and sebastian was safe where he had so longed to be he bore with him a double palm and received a twofold crown yet still an ignominious end before the world beaten to death without ceremony while the emperor conversed how much of martyrdom is in its disgrace woe to us when we know that our sufferings earn us honor the tyrant seeing his work completed ordered that sebastian at least should not be cast into the tiber nor on a dunghill put plenty of weights to his body he added and throw it into the cloaca to rot there and be the food of vermin the christians at least shall not have it this was done and the saints acts inform us that in the night he appeared to the holy matron lucina and directed her where to find his sacred remains she obeyed his summons and they were buried with honor where now stands his basilica illustration christ blessing a child from a picture in the cemetery of the latin way chapter xxviii the critical day its first part there are critical days in the life of man and of mankind not merely the days of marathon of cann or of lepanto in which a different result might have influenced the social or political fate of mankind but it is probable that columbus could look back upon not only the day but the precise hour the decision of which secured to the world all that he taught and gave it and to himself the singular place which he holds among its worthies and each of us little and insignificant as he may be has had his critical day his day of choice which has decided his fate through life his day of providence which altered his position or his relations to others his day of grace when the spiritual conquered the material in whatever way it has been every soul like jerusalem has had its day and so with fabiola has not all been working up towards a crisis emperor and slave father and guest the good and the wicked christian and heathen rich and poor then life and death joy and sorrow learning and simplicity silence and conversation have they not all come as agents pulling at her mind in opposite ways yet all directing her noble and generous though haughty and impetuous soul one way as the breeze and the rudder struggle against one another only to determine the ships single path by what shall the resolution of these contending forces be determined that rests not with man wisdom not philosophy can decide we have been engaged with events commemorated on the th of january let the reader look and see what comes on the following day in his calendar and he will agree it must be an important day in our little narrative from the audience fabiola retired to the apartments of irene where she found nothing but desolation and sorrow she sympathized fully with the grief around her but she saw and felt that there was a difference between her affliction and theirs there was a buoyancy about them there was almost an exultation breaking out through their distress their clouds were sun lit and brightened at times hers was a dead and sullen a dull and heavy gloom as if she had sustained a hopeless loss her search after christianity as associated with anything amiable or intelligent seemed at an end her desired teacher or informant was gone when the crowd had moved away from the palace she took affectionate leave of the widow and her daughters but some way or other she could not like the heathen one as she loved her sister she sat alone at home and tried to read she took up volume after volume of favorite works on death on fortitude on friendship on virtue and every one of them seemed insipid unsound and insincere she plunged into a deeper and a deeper melancholy which lasted till towards evening when she was disturbed by a letter being put into her hand the greek slave graja who brought it in retired to the other end of the room alarmed and perplexed by what she witnessed for her mistress had scarcely glanced over the note than she leaped up wildly from her seat threw her hair into disorder with her hands which she pressed as in agony on her temples stood thus for a moment looking up with an unnatural stare in her eyes and then sank heavily down again on her chair with a deep groan thus she remained for some minutes holding the letter in both her hands with her arms relaxed apparently unconscious who brought this letter she then asked quite collected a soldier madam answered the maid ask him to come here while her errand was being delivered she composed herself and gathered up her hair as soon as the soldier appeared she held this brief dialogue whence do you come i am on guard at the tullian prison who gave you the letter the lady agnes herself on what cause is the poor child there on the accusation of a man named fulvius for being a christian for nothing else for nothing i am sure then we shall soon set that matter right i can give witness to the contrary tell her i will come presently and take this for your trouble the soldier retired and fabiola was left alone when there was something to do her mind was at once energetic and concentrated though afterwards the tenderness of womanhood might display itself the more painfully she wrapped herself close up proceeded alone to the prison and was at once conducted to the separate cell which agnes had obtained in consideration of her rank backed by her parents handsome largitions what is the meaning of this agnes eagerly inquired fabiola after a warm embrace i was arrested a few hours ago and brought hither and is fulvius fool enough as well as scoundrel to trump up an accusation against you which five minutes will confute i will go to tertullus myself and contradict his absurd charge at once what charge dearest why that you are a christian and so i am thank god replied agnes making on herself the sign of the cross the announcement did not strike fabiola like a thunderbolt nor rouse her nor stagger her nor perplex her sebastians death had taken all edge or heaviness from it she had found that faith existing in what she had considered the type of every manly virtue she was not surprised to find it in her whom she had loved as the very model of womanly perfection the simple grandeur of that childs excellence her guileless innocence and unexcepting kindness she had almost worshipped it made fabiolas difficulties less it brought her problem nearer to a solution to find two such peerless beings to be not mere chance grown plants but springing from the same seed she bowed her head in a kind of reverence for the child and asked her how long have you been so all my life dear fabiola i sucked the faith as we say with my mothers milk and why did you conceal it from me because i saw your violent prejudices against us how you abhorred us as practisers of the most ridiculous superstitions as perpetrators of the most odious abominations i perceived how you contemned us as unintellectual uneducated unphilosophical and unreasonable you would not hear a word about us and the only object of hatred to your generous mind was the christian name true dearest agnes yet i think that had i known that you or sebastian was a christian i could not have hated it i could have loved any thing in you you think so now fabiola but you know not the force of universal prejudice the weight of falsehood daily repeated how many noble minds fine intellects and loving hearts have they enslaved and induced to believe us to be all that we are not something even worse than the worst of others well agnes it is selfish in me to argue thus with you in your present position you will of course compel fulvius to prove that you are a christian oh no dear fabiola i have already confessed it and intend to do so again publicly in the morning in the morning what to morrow asked fabiola shocked at the idea of any thing so immediate yes to morrow to prevent any clamor or disturbance about me though i suspect few people will care much i am to be interrogated early and summary proceedings will be taken is not that good news dear asked agnes eagerly seizing her cousins hands and then putting on one of her ecstatic looks she exclaimed behold what i have long coveted i already see what i have hoped for i hold safe to him alone i feel already associated in heaven whom here on earth i have loved with all devotedness oh is he not beautiful fabiola lovelier far than the angels who surround him how sweet his smile how mild his eye how bland the whole expression of his face and that sweetest and most gracious lady who ever accompanies him our queen and mistress who loves him alone how winningly doth she beckon me forward to join her train i come i come they are departed fabiola but they return early for me to morrow early mind and we part no more fabiola felt her own heart swell and heave as if a new element were entering in she knew not what it was but it seemed something better than a mere human emotion she had not yet heard the name of grace agnes however saw the favorable change in her spirit and inwardly thanked god for it she begged her cousin to return before dawn to her for their final farewell at this same time a consultation was being held at the house of the prefect between that worthy functionary and his worthier son the reader had better listen to it to learn its purport certainly said the magistrate if the old sorceress was right in one thing she ought to be in the other i will answer from experience how powerful is wealth in conquering any resistance and you will allow too rejoined corvinus from the enumeration we have made that among the competitors for fabiolas hand there has not been one who could not justly be rather called an aspirant after her fortune yourself included my dear corvinus yes so far but not if i succeed in offering her with myself the lady agness great wealth and in a manner too methinks that will more easily gain upon what i hear of her generous and lofty disposition giving her that wealth independent of conditions and then offering yourself to her will put her under one of two obligations either to accept you as her husband or throw you back the fortune admirable father i never saw the second alternative before do you think there is no possibility of securing it except through her none whatever fulvius of course will apply for his share and the probability is that the emperor will declare he intends to take it all for himself for he hates fulvius but if i propose a more popular and palpably reasonable plan of giving the property to the nearest relation who worships the gods this fabiola does dont she certainly father i think he will embrace it while i am sure there is no chance of his making a free gift to me the proposal from a judge would enrage him then how will you manage it father i will have an imperial rescript prepared during the night ready for signature and i will proceed immediately after the execution to the palace magnify the unpopularity which is sure to follow it lay it all on fulvius and show the emperor how his granting the property to the next in the settlement of it will redound greatly to his credit and glory he is as vain as he is cruel and rapacious and one vice must be made to fight another nothing could be better my dear father i shall retire to rest with an easy mind to morrow will be the critical day of my life all my future depends upon whether i am accepted or rejected i only wish added tertullus rising that i could have seen this peerless lady and sounded the depths of her philosophy before your final bargain was struck fear not father she is well worthy of being your daughter in law yes to morrow is indeed the turning point of my fortunes even corvinus can have his critical day why not fabiola while this domestic interview was going on a conference was taking place between fulvius and his amiable uncle the latter entering late found his nephew sitting sullen and alone in the house and thus accosted him well fulvius is she secured she is uncle as fast as bars and walls can make her but her spirit is free and independent as ever never mind that sharp steel makes short work of spirit is her fate certain and are its consequences sure why if nothing else happens the first is safe the second have still to encounter imperial caprice but i own i feel pain and remorse at sacrificing so young a life and for an insecure result come fulvius said the old man sternly looking as cold as a grey rock in the morning mist no softness i hope in this matter do you remember what day is to morrow yes the twelfth before the calends of february the critical day always for you it was on this day that to gain anothers wealth you committed peace peace interrupted fulvius in agony why will you always remind me of every thing i most wish to forget because of this you wish to forget yourself and that must not be i must take from you every pretence to be guided by conscience virtue or even honor it is folly to affect compassion for any ones life who stands in the way of your fortune after what you did to her fulvius bit his lip in silent rage and covered his crimson face with his hands eurotas roused him by saying well then to morrow is another and probably a final critical day for you let us calmly weigh its prospects you will go to the emperor and ask for your rightful share in the confiscated property suppose it is granted i will sell it as quick as possible pay my debts and retire to some country where my name has never been heard suppose your claims are rejected impossible impossible exclaimed fulvius racked by the very idea it is my right hardly earned it cannot be denied me quietly my young friend let us discuss the matter coolly remember our proverb from the stirrup to the saddle there has been many a fall suppose only that your rights are refused you then i am a ruined man i have no other prospect before me of retrieving my fortunes here still i must fly hence good and what do you owe at januss arch a good couple of hundred sestertia between principal and compound interest at fifty per cent to that unconscionable jew ephraim on what security on my sure expectation of this ladys estates and if you are disappointed do you think he will let you fly not if he knows it most assuredly but we must be prepared from this moment for any emergency and that with the utmost secrecy leave that to me fulvius you see how eventful the issue of to morrow may be to you or rather of to day for morning is approaching life or death to you hang upon it it is the great day of your existence courage then or rather an inflexible determination steel you to work out its destiny illustration a monogram of christ found in the catacombs chapter xxix the same day its second part the day is not yet dawning and nevertheless we speak of having reached its second part how may this be gentle reader have we not led you to its first vespers divided as they are between sebastian of yesterday and agnes of to day have not the two sung them together without jealousy and with fraternal impartiality the one from the heaven which he ascended in the morning the other from the dungeon into which she descended in the evening glorious church of christ great in the unclashing combination of thy unity stretching from heaven to beneath the earth wherever exists a prison house of the just from his lodgings fulvius went out into the night air which was crisp and sharp to cool his blood and still his throbbing brows he wandered about almost without any purpose but found himself imperceptibly drawing nearer and nearer to the tullian prison as he was literally without affection what could be his attraction thither it was a strangely compounded feeling made up of as bitter ingredients as ever filled the poisoners cup there was gnawing remorse there was baffled pride there was goading avarice there was humbling shame there was a terrible sense of the approaching consummation of his villany it was true he had been rejected scorned baffled by a mere child while her fortune was necessary for his rescue from beggary and death so at least he reasoned yet he would still rather have her hand than her head her murder appeared revoltingly atrocious to him unless absolutely inevitable so he would give her another chance he was now at the prison gate of which he possessed the watchword he pronounced it entered and at his desire was conducted to his victims cell she did not flutter nor run into a corner like a bird into whose cage the hawk has found entrance calm and intrepid she stood before him respect me here fulvius at least she gently said i have but a few hours to live let them be spent in peace madam he replied i have come to lengthen them if you please to years and instead of peace i offer happiness surely sir if i understand you the time is past for this sad vanity thus to address one whom you have delivered over to death is at best a mockery it is not so gentle lady your fate is in your own hands only your own obstinacy will give you over to death i have come to renew once more my offer and with it that of life it is your last chance have i not before told you that i am a christian and that i would forfeit a thousand lives rather than betray my faith but now i ask you no longer to do this the gates of the prison are yet open to me fly with me and in spite of the imperial decrees you shall be a christian and yet live then have i not clearly told you that i am already espoused to my lord and saviour jesus christ and that to him alone i keep eternal faith folly and madness persevere in it till to morrow and that may be awarded to you which you fear more than death and which will drive this illusion forever from your mind i fear nothing for christ for know that i have an angel ever guarding me who will not suffer his masters handmaid to suffer scorn but now cease this unworthy importunity and leave me the last privilege of the condemned solitude fulvius had been gradually losing patience and could no longer restrain his passion rejected again baffled once more by a child this time with the sword hanging over her neck a flame irrepressible broke out from the smouldering heat within him and in an instant the venomous ingredients that we have described as mingled in his heart were distilled into one black solitary drop hatred with flashing look and furious gesture he broke forth wretched woman i give thee one more opportunity of rescuing thyself from destruction which wilt thou have life with me or death death even i will choose for her rather than life with a monster like thee exclaimed a voice just within the door she shall have it he rejoined clenching his fist and darting a mad look at the new speaker and thou too if again thou darest to fling thy baneful shadow across my path fabiola was alone for the last time with agnes she had been for some minutes unobserved watching the contest between what would have appeared to her had she been a christian an angel of light and a spirit of darkness and truly agnes looked like the first if human creature ever did in preparation for her coming festival of full espousals to the lamb when she should sign her contract of everlasting love as he had done in blood she had thrown over the dark garments of her mourning a white and spotless bridal robe in the midst of that dark prison lighted by a solitary lamp she looked radiant and almost dazzling while her tempter wrapped up in his dark cloak crouching down to rush out of the low door of the dungeon looked like a black and vanquished demon plunging into an abyss beneath then fabiola looked into her countenance and thought she had never seen it half so sweet no trace of anger of fear of flurry or agitation was there no paleness no flush no alternations of hectic excitement and pallid depression her eyes beamed with more than their usual mild intelligence her smile was as placid and cheerful as it ever was when they discoursed together then there was a noble air about her a greatness of look and manner which fabiola would have compared to that mien and stateliness and that ambrosial atmosphere by which in poetical mythology a being of a higher sphere was recognized on earth it was not inspiration for it was passionless but it was such expression and manner as her highest conceptions of virtue and intellect combined in the soul might be supposed to stamp upon the outward form hence her feelings passed beyond love into a higher range they were more akin to reverence agnes took one of her hands in each of her own crossed them upon her own calm bosom and looking into her face with a gaze of blandest earnestness said fabiola i have one dying request to make you you have never refused me any i am sure you will not this speak not thus to me dearest agnes you must not request you command me now then promise me that you will immediately apply your mind to master the doctrines of christianity i know you will embrace them and then you will no longer be to me what you are now and what is that dark dark dearest fabiola when i look upon you thus i see in you a noble intellect a generous disposition an affectionate heart a cultivated mind a fine moral feeling and a virtuous life what can be desired more in woman and yet over all these splendid gifts there hangs a cloud to my eyes of gloomy shadow the shade of death drive it away and all will be lightsome and bright i feel it dear agnes i feel it standing before you i seem to be as a black spot compared to your brightness and how embracing christianity shall i become light like you you must pass fabiola through the torrent that sunders us fabiola started recollecting her dream waters of refreshment shall flow over your body and oil of gladness shall embalm your flesh and the soul shall be washed clean as driven snow and the heart be softened as the babes from that bath you will come forth a new creature born again to a new and immortal life and shall i lose all that you have but just now prized in me asked fabiola somewhat downcast as the gardener answered the martyr selects some hardy and robust but unprofitable plant and on it engrafts but a small shoot of one that is sweet and tender and the flowers and fruits of this belong to the first and yet deprive it of no grace no grandeur no strength that it had before so will the new life you shall receive ennoble elevate and sanctify you can scarcely understand this word the valuable gifts of nature and education which you already possess what a glorious being christianity will make you fabiola what a new world you are leading me to dear agnes oh that you were not leaving me outside its very threshold hark exclaimed agnes in an ecstasy of joy they come they come you hear the measured tramp of the soldiers in the gallery they are the bridesmen coming to summon me but i see on high the white robed bridesmaids borne on the bright clouds of morning and beckoning me forward yes my lamp is trimmed and i go forth to meet the bridegroom farewell fabiola weep not for me oh that i could make you feel as i do the happiness of dying for christ and now i will speak a word to you which i never have addressed to you before god bless you and she made the sign of the cross on fabiolas forehead an embrace convulsive on fabiolas part calm and tender on agness was their last earthly greeting the one hastened home filled with a new and generous purpose the other resigned herself to the shame stricken guard over the first part of the martyrs trials we cast a veil of silence though ancient fathers and the church in her offices dwell upon it as doubling her crown suffice it to say that her angel protected her from harm and that the purity of her presence converted a den of infamy into a holy and lovely sanctuary it was still early in the morning when she stood again before the tribunal of the prefect in the roman forum unchanged and unscathed without a blush upon her smiling countenance or a pang of sorrow in her innocent heart only her unshorn hair the symbol of virginity which had been let loose flowed down in golden waves upon her snow white dress it was a lovely morning many will remember it to have been a beautiful day on its anniversary as they have walked out of the nomentan gate now the porta pia towards the church which bears our virgin martyrs name to see blessed upon her altar the two lambs from whose wool are made the palliums sent by the pope to the archbishops of his communion already the almond trees are hoary not with frost but with blossoms the earth is being loosened round the vines and spring seems latent in the swelling buds which are watching for the signal from the southern breeze to burst and expand the atmosphere rising into a cloudless sky has just that temperature that one loves of a sun already vigorous not heating but softening the slightly frosty air such we have frequently experienced st agness day together with joyful thousands hastening to her shrine the judge was sitting in the open forum and a sufficient crowd formed a circle round the charmed space which few save christians loved to enter among the spectators were two whose appearance attracted general attention they stood opposite each other at the ends of the semicircle formed by the multitude one was a youth enveloped in his toga with a slouching hat over his eyes so that his features could not be distinguished the other was a lady of aristocratic mien tall and erect such as one does not expect to meet on such an occasion wrapped close about her and so ample as to veil her from head to foot like the beautiful ancient statue known among artists by the name of modesty she had a scarf or mantle of indian workmanship woven in richest pattern of crimson purple and gold a garment truly imperial and less suitable than even female presence to this place of doom and blood a slave or servant of superior class attended her carefully veiled also like her mistress the ladys mind seemed intent on one only object as she stood immovable leaning with her elbow on a marble post illustration chains for the martyrs after a picture found in in a crypt at milan agnes was introduced by her guards into the open space and stood intrepid facing the tribunal her thoughts seemed to be far away and she took no notice even of those two who till she appeared had been objects of universal observation why is she unfettered asked the prefect angrily she does not need it she walks so readily answered catulus and she is so young but she is obstinate as the oldest put manacles on her hands at once the executioner turned over a quantity of such prison ornaments to christian eyes really such and at length selected a pair as light and small as he could find and placed them round her wrists agnes playfully and with a smile illustration the judge angrily reproved the executioner for his hesitation and bid him at once do his duty shook her hands and they fell like st pauls viper clattering at her feet they are the smallest we have sir said the softened executioner one so young ought to wear other bracelets silence man rejoined the exasperated judge who turning to the prisoner said in a blander tone agnes i pity thy youth thy station and the bad education thou hast received i desire if possible to save thee think better while thou hast time renounce the false and pernicious maxims of christianity obey the imperial edicts and sacrifice to the gods it is useless she replied to tempt me longer my resolution is unalterable i despise thy false divinities and can only love and serve the one living god eternal ruler open wide the heavenly gates until lately closed to man blessed christ call to thee the soul that cleaveth unto thee victim first to thee by virginal consecration now to thy father by martyrdoms immolation i waste time i see said the impatient prefect who saw symptoms of compassion rising in the multitude secretary write the sentence we condemn agnes for contempt of the imperial edicts to be punished by the sword on what road and at what mile stone shall the judgment be executed asked the headsman let it be carried into effect at once was the reply agnes raised for one moment her hands and eyes to heaven then calmly knelt down with her own hands she drew forward her silken hair over her head and exposed her neck to the blow a pause ensued for the executioner was trembling with emotion and could not wield his sword as the child knelt alone in her white robe with her head inclined her arms modestly crossed upon her bosom and her amber locks hanging almost to the ground and veiling her features she might not unaptly have been compared to some rare plant of which the slender stalk white as the lily bent with the luxuriancy of its golden blossom the judge angrily reproved the executioner for his hesitation and bid him at once do his duty the man passed the back of his rough left hand across his eyes as he raised his sword it was seen to flash for an instant in the air and the next moment flower and stem were lying scarcely displaced on the ground it might have been taken for the prostration of prayer had not the white robe been in that minute dyed into a rich crimson washed in the blood of the lamb the man on the judges right hand had looked with unflinching eye upon the stroke and his lip curled in a wicked triumph over the fallen the lady opposite had turned away her head till the murmur that follows a suppressed breath in a crowd told her all was over she then boldly advanced forward unwound from round her person her splendid brocaded mantle and stretched it as a pall over the mangled body a burst of applause followed this graceful act of womanly feeling as the lady stood now in the garb of deepest mourning before the tribunal sir she said in a tone clear and distinct but full of emotion grant me one petition let not the rude hands of illustration the christian martyr your servants again touch and profane the hallowed remains of her whom i have loved more than any thing on earth but let me bear them hence to the sepulchre of her fathers for she was noble as she was good tertullus was manifestly irritated as he replied madam whoever you may be your request cannot be granted catulus see that the body be cast as usual into the river or burnt i entreat you sir the lady earnestly insisted by every claim which female virtue has upon you by any tear which a mother has shed over you by every soothing word which a sister has ever spoken to you in illness or sorrow by every ministration of their gentle hands i implore you to grant my humble prayer and if when you return home this evening you will be met at the threshold by daughters who will kiss your hand though stained with the blood of one whom you may feel proud if they resemble be able to say to them at least that this slightest tribute to the maidenly delicacy which they prize has not been refused such common sympathy was manifested that tertullus anxious to check it asked her sharply pray are you too a christian she hesitated for one instant then replied no sir i am not but i own that if anything could make me one it would be what i have seen this day what do you mean why that to preserve the religion of the empire such beings as she whom you have slain her tears interrupted her for a moment should have to die while monsters who disgrace the shape and name of man should have to live and flourish oh sir you know not what you have blotted out from earth this day she was the purest sweetest holiest thing i ever knew upon it the very flower of womanhood though yet a child and she might have lived yet had she not scorned the proffered hand of a vile adventurer who pursued her with his loathsome offers into the seclusion of her villa into the sanctuary of her home and even into the last retreat of her dungeon for this she died that she would not endow with her wealth and ennoble by her alliance that asiatic spy she pointed with calm scorn at fulvius who bounded forward and exclaimed with fury she lies foully and calumniously sir agnes openly confessed herself a christian bear with me sir replied the lady with noble dignity while i convict him and look on his face for proof of what i say didst thou not fulvius early this morning seek that gentle child in her cell and deliberately tell her for unseen i heard you that if she would but accept thy hand not only wouldst thou save her life but despising the imperial commands secure her still remaining a christian fulvius stood pale as death stood as one does for a moment who is shot through the heart or struck by lightning he looked like a man on whom sentence is going to be pronounced not of death but of eternal pillory as the judge addressed him saying fulvius thy very look confirms this grievous charge i could arraign thee on it for thy head at once but take my counsel begone hence forever flee and hide thyself after such villany from the indignation of all just men and from the vengeance of the gods show not thy face again here nor in the forum nor in any public place of rome if this lady pleases even now i will take her deposition against thee pray madam he asked most respectfully may i have the honor of knowing your name fabiola she replied the judge was now all complacency for he saw before him he hoped his future daughter in law i have often heard of you madam he said and of your high accomplishments and exalted virtues you are moreover nearly allied to this victim of treachery and have a right to claim her body it is at your disposal this speech was interrupted at its beginning by a loud hiss and yell that accompanied fulviuss departure he was pale with shame terror and rage fabiola gracefully thanked the prefect and beckoned to syra who attended her the servant again made a signal to some one else and presently four slaves appeared bearing a ladys litter fabiola would allow no one but herself and syra to raise the relics from the ground place them on the litter and cover them with their precious pall bear this treasure to its own home she said and followed as mourner with her maid a little girl all in tears timidly asked if she might join them illustration a blood urn used as a mark for a martyrs grave who art thou asked fabiola i am poor emerentiana her foster sister replied the child and fabiola led her kindly by the hand the moment the body was removed a crowd of christians children men and women threw themselves forward with sponges and linen cloths to gather up the blood in vain did the guards fall on them with whips cudgels and even with sharper weapons so that many mingled their own blood with that of the martyr when a sovereign at his coronation or on first entering his capital throws according to ancient custom handfuls of gold and silver coins among the crowd he does not create a more eager competition for his scattered treasures than there was among those primitive christians for what they valued more than gold or precious stones the ruby drops which a martyr had poured from his heart for his lord but all respected the prior claim of one and here it was the deacon reparatus who at risk of life was present phial in hand to gather the blood of agness testimony that it might be appended as a faithful seal to the record of martyrdom on her tomb illustration the resurrection of lazarus from the cemetery of st domitilla chapter xxx the same day its third part tertullus hastened at once to the palace fortunately or unfortunately for these candidates for martyrdom there he met corvinus with the prepared rescript elegantly engrossed in unical that is large capital letters he had the privilege of immediate admission into the imperial presence and as a matter of business reported the death of agnes exaggerated the public feeling likely to be caused by it attributed it all to the folly and mismanagement of fulvius whose worst guilt he did not disclose for fear of having to try him and thus bringing out what he was now doing depreciated the value of agness property and ended by saying that it would be a gracious act of clemency and one sure to counteract unpopular feelings to bestow it upon her relative who by settlement was her next heir he described fabiola as a young lady of extraordinary intellect and wonderful learning who was most zealously devoted to the worship of the gods and daily offered sacrifice to the genius of the emperors i know her said maximian laughing as if at the recollection of something very droll poor thing she sent me a splendid ring and yesterday asked me for that wretched sebastians life just as they had finished cudgelling him to death and he laughed immoderately then continued yes yes by all means a little inheritance will console her no doubt for the loss of that fellow let a rescript be made out and i will sign it tertullus produced the one prepared saying he had fully relied on the emperors magnanimous clemency and the imperial barbarian put a signature to it which would have disgraced a schoolboy the prefect at once consigned it to his son scarcely had he left the palace when fulvius entered he had been home to put on a proper court attire and remove from his features by the bath and the perfumers art the traces of his mornings passion he felt a keen presentiment that he should be disappointed eurotass cool discussion of the preceding evening had prepared him the cross of all his designs and his multiplied disappointments that day had strengthened this instinctive conviction one woman indeed seemed born to meet and baffle him whichever way he turned but thank the gods he thought she cannot be in my way here she has this morning blasted my character for ever she cannot claim my rightful reward she has made me an outcast it is not in her power to make me a beggar this seemed his only ground of hope despair indeed urged him forward and he determined to argue out his claims to the confiscated property of agnes with the only competitor he could fear the rapacious emperor himself he might as well risk his life over it for if he failed he was utterly ruined after waiting some time he entered the audience hall and advanced with the blandest smile that he could muster to the imperial feet what want you here was his first greeting sire he replied i have come humbly to pray your royal justice to order my being put into immediate possession of my share of the lady agness property she has been convicted of being a christian upon my accusation and she has just suffered the merited penalty of all who disobey the imperial edicts that is all quite right but we have heard how stupidly you mismanaged the whole business as usual and have raised murmurings and discontent in the people against us so now the sooner you quit our presence palace and city the better for yourself do you understand we dont usually give such warnings twice i will obey instantly every intimation of the supreme will but i am almost destitute command what of right is mine to be delivered over to me and i part immediately no more words replied the tyrant but go at once as to the property which you demand with so much pertinacity you cannot have it we have made over the whole of it by an irrevocable rescript to an excellent and deserving person the lady fabiola fulvius did not speak another word but kissed the emperors hand and slowly retired he looked a ruined broken man he was only heard to say as he passed out of the gate then after all she has made me a beggar too when he reached home eurotas who read his answer in his nephews eye was amazed at his calmness i see he drily remarked it is all over yes are your preparations made eurotas nearly so i have sold the jewels furniture and slaves at some loss but with the trifle i had in hand we have enough to take us safe to asia i have retained stabio as the most trusty of our servants he will carry our small travelling requisites on his horse two others are preparing for you and me i have only one thing more to get for our journey and then i am ready to start pray what is that the poison i ordered it last night but it will only be ready at noon what is that for asked fulvius with some alarm surely you know rejoined the other unmoved i am willing to make one more trial any where else but our bargain is clear my fathers family must not end in beggary it must be extinguished in honor fulvius bit his lip and said well be it as you like i am weary of life leave the house as soon as possible for fear of ephraim and be with your horses at the third mile on the latin gate soon after dusk i will join you there for i too have an important matter to transact before i start and what is that asked eurotas with a rather keen curiosity i cannot tell even you but if i am not with you by two hours after sunset give me up and save yourself without me eurotas fixed upon him his cold dark eye with one of those looks which ever read fulvius through to see if he could detect any lurking idea of escape from his gripe but his look was cool and unusually open and the old man asked no more while this dialogue was going on fulvius had been divesting himself of his court garments and attiring himself in a travelling suit so completely did he evidently prepare himself for his journey without necessity of returning home that he even took his weapons with him besides his sword securing in his girdle but concealed under his cloak one of those curved daggers of highest temper and most fatal form which were only known in the east eurotas proceeded at once to the numidian quarters in the palace and asked for jubala who entered with two small flasks of different sizes and was just going to give some explanations when her husband half drunk half furious was seen approaching eurotas had just time to conceal the flasks in his belt and slip a coin into her hand when hyphax came up his wife had mentioned to him the offers which eurotas had made to her before marriage and had excited in his hot african blood a jealousy that amounted to hatred the savage rudely thrust his wife out of the apartment and would have picked a quarrel with the syrian had not the latter his purpose being accomplished acted with forbearance assured the archer chief that he should never more see him and retired it is time however that we return to fabiola the reader is probably prepared to hear us say that she returned home a christian and yet it was not so for what as yet did she know of christianity to be said to profess it in sebastian and agnes she had indeed willingly admired the virtue unselfish generous and more than earthly which now she was ready to attribute to that faith she saw that it gave motives of actions principles of life elevation of mind courage of conscience and determination of virtuous will such as no other system of belief ever bestowed and even if as she now shrewdly suspected and intended in calmer moments to ascertain the sublime revelations of syra concerning an unseen sphere of virtue and its all seeing ruler came from the same source to what did it all amount more than to a grand moral and intellectual system partly practical partly speculative as all codes of philosophic teaching were this was a very different thing from christianity she had as yet heard nothing of its real and essential doctrines its fathomless yet accessible depths of mystery the awful vast and heaven high structure of faith which the simplest soul may contain as a childs eye will take in the perfect reflection and counterpart of a mountain though a giant cannot scale it she had never heard of a god one in trinity of the co equal son incarnate for man she had never been told of the marvellous history of redemption by gods sufferings and death she had not heard of nazareth or bethlehem or calvary how could she call herself a christian or be one in ignorance of all this how many names had to become familiar and sweet to her which as yet were unknown or barbarous mary joseph peter paul and john not to mention the sweetest of all his whose name is balm to the wounded heart or as honey dropping from the broken honeycomb and how much had she yet to learn about the provision for salvation on earth in the church in grace in sacraments in prayer in love in charity to others what unexplored regions lay beyond the small tract which she had explored no fabiola returned home exhausted almost by the preceding day and night and the sad scenes of the morning and retired to her own apartment no longer perhaps even a philosopher yet not a christian she desired all her servants to keep away from the court which she occupied that she might not be disturbed by the smallest noise and she forbade any one to have access to her there she sat in loneliness and silence for several hours too excited to obtain rest from slumber she mourned long over agnes as a mother might over a child suddenly carried off yet was there not a tinge of light upon the cloud that overshadowed her more than when it hung over her fathers bier did it not seem to her an insult to reason an outrage to humanity to think that she had perished that she had been permitted to walk forward in her bright robe and with her smiling countenance and with her joyous simple heart straight on into nothing that she had been allured by conscience and justice and purity and truth on on till with arms outstretched to embrace them she stepped over a precipice beneath which yawned annihilation no agnes she felt sure was happy somehow somewhere or justice was a senseless word how strange she further thought that every one whom i have known endowed with superior excellence men like sebastian women like agnes should turn out to have belonged to the scorned race of christians one only remains and to morrow i will interrogate her when she turned from these and looked round upon the heathen world fulvius tertullus the emperor calpurnius nay she shuddered as she surprised herself on the point of mentioning her own fathers name it sickened her to see the contrast of baseness with nobleness vice with virtue stupidity with wisdom and the sensual with the spiritual her mind was thus being shaped into a mould which some form of practical excellence must be found to fill or it must be broken her soul was craving as a parched soil which heaven must send its waters to refresh or it must become an eternal desert agnes surely well deserved the glory of gaining by her death her kinswomans conversion but was there not one more humble who had established a prior claim one who had given up freedom and offered life for this unselfish gain while fabiola was alone and desolate she was disturbed by the entrance of a stranger introduced under the ominous title of a messenger from the emperor the porter had at first denied him admittance but upon being assured that he bore an important embassy from the sovereign he felt obliged to inquire from the steward what to do when he was informed that no one with such a claim could be refused entrance fabiola was amazed and her displeasure was somewhat mitigated by the ridiculous appearance of the person deputed in such a solemn character it was corvinus who with clownish grace approached her and in a studied speech evidently got up very floridly and intrusted to a bad memory laid at her feet an imperial rescript and his own sincere affection the lady agness estates and his clumsy hand fabiola could not at all comprehend the connection between the two combined presents and never imagined that the one was a bribe for the other so she desired him to return her humble thanks to the emperor for his gracious act adding say that i am too ill to day to present myself and do him homage but these estates you are aware were forfeited and confiscated he gasped out in great confusion and my father has obtained them for you that was unnecessary said fabiola for they were settled on me long ago and became mine the moment she faltered and after a strong effort at self mastery she continued the moment they ceased to be anothers they did not fall under confiscation corvinus was dumb foundered at last he stumbled into something meant for an humble petition to be admitted as an aspirant after her hand but understood by fabiola to be a demand of recompense for procuring or bringing so important a document she assured him that every claim he might have on her should be fully and honorably considered at a more favorable moment but as she was exceedingly wearied and unwell she must beg him to leave her at present he did so quite elated fancying that he had secured his prize after he was gone she hardly looked at the parchment which he had left open on a small table by her couch but sat musing on the sorrowful scenes she had witnessed till it wanted about an hour to sunset sometimes her reveries turned to one point sometimes to another of the late events and at last she was dwelling on her being confronted with fulvius that morning in the forum her memory vividly replaced the entire scene before her and her mind gradually worked itself into a state of painful excitement which she at length checked by saying aloud to herself thank heaven i shall never behold that villains face again the words were scarcely out of her mouth when she shaded her eyes with her hand as she raised herself up on her couch and looked towards the door was it her overheated fancy which beguiled her or did her wakeful eyes show her a reality her ears decided the question by these words which they heard pray madam who is the man whom you honor by that gracious speech you fulvius she said rising with dignity a further intruder still not only into the house the villa and the dungeon but into the most secret apartments of a ladys residence and what is worse into the house of sorrow of one whom you have bereaved begone at once or i will have you ignominiously expelled hence sit down and compose yourself lady rejoined the intruder this is my last visit to you but we have a reckoning to make together of some weight as to crying out or bringing in help you need not trouble yourself your orders to your servants to keep aloof have been too well obeyed there is no one within call it was true fulvius found the way prepared unwittingly for him by corvinus for upon presenting himself at the door the porter who had seen him twice dine at the house told him of the strict orders given and assured him that he could not be admitted unless he came from the emperor for such were his instructions that fulvius said was exactly his case and the porter wondering that so many imperial messengers should come in one day let him pass he begged that the door might be left unfastened in case the porter should not be at his post when he retired for he was in a hurry and should not like to disturb the house in such a state of grief he added that he required no guide for he knew the way to fabiolas apartment fulvius seated himself opposite to the lady and continued you ought not to be offended madam with my unexpectedly coming upon you and overhearing your amiable soliloquies about myself it is a lesson i learned from yourself in the tullian prison but i must begin my scores from an earlier date when for the first time i was invited by your worthy father to his table i met one whose looks and words at once gained my affections i need not now mention her name and whose heart with instinctive sympathy returned them insolent man fabiola exclaimed to allude to such a topic here it is false that any such affection ever existed on either side as to the lady agnes resumed fulvius i have the best authority that of your lamented parent who more than once encouraged me to persevere in my suit by assuring me that his cousin had confided to him her reciprocating love fabiola was mortified for she now remembered that this was too true from the hints which fabius had given her of his stupid misunderstanding i know well that my dear father was under a delusion upon this subject but i from whom that dear child concealed nothing except her religion interrupted fulvius with bitter irony peace fabiola went on that word sounds like a blasphemy on your lips i knew that you were but an object of loathing and abhorrence to her yes after you had made me such from that hour of our first meeting you became my bitter and unrelenting foe in conspiracy with that treacherous officer who has received his reward and whom you had destined for the place i courted repress your indignation lady for i will be heard out you undermined my character you poisoned her feelings and you turned my love into necessary enmity your love now broke in the indignant lady even if all that you have said were not basely false what love could you have for her how could you appreciate her artless simplicity her genuine honesty her rare understanding her candid innocence any more than the wolf can value the lambs gentleness or the vulture the doves mildness no it was her wealth her family connection her nobility that you grasped at and nothing more i read it in the very flash of your eye when first it fixed itself as a basilisks upon her it is false he rejoined had i obtained my request had i been thus worthily mated i should have been found equal to my position domestic contented and affectionate as worthy of possessing her as as any one can be struck in fabiola who in offering his hand expresses himself equally ready in three hours to espouse or to murder the object of his affection and she prefers the latter and he keeps his word begone from my presence you taint the very atmosphere in which you move i will leave when i have accomplished my task and you will have little reason to rejoice when i do you have then purposely and unprovoked blighted and destroyed in me every honorable purpose of life withered my only hope cut me off from rank society respectable ease and domestic happiness that was not enough after acting in that character with which you summed up my condemnation of a spy and listened to my conversation you this morning threw off all sense of female propriety and stood forward prominently in the forum to complete in public what you had begun in private excite against me the supreme tribunal and through it the emperor and arouse an unjust popular outcry and vengeance such as but for a feeling stronger than fear which brings me hither would make me now skulk like a hunted wolf till i could steal out of the nearest gate and fulvius i tell you interposed fabiola that the moment you cross its threshold the average of virtue will be raised in this wicked city again i bid you depart from my house at least or at any rate i will withdraw from this offensive intrusion we part not yet lady said fulvius whose countenance had been growing every moment more flushed as his lips had been becoming more deadly pale he rudely grasped her arm and pushed her back to her seat and beware he added how you attempt again either to escape or to bring aid your first cry will be your last cost me what it may you have made me then an outcast not only from society but from rome an exile a houseless wanderer on a friendless earth was not that enough to satisfy your vengeance no you must needs rob me of my gold of my rightfully though painfully earned wealth peace reputation my means of subsistence all you have stolen from me a youthful stranger wicked and insolent man exclaimed now the indignant roman lady reckless of consequences you shall answer heavily for your temerity dare you in my own house call me a thief i dare and i tell you this is your day of reckoning and not mine i have earned even if by crime it is nothing to you my full share of your cousins confiscated property i have earned it hardly by pangs and rendings of the heart and soul by sleepless nights of struggles with fiends that have conquered ay and with one at home that is sterner than they by days and days of restless search for evidence amidst the desolation of a proud but degraded spirit have i not a right to enjoy it ay call it what you will call it my blood money the more infamous it is the more base in you to step in and snatch it from me it is like a rich man tearing the carrion from the hounds jaws after he has swollen his feet and rent his skin in hunting it down i will not seek for further epithets by which to call you your mind is deluded by some vain dream said fabiola with an earnestness not untinged with alarm she felt she was in the presence of a madman one in whom violent passion carried off by an unchecked deeply moved fancy was lashing itself up to that intensity of wicked excitement which constitutes a moral frenzy when the very murderer thinks himself a virtuous avenger fulvius she continued with studied calmness and looking fully into his eyes i now entreat you to go if you want money you shall have it but go in heavens name go before you destroy your reason by your anger what vain fancy do you mean asked fulvius why that i should have ever dreamt about agness wealth or property on such a day or should have taken any advantage of her cruel death and yet it is so i have it from the emperors mouth that he has made it over to you will you pretend to make me believe that this most generous and liberal prince ever parted with a penny unsolicited ay or unbribed of this i know nothing but i know that i would rather have died of want than petitioned for a farthing of such property then would you make me rather believe that in this city there is any one so disinterested as undesired to have petitioned for you no no lady fabiola all this is too incredible but what is that and he pounced with eagerness on the imperial rescript which had remained unlooked at since corvinus had left it the sensation to him was like that of neas when he saw pallass belt upon the body of turnus the fury which seemed to have been subdued by his subtlety as he had been reasoning to prove fabiola guilty flashed up anew at the sight of this fatal document he eyed it for a minute then broke out gnashing his teeth with rage now madam i convict you of baseness rapacity and unnatural cruelty far beyond any thing you have dared to charge on me look at this rescript beautifully engrossed with its golden letters and emblazoned margins and presume to say that it was prepared in the one hour that elapsed between your cousins death and the emperors telling me that he had signed it nor do you pretend to know the generous friend who procured you the gift bah while agnes was in prison at latest while you were whining and moaning over her while you were reproaching me for cruelty and treachery towards her me a stranger and alien to her you the gentle lady the virtuous philosopher the loving fondling kinswoman you my stern reprover were coolly plotting to take advantage of my crime for securing her property and seeking out the elegant scribe who should gild your covetousness with his pencil and paint over your treason to your own flesh and blood with his blushing minium cease madman cease exclaimed fabiola endeavoring in vain to master his glaring eye but he went on in still wilder tone and then forsooth when you have thus basely robbed me you offer me money you have out plotted me and you pity me you have made me a beggar and then you offer me alms alms out of my own wages the wages which even hell allows its fated victims while on earth fabiola rose again but he seized her with a maniacs gripe and this time did not let her go he went on now listen to the last words that i will speak or they may be the last that you will hear give back to me that unjustly obtained property it is not fair that i should have the guilt and you its reward transfer it by your sign manual to me as a free and loving gift and i will depart if not you have signed your own doom a stern and menacing glance accompanied these words fabiolas haughty self rose again erect within her her roman heart unsubdued stood firm danger only made her fearless she gathered her robe with matronly dignity around her and replied fulvius listen to my words though they should be the last that i may speak as certainly they shall be the last that you shall hear from me surrender this property to you i would give it willingly to the first leper that i might meet in the street but to you never never shall you touch thing that belonged to that holy maiden be it a gem or be it a straw that touch would be pollution take gold of mine if it please you but any thing that ever belonged to her from me no treasures can ransom and one legacy i prize more than all her inheritance you have now offered me two alternatives as last night you did her to yield to your demands or die agnes taught me which to choose once again i say depart and leave you to possess what is mine leave you to triumph over me as one whom you have outwitted you honored and i disgraced you rich and i penniless you happy and i wretched no never i cannot save myself from what you have made me but i can prevent your being what you have no right to be for this i have come here this is my day of nemesis now die while he was speaking these reproaches he was slowly pushing her backwards with his left hand towards the couch from which she had risen while his right was tremblingly feeling for something in the folds of his bosom as he finished his last word he thrust her violently down upon the couch and seized her by the hair she made no resistance she uttered no cry partly a fainting and sickening sensation came over her partly a noble feeling of self respect checked any unseemly exhibition of fear before a scornful enemy just as she closed her eyes she saw something like lightning above her she could not tell whether it was his glaring eye or flashing steel in another moment she felt oppressed and suffocated as if a great weight had fallen upon her and a hot stream was flowing over her bosom a sweet voice full of earnestness sounded in her ears cease orontius i am thy sister miriam fulvius in accents choked by passion replied it is false give me up my prey a few words more were faintly spoken in a tongue unknown to fabiola when she felt her hair released heard the dagger dashed to the ground and fulvius cry out bitterly as he rushed out of the room o christ this is thy nemesis fabiolas strength was returning but she felt the weight upon her increase she struggled and released herself another body was lying in her place apparently dead and covered with blood it was the faithful syra who had thrown herself between her mistresss life and her brothers dagger chapter xxxi dionysius c c the great thoughts which this occurrence would naturally have suggested to the noble heart of fabiola were suppressed for a time by the exigencies of the moment her first care was to stanch the flowing blood with whatever was nearest at hand while she was engaged in this work there was a general rush of servants towards her apartment the stupid porter had begun to be uneasy at fulviuss long stay the reader has now heard his real name when he saw him dash out of the door like a maniac and thought he perceived stains of blood upon his garment he immediately gave the alarm to the entire household fabiola by a gesture stopped the crowd at the door of her room and desired only euphrosyne and her greek maid to enter the latter since the influence of the black slave had been removed had attached herself most affectionately to syra as we must still call her and had with great docility listened to her moral instructions a slave was instantly despatched for the physician who had always been sent for by syra in illness dionysius who as we have already observed lived in the house of agnes in the meantime fabiola had been overjoyed at finding the blood cease to flow so rapidly and still more at seeing her servant open her eyes upon her though only for a moment she would not have exchanged for any wealth the sweet smile which accompanied that look illustration cemetery of callistus in a few minutes the kind physician arrived he carefully examined the wound and pronounced favorably on it for the present the blow as aimed would have gone straight to fabiolas heart but her loving servant in spite of prohibition had been hovering near her mistress during the whole day never intruding but anxious for any opportunity which might offer of seconding those good impressions of grace which the mornings scenes could not fail to have produced while in a neighboring room she heard violent tones which were too familiar to her ears and hastened noiselessly round and within the curtain which covered the door of fabiolas own apartment she stood concealed in the dusk on the very spot where agnes had a few months before consoled her she had not been there long when the last struggle commenced while the man was pushing her mistress backwards she followed him close behind and as he was lifting his arm passed him and threw her body over that of his victim the blow descended but misdirected through the shock she gave his arm and it fell upon her neck where it inflicted a deep wound checked however by encountering the collar bone we need not say what it cost her to make this sacrifice not the dread of pain nor the fear of death could for a moment have deterred her it was the horror of imprinting on her brothers brow the mark of cain the making him doubly a fratricide which deeply anguished her but she had offered her life for her mistress to have fought with the assassin whose strength and agility she knew would have been useless to try to alarm the house before one fatal blow was struck was hopeless and nothing remained but to accomplish her immolation by substituting herself for the intended victim still she wished to spare her brother the consummation of his crime and in doing so manifested to fabiola their relationship and their real names in his blind fury he refused her credit but the words in their native tongue which said remember my scarf which you picked up here brought back to his memory so terrible a domestic tale that had the earth opened a cavern in that moment before his feet he would have leaped into it to bury his remorse and shame strange too it proved that he should not have ever allowed eurotas to get possession of that family relic but should ever since he regained it have kept it apart as a sacred thing and when all else was being packed up should have folded it up and put it in his breast and now in the act of drawing out his eastern dagger he had plucked this out too and both were found upon the floor dionysius immediately after dressing the wound and administering proper restoratives which brought back consciousness desired the patient to be left perfectly quiet to see as few persons as possible so as to prevent excitement and to go on with the treatment which he prescribed until midnight i will call he added very early in the morning when i must see my patient alone he whispered a few words in her ear which seemed to do her more good than all his medicines for her countenance brightened into an angelic smile fabiola had her placed in her own bed and allotting to her attendants the outward room reserved to herself exclusively the privilege as she deemed it of nursing the servant to whom a few months before she could hardly feel grateful for having tended her in fever she had informed the others how the wound had been inflicted concealing the relationship between her assailant and her deliverer although herself exhausted and feverish she would not leave the bedside of the patient and when midnight was past and no more remedies had to be administered she sank to rest upon a low couch close to the bed and now what were her thoughts when in the dim light of a sick room she opened her mind and heart to them they were simple and earnest she saw at once the reality and truth of all that her servant had ever spoken to her when she last conversed with her the principles which she heard with delight had appeared to her wholly beyond practice beautiful theories which could not be brought to action when miriam had described a sphere of virtue wherein no approbation or reward of man was to be expected but only the approving eye of god she had admired the idea which powerfully seized her generous mind but she had rebelled against its becoming the constraining rule of hourly conduct yet if the stroke under which she cast herself had proved fatal as it might easily have done where would have been her reward what then could have been her motive but that very theory as it seemed of responsibility to an unseen power and when miriam had discoursed of heroism in virtue as being its ordinary standard how chimerical the principle had seemed yet here without preparation without forethought without excitement without glory nay with marked desire of concealment this slave had performed a deed of self sacrifice heroic in every way from what could that result but from habitual heroism of virtue ready at any hour to do what would ennoble forever a soldiers name she was no dreamer then no theorist but a serious real practiser of all that she taught could this be a philosophy oh no it must be a religion the religion of agnes and of sebastian to whom she considered miriam every way equal how she longed to converse with her again early in the morning according to his promise the physician returned and found his patient much improved he desired to be left alone with her when having spread a linen cloth upon the table and placed lighted tapers upon it he drew from his bosom an embroidered scarf and uncovered a golden box the sacred contents of which she well knew approaching her he said my dear child as i promised you i have now brought you not merely the truest remedy of every ailment bodily and spiritual but the very physician himself who by his word alone restoreth all things whose touch opens the eyes of the blind and the ears of the deaf whose will cleanses lepers the hem of whose garment sends forth virtue to cure all are you ready to receive him with all my heart she replied clasping her hands i long to possess him whom alone i have loved in whom i have believed to whom my heart belongs does no anger or indignation exist in your soul against him who has injured you does any pride or vanity arise in your mind at the thought of what you have done or are you conscious of any other fault requiring humble confession and absolution before receiving the sacred gift into your breast full of imperfection and sin i know myself to be venerable father but i am not conscious of any knowing offence i have had no need to forgive him to whom you allude i love him too much for that and would willingly give my life to save him and of what have i to be proud a poor servant who have only obeyed my lords commands invite then my child this lord into your house that coming he may heal you and fill you with his grace approaching the table he took from it a particle of the blessed eucharist in the form of unleavened bread which being dry he moistened in water and placed within her lips she closed them upon it and remained for some time absorbed in contemplation and thus did the holy dionysius discharge his twofold office of physician and priest attributed to him on his tomb chapter xxxii the sacrifice accepted through the whole of that day the patient seemed occupied with deep but most pleasing thoughts fabiola who never left her except for moments to give necessary directions watched her countenance with a mixture of awe and delight it appeared as if her servants mind were removed from surrounding objects and conversing in a totally different sphere now a smile passed like a sunbeam across her features now a tear trembled in her eye or flowed down her cheeks sometimes her pupils were raised and kept fixed on heaven for a considerable time while a blissful look of perfect and calm enjoyment sat unvarying upon her and then she would turn round with an expression of infinite tenderness towards her mistress and hold out her hand to be clasped in hers and fabiola could sit thus for hours in silence which was as yet prescribed feeling it an honor and thinking it did her good to be in contact with such a rare type of virtue at length in the course of the day after giving her patient some nourishment she said to her smiling i think you are much better miriam already your physician must have given you some wonderful medicine indeed he has my dearest mistress fabiola was evidently pained and leaning over her said softly oh do not i entreat you call me by such a title if it has to be used it should be by me towards you but in fact it is no longer true for what i long intended has now been done and the instrument of your liberation has been ordered to be made out not as a freedwoman but as an ingenua for such i know you are miriam looked her thanks for fear of further hurting fabiolas feelings and they continued to be happy together in silence towards evening dionysius returned and found so great an improvement that ordering more nourishing food he permitted a little quiet conversation i must now said fabiola so soon as they were alone fulfill the first duty which my heart has been burning to discharge that of thanking you i wish i knew a stronger word not for the life which you have saved me but for the magnanimous sacrifice which you made for it and let me add the unequalled example of heroic virtue which alone inspired it after all what have i done but simple duty you had a right to my life for a much less cause than to save yours answered miriam no doubt responded fabiola it appears so to you who have been trained to the doctrine which overpowered me that the most heroic acts ought to be considered by men as performances of ordinary duties and thereby rejoined miriam they cease to be what you have called them no no exclaimed fabiola with enthusiasm do not try to make me mean and vile to my own heart by teaching me to undervalue what i cannot but prize as an unrivalled act of virtue i have been reflecting on it night and day since i witnessed it and my heart has been yearning to speak to you of it and even yet i dare not or i should oppress your weakness with my overcharged feelings it was noble it was grand it was beyond all reach of praise though i know you do not want it i cannot see any way in which the sublimeness of the act could have been enhanced or human virtue rise one step higher miriam who was now raised to a reclining position took fabiolas hand between both hers and turning round towards her in a soft and mild but most earnest tone thus addressed her good and gentle lady for one moment listen to me not to depreciate what you are good enough to value since it pains you to hear it but to teach you how far we still are from what might have been done let me trace for you a parallel scene but where all shall be reversed let it be a slave pardon me dear fabiola for another pang i see it in your face but it shall be the last yes a slave brutish ungrateful rebellious to the most benign and generous of masters and let the stroke not of an assassin but of the minister of justice impend over his head what would you call the act how would you characterize the virtue of that master if out of pure love and that he might reclaim that wretched man he should rush beneath the axes blow ay and its preceding ignominious stripes and leave written in his will that he made that slave heir to his titles and his wealth and desired him to be considered as his brother o miriam miriam you have drawn a picture too sublime to be believed of man you have not eclipsed your own deed for i spoke of human virtue to act as you have now described would require if possible that of a god miriam pressed the folded hand to her bosom fixed on fabiolas wondering eyes a look of heavenly inspiration as she sweetly and solemnly replied and jesus christ who did all this for man was truly god fabiola covered her face with both her hands and for a long time was silent miriam prayed earnestly in her own tranquil heart miriam i thank you from my soul at length fabiola said you have fulfilled your promise of guiding me for some time i have only been fearing that you might not be a christian but it could not be now tell me are those awful but sweet words which you just now uttered which have sunk into my heart as deeply as silently and as irrevocably as a piece of gold dropped upon the surface of the still ocean goes down into its depths are those words a mere part of the christian system or are they its essential principle from a simple allegory dear lady your powerful mind has in one bound reached and grasped the master key of our whole teaching the alembic of your fine understanding has extracted and condensed into one thought the most vital and prominent doctrines of christianity you have distilled them into their very essence that man gods creature and bondsman rebelled against his lord that justice irresistible had doomed and pursued him that this very lord took the form of a servant and in habit was found like a man that in this form he suffered stripes buffets mockery and shameful death became the crucified one as men here call him and thereby rescued man from his fate and gave him part in his own riches and kingdom all this is comprised in the words that i have spoken and you had reached the right conclusion only god could have performed so godlike an action or have offered so sublime an expiation fabiola was again wrapped up in silent thought till she timidly asked and was it to this that you referred in campania when you spoke of god alone being a victim worthy of god yes but i further alluded to the continuation of that sacrifice even in our own days by a marvellous dispensation of an all powerful love however on this i must not yet speak fabiola resumed i every moment see how all that you have ever spoken to me coheres and fits together like the parts of one plant all springing one from another i thought it bore only the lovely flowers of an elegant theory you have shown me in your conduct how these can ripen into sweet and solid fruit in the doctrine which you have just explained i seem to myself to find the noble stem from which all the others branch forth even to that very fruit for who would refuse to do for another what is much less than god has done for him but miriam there is a deep and unseen root whence springs all this possibly dark beyond contemplation deep beyond reach complex beyond mans power to unravel yet perhaps simple to a confiding mind if in my present ignorance i can venture to speak it should be vast enough to occupy all nature rich enough to fill creation with all that is good and perfect in it strong enough to bear the growth of your noble tree till its summit reach above the stars and its branches to the ends of earth i mean your idea of that god whom you made me fear when you spoke to me as a philosopher of him and taught me to know as the ever present watchman and judge but whom i am sure you will make me love when as a christian you exhibit him to me as the root and origin of such boundless tenderness and mercy without some deep mystery in his nature as yet unknown to me i cannot fully apprehend that wonderful doctrine of mans purchase fabiola responded miriam more learned teachers than i should undertake the instruction of one so gifted and so acute but will you believe me if i attempt to give you some explanation miriam replied fabiola with strong emphasis one who is ready to die for another will certainly not deceive him and now rejoined the patient smiling you have again seized a great principle that of faith i will therefore be only the simple narrator of what jesus christ who truly died for us has taught us you will believe my word only as that of a faithful witness you will accept his as that of an unerring god fabiola bowed her head and listened with reverential mind to her in whom she had long honored a teacher of marvellous wisdom which she drew from some unknown school but whom now she almost worshipped as an angel who could open to her the flood gates of the eternal ocean whose waters are the unfathomable wisdom overflowing on earth miriam expounded in the simple terms of catholic teaching the sublime doctrine of the trinity then after relating the fall of man unfolded the mystery of the incarnation giving in the very words of st john the history of the eternal word till he was made flesh and dwelt among men often was she interrupted by the expressions of admiration or assent which her pupil uttered never by cavil or doubt philosophy had given place to religion captiousness to docility incredulity to faith but now a sadness seemed to have come over fabiolas heart miriam read it in her looks and asked her its cause i hardly dare tell you she replied but all that you have related to me is so beautiful so divine that it seems to me necessarily to end here the word what a noble name that is the expression of gods love the externation of his wisdom the evidence of his power the very breath of his life giving life which is himself becometh flesh who shall furnish it to him shall he take up the cast off slough of a tainted humanity or shall a new manhood be created expressly for him shall he take his place in a double genealogy receiving thus into himself a twofold tide of corruption and shall there be any one on earth daring and high enough to call himself his father no softly whispered miriam but there shall be one holy enough and humble enough to be worthy to call herself his mother almost years before the son of god came into the world a prophet spoke and recorded his words and deposited the record of them in the hands of the jews christs inveterate enemies and his words were these behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and his name shall be called emanuel which in the hebrew language signifies god with us that is with men this prophecy was of course fulfilled in the conception and birth of gods son on earth and who was she asked fabiola with great reverence one whose very name is blessed by every one that truly loves her son mary is the name by which you will know her miriam its original in her own tongue is the one by which i honor her well you may suppose was she prepared for such high destiny by holiness and virtue not as cleansed but as ever clean not as purified but as always pure not freed but exempted from sin the tide of which you spoke found before her the dam of an eternal decree which could not brook that the holiness of god should mingle with what it could only redeem by keeping extraneous to itself bright as the blood of adam when the breath of god sent it sparkling through his veins pure as the flesh of eve while standing yet in the mould of the almighty hands as they drew it from the side of the slumbering man were the blood and the flesh which the spirit of god formed into the glorious humanity that mary gave to jesus and after this glorious privilege granted to our sex are you surprised that many like your sweet agnes should have chosen this peerless virgin as the pattern of their lives should find in her whom god so elected the model of every virtue and should in preference to allowing themselves to be yoked even by the tenderest of ties to the chariot wheels of this world seek to fly upwards on wings of undivided love like hers after a pause and some reflection miriam proceeded briefly to detail the history of our saviours birth his laborious youth his active but suffering public life and then his ignominious passion often was the narrative interrupted by the tears and sobs of the willing listener and ready learner at last the time for rest had come when fabiola humbly asked are you too fatigued to answer one question more no was the cheerful reply what hope said fabiola can there be for one who cannot say she was ignorant for she pretended to know every thing nor that she neglected to learn for she affected eagerness after every sort of knowledge but can only confess that she scorned the true wisdom and blasphemed its giver for one who has scoffed at the very torments which proved the love and sneered at the death which was the ransoming of him whom she has mocked at as the crucified a flood of tears stopped her speech miriam waited till their relieving flow had subsided into that gentler dew which softens the heart then in soothing tones addressed her as follows in the days of our lord there lived a woman who bore the same name as his spotless mother but she had sinned publicly degradingly as you fabiola would abhor to sin she became acquainted we know not how with her redeemer in the secrecy of her own heart she contemplated earnestly till she came to love intensely his gracious and condescending familiarity with sinners and his singular indulgence and forgivingness to the fallen she loved and loved still more and forgetting herself she only thought how she might manifest her love so that it might bring honor however slight to him and shame however great on herself she went into the house of a rich man where the usual courtesies of hospitality had been withheld from its divine guest into the house of a haughty man who spurned in the presumption of his heart the public sinner she supplied the attentions which had been neglected to him whom she loved and she was scorned as she expected for her obtrusive sorrow how did she do this miriam she knelt at his feet as he sat at table she poured out upon them a flood of tears she wiped them with her luxurious hair she kissed them fervently and she anointed them with rich perfume and what was the result she was defended by jesus against the carping gibes of his host she was told that she was forgiven on account of her love and was dismissed with kindest comfort and what became of her when on calvary he was crucified two women were privileged to stand close to him mary the sinless and mary the penitent to show how unsullied and repentant love may walk hand in hand beside him who said that he had come to call not the just but sinners to repentance no more was said that night miriam fatigued with her exertion sank into a placid slumber fabiola sat by her side filled to her hearts brim with this tale of love she pondered over it again and again and she still saw more and more how every part of this wonderful system was consistent for if miriam had been ready to die for her in imitation of her saviours love so had she been as ready to forgive her when she had thoughtlessly injured her every christian she now felt ought to be a copy a representative of his master but the one that slumbered so tranquilly beside her was surely true to her model and might well represent him to her when after some time miriam awoke she found her mistress for her patent of freedom was not yet completed lying at her feet over which she had sobbed herself to sleep she understood at once the full meaning and merit of this self humiliation she did not stir but thanked god with a full heart that her sacrifice had been accepted fabiola on awaking crept back to her own couch as she thought unobserved a secret sharp pang it had cost her to perform this act of self abasement but she had thoroughly humbled the pride of her heart she felt for the first time that her heart was christian chapter xxxiii miriams history the next morning when dionysius came he found both patient and nurse so radiant and so happy that he congratulated them both on having had a good nights rest both laughed at the idea but concurred in saying that it had been the happiest night of their lives dionysius was surprised till miriam taking the hand of fabiola said venerable priest of god i confide to your fatherly care this catechumen who desires to be fully instructed in the mysteries of our holy faith and to be regenerated by the waters of eternal salvation what asked fabiola amazed are you more than a physician i am my child the old man replied unworthily i hold likewise the higher office of a priest in gods church fabiola unhesitatingly knelt before him and kissed his hand the priest placed his right hand upon her head and said to her be of good courage daughter you are not the first of your house whom god has brought into his holy church it is now many years since i was called in here under the guise of a physician by a former servant now no more but in reality it was to baptize a few hours before her death the wife of fabius my mother exclaimed fabiola she died immediately after giving me birth and did she die a christian yes and i doubt not that her spirit has been hovering about you through life by the side of the angel who guards you guiding you unseen to this blessed hour and before the throne of god she has been unceasing in her supplications on your behalf joy tenfold filled the breasts of the two friends and after arrangements had been made with dionysius for the necessary instructions and preparations for fabiolas admission to baptism she went up to the side of miriam and taking her hand said to her in a low soft voice miriam may i from henceforth call you sister a pressure of the hand was the only reply which she could give with their mistress the old nurse euphrosyne and the greek slave placed themselves as we now say under instruction to receive baptism on easter eve nor must we forget one who was already enrolled in the list of catechumens and whom fabiola had taken home with her and kept emerentiana the foster sister of agnes it was her delight to make herself useful by being the ready messenger between the sick room and the rest of the house during her illness as her strength improved miriam imparted many particulars of her previous life to fabiola and as they will throw some light on our preceding narrative we will give her history in a continuous form some years before our story commenced there lived in antioch a man who though not of ancient family was rich and moved in the highest circles of that most luxurious city to keep his position he was obliged to indulge in great expense and from want of strict economy he had gradually become oppressed with debt he was married to a lady of great virtue who became a christian at first secretly and afterwards continued so with her husbands reluctant consent in the meantime their two children a son and daughter had received their domestic education under her care the former orontius so called from the favorite stream which watered the city was fifteen when his father first discovered his wifes religion he had learnt much from his mother of the doctrines of christianity and had been with her an attendant on christian worship and hence he possessed a dangerous knowledge of which he afterwards made so fatal a use but he had not the least inclination to embrace the doctrines or adopt the practices of christianity nor would he hear of preparing for baptism he was wilful and artful with no love for any restraint upon his passions or for any strict morality he looked forward to distinction in the world and to his full share in all its enjoyments he had been and continued to be highly educated and besides the greek language then generally spoken at antioch he was acquainted with latin which he spoke readily and gracefully as we have seen though with a slight foreign accent in the family the vernacular idiom was used with servants and often in familiar conversation orontius was not sorry when his father removed him from his mothers control and insisted that he should continue to follow the dominant and favored religion of the state as to the daughter who was three years younger he did not so much care he deemed it foolish and unmanly to take much trouble about religion to change it especially or abandon that of the empire was he thought a sign of weakness but women being more imaginative and more under the sway of the feelings might be indulged in any fancies of this sort accordingly he permitted his daughter miriam whose name was syrian as the mother belonged to a rich family from edessa to continue in the free exercise of her new faith she became in addition to her high mental cultivation a model of virtue simple and unpretending it was a period we may observe in which the city of antioch was renowned for the learning of its philosophers some of whom were eminent as christians a few years later when the son had reached manhood and had abundantly unfolded his character the mother died before her end she had seen symptoms of her husbands impending ruin and determined that her daughter should not be dependent on his careless administration nor on her sons ominous selfishness and ambition she secured effectually from the covetousness of both her own large fortune which was settled on her daughter she resisted every influence and every art employed to induce her to release this property or allow it to merge in the family resources and be made available towards relieving their embarrassments and on her death bed among other solemn parental injunctions she laid this on her daughters filial sense of duty that she never would allow after coming of age any alteration in this arrangement matters grew worse and worse creditors pressed property had been injudiciously disposed of when a mysterious person called eurotas made his appearance in the family no one but its head seemed to know him and he evidently looked upon him as at once a blessing and a curse the bearer both of salvation and of ruin the reader is in possession of eurotass own revelations it is sufficient to add that being the elder brother but conscious that his rough morose and sinister character did not fit him for sustaining the position of head of the family and administering quietly a settled property and having a haughty ambition to raise his house into a nobler rank and increase even its riches he took but a moderate sum of money as capital vanished for years embarked in the desperate traffic of interior asia penetrated into china and india and came back home with a large fortune and a collection of rare gems which helped his nephews brief career but misguided him to ruin in rome eurotas instead of a rich family into which to pour superfluous wealth found only a bankrupt house to save from ruin but his family pride prevailed and after many reproaches and bitter quarrels with his brother but concealed from all else he paid off his debts by the extinction of his own capital and thus virtually became master of all the wreck of his brothers property and of the entire family after a few years of weary life the father sickened and died on his death bed he told orontius that he had nothing to leave him that all he had lived on for some years the very house over his head belonged to his friend eurotas whose relationship he did not further explain whom he must look up to entirely for support and guidance the youth thus found himself while full of pride ambition and voluptuousness in the hands of a cold hearted remorseless and no less ambitious man who soon prescribed as the basis of mutual confidence absolute submission to his will while he should act in the capacity of an inferior and the understood principle that nothing was too great or too little nothing too good or too wicked to be done to restore family position and wealth to stay at antioch was impossible after the ruin which had overtaken the house with a good capital in hand much might be done elsewhere but now even the sale of all left would scarcely cover the liabilities discovered after the fathers death there was still untouched the sisters fortune and both agreed that this must be got from her every artifice was tried every persuasion employed but she simply and firmly resisted both in obedience to her mothers dying orders and because she had in view the establishment of a house for consecrated virgins in which she intended to pass her days she was now just of legal age to dispose of her own property she offered them every advantage that she could give them proposed that for a time they should all live together upon her means but this did not answer their purpose and when every other course had failed eurotas began to hint that one who stood so much in their way should be got rid of at any cost orontius shuddered at the first proposal of the thought eurotas familiarized him gradually with it till shrinking yet from the actual commission of fratricide he thought he had almost done something virtuous as the brothers of joseph imagined they did by adopting a slower and less sanguinary method of dealing with an obnoxious brother stratagem and unseen violence of which no law could take cognizance and which no one would dare reveal offered him the best chance of success among the privileges of christians in the first ages we have already mentioned that of reserving the blessed eucharist at home for domestic communion we have described the way in which it was enfolded in an orarium or linen cloth again often preserved in a richer cover this precious gift was kept in a chest arca with a lid as st cyprian has informed us orontius well knew this and he was moreover aware that its contents were more prized than silver or gold that as the fathers tell us to drop negligently a crumb of the consecrated bread was considered a crime and that the name of pearl which was given to the smallest fragment showed that it was so precious in a christians eye that he would part with all he possessed to rescue it from sacrilegious profanation the scarf richly embroidered with pearls which has more than once affected our narrative was the outer covering in which miriams mother had preserved this treasure and her daughter valued it both as a dear inheritance and as a consecrated object for she continued its use one day early in the morning she knelt before her ark and after fervent preparation by prayer proceeded to open it to her dismay she found it already unlocked and her treasure gone like mary magdalen at the sepulchre she wept bitterly because they had taken her lord and she knew not where they had laid him like her too as she was weeping she stooped down and looked again into her ark and found a paper which in the confusion of the first glance she had overlooked it informed her that what she sought was safe in her brothers hands and might be ransomed she ran at once to him where he was closeted with the dark man in whose presence she always trembled threw herself on her knees before him and entreated him to restore what she valued more than all her wealth he was on the point of yielding to her tears and supplications when eurotas fixed his stern eye upon him overawed him then himself addressed her saying miriam we take you at your word we wish to put the earnestness and reality of your faith to a sufficient test are you truly sincere in what you offer i will surrender any thing all i have to rescue from profanation the holy of holies then sign that paper said eurotas with a sneer she took the pen in her hand and after running her eye over the document signed it it was a surrender of her entire property to eurotas orontius was furious when he saw himself overreached by the man to whom he had suggested the snare for his sister but it was too late he was only the faster in his unsparing gripe a more formal renunciation of her rights was exacted from miriam with the formalities required by the roman law for a short time she was treated soothingly then hints began to be given to her of the necessity of moving as orontius and his friend intended to proceed to nicomedia the imperial residence she asked to be sent to jerusalem where she would obtain admission into some community of holy women she was accordingly embarked on board a vessel the captain of which bore a suspicious character and was very sparingly supplied with means but she bore round her neck what she had given proof of valuing more than any wealth for as st ambrose relates of his brother satyrus yet a catechumen christians carried round their necks the holy eucharist when embarking for a voyage we need not say that miriam bore it securely folded in the only thing of price she cared to take from her fathers house when the vessel was out at sea instead of coasting towards joppe or any port on the coast the captain stood straight out as if making for some distant shore what his purpose was it was difficult to conjecture but his few passengers became alarmed and a serious altercation ensued this was cut short by a sudden storm the vessel was carried forward at the mercy of the winds for some days and then dashed to pieces on a rocky island near cyprus like satyrus miriam attributed her reaching the shore in safety to the precious burden which she bore she was almost the only survivor at least she saw no other person saved those therefore that did live besides on returning to antioch reported her death together with that of the remaining passengers and crew she was picked up on the shore by men who lived on such spoil destitute and friendless she was sold to a trader in slaves taken to tarsus on the mainland and again sold to a person of high rank who treated her with kindness after a short time fabius instructed one of his agents in asia to procure a slave of polished manners and virtuous character if possible at any price to attend on his daughter and miriam under the name of syra came to bring salvation to the house of fabiola illustration ordination from a picture in the catacombs chapter xxxiv bright death it was a few days after the occurrences related in our last chapter but one that fabiola was told that an old man in great anguish real or pretended desired to speak with her on going down to him and asking him his name and business he replied my name noble lady is ephraim and i have a large debt secured on the property of the late lady agnes which i understand has now passed into your hands and i am come therefore to claim it from you for otherwise i am a ruined man how is that possible asked fabiola in amazement i cannot believe that my cousin ever contracted debts no not she rejoined the usurer a little abashed but a gentleman called fulvius to whom the property was to come by confiscation so i advanced him large sums upon it her first impulse was to turn the man out of the house but the thought of the sister came to her mind and she civilly said to him whatever debts fulvius has contracted i will discharge but with only legal interest and without regard to usurious contracts but think of the risks i ran madam i have been most moderate in my rates i assure you well she answered call on my steward and he shall settle all you are running no risks now at least she gave instructions accordingly to the freed man who managed her affairs to pay this sum on those conditions which reduced it to one half the demand but she soon engaged him in a more laborious task that of going through the whole of her late fathers accounts and ascertaining every case of injury or oppression that restitution might be made and further having ascertained that corvinus had really obtained the imperial rescript through his father by which her own lawful property was saved from confiscation though she refused ever to see him she bestowed upon him such a remuneration as would ensure him comfort through life these temporal matters being soon disposed of she divided her attention between the care of the patient and preparation for her christian initiation to promote miriams recovery she removed her with a small portion of her household to a spot dear to both the nomentan villa the spring had set in and miriam could have her couch brought to the window or in the warmest part of the day could even be carried down into the garden before the house where with fabiola on one side and emerentiana on the other and poor molossus who had lost all his spirit at her feet they would talk of friends lost and especially of her with whom every object around was associated in their memories and no sooner was the name of agnes mentioned than her old faithful guard would prick up his ears and wag his tail and look around him they would also frequently discourse on christian subjects when miriam would follow up humbly and unpretendingly but with the warm glow which had first charmed fabiola the instructions given by the holy dionysius thus for instance when he had been treating of the virtue and meaning of the sign of the cross to be used in baptism whether on the forehead of believers or over the water by which they were to be regenerated or the oil with which as well as the chrism they were anointed or the sacrifice by which they are fed miriam explained to the catechumens its more domestic and practical use and exhorted them to practise faithfully what all good christians did that is to make this holy sign upon themselves already in the course and at the beginning of every work on coming in and going out when putting on their clothes or sandals when they washed sat down to table lighted their lamp lay down in bed or sat on a chair in whatever conversation they should be engaged but it was observed with pain by all but fabiola that the patient though the wound had healed did not gain strength it is often the mother or sister that is last to see the slow waste of illness in child or sister love is so hopeful and so blind there was a hectic flush on her cheek she was emaciated and weak and a slight cough was heard from time to time she lay long awake and she desired to have her bed so placed that from early dawn she could look out upon one spot more fair to them all than the richest parterre there had long been in the villa an entrance to the cemetery on this road but from this time it had already received the name of agnes for near its entrance had this holy martyr been buried her body rested in a cubiculum or chamber under an arched tomb just above the entrance into this chamber and in the middle of the grounds was an opening surrounded above by a low parapet concealed by shrubs illustration fabiola went down herself with a few servants and what was her distress at finding poor emerentiana lying weltering in her blood and perfectly dead which gave light and air to the room below towards this point miriam loved to look as the nearest approach she could make in her infirm health to the sepulchre of one whom she so much venerated and loved early one morning beautiful and calm for it wanted but a few weeks to easter she was looking in that direction when she observed half a dozen young men who on their way to angle in the neighboring anio were taking a short cut across the villa and so committing a trespass they passed by this opening and one of them having looked down called the others this is one of those underground lurking places of the christians one of their rabbit holes into the burrow let us go in said one yes and how shall we get up again asked a second this dialogue she could not hear but she saw what followed it one who had looked down more carefully shading his eyes from the light called the others to do the same but with gestures which enjoined silence in a moment they pulled down large stones from the rock work of a fountain close at hand and threw down a volley of them at something below they laughed very heartily as they went away and miriam supposed that they had seen some serpent or other noxious animal below and had amused themselves with pelting it when others were stirring she mentioned the occurrence that the stones might be removed fabiola went down herself with a few servants for she was jealous of the custody of agness tomb what was her distress at finding poor emerentiana gone down to pray at her foster sisters tomb lying weltering in her blood and perfectly dead it was discovered that the evening before passing by some pagan orgies near the river and being invited to join in them she had not only refused but had reproached the partakers in them with their wickedness and with their cruelties to christians they assailed her with stones and grievously wounded her but she escaped from their fury into the villa feeling herself faint and wounded she crept unnoticed to the tomb of agnes there to pray she had been unable to move away when some of her former assailants discovered her those brutal pagans had anticipated the ministry of the church and had conferred upon her the baptism of blood she was buried near agnes and the modest peasant child received the honor of annual commemoration among the saints fabiola and her companions went through the usual course of preparation though abridged on account of the persecution by living at the very entrance into a cemetery and one furnished with such large churches they were enabled to pass through the three stages of catechumenship first they were hearers admitted to be present while the lessons were read then kneelers who assisted at a portion of the liturgical prayers and lastly elect or petitioners for baptism once in this last class they had to attend frequently in church but more particularly on the three wednesdays following the first the fourth and the last sundays in lent on which days the roman missal yet retains a second collect and lesson derived from this custom any one perusing the present rite of baptism in the catholic church especially that of adults will see condensed into one office what used to be anciently distributed through a variety of functions on one day the renunciation of satan was made previous to its repetition just before baptism on another the touching of the ears and nostrils or the ephpheta as it was called then were illustration baptism in the early ages of the church repeated exorcisms and genuflections and signings of crosses on the forehead and body breathings upon the candidate and other mysterious rites more solemn still was the unction which was not confined to the head but extended to the whole body the creed was also faithfully learnt and committed to memory but the doctrine of the blessed eucharist was not imparted till after baptism in these multiplied preparatory exercises the penitential time of lent passed quickly and solemnly till at last easter eve arrived it does not fall to our lot to describe the ceremonial of the church in the administration of the sacraments the liturgical system received its great developments after peace had been gained and much that belongs to outward forms and splendor was incompatible with the bitter persecution which the church was undergoing it is enough for us to have shown how not only doctrines and great sacred rites but how even ceremonies and accessories were the same in the three first centuries as now if our example is thought worth following some one will perhaps illustrate a brighter period than we have chosen the baptism of fabiola and her household had nothing to cheer it but purely spiritual joy the titles in the city were all closed and among them that of st pastor with its papal baptistery early therefore on the morning of the auspicious day the party crept round the walls to the opposite side of the city and following the via portuensis or road that led to the port at the mouth of the tiber turned into a vineyard near csars gardens and descended into the cemetery of pontianus celebrated as the resting place of the persian martyrs ss abdon and sennen the morning was spent in prayer and preparation when towards evening the solemn office which was to be protracted through the night commenced when the time for the administration of baptism arrived it was indeed but a dreary celebration that it introduced deep in the bowels of the earth the waters of a subterranean stream had been gathered into a square well or cistern from four to five feet deep they were clear indeed but cold and bleak if we may use the expression in their subterranean bath formed out of the tufa or volcanic rock a long flight of steps led down to this rude baptistery a small ledge at the side sufficed for the minister and the candidate who was thrice immersed in the purifying waters the whole remains to this day just as it was then except that over the water is now to be seen a painting of st john baptizing our lord added probably a century or two later immediately after baptism followed confirmation and then the neophyte or new born child of the church after due instruction was admitted for the first time to the table of his lord and nourished with the bread of angels it was not till late on easter day that fabiola returned to her villa and a long and silent embrace was her first greeting of miriam both were so happy so blissful so fully repaid for all that they had been to one another for months that no words could give expression to their feelings fabiolas grand idea and absorbing pride that day was that now she had risen to the level of her former slave not in virtue not in beauty of character not in greatness of mind not in heavenly wisdom not in merit before god oh no in all this she felt herself infinitely her inferior but as a child of god as heiress to an eternal kingdom as a living member of the body of christ as admitted to a share in all his mercies to all the price of his redemption as a new creature in him she felt that she was equal to miriam and with happy glee she told her so never had she been so proud of splendid garment as she was of the white robe which she had received as she came out of the font and which she had to wear for eight days but a merciful father knows how to blend our joys and sorrows and sends us the latter when he has best prepared us for them in that warm embrace which we have mentioned she for the first time noticed the shortened breath and heaving chest of her dear sister she would not dwell upon it in her thoughts but sent to beg dionysius to come on the morrow that evening they all kept their easter banquet together and fabiola felt happy to preside at miriams side over a table at which reclined or sat her own converted slaves and those of agness household all of whom she had retained she never remembered having enjoyed so delightful a supper early next morning miriam called fabiola to her side and with a fond caressing manner which she had never before displayed said to her my dear sister what will you do when i have left you poor fabiola was overpowered with grief are you then going to leave me i had hoped we should live for ever as sisters together but if you wish to leave rome may i not accompany you at least to nurse you to serve you miriam smiled but a tear was in her eye as taking her sisters hand she pointed up towards heaven fabiola understood her and said o no no dearest sister pray to god who will refuse you nothing that i may not lose you it is selfish i know but what can i do without you and now too that i have learnt how much they who reign with christ can do for us by intercession i will pray to agnes and sebastian to interpose for me and avert so great a calamity do get well i am sure there is nothing serious in the matter the warm weather and the genial climate of campania will soon restore you we will sit again together by the spring and talk over better things than philosophy miriam shook her head not mournfully but cheerfully as she replied do not flatter yourself dearest god has spared me till i should see this happy day but his hand is on me now for death as it has been hitherto for life and i hail it with joy i know too well the number of my days oh let it not be so soon sobbed out fabiola not while you have on your white garment dear sister answered miriam i know you would wish to mourn for me but i would not rob you of one hour of your mystic whiteness dionysius came and saw a great change in his patient whom he had not visited for some time it was as he had feared it might be the insidious point of the dagger had curled round the bone and injured the pleura and phthisis illustration administering the sacrament of extreme unction in the early ages of the church had rapidly set in he confirmed miriams most serious anticipations fabiola went to pray for resignation at the sepulchre of agnes she prayed long and fervently and with many tears then returned sister she said with firmness gods will be done i am ready to resign even you to him now tell me i entreat you what would you have me do after you are taken from me miriam looked up to heaven and answered lay my body at the feet of agnes and remain to watch over us to pray to her and for me until a stranger shall arrive from the east the bearer of good tidings on the sunday following sunday of the white garments dionysius celebrated by special permission the sacred mysteries in miriams room and administered to her the most holy communion as her viaticum this private celebration as we know from st augustine and others was not a rare privilege afterwards he anointed her with oil accompanied by prayer the last sacrament which the church bestows fabiola and the household who had attended these solemn rites with tears and prayers now descended into the crypt and after the divine offices returned to miriam in their darker raiment the hour is come said she taking fabiolas hand forgive me if i have been wanting in duty to you and in good example this was more than fabiola could stand and she burst into tears miriam soothed her and said put to my lips the sign of salvation when i can speak no more and good dionysius remember me at gods altar when i am departed he prayed at her side and she replied till at length her voice failed her but her lips moved and she pressed them on the cross presented to her she looked serene and joyful till at length raising her hand to her forehead then bringing it to her breast it fell dead there in making the saving sign a smile passed over her face and she expired as thousands of christs children have expired since fabiola mourned much over her but this time she mourned as they do who have hope illustration portrait of our saviour from the catacomb of st callistus illustration constantine the first christian emperor after a medal of the time part third victory chapter i the stranger from the east we appear to ourselves to be walking in solitude one by one those whose words and actions and even thoughts have hitherto accompanied and sustained us have dropped off and the prospect around looks very dreary but is all this unnatural we have been describing not an ordinary period of peace and every day life but one of warfare strife and battle is it unnatural that the bravest the most heroic should have fallen thick around us we have been reviving the memory of the cruellest persecution which the church ever suffered when it was proposed to erect a column bearing the inscription that the christian name had been extinguished is it strange that the holiest and purest should have been the earliest to be crowned and yet the church of christ has still to sustain many years of sharper persecution than we have described a succession of tyrants and oppressors kept up the fearful war upon her without intermission in one part of the world or another for twenty years even after constantine had checked it wherever his power reached dioclesian galerius maximinus and lucinius in the east maximian and maxentius in the west allowed no rest to the christians under their several dominions like one of those rolling storms which go over half the world visiting various countries with their ravaging energy while their gloomy foreboding or sullen wake simultaneously overshadow them all so did this persecution wreak its fury first on one country then on another destroying every thing christian passing from italy to africa from upper asia to palestine egypt and then back to armenia while it left no place in actual peace but hung like a blighting storm cloud over the entire empire illustration dioclesian after a medal in the cabinet of france illustration lucinius from a gold medal in the french collection illustration maxentius from a silver medal in the french collection illustration galerius maximinus from a silver medal in the french collection and yet the church increased prospered and defied this world of sin pontiff stepped after pontiff at once upon the footstool of the papal throne and upon the scaffold councils were held in the dark halls of the catacombs bishops came to rome at risk of their lives to consult the successor of st peter letters were exchanged between churches far distant and the supreme ruler of christendom and between different churches full of sympathy encouragement and affection bishop succeeded bishop in his see and ordained priests and other ministers to take the place of the fallen and be a mark set upon the bulwarks of the city for the enemys aim and the work of christs imperishable kingdom went on without interruption and without fear of extinction indeed it was in the midst of all these alarms and conflicts that the foundations were being laid of a mighty system destined to produce stupendous effects in after ages the persecution drove many from the cities into the deserts of egypt where the monastic state grew up so as to make the wilderness rejoice and flourish like the lily bud forth and blossom and rejoice with joy and praise and so when dioclesian had been degraded from the purple and had died a peevish destitute old man and galerius had been eaten up alive by ulcers and worms and had acknowledged by public edict the failure of his attempts and maximian herculeus had strangled himself and maxentius had perished in the tiber and maximinus had expired amidst tortures inflicted by divine justice equal to any he had inflicted on christians his very eyes having started from their sockets and licinius had been put to death by constantine the spouse of christ whom they had all conspired to destroy stood young and blooming as ever about to enter into her great career of universal diffusion and rule it was in the year that constantine having defeated maxentius gave full liberty to the church even if ancient writers had not described it we may imagine the joy and gratitude of the poor christians on this great change it was like the coming forth and tearful though happy greeting of the inhabitants of a city decimated by plague when proclamation has gone forth that the infection has ceased for here after ten years of separation and concealment when families could scarcely meet in the cemeteries nearest to them many did not know who among friends or kinsfolk had fallen victims or who might yet survive timid at first and then more courageous they ventured forth soon the places of old assembly which children born in the last ten years had not seen were cleansed or repaired refitted and reconciled and opened to public and now fearless worship illustration the labarum or christian standard from a coin of constantine constantine also ordered all property public or private belonging to christians and confiscated to be restored but with the wise provision that the actual holders should be indemnified by the imperial treasury the church was soon in motion to bring out all the resources of her beautiful forms and institutions and either the existing basilicas were converted to her uses or new ones were built on the most cherished spots of rome let not the reader fear that we are going to lead him forward into a long history this will belong to some one better qualified for the task of unfolding the grandeur and charms of free and unfettered christianity we have only to show the land of promise from above spread like an inviting paradise before our feet we are not the josue that must lead others in the little that we have to add in this brief third part of our humble book is barely what is necessary for its completion we will then suppose ourselves arrived at the year fifteen years after our last scene of death time and permanent laws have given security to the christian religion and the church is likewise more fully establishing her organization illustration a marriage in the early ages of the church many who on the return of peace had hung down their heads having by some act of weak condescension escaped death had by this time expiated their fall by penance and now and then an aged stranger would be saluted reverently by the passers by when they saw that his right eye had been burned out or his hand mutilated or when his halting gait showed that the tendons of the knee had been severed in the late persecution for christs sake if at this period our friendly reader will follow us out of the nomentan gate to the valley with which he is already acquainted he will find sad havoc among the beautiful trees and flower beds of fabiolas villa scaffold poles are standing up in place of the first bricks marbles and columns lie upon the latter constantia the daughter of constantine had prayed at st agness tomb when not yet a christian to beg the cure of a virulent ulcer had been refreshed by a vision and completely cured being now baptized she was repaying her debt of gratitude by building over her tomb her beautiful basilica still the faithful had access to the crypt in which she was buried and great was the concourse of pilgrims that came from all parts of the world one afternoon when fabiola returned from the city to her villa after spending the day in attending to the sick in an hospital established in her own house the fossor who had charge of the cemetery met her with an air of great interest and no small excitement and said madam i sincerely believe that the stranger from the east whom you have so long expected is arrived fabiola who had ever treasured up the dying words of miriam eagerly asked where is he he is gone again was the reply the ladys countenance fell but how she asked again do you know it was he the excavator replied in the course of the morning i noticed among the crowd a man not yet fifty but worn by mortification and sorrow to premature old age his hair was nearly grey as was his long beard his dress was eastern and he wore the cloak which the monks from that country usually do when he came before the tomb of agnes he flung himself upon the pavement with such a passion of tears such groans such sobs as moved all around to compassion many approached him and whispered brother thou art in great distress weep not so the saint is merciful others said to him we will all pray for thee fear not but he seemed to be beyond comfort i thought to myself surely in the presence of so gentle and kind a saint none ought to be thus disconsolate or heart broken except only one man go on go on broke in fabiola what did he next after a long time continued the fossor he arose and drawing from his bosom a most beautiful and sparkling ring he laid it on her tomb i thought i had seen it before many years ago and then turning round he saw me and recognized my dress he approached me and i could feel him trembling as without looking in my face he timidly asked me brother knowest thou if there lie buried any where here about a maiden from syria called miriam i pointed silently to the tomb after a pause of great pain to himself so agitated now that his voice faltered he asked me again knowest thou brother of what she died of consumption i replied thank god he ejaculated with the sigh of relieved anguish and fell prostrate on the ground here too he moaned and cried for more than an hour then approaching the tomb affectionately kissed its cover and retired it is he torquatus it is he warmly exclaimed fabiola why did you not detain him i durst not lady after i had once seen his face i had not courage to meet his eye but i am sure he will return again for he went towards the city illustration noe and the ark as a symbol of the church from a picture in the catacombs he must be found concluded fabiola dear miriam thou hadst then this consoling foresight in death chapter ii the stranger in rome early next morning the pilgrim was passing through the forum when he saw a group of persons gathered round one whom they were evidently teasing he would have paid but little attention to such a scene in a public thoroughfare had not his ear caught a name familiar to it he therefore drew nigh in the centre was a man younger than himself but if he looked older than he was from being wan and attenuated the other did so much more from being the very contrary he was bald and bloated with a face swelled and red and covered with blotches and boils a drunken cunning swam in his eye and his gait and tone were those of a man habitually intoxicated his clothes were dirty and his whole person neglected ay ay corvinus one youth was saying to him wont you get your deserts now have you not heard that constantine is coming this year to rome and dont you think the christians will have their turn about now not they answered the man we have described they have not the pluck for it i remember we feared it when constantine published his first edict after the death of maxentius about liberty for the christians but next year he put us out of fear by declaring all religions to be equally permitted that is all very well as a general rule interposed another determined further to plague him but is it not supposed that he is going to look up those who took an active part in the late persecution and have the lex talionis executed on them stripe for stripe burning for burning and wild beast for wild beast who says so asked corvinus turning pale why it would surely be very natural said one and very just added another oh never mind said corvinus they will always let one off for turning christian and i am sure i would turn any thing rather than stand where pancratius stood interposed a third more malicious hold your tongue broke out the drunkard with a tone of positive rage mention his name again if you dare and he raised his fist and looked furiously at the speaker ay because he told you how you were to die shouted the youngster running away heigh heigh a panther here for corvinus all ran away before the human beast now lashed into fury more than they would have done from the wild one of the desert he cursed them and threw stones after them the pilgrim from a short distance watched the close of the scene then went on corvinus moved slowly along the same road that which led towards the lateran basilica now the cathedral of rome suddenly a sharp growl was heard and with it a piercing shriek as they were passing by the coliseum near the dens of the wild beasts which were prepared for combats among themselves on occasion of the emperors visit corvinus impelled by the morbid curiosity natural to persons who consider themselves victims of some fatality connected with a particular object approached the cage in which a splendid panther was kept he went close to the bars and provoked the animal by gestures and words saying very likely indeed that you are to be the death of me you are very safe in your den in that instant the enraged animal made a spring at him and through the wide bars of the den caught his neck and throat in its fangs and inflicted a frightful lacerated wound the wretched man was picked up and carried to his lodgings not far off the stranger followed him and found them mean dirty and uncomfortable in the extreme with only an old and decrepit slave apparently as sottish as his master to attend him the stranger sent him out to procure a surgeon who was long in coming and in the meantime did his best to stanch the blood while he was so occupied corvinus fixed his eyes upon him with a look of one delirious or demented do you know me asked the pilgrim soothingly know you no yes let me see ha the fox my fox do you remember our hunting together those hateful christians where have you been all this time how many of them have you caught and he laughed outrageously peace peace corvinus replied the other you must be very quiet or there is no hope for you besides i do not wish you to allude to those times for i am myself now a christian you a christian broke out corvinus savagely you who have shed more of their best blood than any man have you been forgiven for all this or have you slept quietly upon it have no furies lashed you at night no phantoms haunted you no viper sucked your heart if so tell me how you have got rid of them all that i may do the same if not they will come they will come vengeance and fury why should they not have tormented you as much as me silence corvinus i have suffered as you have but i have found the remedy and will make it known to you as soon as the physician has seen you for he is approaching the doctor saw him dressed the wound but gave little hope of recovery especially in a patient whose very blood was tainted by intemperance the stranger now resumed his seat beside him and spoke of the mercy of god and his readiness to forgive the worst of sinners whereof he himself was a living proof the unhappy man seemed to be in a sort of stupor if he listened not comprehending what was said at length his kind instructor having expounded to him the fundamental mysteries of christianity in hope rather than certainty of being attended to went on to say and now corvinus you will ask me how is forgiveness to be applied to one who believes all this it is by baptism by being born again of water and the holy ghost what exclaimed the sick man loathingly by being washed in the laver of regenerating water he was interrupted by a convulsive growl rather than a moan water water no water for me take it away and a strong spasm seized the patients throat his attendant was alarmed but sought to calm him think not he said that you are to be taken hence in your present fever and to be plunged into water the sick man shuddered and moaned in clinical baptism a few drops suffice not more than is in this pitcher and he showed him the water in a small vessel at the sight of it the patient writhed and foamed at the mouth and was shaken by a violent convulsion the sounds that proceeded from him resembled a howl from a wild beast more than any utterance of human lips the pilgrim saw at once that hydrophobia with all its horrible symptoms had come upon the patient from the bite of the enraged animal it was with difficulty that he and the servant could hold him down at times occasionally he broke out into frightful paroxysms of blasphemous violence against god and man and then when this subsided he would go on moaning thus water they want to give me water water none for me it is fire fire that i have and that is my portion i am already on fire within without look how it comes creeping up all round me it advances every moment nearer and nearer and he beat off the fancied flame with his hands on either side of his bed and he blew at it round his head then turning towards his sorrowful attendants he would say why dont you put it out you see it is already burning me thus passed the dreary day and thus came the dismal night when the fever increased and with it the delirium and the violent accesses of fury though the body was sinking at length he raised himself up in bed and looking with half glazed eyes straight before him he exclaimed in a voice choked with bitter rage away pancratius begone thou hast glared on me long enough keep back thy panther hold it fast it is going to fly at my throat it comes oh and with a convulsive grasp as if pulling the beast from off his throat he plucked away the bandage from his wound a gush of blood poured over him and he fell back a hideous corpse upon the bed illustration the sacrifice of abraham from a picture in the catacombs his friend saw how unrepenting persecutors died chapter iii and last the next morning the pilgrim proceeded to discharge the business which had been interfered with by the circumstances related in the preceding chapter he might have been first seen busily employed inquiring after some one about the januses in the forum at length the person was found and the two walked towards a dirty little office under the capitol on the ascent called the clivus asyli old musty books were brought out and searched column after column till they came to the date of the consuls dioclesian augustus the eighth time and maximian herculeus augustus the seventh time here they found sundry entries with reference to certain documents a roll of mouldy parchments of that date was produced docketed as referred to and the number corresponding to the entries was drawn out and examined the result of the investigation seemed perfectly satisfactory to both parties it is the first time in my life said the owner of the den that i ever knew a person who had got clear off come back after fifteen years to inquire after his debts a christian i presume sir certainly by gods mercy i thought as much good morning sir i shall be happy to accommodate you at any time at as reasonable rates as my father ephraim now with abraham a great fool that for his pains i must say begging his pardon he added when the stranger was out of hearing with a decided step and a brighter countenance than he had yet displayed he went straight to the villa on the nomentan way and after again paying his devotions in the crypt but with a lighter heart he at once addressed the fossor as if they had never been parted torquatus can i speak with the lady fabiola certainly answered the other come this way neither alluded as they went along to old times nor to the intermediate history of either there seemed to be an understanding instinctive to both that all the past was to be obliterated before men as they hoped it was before god fabiola had remained at home that and the preceding day in hopes of the strangers return she was seated in the garden close to a fountain when torquatus pointing to her retired she rose as she saw the long expected visitor approach and an indescribable emotion thrilled through her when she found herself standing in his presence madam he said in a tone of deep humility and earnest simplicity i should never have presumed to present myself before you had not an obligation of justice as well as many of gratitude obliged me orontius she replied is this the name by which i must address you he signified his assent you can have no obligations towards me except that which our great apostle charges on us that we love one another i know you feel so and therefore i would not have pretended unworthy as i am to intrude upon you for any lower motive than one of strict duty i know what gratitude i owe you for the kindness and affection lavished upon one now dearer to me than any sister can be on earth and how you discharged towards her the offices of love which i had neglected and thereby sent her to me interposed fabiola to be my angel of life remember orontius that joseph was sold by his brethren only that he might save his race you are too good indeed towards one so worthless resumed the pilgrim but i will not thank you for your kindness to another who has repaid you so richly only this morning i have learnt your mercy to one who could have no claim upon you i do not understand you observed fabiola then i will tell you all plainly rejoined orontius i have now been for many years a member of one of those communities in palestine of men who live separated from the world in desert places dividing their day and even their night between singing the divine praises contemplation and the labor of their hands severe penance for our past transgressions fasting mourning and prayer form the great duty of our penitential state have you heard of such men here the fame of holy paul and anthony is as great in the west as in the east replied the lady it is with the greatest disciple of the latter that i have lived supported by his great example and the consolation he has given me but one thought troubled me and prevented my feeling complete assurance of safety even after years of expiation before i left rome i had contracted a heavy debt which must have been accumulating at a frightful rate of interest till it had reached an overwhelming amount yet it was an obligation deliberately contracted and not to be justly evaded i was a poor cenobite barely living on the produce of the few palm leaf mats that i could weave and the scanty herbs that would grow in the sand how could i discharge my obligations only one means remained i could give myself up to my creditor as a slave to labor for him and endure his blows and scornful reproaches in patience or to be sold by him for my value for i am yet strong in either case i should have had my saviours example to cheer and support me at any rate i should have given up all that i had myself i went this morning to the forum found my creditors son examined his accounts and found that you had discharged my debt in full i am therefore your bondsman lady fabiola instead of the jews and he knelt humbly at her feet rise rise said fabiola turning away her weeping eyes you are no bondsman of mine but a dear brother in our common lord then sitting down with him she said orontius i have a great favor to ask from you give me some account of how you were brought to that life which you have so generously embraced i will obey you as briefly as possible i fled as you know one sorrowful night from rome accompanied by a man his voice choked him i know i know whom you mean eurotas interrupted fabiola the same the curse of our house the author of all mine and my dear sisters sufferings we had to charter a vessel at great expense from brundusium whence we sailed for cyprus we attempted commerce and various speculations but all failed there was manifestly a curse on all that we undertook our means melted away and we were obliged to seek some other country we crossed over to palestine and settled for a while at gaza very soon we were reduced to distress every body shunned us we knew not why but my conscience told me that the mark of cain was on my brow orontius paused and wept for a time then went on at length when all was exhausted and nothing remained but a few jewels of considerable price indeed but with which i knew not why eurotas would not part he urged me to take up the odious office of denouncing christians for a furious persecution was breaking out for the first time in my life i rebelled against his commands and refused to obey one day he asked me to walk out of the gates we wandered far till we came to a delightful spot in the midst of the desert it was a narrow dell covered with verdure and shaded by palm trees a little clear stream ran down issuing from a spring in a rock at the head of the valley in this rock we saw grottoes and caverns but the place seemed uninhabited not a sound could be heard but the bubbling of the water we sat down to rest when eurotas addressed me in a fearful speech the time was come he told me when we must both fulfil the dreadful resolution he had taken that we must not survive the ruin of our family here we must both die the wild beasts would consume our bodies and no one would know the end of its last representatives so saying he drew forth two small flasks of unequal sizes handed me the larger one and swallowed the contents of the smaller i refused to take it and even reproached him for the difference of our doses but he replied that he was old and i young and that they were proportioned to our respective strengths i still refused having no wish to die but a sort of demoniacal fury seemed to come over him he seized me with a giants grasp as i sat on the ground threw me on my back and exclaiming we must both perish together forcibly poured the contents of the phial without sparing me a drop down my throat in an instant i was unconscious and remained so till i awoke in a cavern and faintly called for drink a venerable old man with a white beard put a wooden bowl of water to my lips where is eurotas i asked is that your companion inquired the old monk yes i answered he is dead was the reply i know not by what fatality this had happened but i bless god with all my heart for having spared me that old man was hilarion a native of gaza who having spent many years with the holy anthony in egypt had that year returned to establish the cenobitic and eremitical life in his own country and had already collected several disciples they lived in the caves hard by and took their refection under the shade of those palms and softened their dry food in the water of that fountain their kindness to me their cheerful piety their holy lives won on me as i recovered i saw the religion which i had persecuted in a sublime form and rapidly recalled to mind the instructions of my dear mother and the example of my sister so that yielding to grace i bewailed my sins at the feet of gods minister and received baptism on easter eve then we are doubly brethren nay twin children of the church for i was born to eternal life also on that day but what do you intend to do now set out this evening on my return i have accomplished the two objects of my journey the first was to cancel my debt my second was to lay an offering on the shrine of agnes you will remember he added smiling that your good father unintentionally deceived me into the idea that she coveted the jewels i displayed fool that i was but i resolved after my conversion that she should possess the best that remained in eurotass keeping so i brought it to her but have you means for your journey asked the lady timidly abundant he replied in the charity of the faithful i have letters from the bishop of gaza which procure me every where sustenance and lodging but i will accept from you a cup of water and a morsel of bread in the name of a disciple they rose and were advancing towards the house when a woman rushed madly through the shrubs and fell at their feet exclaiming oh save me dear mistress save me he is pursuing me to kill me fabiola recognized in the poor creature her former slave jubala but her hair was grizzly and dishevelled and her whole aspect bespoke abject misery she asked whom she meant my husband she replied long has he been harsh and cruel but to day he is more brutal than usual oh save me from him there is no danger here replied the lady but i fear jubala you are far from happy i have not seen you for a long long time no dear lady why should i come to tell you of all my woes oh why did i ever leave you and your house where i ought to have been so happy i might then with you and graja and good old departed euphrosyne have learnt to be good myself and have embraced christianity what have you really been thinking of this jubala for a long time lady in my sorrows and remorse for i have seen how happy christians are even those who have been as wicked as myself and because i hinted this to my husband this morning he has beaten me and threatened to take my life but thank god i have been making myself acquainted with christian doctrines through the teaching of a friend how long has this bad treatment gone on jubala asked orontius who had heard of it from his uncle ever she replied since soon after marriage i told him of an offer made to me previously by a dark foreigner named eurotas oh he was indeed a wicked man a man of black passions and remorseless villany connected with him is my most racking recollection how was that asked orontius with eager curiosity why when he was leaving rome he asked me to prepare for him two narcotic potions one for any enemy he said should he be taken prisoner this was to be certainly fatal another had to suspend consciousness for a few hours only should he require it for himself when he came for them i was just going to explain to him that contrary to appearances the small phial contained a fatally concentrated poison and the large one a more diluted and weaker dose but my husband came in at the moment and in a fit of jealousy thrust me from the room i fear some mistake may have been committed and that unintentional death may have ensued fabiola and orontius looked at one another in silence wondering at the just dispensations of providence when they were aroused by a shriek from the woman they were horrified at seeing an arrow quivering in her bosom as fabiola supported her orontius looking behind him caught a glimpse of a black face grinning hideously through the fence in the next moment a numidian was seen flying away on his horse with his bow bent parthian wise over his shoulder ready for any pursuer the arrow had passed unobserved between orontius and the lady jubala asked fabiola dost thou wish to die a christian most earnestly she replied dost thou believe in one god in three persons i firmly believe in all the christian church teaches and in jesus christ who was born and died for our sins yes in all that you believe the reply was more faint make haste make haste orontius cried fabiola pointing to the fountain he was already at its basin filling full his two hands and coming instantly poured their contents on the head of the poor african pronouncing the words of baptism and as she expired the water of regeneration mingled with her blood of expiation after this distressing yet consoling scene they entered the house and instructed torquatus about the burial to be given to this doubly baptized convert orontius was struck with the simple neatness of the house so strongly contrasting with the luxurious splendor of fabiolas former dwelling but suddenly his attention was arrested in a small inner room by a splendid shrine or casket set with jewels but with an embroidered curtain before it so as to allow only the frame of it to be seen approaching nearer he read inscribed on it the blood of the blessed miriam shed by cruel hands orontius turned deadly pale then changed to a deep crimson and almost staggered fabiola saw this and going up to him kindly and frankly placed her hand upon his arm and mildly said to him orontius there is that within which may well make us both blush deeply but not therefore despond so saying she drew aside the curtain and orontius saw within a crystal plate the embroidered scarf so much connected with his own and his sisters history upon it were lying two sharp weapons the points of both which were rusted with blood in one he recognized his own dagger the other appeared to him like one of those instruments of female vengeance with which he knew heathen ladies punished their attendant slaves we have both said fabiola unintentionally inflicted a wound and shed the blood of her whom now we honor as a sister in heaven but for my part from the day when i did so and gave her occasion to display her virtue i date the dawn of grace upon my soul what say you orontius that i likewise from the instant that i so misused her and led to her exhibition of such christian heroism began to feel the hand of god upon me that has led me to repentance and forgiveness it is thus ever concluded fabiola the example of our lord has made the martyrs and the example of the martyrs leads us upwards to him their blood softens our hearts his alone cleanses our souls theirs pleads for mercy his bestows it may the church in her days of peace and of victories never forget what she owes to the age of her martyrs as for us two we are indebted to it for our spiritual lives may many who will only read of it draw from it the same mercy and grace they knelt down and prayed long together silently before the shrine they then parted to meet no more after a few years spent by orontius in penitential fervor a green mound by the palms in the little dell near gaza marked the spot where he slept the sleep of the just and after many years of charity and holiness fabiola withdrew to rest in peace in company with agnes and miriam footnotes hot baths lib iv ep the pompeian court in the crystal palace london
