and the online distributed proofreading team ideala by sarah grand lesprit ne nous garantit pas des sottises de notre humeurvauvenargues preface you will ask me perhaps even you who are all charity why parts of this book are what they are i can only answer with another question why are we what we are but i warn you that it would not be fair to take any of idealas opinions here given as final much of what she thought was the mere effervescence of a strong mind in a state of fermentation a mind passing successively through the three stages of the process the vinous alcoholic or excitable stage the acetous jaundiced or embittered stage and the putrefactive or unwholesome stage and also embodying at different times the characteristics of all three but even during its worst phase it was an earnest mind seeking the truth diligently and not to be blamed for stumbling upon good and bad together by the way it is in fact not a perfect but a transitional state which i offer for your consideration a state which has its repulsive features but which it may be hoped would result in a beautiful deposit when at last the inevitable effervescence had subsided but why exhibit the details of the process you may ask to encourage others of course what help is there in the contemplation of perfection ready made it only disheartens us we should lay down our arms we should struggle no longer we should be hopeless despairing reckless if we never had a glimpse of growth of those stepping stones of their dead selves upon which men mount to higher things the imperfections must be studied because it is only from the details of the process that anything can be learned putting aside the people who criticise not with a view to mending matters but because a low desire not to seem lowest makes them level all the people who judge who condemn who have no mercy on any faults and failings but their own and who if they find some stain or blemish in a name of note not grieving that their greatest are so small inflate themselves with some insane delight and would ostracise a neighbour for the first offence by ruling that one mistake must mar a lifeanybodys life but their own of course who have no peace in themselves no habit of sweet thought whose lives are one long agony of excitement objection envy hate and unrest the decently clad devils of society who may be known by their eternal carping and who are already in torment and doing their utmost to drag others after them putting them aside as any one may who has the courage to face themfor they are terrible cowardsand taking the best of us and the best intentioned among us we find that all are apt to make some one trait in the characters some one trick in the manners some one incident in the lives of people we meet the text of an objection to the whole person and a state of objection is a miserable state and a dangerous one because it stops our growth by robbing us of half our power to love in which lies all our strength and which with the delight of being loved is the one thing worth living for when we know in ourselves that love is heaven and hate is hell and all the intervals of like and dislike are antechambers to either we possess the key to joy and sorrow by which alone we can attain to the mystery that may not be mentioned here but beyond which ecstasy awaits us this is why such details are necessary doctorsspiritual must face the horrors of the dissectingroom and learn before they can cure or teach and even we poor feeble creatures who have no strength however great our desire to do either can help at least a little by not hindering if we attend to our own mental health which we shall do all the better for knowing something of our moral anatomy and the diseases to which it is liable we hate and despise in our ignorance and grow weak but love and pity thrive on knowledge and to love and pity we owe all the beauty of life and all our highest power it is that life of custom and accident in which many of us pass much of our time in this world that life in which we do what we have not purposed and speak what we do not mean and assent to what we do not understand that life which is overlaid by the weight of things external to it and is moulded by them instead of assimilating them that which instead of growing and blossoming under any wholesome dew is crystallised over with it as with hoar frost and becomes to the true life what an arborescence is to a tree a candied agglomeration of thoughts and habits foreign to it brittle obstinate and icy which can neither bend nor grow but must be crushed and broken to bits if it stands in our way all men are liable to be in some degree frostbitten in this sort all are partly encumbered and crusted over with idle matter only if they have real life in them they are always breaking this bark away in noble rents until it becomes like the black strips upon the birch tree only a witness of their own inward strength ruskin ideala chapter i she came among us without flourish of trumpets she just slipped into her place almost unnoticed but once she was settled there it seemed as if we had got something we had wanted all our lives and we should have missed her as you would miss the thrushes in the spring or any other sweet familiar thing but what the secret of her charm was i cannot say she was full of inconsistencies she disliked ostentation and never wore those ornamental fidgets ladies delight in but she would take a piece of priceless lace to cover her head when she went to water her flowers and she said rings were a mistake if your hands were ugly they drew attention to them if pretty they hid their beauty yet she wore halfadozen worthless ones habitually for the love of those who gave them to her it was said that she was striking in appearance but cold and indifferent in manner some on whom she had never turned her eyes called her repellent but it was noticed that men who took her down to dinner or had any other opportunity of talking to her were never very positive in what they said of her afterwards she made every one men and women alike feel and she did it unconsciously without effort without eccentricity without anything you could name or define she impressed you and she held you or at least she held me alwaysexpectant nothing about her ever seemed to be of the present when she talked she made you wonder what her past had been and when she was silent you began to speculate about her future but she did not talk much as a rule and when she did speak it was always some subject of interest some fact that she wanted to ascertain accurately or some beautiful idea that occupied her she had absolutely no small talk for any but her most intimate friends whom she was wont at times to amuse with an endless stock of anecdotes and quaint observations and this made people of limited capacity hard on her some of these called her a cold ambitious unsympathetic woman and perhaps from their point of view she was so she certainly aspired to something far above them and had nothing but scorn for the dead level of dull mediocrity from which they would not try to rise to be distinguished among these people she once said it is only necessary to have ones heart dowered with the hate of hate the scorn of scorn the love of love there is no need to do anything if you have the right feeling you may be as passive as a cow and still excel them all for they never thrill to a noble thought then pity them i said no despise them she answered pity is for affliction for such shortcomings as are hereditary and can hardly be remediedfor the taint in nature which is all but hopeless but these people are not afflicted they could do better if they would they know the higher walk and deliberately pursue the lower their whole feeling is for themselves and such things as have power to move them through the flesh only i would almost rather sin on the impulse of a generous but misguided nature and have the power to appreciate and the will to be better than live a perfect loveless woman caring only for myself like these i should do more good they called ideala unsympathetic yet i have known her silent from excess of sympathy she could walk with you reading your heart and soul sorrowing and rejoicing with you and make you feel without a word that she did so it was this power to sympathise and the longing she had to find good in everything that made her forgive the faults that were patent in a nature with which she was finally brought into contact for the sake of the virtues which she discovered hidden away deep down under a slowly hardening crust of that kind of self indulgence which mars a man but her own life was set to a tune that admitted of endless variations sometimes it was difficult even for those who knew her best to detect the original melody among the clashing cords that concealed it but let it be hidden as it might one felt that it would resolve itself eventually through many a jarring modulation and startling cadence perhaps back to the perfect key i saw her first at a garden party she scarcely noticed me when we were introduced there were great masses of white cloud drifting up over the blue above the garden and she was wholly occupied with them when she could watch them without rudeness to those about her and even when she was obliged to look away i could see that she was still thinking of the sky do you live much in cloudland i asked and felt for a moment i had said a silly thing but she turned to me quickly and looked at me for the first time as if she saw meand when i say she looked at me i mean something more than an ordinary look for idealas eyes were a wonder affecting you as a poem does which has power to exalt ah you feel it too she said are they not beautiful will you sit beside me here you can see the river as welldown there beneath the trees i thought she would have talked after that but she did not when i spoke to her once or twice she answered absently and presently she forgot me altogether and began to sing to herself softly flow down cold rivulet to the sea thy tribute wave deliver no more by thee my steps shall be for ever and for ever then suddenly recollecting herself she stopped and exclaimed in much confusion o please forgive me that stupid thing has been running in my head all dayand it is a way i have i always forget people and begin to sing she did not see in the least that her apology might have been considered an adding of insult to injury and of course i was careful not to let her know that i thought it so although i must confess that for a moment i felt just a trifle aggrieved i thought my presence had bored her and was surprised to see when i got up to go that she would rather have had me stay she cared little for people in general and had few likings it was love with her if anything but those whom she loved once she loved always never changing in her affection for them however badly they might treat her and she had the power of liking people for themselves regardless of their feeling for her indeed her indifference on this score was curious i once heard a lady say to her you are one of the few young married ladies whom i dare chaperon in these degenerate days no degree of admiration or worship ever seems to touch you is it real or pretended your unconsciousness unconsciousness of what of the feeling you excite the feeling i excite ideala seemed to think a moment then she answered gravely i do not think i am conscious of anything that relates to myself personally in my intercourse with people they are ideas to me for the most partmen especially so that way she had of forgetting peoples presence was one of her peculiarities if she liked you she was content just to have you there but she never showed it except by a regretful glance when you went away she was very absent too one day i found her with a big awkward volume on her knee heated excited and evidently put out is anything the matter i wanted to know o yes she answered desperately ive lost my pen and im writing for the mail why where are you looking for it i asked she glanced at me and then at the book ii believe she faltered i was looking for it among the ps in the french dictionary on another occasion i watched her revising a manuscript as she wrote her emendations she gummed them on over the old copy and she was so absorbed that at last she put the gumbrush into the inkbottle discovering her mistake she gave a little disconcerted sort of laugh and took the brush away to wash it she returned presently examining it critically to see if it were perfectly cleansed and having satisfied herself she carefully put it back in the inkbottle but perhaps the funniest instance of this peculiarity of hers was one that happened in the grosvenor gallery on a certain occasion she had been busy with her catalogue doing the pictures conscientiously and not talking at all when suddenly she burst out laughing do you know what i have been doing she said i wanted to know who that man isindicating a gentleman of peculiar appearance in the crowdand i have been looking all over him for his number that i might hunt up his name in the catalogue her way of seeing analogies as plausible as the obvious relation of p to pen and of acting on wholly wrong conclusions deduced from most unexceptionable premises was another characteristic she always blamed her early education or rather want of education for it if i had been taught to think she said when my memory was being burdened with historical anecdotes torn from the text and other useless scraps of knowledge i should be able to see both sides of a subject and judge rationally now as it is i never see more than one side at a time and when i have mastered that i feel like the old judge in some greek play who when he had heard one party to a suit begged that the other would not speak as it would only poggle what was then clear to him but in this ideala was not quite fair to herself it was not alwaysalthough unfortunately it was oftenest at critical momentsthat she was beset with this inability to see more than one side of a subject at a time the odd thing about it was that one never knew which side the pathetic or the humorous would strike her generally however it was the one that related least to herself personally this selfforgetfulness with a keen sense of the ludicrous led her sometimes when she had anything amusing to relate to overlook considerations which would have kept other people silent i saw a pair of horses running away with a heavy wagon the other day she told us once it was in cross street and there was a child in the waythere always is a child in the wayand as there was no one else to do it i ran into the road to remove that child i had to pull it aside quickly and there was no time to say allow mein fact there was no time for anythingand in my hurry i lost my balance and fell in the mud and the wagon came tearing over me it was an unpleasant sensation but i wasnt hurt you know neither the wheels nor the horses touched me i got very dirty though and i have no doubt i looked as ridiculous as i felt and for that i expected to be tenderly dealt with but when i went to ask after the child a few days later a neighbour told me that its mother was out and it was a good thing too as she had been heard to declare she would go for that lady the next time she saw her for flingin of her bairn about when she had told the story ideala was horrified to find that the fact which she had overlooked of her having risked her life to save the child struck us all much more forcibly than the ingratitude that amused her although her sense of humour was keen it was not always as i said before the humorous side of a subject that struck her i found her one day looking utterly miserable what has happened i asked you look sad and i feel sad she answered i was just thinking what a pity it is those gay pleasureloving flowerclad people of hawaii are dying out she was quite in earnest and could not be made to see that there was anything droll in her mourning poignantly for a people so remote another instance of her absentmindedness recurs to me the incident was related at our house one evening in idealas presence by mr lloyd a mutual friend a clever drawing by another friend of ideala trying to force a cabman to take ten shillings for a halfcrown fare one of the great fears of her life being the chance of not giving people of that kind as much as they expectedhad caused ideala to protest that she did understand money matters o yes we all know that your capacity for business is quite extraordinary mr lloyd said with a smile that meant something and then addressing us all he asked did i ever tell you about her coming to borrow five shillings from me one day shall i tell ideala you may if you like ideala answered getting very red but the story is not interesting we all began to be anxious to hear it judge for yourselves mr lloyd said one day the head clerk came into my private room at the bank looking perplexed and discomfited please sir he said a lady wishes to see you a lady i answered ladies have no business here what does she want she would not say sir and she would not send in her name she said it did not matter i began to wonder what i had been doing what is she like i asked he looked all round as if in search of a simile and then he answered well sir shes more like a picture than anything show her in i said here the story was interrupted by a shout of laughter he laughed a little himself i should have been polite in any case he declared apologetically the clerk ushered in a lady whose extreme embarrassment made me sorry for her she changed colour halfadozen times in as many seconds and then she hurled her errand at my head in these words without any previous preparation to break the blow mr lloyd can you lend me five shillings and before i had recovered she continuedi came in by train this morning and ive lost my purse and cant get back if you wont help meat least i think ive lost my purse i took it out to give sixpence to a beggarandand here is the sixpence and she held it out to me she had given her purse to the beggar and carried the sixpence off in triumph you may well say oh ideala and mr lloyd was so very good as to take me to the station and see me into the train ideala murmured and he gave me his bankbook to amuse me on the journey and carried huxleys elementary physiology which i had come in to buy off in triumph but with all her selfforgetfulness there were moments in which she showed that she must have thought deeply about herself weighing her own individuality against others to see what place she occupied in her own age and how she stood with regard to the ages that had gone before yet even this she seemed to have done in a selfless way having apparently examined herself coolly critically fairly as she might have examined any other specimen of humanity in which she felt an interest unbiassed by any special regard people always want to know if i write or paint or play or what i do she once said to me they all expect me to do something my function is not to do but to be i make no poetry i am a poemif you read me aright and again in a moment of despondency she said i am one of the weary women of the nineteenth century no other age could have produced me when she said she did nothing she must have meant she was not great in anything for her time was all occupied and those things in which she was interested were never so well done without her help if any crying abuse were brought to light in the old cathedral city if any large measure of reform were set on foot if the local papers suddenly became eloquent in favour of some good movement and adroit in their powers of persuasion if burdens had to be lifted from the oppressed and the weak defended against great odds you might be sure that ideala was busy and her work could be detected in it all and she was especially active when efforts were being made to find amusement for the people that is what they want poor things she would say their lives are such a dreary round of dull monotonous toil and they have so little sun to cheer them they ought to be taught to laugh and have the brightness put into themselves and then it would seem as if they had been relieved of half the atmospheric pressure beneath which they groan think what your own life would be if day day after day brought you nothing but toil if you had nothing to look back upon nothing to look forward to but the labour that makes a machine of you deadening the power to care and holding mind and body in the galling bondage and weariness of everlasting routine she thought laughter an unfailing specific for most of the ills of life we can none of us be thankful enough for the sensation she said nothing relieves the mental oppression which does such moral and physical harm like mirth of course i mean legitimate laughter not levity nor the illnatured rejoicing of small minds in such subjects for sorrow as their neighbours faults follies and mistakes what i am thinking of is the pleasure without excitement which there is in sympathetic intercourse with those large loving natures that elevate and the laughter without bitterness which is always a part of it like most people whose goodness is neither affected nor acquired but natural to them ideala saw no merit in her own works and would not take the credit she deserved for them nor would she have had her good deeds known at all if she could have helped it but knowledge of these things leaks out somehow although probably not a third of what she did will ever be even suspected chapter ii speaking to me of women one day she said certainly they are vainqueurs des vainqueurs de la terre in any sense they choose but the pity of it is that they do not choose to exercise their power for good to any great extent i agree with madame bernierif it were madame bernierwho said lignorance o les femmes sont de leurs devoirs labus quelles font de leur puissance leur font perdre le plus beau et le plus prcieux de leurs avantages celui dtre utiles but hundreds of other quotations will occur to you written by thoughtful men and women in all ages and all to the same effect it is impossible to overestimate their restraining and refining influence as the companions and mothers of menand almost equally impossible to make them realise their responsibility or care to use their strength i would have every woman feel herself a power for good in the landand if only half of them did what a world of difference it would make to everybodys health and happiness but women should as a rule be silent powers there are of course occasions when they must speakand all honour to those who do so when the need arisesbut our influence is most felt when it is quietly persistent and unobtrusive there is no social reform that we might not accomplish if we agreed among ourselves to do it and then worked each of us using her influence to that end in her own family and among her own friends only i once induced some ladies to try a little experiment to prove this at that time the gentlemen of our respective families were all wearing a certain kind of necktie we agreed to banish the necktie and in a month it had disappeared and not one of those gentlemen was ever able to tell us why he had given it up we dont deserve much credit for our ingenuity though she added lightly men are so easily managed all you have to do is to feed them and flatter them i think that hardly fair i commented what the feeding and flattering no the conspiracy well that occurred to me tooafterwards when it was too late to do anything but repent at the time i own i thought of nothing but the success of the experiment as an example and proof of our willpower you considered one side of the subject only as per usual when you are eager and interested i softly insinuated she frowned at me thoughtfully then after a pause she resumed ah yes you may be sure there is a great deal of good motive power in women but most of it is lost for want of knowledge and means to apply it it works like the sails of a windmill not attached to the machinery which whirl round and round with incredible velocity and every evidence of strength but serve no better purpose than to show which way the wind blows this question of the position of women in our own day occupied her a good deal the women of my time she said to me once are in an unsettled state it may be a state of transition much that made life worth having has lost its charm for them the old interests pall upon them occupations that used to be the great business of their lives are now thought trivial and are left to children and to servants principles accepted since the beginning of time have been called in question weariness and distrust have taken the place of peace and content and doubt and dissatisfaction are the order of the day women want something they are determined to have it too and doubtless they would get it if only they knew what it is that they want they are struggling to arrive at something but opinions differ widely as to what that something ought to be and the result is that they have divided themselves into three classes not exactly distinct they dovetail into each other so nicely that it is hard to say where the influence of the one set ends and the other begins there are first of all the women who in their struggles for political power have done so much to unsex us they have tried to force themselves into unnatural positions and the consequence has been about as pleasing and edifying as an attempt to make a goose sing they clamour for change mistaking change for progress but dont let the puzzling dovetail confuse you the people i speak of are not those who have so nobly devoted themselves to the removal of the wrongs of women though they work together but the object of all this class is good they wish to raise us and what they want for the most part is a little more common senseas is shown in their system of education for instance which cultivates the intellectual at the expense of the physical powers girls being crammed as boys to their great let and hindrance also are crammed just when nature wants all their strength to assist their growth the result of which becomes periodically apparent when a number of amiable young ladies are let loose on society without hair or teeth but the thing they clamour for most is equality there is a great deal to be said in favour of placing the sexes on an equal footing and if social conventions are stronger and more admirable than natural instinctsand doubtless they arethe thing should be done but the innate perversity of women make it difficultfor i know this that whatever the position of a true woman and however much she may clamour for equality with men in general the man she herself loves in particular will always be her master but such ridicule as this party has brought upon itself would not have mattered so much had nothing worse come of it unfortunately there seems to be no neutral ground for us women we either do good or harm and i hold that first class responsible for the existence of those people who clamour for change of any kind regardless of the consequences their ideas shorn of all good intention have resulted in the production of a new creature and have made it possible for women who have the faults of both sexes and the virtues of neither to mix in society the bad work done by the influence of this second class is only too apparent it is to them we owe the fact that there is less refinement less courtesy less of the really good breeding which shows itself in kindness and consideration for others and heaven help us even less modesty among us now than there was some years ago these are the women too who spend their time and talents on the production of cleverly written books of the most corrupt tendency their works are a special feature of the age and are doubly dangerous because they have the art of making the worst ideas attractive by presenting them in forms too refined and beautiful to shock even the most delicate besides these two classes there is the third which is more difficult to define it is the one on which our hope rests the women who belong to it are dissatisfied like the others but they are less decided and therefore their dissatisfaction takes no positive shape they also want something and go this way and that as if in search of it but they are not really trying for anything in particular they do good and evil indiscriminately and for the same motive they find distraction in doing somethinganything but the desire to do good is latent in all of them show them the way and it will make itself apparent but what is the reason of all this dissatisfaction i asked why dont you go to your husbands and brothers to be set right as of old ah when you ask me that you get to the first cause of the trouble she answered the truth is that we have lost faith in our men they claim some superiority for themselves but we find none the age requires people to practise what they preach and yet expects us to be guided by the counsels of those whose own lives we know have rendered them contemptible they are not fit to guide us and we are not fit to go alone i suppose we shall come to an understanding eventually either they must be raised or we must be lowered it is for the death of manliness we women mourn we marry and find we have taken upon ourselves misery and lifelong widowhood of the mind and moral nature do you wonder that some of us ask why should we keep ourselves pure if impurity is to be our bedfellow you make us breathe corruption and wonder that we lose our health but why do you talk of the death of manliness men have as much courage now as they ever had oh of coursemere animal courage there is plenty of that but that is nothing a cat will fight for her kittens it is moral courage that makes a man and where do you find it now are men selfdenying are they scrupulous to a shadow of the truth are they disinterested how many gentlemen have you met in the course of your life i know about half a dozen what do you call a gentleman then i asked in surprise what makes a man one why truth and affection of course she answered the one is the most ennobling and the other the most refining quality as a child i used to think ladies and gentlemen never told stories it was only the common people who were dishonourable and that was what made them common hlas one lives and learns i dont think the world is worse than it ever was i said drily not worse when we know so much better she answered with scorn not worse when we have learnt to see so clearly and most of us acknowledge that it is our will which thus enchains us to permitted ill it is nearly two thousand years since christianity began its work and it is still unaccomplished do you know i sometimes think that all this talk of virtue and teaching of religion is a kind of practical joke gravely kept up to find a church parade of respectability for states a profession for hundreds and a means of influencing men by making a tender point in their nervous system to be touched as with a rod when necessarya rod that is held over them always in terrorem we all talk about morality but try some measure of reform and you will find that every man sees the necessity of it for his neighbour only goodness is happiness and sin is disease the truism is as old as the hills and as evident but if men were in earnest do you suppose they would go on for ever choosing sin and its ghastly companion as they do do you know there are moments when i think that even their reverence for the purity of women is a sham for why do they keep us pure is it not to make each morsel more delicious for themselves that sense and sentiment may be satisfied together and their own pleasure made more complete individuals may be in earnest but the great bulk of mankind is a hypocrite when the history of this age is written moral cowardice and selfindulgence will be found to have been the most striking characteristics of the people there is no truth to be found in the inward parts but ideala did not often adopt this tone and she would herself check other people who were preparing to assume it she had a favourite quotation adroitly mangled to suit such occasions when we begin to inculcate morality as a science we must discard moralising as a method she declared and she would also beg us to stop the hysteria it is the mortal malady of all wellbeloved measures she said and it spreads to an epidemic if the infected ones are not suppressed at once to prevent contagion but although she spoke so positively when taken out of herself by the interest and importance of a subject she had no very high opinion of her own judgment and power to decide a little more selfesteem would have been good for her she was too diffident i have not come across people on whose knowledge i could rely she told me i have been obliged to study alone and to form my opinions for myself out of such scraps of information as i have had the capacity to acquire from reading and observation i am therefore always prepared to find myself mistaken even when i am surest about a thingfor what am i an infant crying in the night an infant crying for the light and with no language but a cry in practice too she frequently albeit unconsciously diverged from her theories to some considerable extent as on one occasion when after talking long and earnestly of the sin of selfishness she absently picked up a paper i had just cut with intent to enjoy myself took it away with her to the drawingroom and sat on it for the rest of the morningas i afterwards heard chapter iii ideala held that dignity and calm are essential in a woman but like the rest of the world she found it hard to attain to her own standard of excellence her bursts of enthusiasm were followed by fits of depression and these again by periods of indifference when it was hard to rouse her to interest in anything she always said and was probably right that want of proper discipline in childhood was the reason of this variableness which she deplored but could neither combat nor conceal temperament must also have had something to do with it her nervous system was too highly strung she was too sensitive too emotional too intense she reflected phases of feeling with which she was brought into contact as a lake reflects the sky above it and the bird that skims across it and the boats that rest upon its breast yet like the lakes her own nature remained unchanged it might be darkened by shadows and lashed by tempests till it raged but the pure element showed divinely even in its wrath and the passion of it was expended always to some good end but even her love of the beautiful was carried to excess it was a passion with her which would in a sturdier age have been considered a vice she delighted in the scent of flowers the song of the thrushes in the spring colour and beautiful forms doubtless the emotion they caused her was pure enough and it was natural that highly bred cultivated and refined as she was she should feel these delicate sensuous pleasures in a greater degree than lower natures do there was danger however in the overeducation of the senses which made their ready response inevitable but neither limited the subjects nor regulated the degree to which they should respond but it would be hard in any case to say where cultivation of love for the beautiful should end and to determine the exact point at which the result ceases to be intellectual and begins to be sensual i have sat and watched ideala lolling at an open window in the summer the house stood on a hill a river wound through the valley below and beyond the riverthe land sloped up again green and dotted with trees to a range of low hills crested with a fringe of wood do you know what there is beyond those hills ideala asked me once abruptly i dont know but i love to believe that the sea is there and that the sun is sinking into it now sometimes i fancy i can hear it murmur and then followed a long silence and the scent of mignonette and roses blew in upon her and the twilight deepened and i saw her grow pale with pleasure when the nightingale began to singand then i stole away and never was missed she would lie in a long chair for hours like that scarcely moving and never speaking at first i used to wonder what she thought about but afterwards i knew that at such times she did not think she only felt i have some pictures of her as she was then dressed in a gown of some quaint blue and white japanese material with her white throat barei was just going to catalogue her charms but it seems indelicate to describe a woman point by point like a horse that is for sale i have some other pictures of her too as she appeared to me one hot summer when i was painting a picture by the river and she used to come down the towingpath to watch me work and sit beside me on the grass for hours together talking reading aloud reciting or silent according to her mood but always interesting it was then i learnt to know her best and i am always glad to think of her as i used to see her then coming towards me in one particular grey frock she wore tightfitting and perfect yet with no detail evident it was like an expression of herself that dress so quiet to all seeming and yet so rich in material and so complex in design the wonder and the beauty of it grew upon you and never failed of its effect chapter iv when i first knew ideala her religious opinions were all unsettled i neither believe nor disbelieve she told me i am in a state of dont know or perhaps it would be more exact to say that i both doubt and believe at one and the same time i go indifferently to either church protestant or catholic and am thankful when any note of music or thrill of feeling in the voice or noble sentiment elevates me so that i can pray but i am told that both catholics and protestants consider me a weak waverer and call me incorrigible sometimes i cannot pray for months together and when i do it is generally to ask for something i want not to praise or give thanks but what a blank it is when one cannot pray when one has lost the power to conceive that there is a something greater than man to whom man is nevertheless all in all and to whom we may look for comfort in all times of our tribulation and for sympathy in all times of our wealth to be able to give thanks to god when one is happy is the most rapturous and to be able to call upon him in the day of trouble is the most blessed state of mind i know yet i believe we should only pray for the possible the leafless tree may pray for the time of buds and blossoms will the time come the sooner perhaps not but it will come i must confess she said on another occasion that i do have moments of pure scepticism but when i cannot believe in the existence of a god and a beyond i feel as if the sky were nearer and weighed upon me so that i could not lift my head she thought religion consisted much more in doing right than in believing right and set morality above faith but i think she had a leaning towards the roman catholic religion nevertheless it is a grand old faith she said only it has certain ramifications with which i should always quarrel notably that of the sacred heart with which catholics deface their lovely lady in the churches i always feel that such bad art cannot be good religion when the roman catholic religion commanded respect it expressed itself betteras in the days when it carved itself in harmonies of solid stone and wrote itself in tint and tone on glowing canvases and learnt to speak in thundering mass and mighty hymns of praise there are people who think these new shoots good as a sign of life in the tree and this consideration might perhaps make their appearance welcome but a great deal of strength is expended on their production and it would be just as well to lop them off again the old tree wants pruning and cutting back occasionally and it is a false sentiment that is letting it fall to decay for the sake of these struggling branches there is another thing too for which we should all quarrel with the catholic religion i think the fact his already been noticed by some writer at all events it is evident enough to have occurred to any one i mean the fact that the church by its narrow views about education and its most unspiritual ambition for itself has retarded the worlds progress for centuries by interfering with the law of natural selection as a matter of course for ages all the best men went into the church it was the only career open to them and so they left no descendants at our house on another occasion when the roman catholic religion happened to be under discussion she launched forth some observations in her usual emphatic way there were only two strangers present a lady and her husband ideala asked the lady who was sitting next to her if she were a catholic to which the lady answered no and ideala satisfied proceeded to remark it may be the true religion but it certainly is not the religion of truth the doctrine of expediency or the latitude they allow themselves on the score of expediencyi dont quite know how they put itbut it has much to answer for i never find that my roman catholic friends are true as my protestant friends are there is always a something kept back a reservation a want of straightforwardness even when there is no positive deceptioni cant describe the thing i mean but it is quite perceptible and causes an uneasy feeling of distrust which is all the more tormenting from its vagueness and want of definition the lowclass roman catholics i find never hesitate if a lie will serve their purpose and roman catholic servants are notoriously untrustworthy that of course proves nothing for one knows that lowclass people of any religion are not to be depended onstill there is no doubt that one finds deception more rife among catholics than among protestants and one wonders why if the religion is not to blame my sister claudia had tried to catch idealas eye and stop her but in vain and the lady next her broke out the moment she paused indeed you are quite wrong you cannot have known many catholics they are not untrue o yes i have known numbers ideala answered i speak from experience yet it always seems to me that the roman catholic religion is good for individuals there is pleasure in it and help and comfort for them but then it is death to the progress of nations and the question is would an individual be justified in adding a unit more for his own benefit to a system which would ruin his country i think not here however she stopped seeing at last that something was wrong what dreadful mistake did i make this evening she asked me afterwards mrs jervois declared she wasnt a catholic but her husband is i answered and he heard every word ideala groaned not long afterwards mrs jervois wrote and told us she had entered the catholic church i had in fact been received before i went to you she confessed there ideala exclaimed it is just what i said a want of common honesty is a part of the religion and you see she had begun to practise it while she was here what an eternal lie it is they preach when they tell us life is not worth having she said to me once speaking of preachers generally i have heard an oleosaccharine priest preach for an hour on this subject detailing the worthlessness of all earthly pleasures with which he seemed to be intimately acquaintedhis appearance making one suspect that he had not even yet exhausted them all himselfand giving a florid account of the glories of the life to come about which he appeared to know as much but to care less just as if heaven might not begin on earth if only men would let it one day i had to warn her about acting so often on impulse she heard what i had to say very goodnaturedly and after thinking about it for a while she said what a pity it is one never sees an impulse coming it is impossible to know whether they arise from below or descend from above i always find if i act on one that it has arisen and as surely if i leave it alone it proves to have been a good opportunity lost and how curiously our thoughts go on often so irrespective of ourselves i was in a roman catholic church the other day and the priesta friend of mine who looks like the last of the mohicans minus the feathers in his hair but a good man with nice soft velvety brown eyespreached most impressively he told us that the lord was therethere on that very altar ready to answer our prayers and oh dear when i came to think of it there were so many of my prayers waiting to be answered i felt like presenting them all over again it seemed such a good opportunity and then they sang the o salutaris hostia divinely so divinely that i thought if the lord really had been there he would certainly have made them sing it againand i could not pray any more after that you call this rank irreverence do you not i do and i wish i had not thought it yet it was one of those involuntary tricks of the mind for which i cannot believe that we are to be held responsible theologians would say it was a temptation of the devil but they are wrong the first cause of these mental lapses is to be found in some habit of levity acquired young and not easily got rid of but still not hopeless but prevention is better than cure and children should be taught rightmindedness early i wish i had been happy is the child who is started in life with a set of fixed principles and the power to respect i used to wish that there might be a universal religion but ideala did not share my feeling on this subject i suppose it is a fine idea she said but while minds run in so many different grooves it seems to me far finer for one system of morality to have found expressions enough to satisfy nearly everybody she had very decided views about what heaven ought to be the mere material notion of abundance of gold and precious stones which appealed to the early churchmen has no charm for us she declared we must have new powers of perception and new pleasures provided for us such for instance as mr andrew lang suggests in an exquisite little poem about the homeric phaciathe land whose inhabitants were friends of the gods a sort of heaven upon earth and then she quoted the languid sunset mother of roses lingers a light on the magic seas the wide fire flames as a flower uncloses heavy with odour and loose to the breeze the strange flowers perfume turns to singing heard afar over moonlit seas the sirens song grown faint with winging falls in scent on the cedar trees those lines were the first to make me grasp the possibility of having new faculties added to our old ones in another state of existence she said faculties which should give us a deeper insight into the nature of things and enable us to discover new pleasures in the unity which may be expected to underlie beauty and excellence in all their manifestations as mr norman pearson puts it did you ever read that paper of his after death in the nineteenth century it embodies what i had long felt but could never grasp before i found his admirable expression of it i can see no reason he says in one passage in particular which i remember word for word i think it gives me such pleasure to recall iti can see no reason for supposing that some such insight would be impossible to the quickened faculties of a higher development with a nature material so far as the existence of those faculties might require but spiritual to the highest degree in their exercise and enjoyment under physical conditions which might render us practically independent of space and actually free from the host of physical evils to which we are now exposed we might well attain a consummation of happiness generally akin to that for which we now strive but idealised into something like perfection the faculties which would enable us to obtain a deeper and truer view of all the manifestations of cosmic energy would at the same time reveal to us new forms of beauty new possibilities of pleasure on every side andto take a single instancethe emotions to which the sight of niagara now appeals might then be gratified by a contemplation of the fierce grandeur of some suns chromosphere or the calmer glories of its corona that satisfies does it not she added with a sigh it suggests such infinite possibilities one day when she was making herself miserable for want of a religion i tried to comfort her by talking of the different people whose lives had been good and pure and noble although they had had no faith i suppose my principles are right she said but if they are they have come right by accident the children of the people are sent to sundayschools and taught the difference between right and wrong we seem to be expected to know it instinctively i think if i had learnt i might have profited because i cling so fondly to the one principle i ever heard clearly enunciated it was on the sin of shooting foxes and i cannot tell you the horror i have of the crime even down to the present day but now i think of it i did receive two other scraps of religious training my governess taught me the ten commandments by making me say them after her when i was eating bread and sugar for breakfast before going to church on sunday the thought of them always brings back the flavour of bread and sugar and the other scrap i got from a clergyman to whom i was sent on a single occasion when i was thought old enough to be confirmed he asked me which was the commandment with promise and i didnt know so he told me and then i made him laugh about a horse of mine that used to have great fun trying to break my neck and after that he said i should do i did not agree with him however and i positively refused to be confirmed until i knew more about it my mother said i was the most disagreeable child she had ever known which was probably true but as an argument it failed to convince it was her last remark on the subject happily and after that the thing was allowed to drop ideala was fourteen when she refused to be confirmed for conscientious scruples and although she made light of it in this way she had suffered a good deal and been severely punished at the time for her refusal but vainly for she never gave in in afterlife she held of course that christianity was the highest moral revelation the world had ever known but when she saw that legal right was not always moral right i think she began to look for a higher by baptism she belonged to the church of england but she seems to have thought of the sacrament always with the idea of transubstantiation in her mind she spoke of it reverently but had never been able to take it and for a curious reason she said the idea of it nauseated her she felt that the elements were unnatural food and therefore she could not touch themand this feeling never left her but once when she was dangerously ill and yearned as she told me for the sacrament more than for life and health day and night the longing never left her but not having been confirmed she did not like to ask for it and as she recovered the old feeling gradually returned religious difficulties always tormented her more or less as she grew older she felt with shelley that belief is involuntary and a man is neither to be praised nor blamed for it and she was always ready to acknowledge with sir philip sidney that reason cannot show itself more reasonable than to leave reasoning on things above reason but nevertheless her mind did not rest i have also heard her quote credulity is the mans weakness but the childs strength and add that in matters of faith and religion we are all children and i have thought at times that she had been able to leave it so but something always fell from her sooner or later which showed that the old trouble was rankling stillas when she told me once i have never heard the divine voice which has called you and all my friends i listen for it but it does not speak i call but there is no reply i wait but it does not come the heaven of heavens is dark to me and the yearning of my soul meets no response will it be so for ever no not for everbut she was led by tortuous ways and left to work out her own salvation in very fear and trembling till the dear human love was given to her in pity to help her to know something of that which is divine and then i hope above the trouble of her senses and the turmoil of the world the divine voice did call her and she was able at last to hear chapter v ideala often recurred to the subject of work for women there are so many thousands of us she said who have no object in life and nothing to make us take it seriously my own is a case in point i am not necessary even to my husband there is nothing i am bound to do for him or that he requires of me nothing but to be agreeable when he is with me which would not interfere with a serious occupation if i had one and is scarcely interest enough in life for an energetic woman my household duties take on an average half an hour a day and everything in our house is done regularly and well done my social duties may be got through at odd moments and the more of a pastime i make them the better i fulfil them and with the exception of these there is nothing in my life that i cannot have done for me by some one better able to do it than i am and even if i had children i should not be much more occupied for the things they ought to learn from their mothers are best taught by example for all practical purposes parents as a rule are bad masters for any but very young children they err on the side of over severity or the reverse so you see i have no obligations of consequence and there is therefore nothing in my life to inspire a sense of responsibility and all this seems to me a grievous waste of me i remember lord wensum telling me when we discussed this subject that he was travelling once with a wellknown editor and noticing the number of villas that had sprung up of late years along the whole line of rail they were on he said i wonder what the ladies in those villas do with their time i suppose their social duties are limited and they are too well off to be obliged to trouble themselves about anything it is the existence of those villas the editor answered that makes the present profession of the novelist possible but i think said ideala that those women might find something better to do than to make a profession for novelists but you do a good deal yourself ideala i ventured yes in a purposeless way all my acts are isolated it would make little difference if they had never been done then you are not content after all to be merely a poem i said maliciously you would like to do as well as to be she laughed then after a little she said earnestly do you know i always feel as if i could do somethingteach somethingor help others in a small way with some work of importance i never believe i was born just to live and die but i have a queer feeling about it i am sure i shall be made to go down into some great depth of sin and misery myself in order to learn what it is i have to teach she loved music and painting and poetry and science and none of her loves were barren she embraced them each in turn with an ardour that resulted in the production of an offspringa song a picture a poem or book on some most serious subject and all worthy of note but she was inconstant and these children of her thought or fancy were generally isolated efforts that marked the culminating point of her devotion and lessened her interest if they did not exhaust her strength perhaps though i wrong her when i call her inconstant it seems to me now that each new interest was a step by which she mounted upwards learning to sympathise practically and perfectly with all men in their work as she passed them on her way to find her own chapter vi she knew the poor of the place well and took a lively interest in all that concerned them and occasionally she would confide some of her own odd observations and reflections to me on sunday morning all the women wash their doorsteps she told me i think it is part of their religion and on another occasion she said they have such lovely children here and such swarms of them i am always hard on the women with lovely children people say it is envy hatred malice and all uncharitableness that makes me so but it really is because i think women who have nice children should be better than other women it would be worse for one of them to do a wrong thing than for poor childless me this conclusion may be quarrelled with as illogical but the feeling that led to it was beautiful beyond question and indeed all her ideas on that subject were beautiful she went once soon after she came among us to comfort a lady in the neighbourhood who had lost a baby at its birth it is sad that you should lose your child ideala said to her but you are better off than i am for i never knew what it was to be a mother she would have thought it a privilege to have experienced even the sorrows of maternity talking about the people she told me they draw such nice distinctions they speak of a lady and a real lady a real lady is a person who gives no trouble if mrs vanbrugh wants anything from the butcher and he has already sent to her house once that day she does not expect him to send again she sends to himand she is a real lady mrs stanton is also thoughtful but she is something more she is sociable and kind and talks to them all in a friendly way just as if they were human beings and she is something more than a real ladyshes a real nice lady do you know mrs polter at the fishshop what a finelooking woman she is middleaged intelligent and a very good specimen of her class i should think she has eight children already and would consider the ninth a further blessing her husband is a goodlooking man too and most devoted in fact they are quite an ideal pair with their eight children and their fishshop he had to go to yarmouth the other day to buy bloaters and while he was away she went by the five oclock train every morning to choose the days supply of fish for the shop and he was quite unhappy about it he was afraid she would overdo herself and rather than that should happen he desired her to let the business go to theahem he made her write every day to say how she was and was wretched till he returned to relieve her of her arduous duties she made friends with me during the scarlet fever epidemic number eight was a baby then and she was afraid he might catch the disease and be taken to the hospital and die for want of her and i sympathised strongly with her denunciations of the cruelty of the act fancy taking little babies from their mothers barbarous dont you think it one day a lady came into the shop while i was there she was dressed in a bright pink costume with a large hat all smothered in pink feathers i thought of the queen of sheba and felt alarmed mrs polter told me afterwards she was just a lady rolling in recently acquired wealth and as hard to please as if she had never washed her own doorstep it was then i learnt the difference between a lady and a real lady one of idealas exploits got into the paper somehow and she was annoyed about it and anxious to make us believe the account of the risk she ran had been greatly exaggerated i was present when she gave her own version of the story which was characteristic in every way i heard frantic cries from the river she said some one was shrieking the child will be drowned and i ran to see what was the matter a man was tearing up and down on the bank a child was struggling in the water and as there was nobody else to be seen he looked to me for assistance i advised him to go in and bring the child out but the idea did not appear to commend itself to him so he took to running up and down again bawling the child will be drowned and indeed it seemed very likely so i was obliged to go in and bring it out myself the man was overjoyed when i restored it to him he clasped it in his arms with every demonstration of affection and then he looked at me and became embarrassed he evidently felt that he ought to say something but the difficulty was what to say at last a bright idea seemed to strike him his countenance cleared and he spoke with much feeling i am afraid you are rather wet he observed and then he left me and a sympathetic landlady who keeps a little publichouse by the river and had witnessed the occurrence took me in and dried me she gave me whisky and hot water and entertained me for the rest of the afternoon she is a remarkable woman and i should visit her often were it not for her love of and faith in whisky and hot water i tell her there are five things which make the nose red viz cold tightlacing disease of the right side of the heart dyspepsia and alcohol and the greatest of these is alcohol but she says a little colour anywhere would be an improvement to me and i feel that i can have nothing in common with a woman who has such bad taste in the distribution of colour chapter vii idealas notions of propriety were altogether unconventional she never could be made to understand that it was not the proper thing to talk familiarly to any one she met and discuss any subject they were equal to with them it is good for people to talk and natural and therefore proper she said if i can give pleasure to a stranger by doing so or he can give pleasure to me it would not be right to keep silent she carried this idea of her duty to her neighbour rather far sometimes i remember her telling me once about two old gentlemen she had travelled with the day before the sun came in and bothered me and one of them offered to draw the blind she said and he remarked it was rather a treat to see the sun we have so little of it now and i said that was true and told him how i pitied the farmers i had to stay in my room the other day with a bad cold and i amused myself watching one of them at work in some fields opposite the state of his mind was expressed by his boots on monday the sun was shining the air was mild and it seemed as if we were going to have a continuance of fine weather and the farmer appeared of a cheerful countenance and his boots were polished and laced on tuesday there was an east wind veering south with showers and his boots were laced but not polished on wednesday there was frost fog and gloom and they were neither laced nor polished on thursday there was a snowstorm and he had no boots at all on and after that i did not see him and i wondered if he had committed suicidein which case i thought the jury might almost have brought in a verdict of justifiable felodese and when i told that story the other old gentleman shut his book and began to talk too and i said i thought the weather was much colder than it used to be for i could remember wearing muslin dresses in may and i could not wear them at all now but i did not know if the change were in the climate or in myselfperhaps a little of boththough indeed i knew that to a certain extent it was in the climate which had been very much altered in different districts by drainage and cutting or plantingaltered for the better however as a rule and one old gentleman had heard that before but did not understand it exactly so i explained it to him and then i talked about changes of climate in general and the formation of beds of coal and the ice period and sunspots and the theory of comets and about my husband getting up to see the last one and going out in a felt hat and dressinggown with a bedcandle to look for itand about that dream of mine did i tell you i dreamt the comet came into our drawingroom and the leg of a chinese table turned into a snake and snorted at it and the comet looked so taken aback that i woke myself with a shout of laughter and then we talked of popular superstitions about comets and dreams and ghosts particularly ghosts and i told a number of creepy stories and one old gentleman pretended he didnt believe in them but he did and so did the other without any pretence and we talked about darwinism and the nature of the soul and nihilism and the state of societyandand a few other things and they were such dear delightful old gentlemen and they knew such a lot and were so clever and one of them was a railway director and the other couldnt let his farms and was bothered about his pheasants and wanted to have the trains altered to suit him i should so like to meet them both again and how long did all this take ideala oh some hours i fancy their dreams would be rather confused last night she added naively poor old gentlemen said i this sociability and inclination to talk the matter out and i may say a certain amount of innocence and lack of worldly wisdom into the bargain betrayed her occasionally into small improprieties of conduct that were not to be excused and would possibly not have been forgiven in any one but ideala but such things were allowed in her as certain things are allowed in certain peoplenot because the things are right in themselves but because the people who do them see no harm in them there are people too who seem to enjoy the privilege of making wrong right by doing it society however only accords this privilege to a limited and distinguished few when ideala saw for herself that she had done an unjustifiable thing she was very ready to confess it i always fancied she had some latent idea of making atonement in that way it never mattered how much a story told against herself nor how much malicious people might make of it to her discredit she told all inimitably and with scrupulous fidelity to fact one day she was standing waiting for a train at the station at york and in her absent way she fixed her eyes on a gentleman who was walking about the platform presently he went up to her and without any apology or show of respect remarked i am sure i have seen you before probably ideala rejoined as if the occurrence were the most natural thing in the world but i do not remember you perhaps if i heard your name oh i dont suppose you ever heard my name he said in that case i can never have known you she answered calmly i never know any one except by name i suppose you are an englishman yes he said eagerly i am in the th ah i thought so she interrupted placidly englishmen in the th and some other regiments are apt to have but the one idea and that is and that is a bad one he looked at her for a moment and then hat in hand he made her a low bow and left her without another word i think he felt ill and went to have some refreshment she added when she told me from what happened afterwards i am sure that at the time she had no idea of the real significance of the position in which she found herself placed on this occasion but as a rule if she did or said the wrong thing she became painfully conscious of the fact immediately afterwardsindeed it was generally afterwards that she grasped the full meaning of most things she was ready with repartee without being in the least quick of understanding she had to think things over and even then she was not sure to do the right thing next time mr graves is ten years younger than his wife she told me once and only fancy what i said one day it was in his studio and she was there i declared a woman could have no sense of propriety at all who married a man younger than herselfthat no good could possibly come of such marriagesand a lot more then i suddenly remembered and you can imagine my feelings but what do you think i did i went there the next year and said the same thing again exactly chapter viii when we were a small party of intimate friends and ideala was quite at her ease with us it was pleasant to see her lolling a little languidly as was her wont for physically her energy was fitful in the corner of a couch looking happy and interested her face which was sad in repose lit up for the time with amusement as she quietly listened to our talk and observed all that was going on around her even when she did not speak a word she somehow managed to make her presence felt and as a rule she spoke little on these occasions but sometimes we managed to draw her out and sometimes she would burst forth suddenly of her own accord with a torrent of eloquence that silenced us all and even when she was utterly wrong she charmed us her chance observations were generally noteworthy either for their sense or their humour it was only her sense of humour i think that saved her from being sentimental but she gave expression to it in season and out of season and would let it carry her too far sometimes for she made enemies for herself more than once by the way she exposed the absurdity of certain things to the very people who believed in them every lapse of this kind caused her infinite regret but the fault seemed incurable she was always either repenting of it or committing it although having so many quirks of her own she felt that she of all people in the world should have dealt most tenderly with the weaknesses of others she knew how narrowly she escaped being sentimental and would often joke about her danger in that respect this lovely summer weather makes me sickly sentimental she told me once i feel like the heroine of a threevolume novel written by a young lady of eighteen and i think continually of him i dont know in the least who he is but that makes no difference the thought of him delights me and i want to write long letters to him and make verses about him the whole day long and he wants me to be good she had two or three pet abominations of her own any allusion to which was sure to make her outrageousfalse sentiment and affectation of any kind were amongst them she had little habits too that we were all pleased to fall in with sitting in the corner of a couch and of one couch in particular in every house was one of these and people got into the way of giving up that seat to her whenever she appeared i think it would have puzzled us all to say why or wherefore for she never said or looked anything that could make us think she wished to appropriate it she simply took it as a matter of course when it was offered to her and probably did not know that she invariably sat there ideala was a splendid horsewoman and swam like a fish but she was not good at tennis or games of any kind and she did not dance for a curious reason she objected to be touched by people for whom she had no special affection she even disliked to shake hands and often wished some one would put the custom out of fashion with regard to dancing i have heard her say too that she sympathised entirely with the oriental feeling on the subject she thought it delightful to be danced to to lie still with a pleasant companion near her who would not talk too much and listen to the music and enjoy the poetry of motion coolly and at ease i love to see the dancers dancing in tune she said but to have to dance myself would be as great a bother as to have to cook my dinner as well as eat it i suppose it is a healthy amusementindeed i know it is when you take it as i do for when all you people come down the morning after a dance with haggard eyes and no power to do anything i am as fresh as a lark and have decidedly the best of it she was not good at games because she was not ambitious she did not care to have her skill commended and was content to lose or win with equal indifferenceso long as only the honour of the thing was involved but when the stakes were more material she showed a vice of which she was quite conscious i darent play for money she said to me i never have and i have always said that i never will all the women of my family are born gamblers my mother has often told me that regularly when she was a girl the day after she received her allowance she had either doubled it or lost it all and before she was twenty she hadnt a jewel worth anything in her possessionand my aunts were as bad one of them staked herself one night to a gentleman she was playing with and he won and married her gambling was more the custom then than it is now but for me it is as much in the air as if it were still the fashion when there is any talk of play i feel fascinated and when i see a pack of cards the temptation is so irresistible that i have often to go away to save my resolution which made me think of a favourite quotation of lessings from minnatout les gens desprit aiment le jeu la folie chapter ix idealas low esteem for mere animal courage was probably due to the fact that she possessed it herself in a high degree yet soon after i met her i began to suspect and was afterwards convinced that something in her manner which had puzzled me at first arose from fear there was that in her life which made her afraid of the world which would had it guessed the truth have pryed with curious eyes into her sorrow and found an interest in seeing her suffer the trouble was her husband she rarely spoke of him herself and i think i ought to follow her example and say as little about him as possible he was jealous of her jealous of her popularity and jealous of every one who approached her he carried it so far that she scarcely dared to show a preference and was even obliged to be cold and reserved with some of her best friends i was a privileged person allowed to be intimate with her from the first partly because i insisted on it when i saw how matters stood and partly because my position and reputation gave me a right to insist i never had occasion to brave insults for her sake but like many others i would have done so had it been necessary her friends were constantly being driven from her on one pretext or another people would have taken her part readily enough had she complained but complaint was contrary to her nature and her principles some who suspected the truth blamed her reticence but i always thought it right and on one occasion when we approached the subject indirectly i told her silence is best i ought to have qualified the advice for she carried it too far and was silent afterwards when she should have spokenthat is to say when it had become evident that endurance was useless and degrading she fought hard to preserve her dignity and was determined that as the husband is the wife is should not be true in her case but he did lower her insensibly nevertheless as her life became more and more unendurable she became a little reckless in speech it was a sort of safetyvalve by means of which she regained her composure and i soon began to recognise the sign and to judge of the amount she had suffered by the length to which she afterwards went in search of relief and the extent to which suffering made her untrue to herself as a rule when with him she was yielding but she had fits of determination too when she knew she was right one night as they were driving home from a ball together her husband suddenly declared that he would not allow her to be one of the patronesses of a fancy fair which was to be held for a charitable purpose although she had already consented and he had made no objection at the time but why may i not ideala asked because i object do you hear i will not have it and you must withdraw i must decline to obey any such arbitrary injunction she answered quietly he detained her on the doorstep until the carriage had driven round to the stables now are you going to obey me he asked yes if you give me a reason for what you require she answered wearily oh you are obstinate are you he rejoined in a jeering tone well stay in the garden and think it over perhaps reflection will make you more dutiful i shall tell your maid you will not want her tonight when you have made up your mind you can ring and so saying he walked into the house and shut the door upon her it was a summer night but ideala felt chilly with only a thin shawl over her ball dress she walked about as long as she could but fatigue overcame her at last and she was obliged to lie down on one of the garden seats she wrapped the train of her dress round her shoulders and lay looking up at the stars the air was heavy with the scent of flowers the night was very still once or twice the rush of a passing train in the distance became audible and the ceaseless solemn inarticulate murmur of the night was broken by a nightingale that sang out at intervals divinely ideala never thought of submitting she simply lay there waiting without expecting the night air overcame her more and more with a sense of fatigue but she could not sleep she saw the darkness fade and the dawn appear and when at last the servants began to move in the house she watched her opportunity and slipped in unobserved she went to one of the spare rooms undressed rang and got into bed when the bell was answered she ordered a hot bath and hot coffee immediately the maid supposed she had slept there and seemed surprised but as her mistress offered no explanation she could make no remark and so the matter ended but i do not think ideala suffered much on that occasion her strong young womanhood saved her somewhatand there was a charm for her in the beauty of the night and the novelty of her position which a less healthy organism would not have appreciated had it been able to discover itat such a time chapter x ideala had been married eight years and two months after that night the longdelayed hope of her life which she had begun to believe was beyond hope was at last realised her child was a boy and her joy in him is something that one is glad to have seen but it was shortlived i do not know if her husband were jealous of her happiness or if he thought the child was more to her than he was or if he were merely making a proposition by way of experiment which he never meant to carry into effectprobably the latter at all events he went to her one day when the child was about six weeks old and told her he thought she must give up nursing him the mothers nature was up in arms in a moment i suppose she had not quite regained her strength for she had been very ill and being weak she was excitable i will not give my baby up how can you think it she exclaimed oh well he answered coolly just as you like you know but i should think youd betterfor the childs sake at least it isnt true i dont believe it she said piteously ask the doctor then and he sauntered out smiling and perhaps not dreaming that she would but for the childs sake had alarmed ideala and she sent for the doctor it was hours before he could come to her and in the meantime not knowing that her state of mind would affect the child she had fidgeted and fretted herself into a fever and when the doctor saw her he could only confirm her husbands verdict i am afraid you must give up nursing he said you are in such a nervous state it will do the child harm but hes such a fine fellow hell thrive all rightyou neednt be frightened ideala said nothing but she sat in her own room night after night for a week and heard the child crying for her and could not go to him and even when he did not cry she fancied she heard him still i think as the milk slowly and painfully left her her last spark of affection for her husband dried up too the child died of diphtheria some time afterwards and in a little while ideala who was then in her twentysixth year returned to her old pursuits and no one ever knew what she felt about it for it is with feelings as with waters the shallow murmur but the deep are dumb chapter xi my widowed sister claudia was one of idealas most intimate friends she was a good deal older than ideala whom she loved as a mother loves a naughty child for ever finding fault with her but ready to be up in arms in a moment if any one else ventured to do likewise she was inclined to quarrel with me because although i never doubted idealas truth and earnestness no one could knowing her weak point i feared for her i thought if all the passion in her were ever focussed on one object she would do something extravaganta prediction which claudia with good intent rashly repeated to her once claudia was mistress of my house and she and i had agreed from the first that whatever happened we would watch over ideala and befriend her my sister was one of the people who thought it would have been better for ideala to have talked of her troubles when i praised idealas loyalty and her uncomplaining devotion to an uncongenial duty claudia said loyalty is all very well but i dont see much merit in a life long devotion to a bad cause if there were any good to be done by it it would be different of course but as it is ideala is simply sacrificing herself for nothingand worse she is setting a bad example by showing men they need not mend their manners since wives will endure anything it is immoral for a woman to live with such a husband i dont understand idealas meekness it amounts to weakness sometimes i think i believe if he struck her she would say thank you and fetch him his slippers i feel sure she thinks some unknown defect in herself is at the bottom of all his misdeeds i dont think she knows half as much about his misdeeds as we do i observed then i think it would be a charity to enlighten her claudia answered decidedly one cant touch pitch without being defiled and when it is too late we shall find she has suffered some taint in nature in spite of herself will you kindly take us to the palace this evening the bishop wants us to go in after dinner and ideala has promised to come too ideala was fastidious about her dress and being in one of her moods that evening she teased claudia unmercifully on the way to the palace about a blue woollen shawl she was wearing a delicate and refined nature expresses itself by nothing more certainly than elegant wraps she said parodying another famous dictum and i should not like to be able to understand the state of mind a lady was in when she bought herself a blue woollen shawl but i could believe she was suffering at the time from a temporary aberration of intellectonly if she wore it afterwards the thing would be quite inexplicable claudia drew the wrap round her with dignity and made no reply then ideala laughed and turned to me certainly your friend she said alluding to a young sculptor who was staying with me can invest his portraits with artistic merit claudias likeness in the exhibition is capital and the fame of it is being noised abroad with a vengeance but i think something should be done to stop the little newspaperboy nuisance the reports they spread are quite alarming ideala what nonsense are you talking about sculptors and newspaper boys claudia exclaimed ill tell you said ideala there was a small boy with a big voice standing at the corner of the marketplace this afternoon he had a sheaf of evening papers under his arm and was yelling with much enthusiasm to an edified crowdnoose of the war hawful mutilation of the dead fearful collision in the channel eightyeight lives lost narrative of survivors thrilling details shindy in parlment hirish members to the front again orrible haccident in our own town the lady claudias bust ideala how dare youbut just then the carriage stopped and we had to get out the good bishop met us in the hall ideala positively declined to go upstairs when he asked her it is too much trouble she said not seeing in her absence what was meant i would rather leave my things here but i am afraid i must trouble you the bishop answered in despair the fact is my wife is not so well this evening and she was afraid of the cold and is staying in her own sittingroom the sittingroom was a snug apartment warm cosy luxurious and we found a genial little party of intimate acquaintances there when we arrived idealas husband was not one of them he did not take her out much at that time probably he was engaged in some private pursuit of his own and insisted on her going everywhere alone to keep her out of the way a little while before he would scarcely allow her to pay a call without him but as a rule whatever his mood was she did as he wishedand provoked him sometimes i think by her patient compliance a little resistance would have made the exercise of his authority more exciting when we entered the sittingroom an ominous silence feel on the group which was broken at last by one of the ladies remarking that a kind heart was an admirable thing another agreed and made some observations on the merits of selfsacrifice generally but some people are not satisfied with merely doing a good deed a gentleman declared with profound gravity they think there is no merit in it if they do not suffer for it in some way themselves there was a good deal more of this kind of thing and we were beginning to feel rather out of it when presently the preternatural gravity of the party was broken by a laugh and then it was explained ideala had gone to a neighbouring town one day by train and before she started a poor woman got into the carriage the woman had a thirdclass ticket but she was evidently ill and when the guard came and wanted to turn her out ideala took pity on her insisted on changing tickets and travelled third class herself the woman had been to the palace and described the incident to the bishops wife that morning and she had just told her guests wondering who the lady could have been and they in turn had put their heads together and decided that there was no one in the community but ideala who would have done the thing in that way but what else could i have done she asked when she saw we were laughing at her well my dear said the bishop who always treated her with the kind indulgence that is accorded to a favourite child you might have paid the difference for the woman and travelled comfortably yourself dont you know ideala never thought of that presently the dear old bishop nestled back in his chair and with a benign glance round which his scapegrace son said meant bless you my children be happy and good in your own way but dont make a noise he sank into a gentle doze and the rest of the party relapsed into trivial gossip some of which i give for what it is worth by way of illustration it shows ideala at about her worst but marks a period in her career a turningpoint for the better she was seldom bitter and still more rarely frivolous after that night clare turner will take none of the blame of that affair on his own shoulders some one remarked mr clare turner is the little boy who always said it wasnt me grown up ideala decided from the corner of her couch he is a sort of tworeason man how do you mean a tworeason man ideala well he has only two reasons for everything one is his reason for doing anything he likes himself which is always a good one and the other is his reason why the rest of the world should not do likewise which is equally clearto himself he thinks there should be one law for him and another for everybody else i dont believe in him nor i said one of the gentlemen underhand bowling was all he was celebrated for at school he bowled most frightful sneaks all the time he was there talking about clare turner charlie lloyd put in ive brought a new book of poemsauthor unknown i picked it up at the station today theres one thing in it called the passion of delysle that seems to be intense but ive only just glanced at it and dont really know what its like shall i read it oh do was the general exclamation and we all settled ourselves to enjoy the following treat charlie began softly o day and night oh day and night and is this madness o day and night o day and night and is this joy whence comes this bursting sense of life and love and gladness this pain of pleasure perfected without alloy lo flowing past me are the restless rivers or swelling round me is the boundless sea or else the widening waste of sand that quivers in shining stretches shuts the world from me or seems to shut it while i would that what it seems might be o day and night o day and night this mountain island this saintly shrine this forti scarce know what tis yet this sand or seagirt rocky townclad churchcrownd highland this dull and rugged gem in golden deserts set has some delicious unknown charm to hold me to draw me to itself and keep me here the old grey walls it seems with joy enfold me or is it i that make the dead stones dear and send the throbbing summer in my blood thro all things near o day and night o day and night where else do flowers open their velvet lids like these to greet the light or raise such sunkissed lips aglow to meet cool showers or cast more subtle scents abroad upon the night these trees and trailing weeds that climb the cliffside steep the dusky pine trees draped with wreaths of vine make bowers where love might lie and list the seavoice deep and drink the perfumed air the light like wine which threads intoxication through these hot glad veins of mine o day and night o day and night i sought this haven from place and power and wealth i flew in search of rest they forced and bound me to a hard detested craven who mocked my loathing with his head upon my breast with deathless love i moaned for my young lover to make me great they drove him from my side and foully wrought with shame his name to cover my boy my lord my prince in vain they lied but should i always suffer for their false inhuman pride o day and night o day and night i left them flying i fled by day and night as flies the nomad breeze across the silent land when light to dark was dying and onward like a spirit lost across the seas and on from sea and shore thro appleorchards blooming till all things melted in a moving haze and on with rush and ring by tower and townlet glooming by wood and field and hill by verdant ways while dawn to midday drew and noon was lost in sunset blaze o day and night o day and night light once more waxing still on with courage high tho strength was wellnigh spent grim spectres of pursuit the wearied brain perplexing fearfraught but ever met with spirit dedolent the landscape reeled there came a sense of slumber and myriad shadows rose and wanned and waned and flitting figures visions without number took shape above the land till sight was pained and floated round me till at last the longedfor goal i gained o day and night o day and night with rest abounding the soothing sinking down on hardearned holy rest with grateful ease that grew from all the calm surrounding a languid dreamful ease my soul became possessed the hoarse seawind comes soughing sighing singing its constant message from the patient waves while high above cathedral bells were ringing or falling voices chanted hymns of praise and all the land seemed filled with peace and promised length of days o day and night o day and night once all unheeding by sun and summer wind with tender touch caressed i wandered where the strains the sacred strains were pleading and kneeling in the fane my thoughts to prayer addressed and softly rose the murmurd organ mystery and swelld around the colonnaded aisle where smiled the pictured saints of holy history on prostrate penitents who prayed the while i could not pray there but i felt that god himself might smile o day and night o day and night while i was kneeling there came the strangest sense of some loved presence near a reawakening rush of wellremembered feeling thrilld thro me held me still with vague expectant fear half turnd from me there stood beside the altar where incenseclouds nigh veiled him from my sight a fairhaired priestmy quickend heartbeats falter or is he priest or is he acolyte or layman devotee who prays in novice robes bedight o day and night o day and night whence comes this feeling for all unreal seem day and night and life and death and all unreal the hope that sets my senses reeling and stills my pulse an instant checks my labring breath yet louder rolls the mighty organ thundring and downward slopes a beam of light divine the perfumed clouds are cleft he looks up wondring looks upwhat does he there before the shrine he could not give himself to god for he is mine is mine o day and night o day and night i go forth trembling he did not meet my eyes he never saw my face my bosom swells with joy and jealousy resembling a war of good and evil waged in a holy place no longer soft the day the sun in splendour pours all his might upon this green incline i lie and watch the cirrus clouds surrender their glowing forms to one hot kiss resign how could he give himself to god when he is mine is mine o day and night o day and night beneath your glory the crimson flood of life itself has turned to fire the rugged brows of those old rocks stormrent and hoary are quivering in their grim surprise at my desire the mother earth throbbing with pain and pleasure would sink her voices for the languid noon but light airs wake a reckless maddning measure and wavelets dance and sparkle to the tune and mock the mocking malice of yon daydimmd gibbous moon o day and night o day and night a fisher maiden is wandring up the path to where unseen i lie she comes with some light spoil from off the shore beladen and softly singing of the sea goes slowly by and slowly rise great suntipped white cloud masses sublimely still their shadows flit and flee how silently the work of nature passes the roll of worlds the growth of flower and tree angels of god in heaven give him to me give him to me o day and night o day and night the hours rolling bring evry one its change its song or chant or chime now solemnly their sounds a distant deathknell tolling and now the bells above beat forth the flight of time i lie unconsciously each trifle noting the faroff sailors toiling on the quay or oer the sand a broadwingd seabird floating or passing hum of honeyladend bee angels of god in heaven give him to me give him to me o day and night o day and night the scene surrounding grows dim and all unreal beneath the sunset glow and all the heat and rage pass into peace abounding i moan i fear no more but wait while still tears flow the warm sweet airs scarce move the flowerets slender a pause and hush have settled on the sea a bird trills forth its lovesong low and tender o bird rejoice thy love and thou art free angels of god in heaven give him to me give him to me o day and night o day and night ye knew it ever ye saw it written in the worlds first golden prime and smiled your giant smile at all my rash endeavour to snatch the cup unfilld from out the hand of time he comes o day and night spirits attending swift formless messengers my evry sense apprise he comes the bright fair head oer some old book low bending dear lord at last his eyes have met my eyes gleam of light goes quivering across the happy skies o day and night o day and night love sits between us far out the rising tide comas sweeping oer the sand the murmurous pine trees lend their purple shade to screen us and breathe their fragrant sighs above the quiet land and like a sigh the sunset blaze is over the folding grey has veiled its colours bright while swift from view fade out the gulls that hover as round us sinks at last on pinions light the dark and radiant clarity of the beautiful still night o day and night o day and night no words are spoken such pleasant joy profound no words could well express his wandring fingers smooth my hair in silent token and all my being answers to the tender mute caress my head is resting on his breast for pillow and as by music moved my soul is thrilld flow on and clasp the land o bursting billow o breezes tell the mountains manyrilld our hearts now know each other and our hope is allfulfilld o day and night o day and night no shadow crosses this longdfor solemn hour of allforgetful bliss no chilling thought or stalking dread arising tosses a poisond drop of bitterness to spoil the lingring kiss no memries past or future fears assailing as soon might doubt bedim the stars that shine or souls released reach paradise bewailing the end of pain and clemency divine the glorious present holds us i am his and he is mine o day and night o day and night and was it madness lo all is changing even sky and sea and shore the heaving water ebbs itself away in sadness the waves receding sigh delight returns no more far down the east the dawn is dimly burning its first chill breath has shivered thro my frame and with the light comes cruel thought returning the air seems full of voices speaking blame another day commences but the world is not the same o day and night o day and night its rashes passd us we stand upon the brink and watch the strong deep tide and shrink already from the howls that soon must blast us the world that sins unchidden and the laws that would divide o love they rest in peace whom ocean covers one plunge one clasp supernal one long kiss then downward like those old italian lovers descend for ever through the long abyss and float together happy all eternity like this the charm of the readers voice had held us spellbound and the poem was well received but after the usual compliments there was a pause and then ideala burst out impetuously i am sick of those old italian lovers she said they float into everything their story is the essence with which twothirds of our love literature is flavoured we should never have received them in society why do we tolerate them in books i like my company to be respectable even there and when an author asks me to admire and sympathise with such people he insults me they must be brought in though for the sake of contrast somebody observed they should be kept in their proper place then she answered you may choose what you please to point a moral but for pitys sake be careful about what you use to adorn a tale moral or no moral said the young sculptor i think a new poem of any kind a thing to be thankful for and do you call that kind of thing new said ideala i should say it was a fine compound of all the poems of the kind and several other kinds that have ever been written with a dash of the peculiarly refined immorality of our own times from which nothing is sacred thrown in to make weight such writing like a new disease unknown to men creeps no precaution used among the crowd and saps the fealty of our friends and stirs the pulse with devils leaps and poisons half the young it is the feeling of the day accurately defined nobody sighs for love and peace now the cry is for the indulgence of some fiery passion for an hour and then perditionif you likesince that is the recognised price of it our loves are more intense than they used to be said the sculptor sighing love ideala answered oh do not desecrate the eternal godword love there is little enough of that in the business that goes by its name nowadays i am a ladyi cannot use the right word but it is none the less the thing i mean because it calls blasphemously on god almighty to help it to fulfil itself well said charlie lloyd deprecatingly i didnt offer this you know as an admirable specimen of what our day can produce i told you i hadnt read it and now that i have i dont suppose any one has offered it to the public as a serious expression of sentiment you do not think people write books about what they really feel said ideala i believe they do when the feeling is shameful if you want to keep a secret publish the exact truth in a book and nobody will believe a word of it i think people who publish such productions should be burned on a pile of their own works the writer is young doubtless i said apologetically it gives one a shock to hear a woman say harsh things he was evidently not too young to have bad thoughts said claudia supporting her friend and he was certainly old enough to know better he ejaculated ideala it is far more likely to be she do you read the reviews you will find that all the most objectionable books are written by womenand condemned by men who lift up their voices now as they have done from time immemorial and insist that we should do as they say and not as they do i am afraid you are right said charlie lloyd so many of our best womeni mean the women who are likely to make most impression on the ageare going that way now but what horrid things you say ideala one of the ladies chimed in and you make everybody else say horrid things that passion of delysle is not a bit worse than tennysons fatimaand theres a lot more in itthat part about the roll of worlds you know is quite grand i always liked that idea ideala observed andand the lady continued where she looks at everything you know she was very properly seeking distraction and found it for a moment in the contemplation of nature and that softened her mood so that when the inevitable rush of recollection comes and forces the thought of him back upon her her feeling finds expression in a prayer instead ofinstead of a blasphemous remonstrance ideala put in oh i dont deny that there is just enough to be said in favour of all these things to make them selland this one has two unusual points of interest it opens with a riddle and the ladys lover is a priest which gives an additional zest to the charm of wrongdoing a sauce piquante for jaded appetites why do you call the opening verses a riddle said charlie lloyd because i fancy no one will ever guess what kind of a place it was this mountain island this saintly shrine this fort i forget how it goes on oh the description of the place is not bad charlie answered after reading it over again to himself it would do for the mont st michael in normandy well let that pass then said ideala also the dear familiar subtle scents abroad upon the night but what does she mean by on with rush and ring she means the train obviously what an outlandish periphrasis and how about the rugged brows of those old rocks stormrent and hoary are quivering in their grim surprise that is a pathetic fallacy she is not speaking of the things as they were but as they appeared to her excited fancy she chronicles her own death though so did moses said ideala if you really want to justify the passion of delysle i can help you you see she was dreadfully badly treated by her friends poor thing and her marriage after all was no marriage because she loved another man all the time and your husband isnt properly your husband if you dont love him love being the only possible sanctificationin fact the only true marriage and then her lover thinking he had lost her became a priest and vows made under a misapprehension like that cannot be bindingit would be too much to expect us to suffer always for such mistakes and then the worldbut we all know how cruel the world is and appearances were sadly against them poor things no one would ever have believed that they had stayed out all night to discuss their religious experiences suicide is shocking of course but still when people are driven to it like that we can only be sorry for them and hope they will never do it again she nestled back more comfortably on her couch and then continued in an altered tone but it is appalling to think of the quantity of machinemade verses like those that are imposed on the public year by year verses the mere result of much reading and writing without a scrap of inspiration in them and as far removed from even schoolboy efforts of genius as an oleograph is from an oil painting poets are as rare now as prophets and inspiration has left us for our sins i think any fairly educated one of us with a tolerable memory and the habit of composition could write that passion of delysle again in halfanhour oh could they though said ralph the son of the house i dare bet anything you couldnt do it yourself in twice the time dare you she answered with a little smile well to adopt your elegant phraseology master ralph i bet i will produce the same story with the same conclusion but a different moral in an hoursince you allow me twice the time i namedif i may be permitted to write it in blank verse that is and of course with the understanding that what i write is not intended to be anything but mere versified prose done with you cried ralph hushhh his mother exclaimed deprecatingly betting and before the bishop too what the bishop dont know will do him no harm ma said the youth in a stage whisper sit down ideala and begin its ten minutes to ten now the bishop slept serenely conversation flagged and ideala wrote steadily for about threequarters of an hour then she gathered up the manuscript rose from the table and returned to her old seat the passion of delysle has become the choice she said will you read it for me mr lloyd i think it should have that advantage at least charlie took the manuscript and read once on a time not very long gone by a noble lady had a noble choice the daughter of an ancient house was she beauty and wealth and highest rank were hers but love was not for of a proud cold race her people were caring for nought but lands riches and power holding all tender thoughts as weakly folly only fit for babes the lady learnt their creed her heart seemd hard she thought it so and when the moment came to choose twixt love young love and pride of place she stilld an unwonted feeling that would rise and saying calmly i have got no heart and love is vain she chose to be the wife of sinful age corruption and untruth scorning the steadfast love of one who yearnd to win her from the crooked paths she trod and break the sordid chains that bound her soul and sweep the defiling dust of common thoughts from out her mind until it shone at last with large imaginings of god and good she chose no more they met her life was passd in constant round of pomp and proud display but when he went and never more there came the lovesad eyes to question and entreat the voice of music praising noble deeds the graceful presence and the golden hair she missd the boy but scoffd at first and said one misses all things common pets one spurnd good slaves and bad alike when both are gone a small thing makes the habit of a life but days wore on and adulation palled she knew not what she lackd nor that she loathd the hollow semblance the dull mockery which she had gaind for joy by choosing rank and moneys worth instead of peace and love yet ever as the long days grew to months more heavy hung the time moved slower by and all things troubled her and gave her pain and morning noon and night the thought would rise and grew insistent when she would not hear one loved me out of all this crowd but one and he is gone and i have driven him forth then in the silent solitude of night an old weird story that she once had heard tormented her a story speaking much of a rockisland on the norman coast a mountain peak rising from barren sand or standing seagirt when the tide returns and beaten by the winds on evry side with walldin town and castle on the height and high above the castle strangely placed a grey cathedral with its summit tippd by a gold figure of st michael crownd with burnished wings and flashing sword that shone a beacon in the sunset seen for miles as tho the archangel floated in the air the castle and the church a sanctuary and refuge were to which men often fled for rest or safety finding what they sought and as the lady thought about the place a notion came that she would like to kneel and pray for peace at that far lonely shrine the longing grew she rested not nor slept and should she fly and leave her wretched wealth and if she fled she never could return yet if she stayd she felt that she should die so go or stay meant misery for her but misery is lessened when we move yes she would go and then she laughd to think of the wild fury of her harsh old lord when he should wake one day and find her gone laughd the first time for long and weary months by mont st michael on the norman coast a restless river changing oft its course flows sullenly and racehorselike the tide which going leaves a wilderness of sand comes rushing back a foamtoppd watry wall and those who wandring scape the quicksands grip are often caught and drownd ere help can come but fair the prospect from the mount when bright the sunshine falls on avranches far away a white town straggling oer a verdant hill and on the treeclad country toward the west on apple orchards and the fairy bloom of feathry tamrisk bushes on the shore whilst high above in silent majesty of hue and form the floating clouds support the farextending vault of azure sky such was the shrine the lady sought and there in mute appeal for what she lackd she knelt not knowing what she lackd but finding peace steal oer her soul there as she faintly heard the slow and solemn chanting of the priests the mild monotony of murmured prayers and hush of pauses when she seemed to feel the heart she deemd so hard was melting fast and listend to a voice within her say love is not vain love all things and rejoice and found warm tears were stealing down her cheeks the mystery of love of love of love of hope of joy of life itself she felt the crown of life which she had sacrificed in scornful pride for lust of power and place the lady bowd her head and oer her swept a wave of anguish and she knew despair could i but see him once again she moand see him and beg forgiveness and then die did the archangel michael standing there upon her left in shining silver hear who knows her prayer was answerd like a flash for at that moment clear and sweet oer all the mingled music of the chanting choir there rose a voice that thrilld her inmost soul it breathed a blessing utterd soft a prayer no need to look and yet she lookd and saw a hooded monk before the altar kneel a graceful presence tho in sordid dress and as she gazed the cowl slippd back and showd but dimly thro the incenseperfumed cloud a pure pale face a golden tonsured head and blue eyes raised to heaven then the truth was there reveald to her that he had left the world to watch and pray for such as she out of the castledgate she hurried forth what matterd where she went to east or west what matterd peasants warning that the sand was shifting ever and the rushing tide gave them no quarter whom it overtook twas death she courted and with heedless step onward to meet it swift the lady fled death is so beautiful at such a time when all the land in summer sunshine lies and lapse of distant waves breaks pleasantly the silence with a soothing dreamy sound and danger seems no nearer than the sky he tempts us from afar with hope of rest she hurried on in search of death nor heard that eager footsteps followed where she went the voice that calld her was not real she thought but a sweet portion of a strange sweet dream for now the terrible anguish quickly passd and sense of peace at hand was all she felt o stop ah that was real she turnd and saw nor saw a moment till she felt his grasp strong and determined on her rounded arm thou shalt not die he cried what madness this madness she echoed nay my love tis bliss the first my life has knownto stand here still with thee beside me and to wait for death i know my heart at last but all too late i may not love thee i anothers wife thou mayst not love me thou hast wedded heaven we cannot be together in this world i cannot live alone and know thee here and thou art troubled i for beneath that garb thy heart beats ever hot with love for me for love will not be quelld by monkish vows but all things change in death so let us die thus hand in hand and so together pass and be together thro eternity there was a struggle in the young monks breast he would not meet her pleading eyes and yield but gazing up to heaven prayed for strength strength to resist and guidance how to act for death like that with her was luringsweet a strong temptation but he must resist and strive to save and show her how to live we cannot make hereafter for ourselves he answered softly all that we can do is so to live that we shall win reward of praise and peace and happy life to come thy duty lies before thee so does mine let each return and toil and watch and pray knowing each others heart is fixd on heaven and do the good we can not seeking death nor shunning it but living pure and true with conscience clear to meet our god at last and win each other for our great reward the moving music of his words sank deep her alterd heart thrilld high to holy thoughts be thou my guide she said my duty now shall bring me peace so shall i toil like thee to win the love i yearn for in the end it might not be the treachrous working sand already clutched their feet and checkd their speed and dancing sparkling like a joyful thing a glittring glassy wall of foamfleckd wave towards them glided with that fatal speed you cannot mark because it is so swift no use to struggle now no time to fly he claspd her to him god hath willd it thus courage my sister is this death she cried yes this is death it is not death but joy and as she spoke the spot where they were seen became a watry waste of battling waves while high above the summer sun shone on a passing seabird hoarsely shriekd along all things were changed with that vast change which makes it seem as tho nought else had ever been well done ideala said ralph patronisingly you certainly have a memory and are quite as good at patchwork as the author of delysle i could criticise on another count but taking into consideration time place circumstances and the female intellect i refrain that is the generous sort of creature i am so without expressing my own opinion furtherexcept to remark that though i dont think much of either of them personally i prefer delysle the other is wholesomer doubtless for those who like a mild diet milk and water doesnt agree with me but i put it to the vote ladies and gentlemen do you or do you not consider that this lady has won her bet oh won it most decidedly we all agreed bytheby what was the bet i asked my pas gaiters against idealas blue stockings i regret to say that circumstances over which i have no controland he glanced at the unconscious bishopprevent the immediate payment of my debtunless indeed he has a second pair and he left the room hurriedly as if to see he did not come back to us that evening but i believe he was to be heard of later at the sign of the billiard and cue well said the young sculptor returning to the old point of departure for my own part i find much that is elevating in modern works so do i said ideala i find much that raises me on stilts but even that eminence would enable you to look over other peoples heads and beyond it would she answered if human nature didnt desire a sense of security but as it is when i am artificially set up i find that all i can do is to look at my own feet and tremble lest i fall modern literature stimulates it doesnt nourish it makes you feel like a giant for a moment but leaves you crushed like a worm and without faith without love without hope it excites you pleasurably and when you see life through its medium you never suspect that the vision is distorted it makes you think the iconoclast the greatest hero and causes you to feel that you share his glory when you help him with your approval to overthrow all the images you ever cherished but when the work of destruction is over and you look about you once more with sober eyes you find you have sacrificed your all for nothing your false guide fails you when you want him most he robs you and leaves you hungry thirsty and alone in the wilderness to which he has beguiled you there is no need for new theories of life and religion all we require is strength and courage to perfect the old ones footnote she quite changed her mind upon this subject eventually and held that there was not only need of new theories but good hope that we should have them what the mind wants is food it can grow upon not stimulants which inflate it for a time with a fancied sense of power that has no real existence but i have small hope for our nation when i think of the sparkling trash that the mind of the multitude daily imbibes and craves for i mean our novels what a fine affectation of goodness there is in most of them and what a perfect moral is tacked on to themlike the balayeuse at the bottom of a ladys dress but like the balayeuse it is only meant to be a protection and a finish and however precious it may be it suffers from contact with the dirt and sooner or later has to be cut out and cast aside soiled and useless some doggerel a friend of mine scribbled on one book in particular describes dozens of popular novels exactly o what a beautiful history think what temptations they passed each one more cruelly trying more tempting indeed than the last and what a lesson it teaches no passion from evils exempted whilst admiring the moral it preaches it makes you quite long to be tempted i agree with those who tell us that society is breaking up or will break up unless something is done at once to stop the dissolution we have no high ideals of anything marriage itself is a mere commercial treaty and only professional preachers speak of it in other termsand those young people with a passion for each other who are about to be uniteda passion that dies the death inevitably for want of knowledge and wholesome principle and selfcontrol to support it some of us like our bargains better than others but you can judge of the estimation in which marriage is held when you see how much happiness people generally find in it if men and women were kept apart and made to live purely from their cradles they would still scarcely be fit for marriage yet any man thinks he may marry and never cares to be the nobler or the better for it and when you see that this the only perfect state the most sacred bond of union between man and woman is everywhere lightly considered dont you think there is reason in the fear that we are falling on bad times oh dont quote the romans to me and the inevitable we know better than the romans and could do better if we chose but we have to mourn for the death of our manhood where is our manhood where are our men is there any wonder that we are losing what is best in life when only women are left to defend it believe me the degradation of marriage is the tune to which the whole fabric of society is going to pieces eh what exclaimed the bishop waking up with a startwhole fabric of society going to pieces nonsense when so many people come to church and then look at all the societies at work for thefor the ahprevention of everything why i belong to a dozen at least myself the prevention of cruelty to animals and the rational dress reform for doing away with petticoatsno bytheby it is my wife who belongs to that but at any rate everything is being done that should be done and you talk nonsense my dearlooking at ideala severely because you dont know anything about it the faults we are hardest on in others are those we are most conscious of in ourselvesperhaps because we know how easy it would be to conquer them ideala observed vaguely oh come now my dear said the bishop beaming round on all of us you must not believe what you hear about society being in such a bad state i know idle people say so and it is very wrong of them why i never see anything wrong of course not said ideala we are all on our best behaviour before you the bishop patted his apron goodhumouredly well now take yourself for example he said i am sure you never do wrongtell stories you know and that kind of thing havent i though she answered mischievously not that it was much use for i always repented and confessed and now i have abandoned the practice to the best of my ability it is horrid to feel you dont deserve the confidence that is placed in you bishop isnt it ideala claudia protested the bishop looked puzzled i can assure you i have suffered agonies of remorse because in an idle moment i deceived my cata big comfortable creature who used to come to me every day to be fed and preferred to eat out of my hand he was greedy though and snapped and one day i offered him a piece of preserved ginger and he dashed at it as usual and swallowed it before he knew what it was then he just looked at me and walked away he trusted me and i had deceived him it was an unpardonable breach of confidence and i have always felt that i never could look that cat in the face again the bishop smiled and sighed at the little reminiscence i think you are right though in one way ideala he presently observed the powers of light and darkness are certainly having a hard fight for it in our day but we have every reason to hope oh yet we trust that somehow good will be the final goal of ill and granted that the popular literature of the day is corrupt the young sculptor put in and that the standard of society is being yearly lowered by it still there is art but there is so little of it said ideala i mean so little that elevates most of the subjects chosen are not worth painting and what profit is there in contemplating a thing that is neither grand nor beautiful in itself nor suggestive by association of anything that is grand or beautiful the pictures one generally sees are not calculated to suggest anything to the minds that need suggestion most the technical part may be good and gratifying to those who understand it but that is the mere trade of the thing we prefer to see it well done of course but if the canvas has nothing but the paint to recommend it the artist might have saved himself the trouble of putting it on for all the good it does or the pleasure it gives oh ideala do you know nothing of the charm of colour asked a lady who painted i do said ideala but i may be supposed to have enjoyed exceptional advantages and it is hardly charm we want to elevate us there will always be enough in all conscience to appeal to the senses but there is an absence even of charm many a noble thought has been expressed in a coat of colour said the lady i know it has ideala answered and all best thoughts give pleasure i have been so thrilled by a noble idea well expressed that i could do nothing but sit with closed eyes and revel in the joy of it but if such an idea were placed before you and you did not know the language in which it was written what good would it do you an uneducated person seeing a picture of a donkey in a field sees only a donkey in a field however well it may be painted and i fancy very exceptional ability would be required to make any of us think a grey donkey sublime or believe an ordinary green field to be one of the elysian talking about charm the sculptor broke in enthusiastically i suppose you havent seen the new picture venus getting into the bath that is a feast of colour and realism if you like she is standing beside the bath with a dreamy look on her face her lovely eyes are fixed on the water one arched and blueveined foot is slightly raised as if the touch of the marble chilled her her limbs are in an easy attitude and beautifully modelled she is represented as a slight young girl and the figure stands out in exquisite nudity from a background of pompeian red and the dark green of myrtles with one hand she is holding aloft the masses of her rich brown hairthe attitude suggests the stretching of the muscles after repose with the otherbut here his memory failed him what is she doing with her other hand scratching herself slipped from ideala involuntarily to her own horror and the delight of some but she recovered herself quickly and turning to the good bishop who was looking mildly astonished and much amused she said there my lord is an instance of the corrupt state of society in our own day you see even your restraining presence doesnt always keep us in order i hope she whispered to me im not going to be made the horrid example to prove the truth of all my theories soon after this the party broke up claudia returned in her wraps to say goodnight to the bishops wife claudia ideala exclaimed you have forgotten that detestable old blue shawl claudia tried to stop her with a significant gesture but in vain ideala was obtuse claudia came out this evening in the most extraordinary covering i ever saw a lady wear she said to the bishops wife i really think she must have borrowed it from one of the maids i am afraid you must mean the blue shawl i lent to lady claudia the other evening the bishops wife replied with a hurt smile oh said ideala disconcerted for a moment but really bishopess you deserve to be upbraided you should set a better example and not provoke us to scorn on the subject of your shawls later when i was alone with my sister i said ideala did nothing but put her foot in it this evening what was the matter with her i never heard her speak so strongly before except when she was alone with us and i dont think she ought to discuss such subjects with such people it is hardly delicate claudia sighed wearily who knows what pain is at the bottom of it all she said but one thing always puzzles me ideala rails at evils that never hurt her and yet she speaks of marriage which has been her bane as if it were a holy and perfect state upon which it is a privilege to enter plenty of people have condemned marriage simply because their own experience of it has been unfortunate i answered but ideala is above that she will let no petty personal mishap prejudice her judgment on the subject she sees and feels the possibility of infinite happiness in marriage when there is such love and such devotion on both sides as she herself could have brought to it and she understands that her own unhappy experience need only be exceptional i wish it were sighed claudia some years later ideala confessed to me that she had written the passion of delysle herself but had had no idea of its significance until she heard it read aloud that night and then as she elegantly expressed it she could have cut her throat with shame and mortification which i consider a warning to young ladies not to trust to their poetical inspirations forif the shade of shelley will pardon the conclusionalas apparently they know not what they do when they write verses i cant think how you could have criticised it like that ideala i said now that i know you wrote it neither can i she answered you ought to have confessed you had written it or have said nothing about it i told her frankly yes she assented not doing so was a kind of falsehood but neither course occurred to me and then she explained i never see the meaning of what i write till the light of public opinion is turned upon it or some cold critic comes and damps my enthusiasm when a subject possesses me and shapes itself into verse it boils in my brain and my pen is the only way of escape for it the one safetyvalve i have to ease the pressure and i cant judge of its merits myself for long enough after it is written because the boiling begins again you see whenever i read it and then there is such a steam of feeling i cannot see to think for the verses however poor they appear to you contain for me the whole poem as i have it in my inner consciousness it is beautiful as it exists there but the power of expression is lacking if only i could make you feel it as i do i should be the greatest poet alive it was a trick of idealas to miss the true import of a thingoften an act of her ownuntil the occasion had passed or to see it strangely distorted as she frequently did at this timethough that gradually ceased altogether as she grew older but it was this peculiarity so strongly marked in her which first helped me to comprehend a curious trait there is in the moral nature of men and women while it is still in process of development many men frenchmen especially have thought the trait peculiar to women la bruyre declares that women have no principles as men understand the word they are guided by their feelings and have full faith in their guide their notions of propriety and impropriety right and wrong they get from the little world embraced by their affections and alphonse karr says never attempt to prove anything to a woman she believes only according to her feelings endeavour to please and persuade she may yield to the person who reasons with her not to his argumentsopinions however which apply to men as often as not and only to the young impressible passionate and imperfectly educated of either sex but there is scarcely a generalisation for one sex which does not apply equally to the other so perfectly alike in nature are men and women the difference is only in circumstance reverse the position of the sexes require men to be modest and obedient and they will develop every womans weakness in a generation if a man would comprehend a woman let him consider himself the woman has the same joys sorrows hopes fears pleasures and passionsexpressed in another way that is all but certainly for a long time idealas guide was her feeling about a thing i have often said to her when at last she decided to take some step which had obviously been the only course open to her from the first but ideala why have you hesitated so long you knew it was right to begin with yes she would answer i knew it was right but i have only just now felt that it was she had never thought of acting on the mere cold knowledge for feeling to knowledge in young minds is like the match to a fire laid in a grate knowledge without feeling being as cheerless and impotent as the fire unlit chapter xii a little while after that evening at the palace we learnt to our dismay that idealas husband had taken a house in one of the rough manufacturing districts to which he meant to remove immediately business was the pretext as he had money in some great ironworks there but i think the nearness of a large city where a man of his stamp would be able to indulge all his tastes without let or hindrance had something to do with the change ideala had kept up very well while she was among us but soon after she went away we gathered from the tone of her letters that there was a change in her which alarmed us her health which had hitherto been splendid seemed to be giving way and it was evident that her new position did not please her and that even after she had been there for months she continued to feel herself a stranger in a strange land the people were uncongenial and i think it likely they regarded idealas oddities with some suspicion and did not take to her as we had done she had not that extreme youth which had been her excuse when she came to us and which somehow we had not missed when she lost it and her habitual reserve on all matters that immediately concerned herself must also have tended to make her unpopular with people whose predominant quality was an eminent curiosity they are far above books ideala wrote to claudia what they study is each other and in the pursuit of this branch of knowledge they are indefatigable when they can get nothing out of me about myself they question me about my husband and friends and it is in vain that i answer them with those words of wisdom i feel sure i misquote them all that is mine own is yours till the end of my life but the secret of my friend is not mine ownthey persevere our house is near the town eighteen big chimneys darken our daylight and deluge us with smuts when the wind brings the smoke our way and besides the smoke we are subject to unsavoury vapours from chemical works in the other direction so that when the wind shifts we only exchange evils they say these chemical fumes are not unwholesome and quote the deathrate which is lower than any other place of the size in england in fact scarcely anybody dies here they go away as soon as they begin to feel illperhaps that accounts for it but those horrid chemical fumes have a great deal to answer for they have killed the trees for miles around it is the oaks that suffer principally the tops are nipped first and then they gradually die downwards till the whole tree is decayed all through the absence of trees makes the country bleak and desolate and i cannot help thinking the unlovely surroundings affect us all the people themselves are unlovely in thought and word and deed but i have found a good deal of rough kindliness amongst them nevertheless they did mob me on one occasion and made most unkind remarks about my nether garments when i was obliged to walk through the town in my riding habit but as a rule the mill girls merely observe thats a lady and let me go by unmolestedunless i happen to be carrying flowers they do so love flowers poor things and i cannot resist their pathetic entreaties when they beg for one missus ony one some of my lady friends are not let off so easily as i am the girls chaff them unmercifully about their dress and personal peculiarities and if they show signs of annoyance they call them names that are not to be repeated the mill girls wear brightcoloured gowns white aprons and nothing on their heads if a policeman catches them at any mischief they either clatter off in their clogs with shrieks of laughter or knock him down and kick him most unmercifully they are as strong as men and as beautiful some of them as saints but they are very unsaintlike creatures reallyirresponsible and with little or no idea of right and wrong one scarcely believes that they have soulsand i am always surprised to find that anything not cruel and coarse can survive in the hearts of people begrimed body and mind like these by their hard surroundings but it is there neverthelessthe human nature and the poetry and the something ready to thrill to better things a gentleman has a lovely place not far from us where the trees have been spared by a miracle nightingales seldom wander so far north but a few years ago a stray one was heard there and the wonder and the beauty of its voice brought hundreds from the mills and crowded streets to hear it sing special trains were run from the neighbouring city to accommodate the crowds that came nightly to wait in the moonlight and listen and an enterprising trader set up a stall and sold gingerbeer the story ends there but i like it dont you especially the gingerbeer part of it it was told me by one who remembers the circumstance my greatest pleasure in life is in my flowers they are dearer to me than any i ever had before because they are all so delicate and require such infinite care and tenderness to keep them alive in this uncongenial climate i have my thrushes alsotwo which i stole from a nest in a wood one moonlight night and brought up by hand on bread and milk and scraped beef i had to get up at daylight and feed them every hour until dark but the clergy will not allow that this obligation was a proper excuse for staying away from church and just now i am unhappy in the feeling that their religion must be inhuman but my thrushes have well repaid the trouble they call me when i go into the room and come to me when i open the door of their cage and perch on my shoulder one of them israfil sings divinely people who come to hear him see only a little brown bird with speckled breast and call him a thrush but i know he is israfil the angel of song and most melodious of gods creatures and he thinks that i have wings he told me so i wish you would send me a basket of snails packed up in lettuce leaves i dont know why but i can find none here and i cannot hear of one ever having been seen in the county but please do not send them unless you are quite sure you can spare them ideala is trying to hide herself behind these pretty trivialities claudia said i always suspect that there is something more wrong than usual when she adopts this playful tone and childlike simplicity of taste it must be trying to have a friend who believes so little in one as you do in ideala i answered oh how exasperating you are claudia exclaimed you know what i mean quite well enough later ideala wrote you are anxious about my health the fact is i have developed a most extraordinary talent for taking cold i went by train to see the museum in the city the other day i took off my cloak while i was there and stayed an hour and when i came away the antiquary who knew i was a precious specimen wrapped me up carefully himself nevertheless i caught cold then i went to stay with some people near here who clamoured much for the pleasure of my company they live in a palace and are entertaining the ladys papa took me in to dinner he first evening he asked me about major gorst and wanted to know in an impressive tone of voice if i had heard that he was the next heir but one to the hearldom of cathcourt the next day my hostess said to her husband dearest do let me ride oscar and he replied no my darling i cant till i know hes safe i must get some one to try him firstand he looked at meperhaps you wouldnt mind they had never seen me on horseback and i was longing to distinguish myself i did distinguish myself oscar was a merry horse but one never knew how he would take things the first bridge we came toi was sitting easy to a canter with my foot out of the stirrup and my leg over the third crutcha bad habit i learnt from a foreign friendand an express train rushed by oscar went on abruptly but i remained the next difficulty was at a brook we ought to have crossed it together but oscar changed his mind at the last moment so he remained and i went on and after that we came to crossroads and had a difference of opinion about which was the right one that ended in our coming over together which made me feel solemndisheartened in factand then i thought we should never understand each other and be friends so i gave him up i did not talk much about riding to those people after that but i wore my summer habit that day and of course i caught cold and when that was nearly well i went downstairs to be civil to some people who had driven a long way to see me the drawingroom was damp from disuse and the fire had only just been lightedand of course i caught cold when that was better i went for a drive the wind was east and the carriage was openand of course i caught cold i dont know how it may strike you but argument seems to me useless when a person has such a constitution can you read between the lines of that letter claudia asked me she seems to be dreadfully dont care i said exactly she is more reckless and therefore more miserable than she used to be i wouldnt live with him ideala wont shirk her duty because it is hard and unpalatable i answered i believe she likes it claudia exclaimed and then smiling at her own inconsistency she explained i mean if she really is miserable she ought to speak and let us do something it is contrary to her principles she would think it wrong to disturb your mind for a moment because her own life is a burden to her that is why she always tries to seem happy and is cheerful on the surface if she made lament we should suffer in sympathy and all the more because there is so very little we could do to help her silence is best if she ever gives way she will not be able to bear it again but why should she bear it claudia demanded it is her duty i know she thinks so and is sacrificing her life to that principle but will you kindly tell me where a womans duty to her husband ends and her duty to herself begins i suppose you will allow that she has a duty to herself and the line should be drawn somewhere claudias mind was a sort of boomerang just then returning inevitably to this point of departure but i could make no suggestion that satisfied her and i was uneasy myself ideala refused to come to us and had made some excuse to prevent it when claudia offered to go to her this puzzled me but we induced her at last to promise to meet us in london in may it was april then and we thought if she could be persuaded to stay two months of the season in town with us and go with us afterwards to a place of mine in the north which she loved she would probably recover her health and spirits chapter xiii in the meantime however something decisive happened as we afterwards learnt it seems that after they left our neighbourhood ideala had by accident made a number of small discoveries about her husband which had the effect of destroying any remnant of respect she may still have felt for him she found that he was in the habit of examining her private papers in her absence and that he had opened her letters and resealed them his manner to her was unctuous as a rule but she knew he lied to her without hesitation if it suited his purposeand that alone would have been enough to destroy her liking for him for it is not in the nature of such a woman to love a man who has looked her in the face and lied to her these things and the loneliness he brought upon her by driving from her the few people with whom she had any intellectual fellowship she would have borne in the old uncomplaining way but he did not stop there one day she drove into town with a friend who got out to do some shopping ideala waited in the carriage which had stopped opposite a publichouse and from where she sat she could see the little sitting room behind the bar and its occupants they were her husband and the barmaid who was sitting on his knee ideala arranged her parasol so that they might not see her if they chanced to look that way and calmly resumed the conversation when her friend returned she dined alone with her husband that evening and talked as usual telling him all she had done and what news there was in the paper as she always did to save him the trouble of reading it in return he told her he had been at the ironworks all day only leaving them in time to dress for dinner a piece of news she received with a still countenance and her soft eyes fixed on the fire she was standing on the hearth at the time and as he spoke he laid his hand upon her shoulder caressingly but she could not bear it her powers of endurance were at an end and for the first time she shrank from him openly how you do loathe me ideala he exclaimed yes i loathe you she answered and then in a sudden burst of rage he raised his hand and struck her idealas determination to be faithful to what she conceived to be her duty had kept her quiet hitherto but now a sense of personal degradation made her desperate and she forgot all that her first impulse was to consult somebody to speak and find means to put an end to her misery but i was not there and to whom should she go for advice her impatience brooked no delay she must see some one instantly she thought of the rector of the parish but felt he would not do he was a finelooking wellmannered old gentleman much engaged in scientific pursuits who always spoke of the deity as if he were on intimate terms with him and had probably never been asked to administer any but the most formal kind of spiritual consolation in his life the training and experience of a roman catholic priest accustoming them as it does to deal with every phase of human suffering and passion would have been more useful to her in such an emergency but she knew none of the priests in that district and did not think of going to them but while she was considering the matter as if by inspiration she remembered something an acquaintance had lately written to her this lady was a person for whom she felt much respect and that doubtless influenced her decision considerably the lady wrote it must be convenient to be only twenty minutes by train from such a big place i suppose you go over for shopping c when you are there again i wish you would go and see my cousin lorrimer he is adviser in general at the great hospitala responsible position and i am sure if you go he will be glad to do the honours of the place which is most interesting ideala had felt from the first that she would rather consult a stranger who would be disinterested and unprejudiced this gentlemans name promised well for him for he belonged to people whose integrity was well known and his position vouched for his abilityand also for his age to ideala whose imagination had pictured a learned old gentleman bald spectacled benevolent full of knowledge of the world wise saws and modern instances no one she thought could be better suited for her purpose and accordingly next day after attending to her household duties she went by an early train to consult him chapter xiv the great hospital had been founded by an eccentric old gentleman of enormous wealth for an entirely original purpose he observed that great buildings were erected everywhere to receive patients suffering from all imaginable bodily ills chronic mania of course when the brain was diseased being one of them but no one had thought of making provision for such troubles mental moral and religious as affect the mind and he held that such suffering was as real and without proper treatment as incurable and disastrous as any form of physical ailment he therefore determined to found an hospital for these unhappy ones which should contain every requisite that divine revelation had suggested or human ingenuity could devise for the promotion of peace of mind the idea had grown out of some great mental trouble with which he himself had been afflicted in early life and for which the world as it was could offer him no relief the first thing he did towards the carrying out of his plan was to buy a site for his hospital near a growing town on the banks of a big river the building was to be surrounded by green fields for the colour is refreshing and within sight of a great volume of calmly flowing water the silent power of which is solemn and tranquillising to the spirit and human society was to be within easy reach for many people find it beneficial as soon as he had found the site which was entirely satisfactory he set about maturing his plan for the building such a scheme could not be carried out in a moment and he spent thirty years in travelling to study human nature and architecture and all else that should help to bring his work to perfection at the end of thirty years he had finished a plan for the building to his own entire satisfaction but mr ruskin had been growing up in the meantime and had begun to write and the founder happening to come across his works by accident one day discovered his own ideas to be wrong from beginning to end however as it was the truth he was aiming at and not a justification of himself he calmly burnt his plans put his fingers in his ears figuratively speaking that he might not hear the rest of the world bray and for ten years more devoted himself to the study of mr ruskin at the end of that time he knew something about proportion about masses and intervals of light and shade about the grandeur and sublimity of size and the grace and beauty of ornament about depth and harmony of colour and all the other wonders that make one sick with longing to behold them and when he had mastered all this he determined to begin at the very beginning that is to say with the walls that were to enclose his vast experiment everything was to be real everything was to be solid everything had to be endowed with a power of expression that could not fail of its effect and as soon as he felt he might safely begin he hastened away to inspect the long neglected site for his wonderful building but here an unexpected check awaited him while he himself had been so hard at work his future neighbours had not been idle the town had grown to a city the rivers banks were crowded with wharves and human habitations the river itself cradled a fleet on its bosom its waters once so sublimely clear and still were turbid and yellow befouled by the city sewers and useful only and all that remained to remind him of what had once been were a few acres of weeds enclosed by an iron railingan eyesore to the inhabitants of that region as the corporation told him with a polite hope that he would either build on it soon or leave it alone which was their diplomatic way of requesting him to hand the lot over to themselves and this he might have done had they said please but when he found the young city so ignorant he thought it his duty to teach it manners so he took a year or two more to consider the matter then he perceived that if he built his house on the site as it was now he should do even more good than he had intended for the constant contemplation of such a stately pile would help to elevate the citizens outside the building while those within might find comfort in seeing themselves surrounded by even greater misery than their own and so the building rose and grew to perfection and they found after all that no better site could have been chosen for it for from every side as you approached it it was seen to advantage and the majesty and power of it were made manifest outside the design was so evident in its grandeur that the mind was not wearied and perplexed by an effort to understand it was simply elevated to a state of enjoyment bordering on exaltationexaltation without excitement and near akin to peace and the interior of the building as you entered it maintained this first impression such ornament as there was touched you as the clouds do with a sense of suitability that left nothing to be desired art was so perfectly hidden that there seemed to have been no striving for effect in decoration or construction it looked like a work of nature accomplished without effort and beautiful without design and the mind brought under its influence and left free of conjecture was gently compelled to revel in the peace which harmonious surroundings insensibly produce disturbing thoughts vanished as being too common and mean too human for such a place and the spirit was soothed with a sense of reposeof sensuous restfulness really for the pleasure as intended affected the senses more than the intellect which could here make holiday workwearied brains were thus eased from pressure and minds a prey to doubts and other disturbing thoughts which impaired their strength if they did not render them useless were at once relieved and this was the beginning of the treatment which was afterwards continued in other parts of the building and by other means until the cure was completearrangements being made for the removal of cases that proved to be hopeless to those older establishments which have long existed at the expense of the country or as the outcomes of private enterprise of course the staff of such a place had to be formed of men of a high order some of these had been patients themselves and had been chosen on that account it being thought that those who had suffered from certain ills would be apt to detect the symptoms in others and able to devise remedies for them which proved to be the case the establishment was munificently endowed and liberally supported and the master as he was reverently called lived just long enough to see that it was a success he had not thought of extending the charity to women being under the impression that no such provision was necessary for them he acknowledged that they had a large share of physical suffering to endure but asserted that nature to preserve her balance must have arranged their minds so as to render them incapable of suffering in any other way sentimentality hysteria and silliness he said were at the bottom of all their mental troubles which did not therefore merit serious attention chapter xv but of all this ideala knew little or nothing when she went there except that the great hospital existed for some learned purpose she felt the power of the place however preoccupied as she was and stopped involuntarily when she saw the building ceasing for a moment to be conscious of anything but the awe and admiration it inspired then she passed up the broad steps beneath the massive pillars of the portico and entered the hall a manservant took her card to mr lorrimer and returning presently requested her to follow him they left the great hall by a flight of low steps at the end of it and turning to the right passed through glass doors into quite another part of the building a long dimlylighted gallery led away into the distance a few doors opened on to it and at one of these the servant stopped and knocked a tall gentleman opened the door himself and begging ideala to enter bade her be seated at a writingtable which stood in the middle of the room and himself took the chair in front of it and looked at idealas card which lay before him another gentleman whom lorrimer introduced as my brother julian lounged on a highbacked chair at the other side of the table the room was a good size but so crowded with things that there was scarcely space to turn round the light fell full upon lorrimer as he sat facing the window and ideala saw a fair man of about thirty not at all the sort of man she had imagined and quite impossible for her purpose an awkward pause followed her entrance she was unable to tell him the real reason of her visit and at a loss to invent a fictitious one i dont suppose you know in the least who i am she said seeing that he glanced at her card again and then she explained telling him what his cousin had written to her and you would like to see the hospital he asked please he rose took down a bunch of keys and requested her to follow him she felt no interest in the place and knew it was a bore to him to show it to her but the thing had to be done he led her through halls and lecturerooms places of recreation and places for work he showed her picture galleries statuary the library and a museum and told her the plan of it all clearly like one reciting a lesson and indifferently like one performing a task that must be got through somehow but making it all most interesting nevertheless ideala began to be taken out of herself what a delightful place she said when they came to the library and there is a whole row of books i want to consult how i should like to come and read them oh pray do he answered whenever you like ladies frequently do so you have only to write and tell me when you wish to come and i will see that you are properly attended to thank you ideala rejoined it is just the very thing for me for i am writing a little book and cannot get on till i have consulted some authorities on the subject in the museum they stopped to look at a mummy oh happy mummy burst from ideala involuntarily why asked lorrimer aroused from his apathy it has done with it all you know she answered then he turned and looked at her and she saw that he was something more than cold palefaced and indifferent which had been her first idea of him his eyes were large dark grey and penetrating she would have called his face fine rather than handsome but the upper part was certainly beautiful in spite of some hard lines on it there was something in the expression more than in the formation of the mouth and chin however that did not satisfy his head and throat were splendid the former narrowed a little at the back but the forehead made up for the defect which was not striking he made ideala think of tito melema and of bayard that remark of hers having broken the ice they began to talk like human beings with something in common but idealas mood was not calculated to produce a good impression the failure of her enterprise brought on a fit of recklessness such as we understood and she said some things which must have made a stranger think her peculiar lorrimer had begun to be amused before they returned to the great entrance hall once or twice he looked at her curiously what sort of a person are you i wonder he was thinking i was dying of dulness she said telling him about the place she came from and so i came to see you he left her for a moment but presently returned with his brother you had better come and have some luncheon before you go back he said and she went as they left the building lorrimer asked her where on earth did my cousin meet youwith the slightest possible emphasis ideala understood him and laughed upon my word i dont know who introduced her she answered standing on her dignity nevertheless i cant remember they went to the refreshmentroom at the station it was crowded but they managed to get a table to themselves there was a vacant seat at it and an old gentleman begged to be allowed to occupy it as there was no other in the room the three chatted while they waited each hiding him or her self beneath the light froth of easy conversation and people not accustomed to look on the surface for signs of what is working beneath would have thought them merry enough as she began to know her companions better ideala was more and more drawn to lorrimer his brother who was a dark man and very different in character did not attract her the old gentleman meanwhile was absorbed in his newspaper and he marked his enjoyment of it by inhaling his breath and exhaling it again in that particular way which is called blowing like a porpoise lorrimer by an intelligent glance expressed what he thought of the peculiarity to ideala who remarked it is the next gale developing dangerous energy on its way to the north british and norwegian coasts the laugh that followed caused the old gentleman to fold up his paper and look benignly at the young people over his pincenez it was early in the season and peas were a rare and forced vegetable a small dish of them was brought and handed to the dangerous gale who absently took them all you have taken all the peas sir allow me to give you all the pepper said lorrimer dexterously suiting the action to the word the dangerous gale though disconcerted at first was finally moved to mirth ah young people young people he said and sighedand being a merry and wise old gentleman he found pleasure in their pleasure and entered into their mood little suspecting that black care was one of the party or that a black bruise which would have aroused all the pity and indignation of his honest old heart had he seen it was almost under his eyes and they all loved him presently he rose to go but before he departed he observed looking kindly at ideala and lorrimer youre a handsome pair my dears let me congratulate you and may your children have the mothers sweetness and the fathers strength and may the love you have for each other last for evertheres nothing like it thank god for it and remember him alwaysand keep yourselves unspotted from the world and so saying he went his way in peace dear embarrassing old man said lorrimer regretfully i wish i hadnt spilt the pepper on his plate is there a chance for lorrimer his brother asked but ideala only stared at him there was something in his tone that made her feel ill at ease and brought back the recollection of her misery in a moment then all at once she became depressed and both the young men noticed it im afraid youre rather down about something julian said youd better tell us what it is perhaps we could cheer you up and im a lawyer you know i might be able to help you lorrimer was looking at her and seemed to wait for her to speak but she only showed by a change of expression that the fact of his brother being a lawyer possessed a special interest for her if you will trust us he said at last perhaps we can help you i wish i could she answered wistfully i came to tell you this sounds serious julian said lightly you will have to begin at the beginning you know come lorrimer well go down the river and to ideala you might tell us all about it on the way you know yes come said lorrimer ideala rose to accompany them without a thought it all came about so easily that no question of propriety suggested itselfand if any had occurred to her she would probably have considered it an insult to these gentlemen to suppose they would allow her to put herself in a questionable position and when julian lit a cigarette without asking her permission she was surprised on the way to the river idealas spirits rose again and they all talked lightly making a jest of everything but while they were waiting for a boat julian took up a bunch of charms that were attached to idealas watchchain and began to examine them coolly and the unwonted familiarity startled her with a sudden revulsion of feeling she turned to lorrimer she was annoyed by the slight indignity and also a little frightened whatever lorrimer may have thought of her before he understood her look now and his whole manner changed julian left them for a moment i am so ashamed of myself ideala said i have made some dreadful mistake i have done something wrong i am very sorry for you he answered gravelyand then to his brother who had returnedyou can go on if you like i am going back oh we cant go on without you ideala interposed and i would rather go back too they began to retrace their steps and lorrimer as they walked managed with a few adroit questions to learn from ideala that the trouble had something to do with her husband regy beaumont is coming to me this afternoon he said to his brother would you mind being there to receive him they exchanged glances and julian took his leave now tell me lorrimer said to ideala but an unconquerable fit of shyness came over her the moment they were left alone together i cannot tell you she answered it is too dreadful to speak of your husband has done you some great wrong he said yes something for which you can get legal redress yes and that made you desperate yes and what did you do he put the question abruptly startling ideala as he had intended i oh idid nothing she stammered there was a pause my ideal of marriage is a high one he said at last and i should be very hard on any shortcomings of that kind ideala longed to confide in him but her shyness continued and she walked by his side like one in a dream he took her to the station and when they parted he said you will write and tell me ideala looked up there were no hard lines in his face now he was slightly flushed yes i will write she answered almost in a whisper and then the train with rush and ring bore her away through the springcountry but she neither saw the young green of the hedgerows nor the young lambs bleating in the meadows nor the broad river as she passed it nor the fleecy clouds that flecked the blue she was not really conscious of anything for the moment but that sudden great unspeakable uplifting of the spirit which is joy chapter xvi the following week ideala came to london but not to usshe had promised to stay with some other people first she wrote three times to lorrimer while she was with themfirst to thank him for his kindness to which he replied briefly begging her to confide in him and let him help her in her second letter ideala told him what had occurred his reply was businesslike he urged her to let him consult his legal friends about her case pointed out that she could not be expected to remain with her husband now and showed her that she would not have to suffer much from all the publicity which was necessary to free her from him she replied that her first impulse had been to obtain legal redress but that now she could not make up her mind to face the publicity she would see him however when she returned and consult him about it and she would also like to consult those books in the library her buoyant spirit was already recovering under the influence of a new interest in life lorrimers answer was formal as his other notes had been he begged her to make any use of the library she pleased only to let him know when to expect her that she might have no trouble with the officials and offered her any other help in his power in the meantime my sister claudia had seen ideala and had been pleased to find her not looking well certainly but just as cheerful as usual it is evident the place does not agree with her claudia said but a few weeks with us will set her all right again they drove in the park together one afternoon and talked as usual of many things the state of society being one of them this was a subject upon which my sister descanted frequently and it was from her that ideala learnt all she knew of it can you wonder claudia said on this occasion that men are immoral when ladies in society rather pride themselves than otherwise on imitating the demimonde have you ever noticed ideala answered indirectly how frequently a word or phrase which you know quite well by sight but have never thought of and do not understand is suddenly brought home to you as it were you come across it everywhere and at last take the trouble to find out what it means in selfdefence that expressiondemi mondehas begun to haunt me since i came to town and i feel i shall be obliged to look it up at once to stop the nuisance we went to a theatre the other night and when we were settled there i saw my husband in the stalls with a lady in flamecoloured robes i didnt know he was in town the rest of our party saw him too and the gentlemen had a mysterious little consultation at the back of the box then one of them left us but returned almost immediately and told us the carriage had not gone and hadnt we better try some other theatre the piece at that one was not so good as they had supposed but i knew they had taken a lot of trouble entirely on my account to get a box there as i had expressed a wish to see that particular piece and i said i had come to enjoy it and meant to i did enjoy it too it was so absorbing that i forgot all about my husband and dont know when he left the theatre i only know that he disappeared without coming near us when we got back lilian came to my room and told me they were all saying downstairs that i had behaved splendidly and i said i was delighted to hear it particularly as i did not know how or when or where i had come to deserve such praise and then she asked me if i knew who it was my husband was with i said no some aldermans wife i supposed nothing half so good she answered that woman is notorious she is one of the demimonde well i said i dont suppose she is in society and then lilian said good gracious ideala how can you be so tranquil you must care i think you are the most extraordinary person i ever met and i told her that the only extraordinary thing about me just then was a great exposition of sleep that had come upon me and then she left me but she told me afterwards that she thought i was acting and came back later to see if i really could sleep and you did sleep ideala like a topwhy not but now you are following suit with your ill conducted people and your demimonde i want to know what you mean by that phrase then claudia explained it to her but i thought all that had ended with the roman empire ideala protested claudia laughed and then went on without pity describing the class as they sink lower and lower and cruelly omitting no detail that might complete the picture but the men are as bad said ideala oh as bad yes was the answer ideala was pale with disgust and we have to touch them she said her ignorance of this phase of life had been so complete and her faith in those about her so perfect that the shock of this dreadful revelation was almost too much for her at first as the carriage drove on through the crowded streets she saw in every womans face a hopeless degradation and in every mans eyes a loathsome sin and she exclaimed as another woman had exclaimed on a similar occasion oh claudia why did you tell me it is too dreadful i cannot bear to know it how a woman can be at once so clever and such a fool as you are ideala puzzles me claudia remonstrated not unkindly she had warmed as she went on and forgot in her indignation to take advantage of this longlookedfor opportunity to speak to ideala about her own troubles and afterwards when she showed an inclination to open the subject ideala put her off with a jest le mariage est beau pour les amants et utile pour les saints she quoted lightly class me with the saints and talk of something interesting a few days later claudia came to me in dismay what do you think she said ideala is not coming to us at all she says she must go back at once go back i exclaimed and why she is going to write something for which she requires to read a great deal and she says she must go back to work but that is nonsense i protested she can work as much as she likes herei can even help her i know that claudia answered but she spoke so positively i could not insist i suppose the truth is her husband has ordered her back and she is going to be a good obedient child as usual does she seem at all unhappy no and that is the strange part of it she has coolly broken i dont know how many other engagements to return at once and instead of seeming disappointed she simply glows and is glad she says nothing but i can see it i dont know what on earth she is up to now and claudia left the room frowning and perplexed when i heard she was not unhappy this sudden whim of idealas did not disturb me much indeed i was rather glad to think she had found something to be enthusiastic about her fits of enthusiasm were rarer now and i thought this symptom of one a good sign it was odd though that i had not seen her while she was in town i was half inclined to believe she had avoided me chapter xvii to give the story continuity it will be necessary to piece the events together as they followed many of them only came to my knowledge some time after they occurred and even then i was left to surmise a good deal but i am able now with the help of papers that have lately come into my possession to verify most of my conjectures and arrange the details the summer weather had begun now laburnums and lilacs were in full flower the air was sweet with scent and song and to one who had borne the heavy winter with a heavy heart but was able at last to lay down a load of care the transition must have been like a sudden change from painful sickness to perfect health ideala went to the great hospital at once she had written to fix a day and lorrimer was waiting for her she was not taken to his room however as on the previous occasion but to another part of the building a long gallery hung with pictures where she found him superintending the arrangement of some precious things in cabinets ideala looked better and younger that day in her summer dress than she had done in her heavy winter wraps on the occasion of their first meeting but when she found herself face to face with lorrimer she began to tremble and was overcome with nervousness in a way that was new to her he saw the change in her appearance and manner at a glance and smiling slightly begged her to follow him and led the way through long passages and many doors passing numbers of people to his own room he spoke to her once or twice on the way but she was only able to answer confusedly in a voice that was rendered strident by the great effort she had to make to control it he busied himself with some papers for a few minutes when they reached his room to give her time to recover herself and then he said standing with his back to the fireplace looking down at her and speaking in a tone that was even more musical and caressing than she remembered it well and how are you and how has it been with you since your return i am utterly shaken and unnerved as you see she answered then added passionately i cannot bear my life it is too hateful there is no need to bear it he said nothing is easier than to get a separation after what has occurred was there any witness no and i dont think any one in the house suspects that there is anything wrong and none of my friends know i have never told them i wonder why i told you you wanted me to help you he suggested i dont think i did she said how could i want you to help me when i dont mean to do anything i fancy i told you because i was afraid you would think me a little mad that day and i would rather you knew the truth than think me mad i dont mean to try for a separation i cant leave him entirely to his own devices if i did he would certainly go from bad to worse and if you dont what will become of you i think much more of such a life would make you reckless she was silent for a little then she exclaimed help me not to grow reckless i am so alone he took her hands and looked down into her eyes a sudden deep flush spread over his face smoothing out all the lines as she had seen it do once before and transforming him it is like walking on the edge of a precipice in the dark he said in a low voice and his grasp tightened as he spoke there was something mesmeric in his touch that overpowered ideala she felt a change in herself at the moment and she was never the same woman again i will help you if i can he said after another pause and then he let her go after that they talked for some time he tried to persuade her to reconsider her decision and leave her husband he honestly believed it was the best thing she could do and told her why he thought so she acknowledged the wisdom of his advice but declined to follow it and he was somewhat puzzled for the reasons she gave were hardly enough to account for her determination they wandered away from that subject at last however and talked of many other things he told ideala of his first coming to the great hospital as a patient and gave her some of the details of his own case and told her enough of his private history to arouse her sympathy and interest but of the nature of these confidences i know nothing ideala felt in honour bound not to repeat them as they were made to her in the course of a private conversation and she was always scrupulously faithful to all such trusts i know however that he was a man who had suffered acutely both from unhappy circumstances and from those troubles of the mind which beset clever men at the outset of their career and sometimes never leave them entirely at peace but this man was something more than a clever man he was a man in a thousand he had in a strong degree all that is worst and best in a man the highest and most spiritual aspirations warred in him with the most carnal impulses and he spent his days in fighting to attain to the one and subdue the other ideala had never known a man like this man his talents his rapid changes of mood as sense or conscience got the upper hand and his versatility charmed her imagination and excited her interest and he had besides that magnetic power over her by which it is given to some men to compel people of certain temperaments to their will while she was with him he could have made her believe that black was white and not only believe it but be glad to think that it was so and he always compelled her to say exactly what she had in her mind at the moment even when it was something that she would very much rather not have said but i am forgetting my other object in coming ideala broke off at last may i look at the books lorrimer took out his watch you ought to have some lunch first he said if you will come now and have some we can return and look at the books afterwards ideala acquiesced fearing it was his own lunch time and knowing it would detain him if she did not accompany him ladies not being allowed to lunch at the great hospital they went as before to the station close by and sat down side by side perfectly happy together chatting laughing talking about their childhood and making those trifling confidences which go so far to promote intimacy and are often the first evidence of affection now and then they touched on graver matters he upheld all that was old and believed we can have no better institutions in the future than those which have already existed in the past ideala had begun to think differently i am sure it is a mistake to be for ever looking back to the past for precedents she said the past has its charm of course but it is the charm of the charnel houseit is the dead past and what was good for one age is bad for another as one mans meat is another mans poison he said proverbs prove nothing she answered lightly have you noticed that they go in pairs there is always one for each side of an argument one mans meat is another mans poison is met by what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the ganderand so on but dont you think it absurd to cling to old customs that are dying a natural death learn of the past if you like but live in the present and make your laws to meet its needs it is this eternal waiting on the past to copy it rather than to be warned by its failures to do as it did under the impression apparently that we must succeed better than it did following in its footsteps though we know they led to ruin once and because the way was pleasant being surprised to find that it must end again in disasterit is this abandonment of all hope of finding new and efficacious remedies for the old diseases of society that has checked our progress for hundreds of years and will keep the world in some respects just as it was at the time of the crucifixion for my own part i cannot see that history does repeat itself except in trifling details and in the lives of unimportant individuals i think he rejoined if you have studied the decline of the roman empire you must have seen a striking analogy between that and our own history at the present time with the exception of changes of manners which only affect the surface of society we are in much the same state now as the romans were then i know many people say so and believe it ideala answered and there is evidence enough to prove it to people who are trying to arrive at a foregone conclusion but it is not the resemblances we should look to but the differences it is in them that our hope lies and they seem to me to be essential take the one grand difference that has been made by the teaching for hundreds of years of the perfect morality of the christian religion do you think it possible for men while they cling to it to reel back into the beast and be no more but are men clinging to it yes in a way for it has insensibly become a part of all of us and has made it possible for us to show whole communities of moral philosophers now in a generation the ancients had only an occasional one in a century but such a one the old moral philosophers were grand certainly but not grander than our own men are of whom we only hear less because there are so many more of them but do you mean to say society is less sinful than it was there is one section of society at the present day they tell me which is most desperately wicked it is worse than any class was when the world was young because it knows so much better but i believe the bulk of the people like right so well that they only want a strong impulse to make them follow it i feel sure sometimes that we are all living on the brink of a great change for the better and that there is only one thing wanting nowa great calamity or a great teacherto startle us out of our apathy and set us to work we are not bold enough we should try more experiments they can but fail and if they do we should still have learnt something from them but i do not think we shall fail for ever what we want is somewhere and must be found eventually they tried some experiments with the marriage laws in france once lorrimer observed tentatively yes and failed contemptibly because their motive was contemptible they did not want to improve society but to make selfindulgence possible without shame i think our own marriage laws might be improved people are trying to improve them he said with a slight laugh a friend of mine has just married a girl who objected to take the oath of obedience how absurd it is for a girl of nineteen to imagine she knows better than all the ages i think said ideala that it is more absurd for all the ages to subscribe to an oath which something stronger than themselves makes it impossible for half of them to keep strength of character must decide the question of place in a household as it does elsewhere and it is surely folly to require and useless to insist on the submission of the strong to the weak the marriage oath is farcical a woman is made to swear to love a man who will probably prove unlovable to honour a man who is as likely as not to be undeserving of honour and to obey a man who may be incapable of judging what is best either for himself or her i have no respect for the ages that uphold such nonsense there was never any need to bind us with an oath if men were all they ought to be wouldnt we obey them gladly to be able to do so is all we ask well it is a difficult question he answered and i dont think we need trouble ourselves about it any way do you like flowers yes she burst out in another tone and easy chairs and pictures and china and everything that is beautiful and all sensual pleasures she said it but she knew in a moment that she had used the wrong word and was covered with confusion lorrimer looked at her and laughed and so do i he said oh if only i could unsay that thought ideala but the word had gone forth and was already garnered against her then came an awful moment for herthe moment of going and paying it was hateful to let him pay for her lunch but she could not help it she was seized with one of those fits of shyness which made it just a degree less painful to allow it than to make the effort to prevent it they returned to lorrimers room and pored together over a catalogue looking up the books she wanted when they had found their names and numbers lorrimer sent for them from the library but it was too late to do anything that day and so she rose to go lorrimer walked with her to the station and saw her into the train on the way they talked of little children he loved them as she did a friend of mine he said has the most beautiful child i ever saw just to look at it makes me feel a better man chapter xviii in the days that followed a singular change came over ideala no external circumstance affected her she moved like one in a dream thought had ceased for her all life was one delicious sensation and at times she could not bear the delight of it in silence she would tell it in low songs in the twilight she would make her piano speak it in a hundred chords and it would burst from her in some sudden glow of enthusiasm that made people wonderthe apparent cause being too slight to account for it while this lasted nothing hurt her she saw the sufferings of others unmoved she met her husbands brutalities with a smiling countenance and bore the physical discomfort of a bad sprain without much consciousness of pain and she knew nothing of time and never asked herself to what she owed this joy the utter forgetfulness of everything that came upon her when she was alone was almost incredible one evening she spent two hours in walking a distance she might easily have done in forty minutes she had been to see a sick person and when she found herself in the fresh air after having spent some time in a small close room the dreamlike feeling came over her and her spirit was uplifted with inexpressible gladness the summer air was sweet and warm a light rain was falling and she took off her hat and wandered on looking up but noting nothing and singing schuberts hark hark the lark to herself softly as she came a man standing at a cottage door begged her to go in and shelter she looked at him and her face was radiantthe raindrops sparkled on her hair he was only a working man clayand common clay but the light in her eyes passed through him and the memory of her stayed with him a thing apart from his daily life held sacred and not to be described a man might live a hundred years and never see a woman look like that i did not know it was raining she said it is only light rain and the air is so sweet and the glow down there in the west is like heaven how beautiful life is ay lady he answered and stood there spellbound watching her as she passed on slowly and listening to her singing as she went a few days later she saw lorrimer again she found him in his room this time he knew she was coming and flushed with pleasure when he met her at the door ideala was not nervous it all seemed a matter of course to her now the books he had got for her from the library were where she had left them he placed a chair for her beside his writingtable and then went on with his own work she had understood that she was to read in the library but she did not think of that now she simply acquiesced in this arrangement as she would have done in any other he might have made for her a secretary was busy in another part of the room when she entered but after awhile he left them then lorrimer looked up and smiled you are looking better today he said tell me what you have been doing since i saw you lotuseating she answered how lovely the summer is since i saw you i have wanted to do nothing but rest and dream you have been happy then yes is he kind to you ohhe he is just the same there is no change in my life the change is in me then you mean to be happy in spite of him i call that the beginning of wisdom i know two other ladies who hate their husbands and they manage to enjoy life pretty well and i dont see why you should be miserable always because you happen to have married the wrong man how was it you married him were you very much in love with him no not in the least spooney then not even spooney as you call it i was very young at the time very young girls know nothing of love and marriage very young he repeated thoughtfully he was drawing figures with his pen on the blottingpaper before him but why did you marry him then i can give you no reasonexcept that i was not happy at home you all say that slipped from him with a gesture of impatience i wish i had been more original said ideala she took up her book again and he resumed his writing and for some time there was silence but idealas attention wandered she began to examine the room which was as usual in a state of disorder one side of it was lined with cabinets of various sizes and periods labels indicated the contents of some of them only one picture hung on that side of the roomit was the portrait of a gentlemanbut several others stood on the ground against the cabinets the walls were painted some dark colour a japanese screen was drawn across the door and beside it was a hard narrow settee covered with dark green velvet books were piled upon it and heavily embroidered foreign stuffs and near it a number of japanese drawings stood on a stand the mantelpiece was crowded with an odd mixture of china and other curios all looking as if they had just been unpacked above it another picture was hung a steel engraving the writingtable by which they sat was nearly in the middle of the room in the window was another table covered also with a miscellaneous collection of curios and on every other available article of furniture books were piled the high backs of the chairs were elaborately carved the seats being of the same green velvet as the settee a high wireguard surrounded the fire place and this unusual precaution made one think that the contents of the room must be precious the occupant of this apartment might have been an artist a man of letters or a virtuosoprobably the latter but whatever he was it was evident that his study was a workshop and not a showroom from the room ideala looked to her companion he was writing rapidly and seemed absorbed in his subject he was frowning slightly his face was pale and set and he looked older by ten years than when he had spoken last and seemed cold and unimpassioned as a judge but ideala thought again that the face was a fine one presently he became conscious of her earnest gaze he did not look up but every feature softened and a warm glow spread from forehead to chin it was as if a deep shadow had been lifted and a younger but less noble man revealed how you change ideala exclaimednot from day to day but from moment to moment you are like two men i wish i could get behind that horrid veil of flesh that hides you from me i want to see your soul he smiled you are getting tired he said do let me persuade you to come and have some lunch when you begin to speculate i know you have done enough but ideala could not go through the ordeal of who should pay for lunch again she preferred to starve the camaraderie between them was mental enough to be manlike already but only as long as there was no question of material outlay maynt i stay here and read she said i can have something byand by when i want it do go and leave me and he was obliged to go at last wondering somewhat at her want of appetite when he returned she was still working diligently and they spent the rest of the afternoon together reading writing and chatting until it was time for ideala to go lorrimer saw her into her train and fixed another day for her to return and go on with her work and so the thing became a settled arrangement whenever she could spare the time she went and worked beside him and he was always the same kindly considerate helping her now and then but not as a rule interfering with her she just came and went as she pleased and as she would have done had he been her brother sometimes they were alone together for hours sometimes his secretary worked in the room with them and always there were people coming and going there was nothing to suggest a thought of impropriety and they were soon on quarrelling terms falling out about a great many thingswhich is always the sign of a good understanding but after the first they touched on no dangerous subject for a long time at last however there came a change ideala noticed one day that lorrimer was restless and irritable am i interfering with your work today she said do tell me any other day will suit me just as well oh no he answered i am lazy that is all how are you getting on let me see and he took the paper she was engaged upon and looked at it she watched him and saw that he was not reading although he held it before his eyes for some time he was paler than usual and there was a look of indecision in his face very unlike its habitual expression which was serene and selfcontained looking up all at once he met her eyes fixed on him frankly and affectionately but he did not respond to her smile how do you suppose all this is going to end he said abruptly wont it do she answered thinking of her paper had i better give it up or rewrite it he threw the paper down with a gesture of impatience and got up and then as if ashamed of his irritability he took it again and gave it back to her in doing so his hand accidentally touched hers how cold you are he said let me warm your hands for you they are benumbed she answered letting him take them and rub them after a moment he said without looking at her do you know it is very good of you to come here like this why she asked it suits my own convenience i know but it is refreshing to find some one who will suit their own convenience so that sounds as if it were not the right thing to do she exclaimed nonsense he answered you misunderstand me ideala withdrew her hands hastily and half rose what is the matter he said come dont be idle you should have mastered that book by this time but ideala was disturbed i cant read she said tell me what you thought of me when i came to you that first day i fancied you were old and i have been afraid since in spite of your cousins suggestion that you may have considered it odd of me to introduce myself like that oh it is quite customary here he answered but even if it had not been we cant all be bound by the same common laws the ordinary stars and planets have an ordinary course mapped out for them and they darent diverge an inch but every now and then a comet comes and goes its own eccentric way and all the lesser lights wonder and admire and let it go that would be very fine for us if only we were comets among the stars she said oh you might condescend to claim a kindred with them he answered lightly the only heavenly body i ever feel akin to is one of those meteors that flash and fall she said they go their own way too do they not and are lost there is no question of being lost here he interposed the most scrupulous have made an exception in favour of one person and the world has not blamed them after having endured so much you are entitled to some relaxation i should do as i liked now if i were you she looked at him inquiringly it seemed as if he were not expressing himself but trying the effect of what he said upon her he was sitting in his usual place now drawing figures on the blotting pad you have read i suppose he added after a pause and without looking up i wish i had never read anything she exclaimed passionately i wish i could neither read write nor think but the trouble now was if only she could have recognised it that she did not think she only felt she got up and went to the mantelpiece he remained where he was sitting with his back to her presently she began to look at the china absently at first but afterwards with interest there were some new specimens just unpacked and all crowded together what a lovely lotusleaf she said at last satsuma i supposeno kioto but what a good specimen and it is broken too what a pity i should so like to mend it would you he said rousing himself then you shall he went to one of the cabinets and got out the materials and in a few minutes they were bending busily over the broken plaque as interested and eager about it as if no subject of more vital importance had ever distracted them they were like two children together often as quarrelsome always as inconsequent happy hard at work and equally happy idling apt to torment each other at times about trifles but always ready to forget and forgive and with that habit in common of forgetting everything utterly but the occupation of the moment they talked on now for a little longer but not brilliantly they were both considered brilliant in conversation but somehow on these occasions neither of them shone i suppose when two such bright and shining lights come together they put each other out then it was time for ideala to go a bitter wind met them in the face on their way to the station and before they had gone far ideala noticed that lorrimers mood had changed again his face grew pale his step less elastic his manner cold and formal all the brightness all the sympathy which made their intimacy seem the most natural because it was the pleasantest thing in the world to ideala had gone he was like a man seized with a sudden fit of remorse disgusted with himself and moved to repent i should bear with your husband if i were you he said at last breaking the silence he behaves like a brute but i dare say he cant help it a man cant help his temperament and probably you provoke him more than you think ideala was surprised it was so long since they had mentioned her husband i fear i am provoking she answered humbly but how am i to help it i have tried so hard and for so long to be patient and i only want to do right they were parting then and he looked down at her in silence for some seconds and when ideala saw the expression of his face her heart sank in that one moment she realised all that his friendship had been to her and foresaw the terrible blank there would be for her if it should ever end that there was any danger that there could be anything but friendship between men and women who must not marry had not even yet occurred to her her intimacy with myself had prepared the way for lorrimer and made this new intimacy seem also perfectly right what is the matter with you today she said what spirit of dissatisfaction has got hold of you i am dissatisfied he said raising his hat and brushing his hand back over his hair then he looked at her why dont you help me he asked how can i help you she answered i dont understand you you ought to i wish to goodness you didand then his face cleared but you will come again he added in the old way i shall expect you soon and so he let her go and ideala was glad because an unpleasant jar was over she did not trouble herself about his private worries if he wished her to know he would tell her lorrimer had a temperbut then she had known that all along and lorrimer was lorrimerthat was all about it chapter xix he let her go somewhat bewildered and not understanding herself or him nor caring to understand only happy dangerously happy the train bore her through an enchanted region of brightness and summer and although the power of thought was for the moment suspended she was conscious of this and her own delight was like the unreasoning pleasure of earth when the sun is upon it there was no carriage to meet her at the station and she set off to walk home it was the first time she had been alone on foot in the squalid disorderly streets of that dingy place and her way which she was not quite sure of took her through some of the worst of them they were filled with loudlaughing uncleanly women and skulking hangdog looking men and the grimeclogged atmosphere was heavy with foul odours but she noticed nothing of this the golden glow the sun made in his efforts to shine through the clouds of smoke might have been a visible expression of her own ecstatic feeling and she would have thought so at any other time but now she never saw it in a somewhat open and more lonely part of the road she met a tramp a great rude hulking common fellow with fine blue eyes he stopped in the middle of the road and stared at ideala as she came up to him walking as usual with a slight undulating movement that made you think of a yacht in a breeze her face upraised and her lips parted he took off his cap as she approached the gesture attracted her attention and thinking he wanted to beg or ask some question she stopped and looked at him inquiringly well you are a nice lady he exclaimed he hadnt the gift of language but she saw the soul of a man in his eyes and she understood him thank you she answered and passed on unsurprised in the next street a breathless creature came running after her a tawdry painted dishevelled girl she stopped ideala and stood panting with hot dry lips and eyes full of animal suffering her clothes exhaled the smell of some vile scent that was overpowering involuntarily ideala shrank from her and all the joy left her face ive runthe girl gaspedsuch a waythey said youd gone this road ive waited about all day to catch you come for gods sake but where theres a girl dyingand she clutched idealas arm trying to drag her along with heror she would die and have done with it but she cant till shes seen you sheve something on her mindsomething to tell you come my lady come for the love of the lord and the blessed virgin no harmll happen to you ideala made a gesture show me the way she said but you dont seem able to walk theres an empty cab coming get in and tell the man where to drive to they stopped at a row of manystoreyed houses in a low bystreet a stout elderly woman with an evil countenance met them at the door she began some speech in a cringing tone to ideala but the tawdry girl pushed her aside rudely hold your jaw and get out of the way she said ill show the lady up the woman muttered something which ideala fortunately did not hear and let them pass they went upstairs to the very top of the house and entered a low room furnished with a broken chair and a small bed only on the bed lay a girl who in spite of disease and approaching death looked not more than twenty and was probably two years younger she turned her haggard face to the door as it opened and a gleam of satisfaction caused her eyes to dilate when she saw ideala they were large dark eyes but her face was so distorted with suffering and discoloured by disease it was impossible to imagine what it once had been here she is polly said the tawdry one triumphantly i said id bring her now didnt i ideala knelt down by the bed my but youre a game un said the tawdry one admiringly you aint afraid of catching nothing now id have asked what was up before id have done that and i wouldnt touch her with the tongs nor stay in the room with her was it ever so you just holler when you want me and ill come back and so saying she left them you are not afraid to touch meyou dont mind said the dying girl when ideala had taken off her gloves and knelt holding her hands afraid mind ideala whispered her eyes full of pity i only wish you would let me do something for you at that moment they were startled by an uproar downstairs a man and woman were quarrelling at the top of their voices at first only their tones were audible but these grew more distinct and in a few seconds ideala could hear what was said and it was evident that the combatants were approaching i tell you the ladys all right the woman ideala had seen downstairs was heard to shriek with sundry vile epithets pollys dying and sheve come to visit her seein s believin the man rejoined doggedly just show me the lady and shut up you foulmouthed devil you the door was flung open and there stood the fat harridan and towering over her was a great redhaired policeman who seemed both relieved and abashed when he saw ideala what is the meaning of this she said rising and drawing herself up indignantly dont you see how ill this girl is such an uproar at such a time is indecent the woman shrank from her gaze and slunk away the policeman wiped his hot face with a red handkerchief i saw the girl fetch you here maam he said apologetically and i thought it was a trap it aint safe for a woman let alone a lady to come to no such a place ill just wait and see you safe out of it he shut the door and ideala heard him walking up and down on the landing outside the dying girl seemed scarcely conscious of what was passing ideala looked round for something to revive her there was not even a cup of water in the room she knelt once more beside the bed and raised her in her arms and let her head rest on her shoulder all the mother in her was throbbing with tenderness for this poor outcast the girl drew a long deep sigh could you take anything ideala asked no lady not now the thirst was awful awhile ago and i cried and cried although i knew no one would listen to me or come if they heard theyd rather wed die when we get ill its a bad thing for the house she could only speak in gasps and what have you had ideala asked the scarlet fever maam theres an awful bad kind about and i caught it they all die that gets it ideala drew her closer and laid her own cool cheek on her damp forehead tell me why you wished to see me she said you are so good the girl answeredi thought youd better knowand getaway fromthat low brute ideala understood and would fain have stopped the story but it seemed a relief to the girl to speak and so she listened it was the old story the old story aggravated by every incident that could make it more repulsiveand her husband was the hero of it shall i go to hell the girl asked shrinking closer for these christ died ideala murmured the words flashed through her mind and the meaning of them was new to her her heart was wrung for the desolate girl dying alone in sin and sorrow without a creature to care for herdying alone in the arms of a strange woman with a policeman outside guarding her ideala cried in her heart with an exceeding bitter cry god do so to him and more also pray for me lady but ideala could not pray with a curse on her lipsand besides the power to pray had been taken from her for many a weary day before that she thought of the policeman and called him in see she is dying she said looking up at him helplessly and she has asked me to pray and i cant will you and quite simply and reverently as if it had been part of his ordinary duty he took off his helmet and knelt down a great rough looking man in a hideous dress and prayed dear lord forgive her they were the last words she heard chapter xx the people seemed to have deserted the house even the tawdry one had disappeared and ideala was obliged to lay out the poor dear girl herself and make her ready for decent burial as soon as she could leave the place she went escorted by the policeman to the fever hospital to have her things fumigated the risk of infection had not troubled her till she remembered the likelihood of taking it to others but as soon as she thought of that she took the necessary precautions to prevent it she sent a message from the hospital to her maid telling her to pack up some things and meet her at the station in time for the mail at eleven oclock that night she had thought of some friends who lived a nine hours journey from her home and had determined to go to them for a time she wrote to her husband also from the hospital the girl mary morris died of scarlet fever this afternoon in the house to which you sent her when you were tired of her she said i was with her when she died i am going to the trelawneys tonight but at present i have formed no plans for the future during the first few days of her stay with the trelawneys she just lived from hour to hour not thinking of anything past present or to come but out of this apathy a desire grew by degrees she wanted to see lorrimer she could speak to him and she was sure he would help and advise her she wrote to him telling him she particularly wished to see him on a certain day and asking him to meet her at the station adding by way of postscript i do not think i quite know what you meant when you advised me to go my own way but if any wrongdoing were part of the programme i should not be able to carry it out however i feel sure that you would be the last person in the world to let me do wrong even if i were inclined to she knew that her husband was away from home and her intention had been to sleep there that night and go on to lorrimer the next morning but she had been misinformed about the trains and after many changes and tedious waits she found herself alone in the middle of the night at a little railway junction with no chance of a train to take her on for several hours and what was worse without money enough in her purse to pay her bill if she went to an hotel the waitingrooms were all closed for the night and there seemed nothing for it but to wander about the station till the train came and released her she told her dilemma to an old scotch inspector who was waiting to see what she meant to do he gave the matter his best consideration but it evidently perplexed him if you was a box he said rubbing his chin thoughtfully we could put you in the leftluggage office but i am not a box ideala answered as if only the most positive denial would prevent mistake on the subject it was raining hard and bitterly cold only part of the platform was roofed in and every now and then a gust of wind splashed the raindrops into their faces as they stood beside idealas luggage in a circle of yellow light cast upwards by a lantern which the inspector had put on the ground at their feet theres me and tom the porter he said at last weve got to wait for the two oclock down and the four oclock up tom hell come ome and sit over the kitchen fire with me i suppose now you wouldnt like to do that indeed i should be very glad to ideala answered that is she added quickly if it would not inconvenience you he made an inexplicable gesture and seemed to consider the matter settled ill just put this here luggage in the office he said shouldering a box and taking up a portmanteau but he muttered as he went its a pity now you wasnt luggage ideala followed him meekly from the luggageoffice out into the lane and down a country path to a little cottage the door opened into the kitchen and a young man in a porters uniform was sitting over a cheery fire reading a newspaper by the light of a tallow candle the kitchen was large for the size of the house besides the door they had entered by there were two others both closed the walls were panelled from floor to ceiling with wood darkened by age several of the panels were doors of cupboards that projected slightly from the wall and shelves had been sunk in flush with it and placed anglewise in the corners the shelves were covered with old china there was a row of brass candlesticks of good design on the high mantelpiece and more china stood behind them on a panel above the mantelpiece a curious design of dogs and horses in a wood had been carved with much patience and some skill the furniture of the place was an old oak table standing in the windowthe window itself had a deep sill on which was arranged a row of flowerpots from which a faint perfume came at intervalsa long narrow oak chest carved and polished with the date on the side of it a settle and a dresser covered with the ordinary crockery used by poor people the brick floor was rudded and sanded the hearthstone was yellow and the part under the grate was white one highbacked oldfashioned chair stood on each side of the hearth tom the porter was sitting in one of them and at his elbow was a small round table with a pipe tobacco jar and two or three books upon it a square table in the middle of the room was laid out for supper with a dish two plates a beer mug and half a loaf of bread some potatoes were roasting on the hob the old womans asleep i expects youll mind and not make a noise the inspector said to ideala as if he were warning a child to be good tom the porter rose and gazed at the lady with his mouth open in a state of astonishment that was justified by the time and place of her advent but he offered her his chair with the courtesy of a gentleman and the old inspector bade her make herself at home which she did by removing her hat and wraps and taking off her gloves in a higher sphere of life those two men would have stared her out of countenance but tom the porter and the old inspector not from want of appreciation but from the refinement that seems natural to people who come of an old stock whatever their station and have had china and carved oak in their possession from one generation to anotherforebore even to look at her lest she should be embarrassed by their curiosity they did the honours of the house with dignity and without vulgar apology for a state of things that was natural to them and ideala at once adapted herself to the circumstances and burnt her fingers while attending to the baked potatoes which tom had somewhat neglected she always declared afterwards that there was nothing so good in the world as baked potatoes and salt provided the company was agreeable and now and then she would thrill us with reminiscences of that evenings entertainmentwith wonderful accounts of railway accidents and of one in particular that happened on a pitchdark night when fires had to be made to light the workers as they toiled fearfully amongst the wreck of the trains searching for the mangled and mutilated the dying and the dead while the air was filled with horrid shrieks and groans for it seems these three when they had finished the baked potatoes drew their chairs to the fire and talked and one can well imagine what idealas stories wereher tales of the japanese with whom she had lived of chinese prisons into which she had peeped of earthquakes tornadoes and shipwrecks and other perils by land and sea all told in a voice that thrilled you whatever it said tom the porter and the old scotch inspector were in luck that night and they knew it when at last it was time for ideala to go and in return for her thanks for his kind hospitality and the contents of her purse which had rather more in it than she had fancied the inspector expressed his appreciation with an earnest smack well he said youre rare good company i shant mind when you come along this way again the train was late in arriving and she had only time to rush up to the house change her dress and return to the station to catch the one by which she had asked lorrimer to meet her perhaps it was the thought of what she had come to tell him that made her heart beat nervously as the train drew up at her destination and she leant forward to look for him among the people on the platform she looked in vainhe was not there something of course had happened to detain him doubtless he had sent a message to explain she waited a little but nobody appeared to be looking for her then she left the station and walked in the direction of the hospital thinking he had missed the train and she should probably meet him on the way her nervousness increased as she went she was not used to be alone in crowded streets and she began to feel faint and bewildered her heart seemed to stop whenever she saw a fair headed man but she reached the hospital at last and no lorrimer had met her then a new fear disturbed her perhaps he was ill she went up to the door and there just coming out lorrimers secretary met her i was just coming to meet you madam he said i am sorry i am too late mr lorrimer has been detained by visitors and sent me to apologise for his absence if you will be so good as to come to the library he will join you there as soon as he is disengaged when she was settled in the library a servant brought her books to her she had not come to read but work was the daily habit of her life and she went on now mechanically but carefully as usual though with a curious sinking of the heart and benumbing sense of loss and pain as she came along in the train she had been thinking how it would amuse lorrimer to hear of her nights adventure and of the relief it would be to tell him of all the other things she had come to tell but now she felt like one bidden to a bridal and brought to a burial people were going and coming continually in the library a gentleman sat at a table near her busily writing servants went backwards and forwards with books another gentleman came in and looked at her curiously and then went away she began to feel uncomfortable and wondered what was keeping lorrimer so long she thought too of leaving the place at once and going back by an earlier train than she had intended but it would hardly have been polite a servant came and told her the library was closed to visitors at two i am waiting for mr lorrimer she said oh in that case and the man withdrew the name was an open sesame to all parts of the building at last he came she rose with a great sense of relief let me take your books he said i have done with them she answered and without another word he led the way to his own room they took their accustomed seats i am sorry i could not meet you he said i hope you do not think me rude some wretched people turned up at the last moment and wanted to see everything just look at the room every cabinet seemed to have been ransacked and treasures of all kinds were lying about in most admired disorder lorrimer looked round him desperately and pushed his hat back from his forehead ideala smiled it was so like him to forget he had it on outside a heavy thundercloud gathered and darkened the room presently big drops of rain splashed against the window and it began to lighten long claps of thunder rolled and muttered incessantly away in the distance and every now and then one would burst directly above them as it seemed with splendid effect lorrimer looked up at the window straight before him and played with a pen and ideala half turning her back to him sat silent also watching the storm there were some high houses opposite of which only the upper storeys were visible two children were playing in a dangerous position at an open window in one of them above the houses a strip of sky heavy and dark and changeful was all that showed ideala felt cold and faint the long fast and fatigue were beginning to tell upon her she was nervous too the silence was oppressive but she could not break it she felt some inexplicable change in her relations with lorrimer which made it impossible to speak furtively she watched him trying to discover if he felt it too the look of age was on his face and it was clouded with discontent anxiously she sought some sign of sickness to account for it but no there was no trace of physical suffering the trouble was mental you are not looking well lorrimer said at last i suppose you have been starving yourself since i saw you you have had no lunch today again you will kill yourself if you go on like that i was speaking about you to a doctor the other day he said you could not fast as you do without taking somethingstimulants or sedatives ideala winced what an insulting thing to say she exclaimed indignantly i will not allow you to adopt that tone with me you have no right to scold me i have and shall he retorted i suppose you want to kill yourself perhaps it is the best thing people can do who hate their lives i dont hate my life i dont want to die she rejoined the other day you said you loathed your life you are accusing me of inconsistency she said you who are in two states of mind every time i see you she got up and i do mean what i say she resumed i loathed the old life but that is done with i am living a new life now he turned to look at her red chasing white from his face at every breath then yielding to an irresistible impulse he went to her grasped her folded hands in both of his and looked into her eyes for one burning moment the hot blood flamed to her face she was startled dont let us quarrel he said hoarsely why do you try to she retorted it is always you who begin i think you want pluck he said oh no not that she answered just now you do then i think you want discernment she retorted with spirit and so they went on as if neither of them had ever heard of such a thing as conventional propriety lorrimer did not answer that last remark he was standing at a little distance from her watching her ideala was looking grave what is your conscience troubling you about now he asked i never listen to my conscience i dont believe you she answered promptly that is polite he observed then there was another pause it must be time for me to go she said at last the rain was still falling in torrents oh no he exclaimed you mustnt go yet your train does not leave for another hour why do you want to go she was struggling with the button of a glove and he went to help her but she repulsed him half unconsciously as she would have brushed off a troublesome fly the gesture irritated him i cannot believe you are not conscientious she said with a frown of intentness when a man of talent ceases to be true he loses half his power he turned from her coldly sat down at the writing table and began to write ideala was still putting on her gloves outside the rain fell lightly now and the clouds were clearing the children were still playing at the open window of the house opposite lorrimer had often been obliged to answer notes when she was there she thought nothing of that but he was a long time and at last she interrupted him forgive me if i disturb you she said but i am afraid i shall miss my train oh pardon me he answered jumping up and looking at his watch but it is not nearly time yet i cannot understand why you are in such a hurry today yet you know that i always go when i have done my work she said you have done unusually early then he replied and i wish to goodness i had he looked round the room pettishly like a schoolboy out of temper i shall have to put all these things away when youre gonea task i hate but nobody can do it but myself why wait till ive gone let me help you said ideala his countenance cleared and they set to work merrily he explaining the curious histories of coins and cameos of ancient gems ornaments of gold and silver and valuable intaglios as they returned them to their places both forgot everything in the interest of the collection so that when the last tray was completed they were surprised to find that two trains had gone while they were busy and another had become due and there was only time to jump into a hansom to catch it lorrimer was still irritable why on earth does a lady always carry her purse in her hand he said as they drove along ideala laughed and put hers in her pocket when are you coming to go on with your work he asked i will write and fix a day she said i shall be away a good deal for the next three weeks he continued the twentythird or twentysixth would be the most convenient days for me if they would suit you thank you she answered and hurried down the platform without having said a word or given a thought to what she had come to say and then at last the twentyfour hours fasting fatigue and mental suffering overcame her a little later she was lying insensible on the floor of her room and she was alone the servants had not seen her enter and there was not a creature near her to help her chapter xxi ideala was unable to exert herself for many days after this at last however she began to think of work again and of lorrimer she was uneasy about him he had not been himself on that last occasion something was wrong she could not think what but she felt anxious and out of her anxiety arose an intense longing to see him again so she wrote first of all fixing the twentythird for her visit but when the day came she found herself unequal to the exertion and wrote again begging him to expect her on the twentysixth instead he did not reply he was generally overwhelmed with correspondence and she had therefore begged him not to do so if the days she named suited him up to this time she had never heard lorrimer mentioned by any one but now suddenly his name seemed to be in everybodys mouth she thought of him incessantly herself and it was as if the strength of her own mind compelled all other minds to think of him while she was present and to yield to her will and tell her all they knew for curiously enough she had begun to want to know about him i call it curious because she was so confiding so unsuspicious and also so penetrating she never seemed to care to know more of people than she learnt from intercourse with them but with regard to lorrimer she had evidently begun to distrust her own judgment which is significant one night at a dinnerparty she was thinking of a gratuitous piece of information an old woman who brought her some milk on one occasion at the great hospital had given her ideala had noticed that the old woman had a bad cough and had asked her in her usual kindly way if she were subject to it and what she did for it remarking that the north country air was trying to people with delicate chests and warmer clothing and greater care were more necessary there than in the south and thereupon the old woman had launched forth as such people will upon the slightest provocation with minute details of her own sufferings and the sufferings of all the people she ever knew from the bronchitis during the winter and spring mr lorrimer being included among the number does mr lorrimer suffer in that way ideala had asked with interest indeed yes was the answer given with many shakings of the head and that air of importance and pleasure which vulgar bearers of bad news assume he was very bad in the spring he coughed so as never was and had to give in at last and keep his room which he should have done at first but it takes a deal to make him give in for he takes no care of hisself though not strong and we were in a way eh but it would be a bad thing for this place if anything happened to mr lorrimer ideala gave the woman halfacrown people may have bronchitis without being delicate she asserted mr lorrimer is very kind to all of you i suppose if i was to tell you all his good deeds maam the woman said impressively id not have done before tomorrow morning but as to his not being delicate she continuedin the hope perhaps of scoring another on that point why it just depends on what you call delicate ideala absently gave her another halfcrown and another after that but she could not get her to say that mr lorrimers chest was strong later when lorrimerre turned and they were both at work he was interrupted in the middle of some cynical remarks on overpopulation and the good it would do to check it by allowing the spread of epidemics and encouraging men to kill each other by the arrival of another old woman in great distress his manner changed in a moment i am afraid he is worse he said to her most kindly she could only shake her head there is the order he went on giving her a paperget him these things at once and tell him i will come as soon as i am disengaged when they were alone again ideala looked at lorrimer and laughed another instance i shrewdly suspect of the difference between theory and practice she observed he brushed his hand back over his forehead and hair a trifle disconcerted he was the only son of his mother and she was a widow he said and one can approve of capital punishment without having the nerve to see it inflicted i suppose ideala commented and be convinced that it would be good for the human race to have a certain number of their children drowned like kittens every year and yet not be able to see a single one disposed of in that way without risking ones own life to save it verily i have heard this often and yet i think i am more surprised to find it true than if i had never been warned but that is always the way things surprise us just as much as we expect them to when we went up the river to canton and saw the pagoda we all exclaimed why it is just like the picturesriver and junks and all if we had not seen the pictures i believe we should scarcely have noticed it and certainly we should not have been surprised at all havent you done being surprised yet lorrimer asked no have you quite nothing ever surprises me i have read somewhere she said trying hard to recall the passage that fast men stupid men i think and rascals profess to feel no surprise at anything the colour flew over his face he seemed about to speak but took up his pen again as if the thing were not worth the trouble of a word and went on with his work the habit of treating men as ideas is not to be got rid of in a moment and it was only when she thought it over at dinner this evening that she saw anything to hurt him in what she had said now that she did think of it however it certainly seemed natural that he should object to being classed in any category which included fast men stupid men or rascals but even while she blamed herself and credited him with much forbearance in that he had allowed her rudeness to pass unpunished she was conscious of the existence in that substratum of thought which goes on continually irrespective of our will of a doubt as to whether he might not after all be one of thesesay a fast man for what did she know about him nothing except that his manners were agreeable true she had heard of his good deeds and there is never smoke without fire but a man may balance his accounts and many men do in that way topping up the scale of good deeds pretty high when the bad ones on the other side threaten to turn it and seeing that she knew nothing definitely about his private character suppose she had been deceived in him but no the thing was impossible and just as she thought it a gentleman sitting opposite one whom she had not met before looked across the table and asked her if she knew mr lorrimer i have seen him she answered with a burning blush being taken unawares hes a charming fellowdont you think so yes i think so she agreed with an indescribable sense of relief and the next day a young clergyman whom she stopped to speak to in the street began at once about lorrimer i met him at dinner the other night he said i suppose you know him there is much truth in birds of a feather he fascinated us all with his talk of art and literature he gave us such new ideasdescribed such varied experiences and all with such grace and power yes she answered thoughtfully i believe he is brilliant many people are that was the reply given with hearty enthusiasm but lorrimer is something more he is good he makes you feel it and know it and believe in him without ever saying a word about himself ah she sighed there is power in that what lovely summer weather it makes me dream dont you love the time of nasturtiums their pungent scent and their colours they seem to penetrate and glow through everything and make the time their own and so she left him but that same day an old gentleman who came from another county and looked as if he had come from another centuryan old gentleman with curious wavy hair parted in the middle who worshipped the idol of daysthe past and all that belonged to itand for evening dress wore kneebreeches frilled shirt black silk stockings and diamond buckles in his shoes and had a bijou house filled with a thousand relics of his idol of days where noble ladies were wont to loll and listen to him and drink tea out of his wonderful cups and love him so it was saidthis gentleman called on ideala he came to charm and to be charmed and he of all people in the world the one from whom she would least have expected it although she knew they had met began to sing lorrimers praises he raises the tone of everything he is engaged upon this gentleman said he has not quite kept faith with me about a matter he promised to look into for me a year ago but doubtless he is busy i suppose you know him yes i know him he seems to be very much above the average oh very much above the average was the warm response hes a charming fellow and a thoroughly good fellow too this was the chorus to everything and there was only one dissentient voicethat of a man who admired ideala and was a good soul himself having gone out of his way to pay her trifling attentions and even found occasion to do her some small acts of kindness he began with the rest to praise lorrimer but when he saw he was doing so at his own expense by diverting her attention from himself to his subject he somewhat lowered his tone every one seems to like mr lorrimer ideala said o yes hes certainly a nice fellow but he puts a lot of side on and well he may being so very good and wellbeloved she answered smiling so spoilt and conceited you might say was the rejoinder but she felt that there was jealousy in the tone and only laughed what an interesting face he has a lady remarked who was having tea with ideala teteatete one afternoon and had brought the conversation round to lorrimer as seemed inevitable in those days he must make a charming portrait yes it is a fine face ideala answered dreamilya face for a bust in white marble a face from out of the long agonot greek but roman of the time when men were passing from a strong simple manly into a luxuriously effeminate selfindulgent stage the face of a man who is midway between the two extremes and a prey to the desires of both i wish i had been his mother his mother was a noble woman i know but she was not omniscient and she never could have understood the boy i daresay he was not enough of an ugly duckling to attract special attention and with many other chicks in the brood he could not have more than the rest and yet he required it he ought to have been an only child if he had been mine i should have known what his dreaminess meant why he loved to wander away and be alone what was the conflict that began in his cradleor earlier surely a mother must remember what there was in her mind to influence her child she must have the key to all that is wrong in him she must know if his soul is likely to be at war with his senses and then ideala forgot her listener and burst out with one of those curious flashes of insight irrespective of all knowledge to which she was subject if i were only a soul to be saved he would save me but i am also a body to be loved and whether he loves me or not he suffers it is the eternal conflict of mind and matter spirit and flesh two prisoners chained togetherthe one despising the other yet ruled by him and subservient to the needs of his lower nature the lady stared at her you know mr lorrimer very well then i suppose she remarked let me see said ideala awaking from her trance that is a question i often ask myself and sometimes i say i do know him very well and sometimes i say i dont i go to the great hospital frequently to read and to look up information and he helps me he is a man who makes an instant impression but he is manysided and now you ask me i think on the whole that i do not know him well i should not be surprised to hear any number of the most contradictory things about him it is not a nice character to have the lady said no ideala answered not at all nice but very interesting when at last the day arrived she felt an unusual impatience to see him and she was in a strange flutter of nervous excitement should she tell him of those things which she had not been able to confide to him on the last occasion of their meeting could she no impossible but she must see him nevertheless the desire was imperative the servant she had been accustomed to see met her at the door of the great hospital she fancied he looked at her peculiarly he said he had heard something about mr lorrimer being absent that day but he would inquire he left her and returning in a few minutes told her mr lorrimer was not there did he leave no note no message for me ideala asked faintly no madam nothing was the reply chapter xxii for quite three months we heard nothing of ideala but we were not alarmed as she often neglected us in this way when she was busy at last however claudia received a note from her written in pencil and in her usual style it has been dull down here to a degree she said i am beginning to think we are all too respectable are respectability and imbecility nearly allied i wonder but dont tell me i dont want to know all the trouble in the world comes from knowing too much and then im so dreadfully clever if people take the trouble to explain things to me i am sure to acquire some of the information they try to impart i heard of the block system the other day it sounded mysterious i like mystery and i went about in daily dread of having it all made plain to me by some officious person one day i was sitting on a rail above the line watching the trains a workman came and sat down near me it is very hard to have a workman sit down near you and not to talk to him so we talked and before i knew what was coming he had explained the whole of that block system to me only fancy and i may never forget it it is quite disheartening he said he was a pointsman and i asked him if he would send a train down a wrong line for fifty pounds he said fifty pounds was a large sum and he had a mother depending on him the people here are delicious i think i shall write a book about them some day have you felt the fascination of the trains my favourite seat here is a lovely spot just above where they pass i can look down on them and into them the line winds rather through meadows and between banks where wild flowers grow and under an ivied bridge or two and by some woods and the trains rush pastsome slow some fast and now and then comes one that is just a flash and roar and i cling to the railing for a moment till it passes and quiver with excitement feeling as if i must be swept away i look at the carriage windows too trying to catch a glimpse of the people and i always hope to see a face i know in that lies all the charm i seem to be expected in town and some scotch friends have asked me to pay them a visit en route i should like to go that way above everything one would see so much more of the country but i darent go to london while the bishop is there he is making a dead set at me again confirmation this time and i am afraid if he heard of my arrival he would do something rashdance down the row in his gaiters perhapswhich might excite comment even if people knew what he was after and then she went on to say she had been a little out of sorts and very lazy and she thought the north country air would brace her nerves and if we would have her she would like to go to us at once she arrived late one afternoon and i did not see her until she came down to the drawingroom dressed for dinner i had not thought anything of her illness she made so light of it and i was therefore startled beyond measure when she appeared why my dear i exclaimed involuntarily what have they done to you youre a perfect wreck well so i thought she answered but i did not like to tell you i was afraid you might think i was trying to make much of myself wrecks are so interesting there was a large party staying in the house and i had no opportunity of speaking to her that evening but the next morning she came into my studio with a brave assumption of her old manner i cannot tell how it was that i knew in a moment she had broken down but i did know it and i could only look at her perhaps something in my look showed her she had betrayed herself for all at once her false composure forsook her and she stretched out her hands to me with a piteous little gesture what am i to do she said will it always be like this but i could not help her i turned to the picture i was working at and went on painting without a word byandby she recovered herself and began to talk of other things i blamed myself afterwards i ought to have let her tell me then but i had no notion of the truth i only thought of her husband and i selfishly shrank from encouraging her to speak complaint seemed to be beneath her but i know now that she never wanted to make any complaint of him to me it was of her new acquaintance that she longed to tell me she had settled the difficulty with her husband without consulting any one she had returned to his house and remained there as his wife nominally and because he particularly wished that the world should know nothing of the rupture i believe that she had done it sorely against the grain and only because he represented that by so doing she would save his reputation but from that time forward she would accept nothing from him but houseroom for she held that no highminded woman could take anything from a man to whom she was bound by no tie more sacred than that of a mere legal contract she was very quiet when she first came to us but beyond that i noticed nothing unusual in her manner and after the first i was inclined to think that being out of health accounted for everything my sister claudia however was not so easily deceived she declared that ideala was suffering from some serious trouble either mental or bodily and as the days wore on and there was no change for the better in her but rather the contrary i began to share claudias anxiety ideala grew paler and thinner and more nervous she was oftenest depressed but occasionally had unnatural bursts of hilarity that would end suddenly in long fits of brooding it seems she had at first believed that lorrimers absence was an intentional slight and the humiliation coming as it did upon the long train of troubles which had weakened her already both in body and mind nearly killed her she had been lying for weeks between life and death and we had known nothing of it but as her strength returned she began to think she had been unjust to lorrimer she could account for his absence in many ways he had been called out suddenly and had left no message because he expected to be back before she arrived but had been detained or perhaps he had left a message with one of the servants whom she had not seenthere were so many about the place or it was just possible that he had never received her letter at alla certain number are lost in the post every day and altogether it was more difficult to think badly of him than to believe that there had been some mistake but still there was a doubt in her mind and she bore the torment of it rather than ask for an explanation which might only confirm her worst fears chapter xxiii about a month after she came to us ideala caught a bad cold the doctor said her chest was very delicate there was no disease but she required great care and must not go out of doors soon afterwards he ordered her to remain in two rooms and my sister had a favourite sittingroom turned into a bedroom for her it opened into the blue drawingroom and we took to sitting there in the evening so that ideala might join us without change of temperature ideala had always been careless about her health and we expected some trouble with her now but she acquiesced in all our arrangements without a word it was easy to see however that her docility arose from indifference the one idea possessed her and she cared for nothing else did he or did he not mean it was the question she asked herself morning noon and night till at last she could bear it no longer anything was better than suspense she must write to him she must know the truth one way or the other i had stayed up in the blue drawingroom to read one night after the rest of the party had gone to their rooms but my mind wandered from the book ideala had been very still that evening and i could not help thinking about her once or twice i had caught her looking at me intently it seemed as if she had something to say but when i went to speak to her she answered quite at random i was much troubled about her and something happened presently which did not tend to set my mind at rest the room was large and the fire though bright and one shaded lamp standing on a low table left the greater part of it in shadow when i gave up the attempt to read i had gone to the farther end of it to lie on a sofa which was quite in the shade about midnight the door into idealas room opened and she stood on the threshold with a loose white wrapper round her she could not see me and i ought to have spoken and let her know i was there but i was startled at first by her sudden appearance and afterwards i was afraid of startling her she was so nervous and fragile then that a very little might have led to serious consequences i did not like to play the spy but it was a choice of two evils and i thought she had come for a book or something and would go directly and if she did discover me she would suppose me to be asleep she walked about the room however for a little in an objectless way then she sank down on the floor with a low moan beside a chair and hid her face on her arm presently she looked up and i saw she held something in her hand it was a gold crucifix and she fixed her eyes on it the lamplight fell on her face and i could see that it was drawn and haggard claudia had maintained latterly that her illness arose more from mental than from physical trouble did this explain it and was it a religious difficulty a weary while she remained in the same attitude gazing at the crucifix but evidently there was no pity for her pain and no relief she neither prayed nor wept and scarcely moved and i dared not at last however a great drowsiness came over me and when i awoke i almost thought i had dreamt it all for the daylight was streaming in and i was alone later in the day when i saw ideala she had just finished writing a letter shall i take it down for you i asked the man will come for the others presently she handed it to me without a word on the way downstairs i saw that it was addressed to lorrimer of whom i had not then heard but somehow i could not help thinking that this letter had something to do with what i had seen the night before for a day or two after that ideala seemed better then she grew restless which was a new phase of her malady she had been so still before and soon it was evident that she was devoured by anxiety which she could not conceal i felt sure she was expecting someone or something that never came for days she wandered up and down up and down and she neither ate nor slept one afternoon i went to ask if she had any letters for the post at first she said she had not then she wanted to know how soon the post was going in a few minutes i told her she sat down on the impulse of the moment and hurriedly wrote a note which she handed to me it was addressed to lorrimer but i asked no questions two days afterwards a single letter came by the post for ideala i took it to her myself and saw in a moment that it was what she had waited for so anxiously the cruel suspense was over at last that evening she was radiant but she told us she must go home next day and we were thunderstruck it was the depth of winter the weather was bitterly cold and she had not been out of the house for months and under the circumstances to take such a journey was utter madness but we remonstrated in vain she was determined to go and she went chapter xxiv in a few days she returned to us and we were amazed at the change in her her voice was clear again her step elastic her complexion had recovered some of its brilliancy there was a light in her eyes that i had never seen there before and about her lips a perpetual smile hovered she was tranquil again and selfpossessed but she was more than thatshe was happy one could see it in the very poise of her figure when she crossed the room this is delightful is it not claudia whispered to me in the drawingroom on the evening of her return delightful i answered but i was puzzled idealas variableness was all on the surface and i felt sure that this sudden change which looked like ease after agony meant something serious she did not keep me long in suspense the next morning she came to my studio door and looked in shyly come in i said i have been expecting you and then i went on with my painting i saw she had something to tell me and thought as she was evidently embarrassed it would be easier for her to speak if i did not look at her i hope you are going to stay with us some time now ideala i added glancing up at her as she came and looked over my shoulder at the picture her face clouded ii am afraid not she answered hesitating and nervously fidgeting with some paint brushes that lay on a table beside her i am afraid you will not want me when you know what i am going to do i only came back to tell you my heart stood still to tell me why what are you going to do it is very hard to tell you she faltered you and claudia are my dearest friends and i cannot bear to give you pain but i must tell you at once it is only right that you should knowespecially as you will disapprove i turned to look at her but she could not meet my eyes give us pain disapprove i exclaimed what on earth do you mean ideala what are you going to do an immoral thing she answered good heavens i exclaimed throwing down my palette and rising to confront her i dont believe it i mean she stammeredthe blood rushing into her face and then leaving her white as she spokesomething which you will consider so i cannot believe it i reiterated but it is true he says so hewho in gods name lorrimer and who on earth is lorrimer that is what i came to tell you she answered faintly i gathered up my palette and brushes and sat down to my easel again tell me then i said as calmly as i could i pretended to paint and after a little while still standing behind me so that i could not see her face she began in a low voice and told me with her habitual accuracy all that had passed between them and what did you think when you found he was not there i asked for at that point she had stopped at first i thought he did not want to see me and had gone away on purpose she answered then i was ill but after that when i began to get better i was afraid i had been unjust to him there might have been some mistake and i was half inclined to go and see but i was frightened and every day the longing grew and i used to sit and look at my watch and thinki could be there in an hour or i might be with him in forty minutes but i never went and after a while i could not bear it any longer and so i came to you but the thought of him came with me and the desire to know the truth grew and grew until at last i could bear that no longer either and then i wrote and day after day i waited and no answer came and then i was sure he had done it on purpose but yet i could not bear to think it of him and i began not to know what people said when they spoke to me and i think i should have killed myself but i come of an old race you know and none of us ever did a cowardly thing and i would rather suffer for ever than be the firstnoblesse oblige i dont deserve much credit for that though for i knew i should die if i did not see him againdie of grief and shame and humiliation because of what i had written for as the days passed and no answer came i was afraid i had said too much and he had misunderstood me and would despise me if i had only been sure that he did not want to see me again of course i should never have written but so many people have lost their only chance of happiness because they had not the courage to find out the truth in some such doubtful matter and i did believe in him so i could not think he would do a low thing i was in a difficult position and i did what i thought was right but when no answer came to my letter i began to doubt and then in a moment of rage feeling myself insulted i wrote again yet i dont know what made me write it was an impulsethe sort of thing that makes one scream when one is hurt it does no good but the cry is out before you can think of that all i said was i understand your silence you are cruel and unjust but i can keep my word and if i live for nothing else i promise that i will make you respect me yet i never expected him to answer that second note but he did at once and he offered to come here and explainhe was dreadfully distressed but i preferred to go to him and you went yes and i was frightened and he was very kind by degrees she told me much of what had passed at that interview she seemed to have had no thought of anything but her desire to see him and have her mind set at rest until she found herself face to face with him and then she was assailed by all kinds of doubts and fears but he had put her at her ease in five minutesand in five minutes more she had forgotten everything in the rapid change of ideas the delightful intellectual contest and communion which had made his companionship everything to her she did just remember to ask him why he had not answered her first letter he searched about amongst a pile of newlyarrived documents on his writing table there it is he said showing her the letter covered with stamps and postmarks it only arrived this morningjust in time though to speak for itself i was abroad when you wrote and it was sent after me and has followed me from place to place as you see so that i got your second letter first you might have known there was some mistake pardon me ideala answered i ought to have known and then she had looked up at him and smiled and never another doubt had occurred to her but ideala i said to her you used the word immoral just now you were talking at random surely you are nervous for heavens sake collect yourself and tell me what all this means no i am not nervous she answered see my hand is quite steady it is you who are trembling i am calm now and relieved because i have told you but oh i am so sorry to give you pain i do not yet understand i answered hoarsely he wants me to give up everything and go to him she said but he would not accept my consent until he had explained and made me understand exactly what i was doing the world will consider it an immoral thing he said and so it would be if the arrangement were not to be permanent but any contract which men and women hold to be binding on themselves should be sufficient now and will be sufficient again as it used to be in the old days provided we can show good cause why any previous contract should be broken you must believe that you must be thoroughly satisfied now for if your conscience were to trouble you afterwardsyour troublesome conscience which keeps you busy regretting nearly everything you do but never warns you in time to stop youif you were to have any scruples then there would be no peace for either of us and you had better give me up at once and what did you say ideala i said perhaps i had i was beginning to be frightened again and how did it end he made me go home and consider yes and what then i demanded impatiently and next day he came to meto know my decisionandandi was satisfied i cannot live without him i groaned aloud what was i to say what could i do an arrangement of this sort is carefully concealed as a rule by the people concerned and denied if discovered but here were a lady and gentleman prepared not only to take the step but to justify itunder somewhat peculiar circumstances certainlyand carefully making their friends acquainted with their intention beforehand as if it were an ordinary engagement i knew ideala and could understand her being overpersuaded something of the kind was what i had always feared for her but lorrimerwhat sort of a man was he i own that i was strongly prejudiced against him from the moment she pronounced his name and all she had told me of him subsequently only confirmed the prejudice why was he not there that day to receive you i asked at last i dont know she said i quite forgot about that and i suppose he forgot too she added since he never told me oh ideala i exclaimed how like you that is it is most important that you should know whether he intended to slight you on that occasion or not it is the key to his whole action in this matter but supposing he did mean to be rude i should have to forgive him you know because i have been rude to himoften he does not approve of my conduct always by any means she placidly assured me and does he of all people in the world presume to sit in judgment on you i answered indignantly i always thought you the most extraordinary person in the world ideala until i heard of this gentleman hush she protested as if i had blasphemed you must not speak of him like that he is a gentlemanas true and loyal as you are yourself and he is everything to me but these assurances were only what i had expected from ideala and in no way altered my opinion of mr lorrimer i knew idealas peculiar conscience well she might do what all the world would consider wrong on occasion but she would never do so until she had persuaded herself that wrong was rightfor her at all events he may be everything to you but he has lowered you ideala i resumed thinking it best not to spare her i was degraded when i met him circumstances cannot degrade us until they make us act unworthily i rejoined oh no he has not lowered me she persisted quite the contrary i have only begun to know the difference between right and wrong since i met him and to understand how absolutely necessary for our happiness is rightdoing even in the veriest trifle and there is one thing that i must always be grateful to him fori can pray now but i belied myself to him nevertheless he asked me if i ever prayed and i was shy i could not tell him because i only prayed for him it was easier to say that sometimes i reviled ah why can we not be true to ourselves but i cant always pray she went on sorrowfully only sometimes generally when i am in church the thought of him comes over me then and a great longing to have him beside me kneeling with his heart made tender and his soul purified and uplifted to god as mine is possesses mea longing so great that it fills my whole being and finds a voice my god my god give him to me angels of god in heaven give him to me give him to me i answered bitterly yes i remember she rejoined i said it in my arrogant ignorance i did not understand and this is different it is always different in our own case i answered do you remember that passage ralph waldo emerson quotes from lord bacon moral qualities rule the world but at short distances the senses are despotic it seems to me that when you call upon god in that spirit you are worshipping him with your senses only then i believe it is possible to make the senses the means of saving the soul at critical times she answered and at all events i know this that i more earnestly desire to be a good woman now than i ever did before it would be a dangerous doctrine i began only in cases where the previous moral development had not been of a high order she interrupted i felt it was useless to pursue that part of the subject so i waited a little and then i said am i to understand then that you are going to give up your position in society and all your friends for the sake of this one man who probably does not care for you who certainly does not respect you and of whom you know nothing verily he has gained an easy victory but of course you know now what his object has been from the first i know what you mean she answered indignantly but you are quite wrong he does care for me and if i give up my position in society for his sake he is worth it and i am content and it is my own doing too i know that there cannot be one law for me and another for all the other women in the world and if i break through a social convention i am prepared to abide by the consequences do you want to make me believe that his sympathy was pretended that he deliberately planned something i have no word to expressand would have carried out his plan absolutely in cold blood without a spark of affection for me it would be hard to believe it of any man it is impossible to believe it of him he is a man of strong passions if you will but of noble purpose and if i make a sacrifice for him he will be making one for me also he may have been betrayed at times by grief or other mental pain which weakened his moral nature for the moment and left him at the mercy of bad impulses but i can believe such impulses were isolated and any action they led him into was bitterly repented of and no one will ever make me alter my conviction that i wronged him when i doubted him even for a moment this is all very well ideala i said trying not to irritate her by direct opposition if you appeared to him as you appear to me do you think you did was there anything in your conduct that might have given him a low estimate of your character to begin with anything that might have led him to doubt your honesty and think when you made your confession that you were trying to get up a little play in which you intended him to take a leading part that you merely wished to ease your mind from some inevitable sense of shame in wrongdoing by finding an excuse for yourself to begin withan excuse by which you would excite his interest and sympathy and save yourself from his contempt oh she exclaimed could hecould any onethink such a thing possible such things are being done every day ideala and a man of the world would naturally be on his guard against deception if he thought he was being deceived do you think it likely he would feel bound to be scrupulous but he did believe in me she declared passionately he pretended to it was part of the play you see he only kept it up until he thoroughly understood you and then his real feelings appeared and he was rude to you for i call his absence on that occasion distinctly rude and intentionally so too since he sent no apology he was only rude to me to save me from myself then as lancelot was rude to elaine she answered or is it not just possible that he was disappointed when he found you better than he had supposed that he felt he had wasted his time for nothing and was irritated she interrupted me i forgive you she said because you do not know him but i shall never convince you you are prejudiced you do not think ill of me why do you think ill of him i made no answer and she was silent for a little then she began again recurring to the point at issue if he did slight me on that occasion she saidand i maintain that he did notbut if he did it was accidentally done the evidence is against him i answered drily many innocent persons have suffered because it was she said with confidence you are infatuated i answered roughly and then my heart sent up an exceeding great and bitter cry ideala ideala how did it ever come to this she was silent but her eyes were bright once more her figure was erect there was new life in heri could see thatand never a doubt she was satisfied she was happy must i give you up she said at last tentatively no you must give him up i answered ah that is impossible she cried we were made for each other we cannot live apart ideala i exclaimed exasperated he never believed in you he thought you were as so many women of our set are and he showed it if only you could have understood when you saw him at the hospital on that last occasion you felt that there was some change as you say yourself and that was it you talked to him of truth then and it irritated him as the devil quoting scripture might be supposed to irritate and when you went back again he showed what he thought of you by his unexplained absence he thought you were not worth consideration and he gave you none it would have been paying himself a very poor compliment if he had thought that only a corrupt woman could care for him she answered confidently but i tell you i am sure there is some satisfactory explanation of that business i only wish i had remembered to ask for it that i might satisfy you now and at any rate she added whatever he may have thought he knows better by this time i could say no more baffled and sick at heart i left her wondering if some happy inspiration would come before it was too late and help me to save her yet chapter xxv i went to consult my sister claudia the blow was a heavy one for her also but i was surprised to find that she did not share my contempt for the person whom i considered responsible for all this trouble ideala is no common character herself claudia argued and it isnt likely that a common character would fascinate her as this man has done will you speak to her claudia and see what your influence will do it is no use my speaking to her she answered disconsolately ideala is a much cleverer woman than i am she would make me laugh at my own advice in five minutes and besides if she be infatuated as you say she is she will be only too glad to be allowed to talk about him and that will strengthen her feeling for him no she has chosen you for her confidant and you had better talk to her yourselfand may you succeed she added laying her head on the table beside which she was sitting and giving way to a burst of grief i tried to comfort her but i had little hope myself and i could not speak at all confidently i believe claudia said before we parted that there is nothing for her now but a choice of two evils if she gives him up she will never care for anything again and if she does not she will have done an unjustifiable thing and life after that for such a woman as ideala would be like one of those fairy gifts which were bestowed subject to some burdensome condition that made the good of them null and void i did not meet ideala again until the evening and then i was not sorry to see that her manner was less serene it was just possible that she had been thinking over what i had said and that some of the doubts i had suggested were beginning to disturb her perfect security after dinner she brought the conversation round to those social laws which govern our lives arbitrarily i did not see what she was driving at neither did the good old bishop who was one of the party nor a lawyer who was also present you want to know something said the latter what is it you must state your case clearly i want to know if a thing can be legally right and morally wrong ideala answered of course not the bishop rashly asserted that depends the lawyer said cautiously if i signed a contract ideala explained and found out afterwards that those who induced me to become a party to it had kept me in ignorance of the most important clause in it so that i really did not know to what i was committing myself would you call that a moral contract i should say that people had not dealt uprightly with you the bishop answered but there might be nothing in the clause to which you could object but suppose there was something in the clause to which i very strongly objected something of which my conscience disapproved something that was repugnant to my whole moral nature and suppose i was forced by the law to fulfil it nevertheless should you say that was a moral contract should you not say that in acting against my conscience i acted immorally we all fell into the trap and looked an encouraging assent and in that case she continued i suppose my duty would be to evade the law and act on my conscience the bishop looked puzzled i should only be doing what the early martyrs had to do she added that is true he rejoined with evident relief but i dont see what particular contract you are thinking of said the lawyer the marriage contract ideala answered calmly this announcement created a sensation the lawyer laughed the bishop looked grave oh but you cannot describe marriage in that way he declared with emphasis humph the lawyer observed meditatively i am afraid i must beg to differ from your lordship many women might describe their marriages in that way with perfect accuracy marriages are made in heaven the bishop ejaculated feebly let us hope that some are dear bishop claudia sweetly observed and all the married people in the room looked amen at her i think an ideal of marriage should be fixed by law and lectures given in all the colleges to teach it ideala went on and a standard of excellence ought to be set up for people to attain to before they could be allowed to marry they should be obliged to pass examinations on the subject and fit themselves for the perfect state by a perfect life it should be made a reward for merit and a goal towards which goodness only could carry us then marriages might seem to have been made in heaven and the blessing of god would sanctify a happy union instead of being impiously pronounced in order to ratify a business transaction or sanction the indulgence of a passing fancy but only the love that lasts can sanctify marriage and a marriage without such love is an immoral contract marriage an immoral contract the bishop exclaimed o dear o dear this is not right you know this is not at all right i must make a note of thisi really must you are in the habit of saying things of this sort my dear i remember you said something like it once before and really it is not a subject to joke about such an idea is quite pernicious it must not be allowed to spreadeven as a joke i wish my dear you had not promulgated it even in that spirit you haveah a knack of making things seem plausible and of giving weight to opinions by the way you express them although the opinions themselves are quite erroneous as on the present occasion some of your ideas are so very mistaken you know and you really ought to leave these matters to those who understand them and can judge it is very dangerous to discuss such subjects especiallyahwhen you know nothing about them andahcannot judge i really must preach a sermon on the subject let me see next sundayah yes next sunday if you will kindly come and hear me we all thanked him as enthusiastically as we could later i found ideala alone in one of the conservatories she took my arm affectionately and we walked up and down for a time in silence she was smiling and happy so happy indeed that i found it hard to say anything to disturb her for a moment i felt almost as she did about the step she proposed to take there had been little joy in her life and she had borne her cross long and bravely what wonder that she should rebel at last and claim her reward do you remember how you used to talk about the women of the nineteenth century ideala i said at last and describe the power for good which they never use and rail at them as artificial millinermade manhunting selfindulgent animals i know she answered and now you would say i am worse than any of them i used to have big ideas about woman and her mission but i always looked at the question broadly as it affects the whole world now my vision is narrowed and i see it only with regard to one individual but i am sure that is the right way to look at it i think every woman will have to answer for one mans soul and it seems to me that the noblest thing a woman can do is to devote her life to that soul first of allto raise it if it be low to help it to peace if peace be lacking and to gather all the sunshine there is in the world for it and after that if her opportunities and powers allow her to help others also she should do what she can for them i do not know all the places which it is legitimate for women to fill in the world but it seems to me that they are many and various and that the great object in life for a woman is to help to be a pericles i see that a man must have an aspasia was aspasia vile some said soyet she did a nobler work and was finer in her fall if she fell than many good women in all the glory of uprightness are and was she impure then it is strange that her mind was not corrupting in its influence and was she low then whence came her power to raise others it seems to me that it only rests with ourselves to make any position in life which circumstances render it expedient for us to occupy desirable and you propose to be an aspasia to this modern pericles if you like to put it so the cases are not dissimilar as there was an obstacle in the way of their marriage also the law was the obstacle yes another of those laws which are more honoured in the breach than in the observance they might not marry because she came from miletus and lorrimer may not marry me because i came out of the house of bondage unwise laws make immoral nations but you have gone about this business in such an extraordinary way ideala i said you seem to have tried to make it appear as bad for yourself as you can why did you not leave your husband when lorrimer advised you to if i had gone then i should have been obliged to live somewhere else a long way from lorrimer and i might never have seen him again and do you mean to say you decided to endure a life that had become hateful to you in every way simply for the sake of seeing this gentleman occasionally yes ah you do not know how good he is nor how he raises me i never knew the sort of creature i was until he told me he said once when we quarrelled that i was fanciful sentimental lackadaisical hysterical and in an unhealthy state of mind and yet i made a gesture of impatience and she stopped but ideala i asked her after a little pause have you never felt that what you are doing is wrong i cannot say that exactly she answered i knew that certain social conventions forbade the thingat least i began to acknowledge this to myself after a time at first you know i thought of nothing i was wholly absorbed in my desire to see him that excluded every other consideration do you know what it is to be sure that a thing is wrong and yet not to be able to feel it soto have your reason acknowledge what your conscience does not confirm i made no answer and we were silent for a little then she spoke again one day when i was in japan she said i was living up in the hills at hakone a village on a lake three thousand feet above the level of the sea the mayor of the village was entertaining me and whenever i went out he sent his son and several of his retainers as an escort that i might not be subject to annoyance or insult from strangers one day i was crossing the hills by a mountainpath there is between hakone and mianoshita and after i passed ashynoyou where the sulphur springs are i found myself in a dense fog i could not see anything distinctly three yards in front of me kashywaya and the other men never walked with me they used to hover about me leaving me to all intents and purposes alone if i preferred it the japanese are very delicate in some things it was weeks before i knew that i had a guard of honour at all on that particular day i lost sight of them altogether but i could hear them calling to each other through the fog and i sat down feeling very wretched and lonely i thought how all the beauty of life had been spoiled for me how past present and to come it was all a blank and i wished in my heart that i might die and know no more and do you know just at that moment the fog beneath me parted and i saw the sea sapphire blue and dotted with boats and the sand a streak of silver and the green earth and a low horizon of shining clouds and over all the sun dear lord in heaven how glad a sight it was she pressed her handkerchief to her eyes and i was wandering she continued in some such mental mist lost and despairing when lorrimer came into my life and changed everything for me in a moment like the sun would you have me believe that he was sent to me then only for an evil purpose that the good god in whom i scarcely believed until in his mercy he allowed me to feel love for one of his creatures and to realise through it the divine love of which it is surely the foreshadowingwould you have me believe myself degraded by love so sent would you have me turn from it and call it sin when i feel that god himself is the giver i was silent not knowing how to answer her presently i asked but why not have a legal separation a divorce from your husband now i cannot she answered sadly at one time i had written proof of his turpitude but i could not make up my mind to use it then and i destroyed it eventually so that now my word would be the only evidence against him and that would not do i suppose although you all know better than i do i fancy what his life has been other people had by this time come into the conservatory and we were therefore obliged to change the subject in the days that followed every one seemed to become conscious of some impending trouble we were all depressed and one by one our party left us until at last only ideala remained for we had not the heart to ask other guests even if it had been expedient and under the circumstances claudia did not consider it so ideala spent much of her time in writing to lorrimer some of these letters were never sent i fancy she wrote exactly as she felt and often feared when she had done so that she had been too frank how these two ever came to such an understanding i am at a loss to imagine and i have searched in vain for any clue to the mystery only one thing is plain to me that when at last ideala understood her feeling for lorrimer she cherished it after she found that her husband had broken every tie disregarded every obligation legal and moral that bound her to him she seems to have considered herself free but i feel quite sure she had not acknowledged this even to herself when she returned to lorrimer and that simply because she had not contemplated the possibility of being asked to take any decided step when the time came however she apparently never questioned her right to act on this fancied freedom the circumstances under which they had met were probably responsible for a great deal the whole of their acquaintance had had something unusual about it which would naturally predispose their minds to further unaccustomed issues when any question of right or expediency arose the restrictions which men and women have seen fit to place upon their intercourse with each other are the outcome of ages of experience and they who disregard them bring upon themselves the troubles against which those same restrictions irksome at times as they must be are the only adequate defence one letter i have here shows something of the strength and tenderness of idealas devotion and i venture to think that even under the circumstances it must be good for a man to have been loved once in his life like that the letter begins abruptlyoh the delight of being able to write to you she says without fear and without constraint if it were possible to step from the dreary oppression of the northern midnight into the full blaze of the southern noon the transition would not be greater than is the sense of rest and relief that has come to me after the weary days which are over do you know i never believed that any one person could be so much to another as you are to me that any one could be so happy as i am i think i am too happy but dear i want you i want you always but most of all when anything good or beautiful moves me i feel nearer to you then and i know you would understand every good thought every worthy aspiration everything that is best in me and every possibility of better things seems due to your influence and makes me crave for your presence you have been the one thing wanting to me my whole life long i believe that no soul is perfect alone and that each of us must have a partnersoul somewhere kept apart from usby false marriages perhaps or distance or death but still to be ours if not in this state then in some other when both are perfect enough to make the union possible we are not all fit for that love which is the beginning of heaven and can have no end transcribers note lengthy footnote relocated to chapter end does this seem fanciful to you it would comfort me if we were ever separated ifi cannot tell you how it makes my heart sink just to look at that word although i know it does not suggest anything that is possible in our case what power would take you from me now when there is no one else in the whole wide world for me but you and always you and only you you with your ready sympathy and perfect refinement your wit your rapid changes your ideality your kindness your cruelty and the terrible discontent which makes you untrue to yourself you are my world but unless i can be to you what you are to me you will always be one of the lonely ones tell me again that my absence makes a blank in your life you did not write the word you only left a space and do you know how i filled it at first it was such a relief when you left off coming i read and i raged at you i have heard it said lately that you are fickle but these people do not understand you you are true to your ideal but the women you have hitherto known were only so many imperfect realisations of it and so you went from one to the other always searching but never satisfied and you have it in you to be so much happier or so much more miserable than other meni should have trembled for you if your hopes had never been realised but what would satisfy you i often long to be that mummy you have in the great hospital the one with the short nose and thick lips when you looked at me spirit and flesh would grow one with delight and i should come to life and grow round and soft and warm again and talk to you of thebes and you would be enchanted with meyou could not help it then i should be so old so very old and genuine dear how i laugh at my fears now or rather how i bless them if i had never known the horror of doubt how could i have known what certainty is and i did doubt you i dare acknowledge it now i wonder if you can understand what the shame of that doubt was when i thought your absence and your silence were intentional slights i knew how they felt when they called on the rocks to cover them and i wishedoh how i wishedthat a thousand years had passed and my spirit could be at the place where we met and see the pillars broken and the ivy climbing over the ruins and the lizards at home amongst them and the shameless sunlight making bare the spot where we stood it was as if i had been punished for some awful unknown sin and when i seemed to be dying and i dared not write to you and all hope of ever knowing the truth had departed i used to exclaim in my misery verily lord if thy servant sinned she hath suffered for the anguish of death has been doubled and the punishment of the lost has begun while yet the tortured mind can make its lament and moan with the tortured body but all that bitter past only enhances the present i wonder where you will be today i believe you are always in that room of yours you only leave it to walk to the station with me after which you go back to it and work there till it is dark and then you rest waiting for the daylight and when it comes you go to work again i cannot fancy you anywhere else i should not like to realise that you have an existence of which i can know nothing a life through which i cannot follow you even in imagination but sometimes you come to me and then how glad i am you come to me and kiss me and it is night and i am dreaming and not ashamed yes the days do drag on slowly for after all i am never quite happy never at peace even never for a moment except when i am with you i am sorry i feel so for it seems ungrateful in the face of all the kindness and care that is being lavished on me by my friends one lady here has seven childrenanother instance of the unequal distribution of the good things of this world she has lent me one of them to comfort me because i am jealous he sleeps in my room and is a fair haired boy with eyes that remind me of you will he also when he grows up have the conscience of a saint among his warring senses i hope not i should think when sense and conscience are equally delicate and apt to thrill simultaneously life must be a burden would such a state of things account for moods that vary perpetually i wonder here she breaks off and i think these last reflections account for the fact that the letter was never sent relocated footnote this passage might have been taken from plato verbatim but ideala had not read plato at the time it was written the inborn passionate longing of the human soul for perfect companionship doubtless accounts for the coincidence which also shows how deeprooted and widely spread the hope of eventually obtaining the desired companionship is some will maintain that the desire for such a possibility has created the belief in it but others claim to have met their partnersouls and to have become united by a bond so perfect that even distance cannot sever it there being some inexplicable means of communication between the two which enables each to know what befalls the other wherever they may be the idea might probably be traced back to that account of adam which describes him as androgynous or a higher union of man and womana union of all the attributes of either which to punish adam for a grievous fault was subsequently sundered into the contrast between man and woman leaving each lonely imperfect and vainly longing for the other chapter xxvi ideala lingered unwillingly but the reason of her reluctance to go was not far to seek now that lorrimer knew she loved him she was ashamed to go back it would have been bad enough had he been able to come to her but going to him was like reversing the natural order of things and unsexing herself i suppose however that she forgot her shyness in her desire to be with him as the time went on and the effort it cost her to conquer her fear and go to him was not so dreadful as the blank she would have been obliged to face had she stayed away at all events she fixed a day at last and one morning she announced to us sadly enough that on the morrow she must say farewell she made the announcement just after breakfast and claudia rose and left the room without a word my sister had never been able to speak to ideala on the subject but she did not cease to urge me to expostulate and she had suggested many arguments which had affected ideala and made her unhappy but without altering her determination i could not find a word to say to her that morning and during the slow hours of the long day that dragged itself on so wearily for all of us nothing new occurred to me it will be a relief when it is over i said to my sister yes she answered it is worse than death in the evening she came to my study and said ideala is alone in the south drawingroom i wish you would go to her and make a last effort to dissuade her i consented hopelessly and went ideala was standing in a window looking out listlessly she was very pale and i could see that she had been weeping i sat down near the fire and presently she came and sat on the floor beside me and laid her head against my knee in all the years of my love for her she had never been so close to me before and i was glad to let her rest a long long time like that were you happy while you were with lorrimer ideala i asked at last she did not answer at once and when she did it was almost in a whisper no never quite happy till this last time she said never entirely at ease even it was when i left him when i was alone and could think of him that the joy came there was nothing real in your pleasure then i went on it was purely imaginarydue to your trick of idealising everything and everybody you care for i do not know she said do you think it was the same with him i asked againi mean all along did it always make him happy to have you there i cannot tell she said yes i think at times he was glad but a word would alter his mood and then he would grow sad and silent even on the last occasion no not on the last occasion he was happy thenand she smiled at the recollectionah so happy it was like new life to him he was so young so fresh so gladlike a boy but before when his moods varied so often did it ever seem to you that he was troubled and dissatisfied with himself that the intimacy had begun on his part under a misapprehension and that when he began to know you better he had tried to end it and save you by not seeing you on that occasion ah that occasion again she ejaculated i forgot to tell you but i asked for an explanation just to satisfy you here it is and she took a note from her pocketbook and handed it to me it was one which she had written to him i do not understand i said read it she answered and you will find i asked him to expect me on monday the th it was a clerical error tuesday was the th and i went on tuesday he waited for me the whole long monday and that night he had to set off suddenly for the continent on business connected with the great hospital he went wondering what had detained me and expecting an explanation when he returned he inquired but nobody could tell him whether i had been or not so he waited and waited as i did expecting to hear and as much perplexed and distressed as i was and as proud for he never thought of writing to menor did he think of looking at my note again until i wrote the other day and then he discovered the mistake now are you satisfied about thatyes i answered reluctantly it was no relief to end him blameless but what did he mean when he talked of conscience and scruples he used to laugh at my troublesome conscience as he called it she answered evasively would he have known you had a conscience do you think if he had had none himself i asked her did he ever say anything that showed he was yielding to a strong inclination which he could not justify and would not conquer oh no she said then added undecidedly at leasthe did say once of course in the opinion of the world the thing cannot be justified but then he went on as if it had slipped from him involuntarily bah i am only doing as other men do which shows he was not exactly satisfied to be only as other men are that is what i have often told you she said his ideal of life both for himself and others is the highest possible and he suffers when he falls below it or even belies himself with a word passion never lasts and love does not lead to evil i continued meditatively if you love him ideala how will you bear to feel that he has degraded himself by degrading you oh do not speak like that she exclaimed there is no degradation in love it is sin that degrades and sin is something that corrupts our minds is it not and makes us unfit for any good work and unwilling to undertake any this is very different ideala do you remember telling me once that you had a strange feeling about yourself that you thought you would be made to go down into some great depth of sin and suffering in order to learn what it is you have to teach ah yes she answered but i have not gone down i must obey my own conscience not yours and my conscience tells me the thing is right which you hold to be wrong i am quite willing to believe it would be wrong for you but for me it is clearly right you said the other day he had lowered me what a fiction that is in what have i changed for the worse do i fail in any duty of life since i knew him in which i previously succeeded oh no he has not lowered me love like this rounds a life and brings it to perfection it could not wreck it but ideala you are going to fail in a duty you are going to fail in the most important duty of your lifeyour duty to society i owe nothing to society she answered obstinately i have always admired you i pursued for not letting your own experience warp your judgment oh what a fallingoff is here i have heard you wish to be something more than an independent unit of which no account need be taken how can we any of us say we owe nothing to society when we owe every pleasure in life to it do we owe nothing to those who have gone before and whom we have to thank for the music the painting the poetry and all the arts which would leave a big blank in your life ideala if they ceased to exist you would have been a mere savage now without refinement enough to appreciate that rose at your waistbelt but for the labour and selfdenial which the hundreds and thousands who lived and loved and suffered in order to make you what you are have bestowed on you and on all of us you would not say if you thought a moment that society had done nothing for you and no one can honestly think that they owe it nothing in return it seems to me that a rigid observance of the laws which hold society together and make life possible for all of us and pleasant for some is the least we can do and do you know ideala when a woman ever thinks of doing what you propose to do she has already gone down to a low depthof ingratitude if of nothing else i do not propose to do anything that will injure any one she answered coldly i am free am i not to dispose of myself as i like to give myself to whomsoever i please we are none of us free in that sense of the word i replied all are but parts of one stupendous whole whose body nature is and god the soul you are as i know you have desired to be part of a system and an important part all the toil and trouble of the world and all the work which began with the life of man is directed towards one great end the doing away with sin and suffering and the establishment of purity and peace and this work seems almost hopeless not because the multitude do not approve of it but because individuals are cowardly and will not do their share of it every act of yours has a meaning it either helps or hinders what is being done to further this the object of life lately ideala you have been talking wildly without for a moment considering the harm you may be doing you have expressed opinions which are calculated to make people discontented with things as they are you rob them of the content which has made them comfortable heretofore and yet you offer them nothing better in return for it you would have society turned topsyturvy and all for what why simply to make a wrong thing right for yourself if your example were followed by all the unhappy people in the world how would it end do you think there must be moral laws and it is inevitable that they should press hardly on individuals occasionally but it is clearly the duty of individuals to sacrifice themselves for the good of the community at large i do not understand your morality she said do you think that although i love another man it would be right for me to go back and live with my husband right but under the circumstances not advisable and at any rate nothing would make it moral for you to go to that other man oh do not fill my mind with doubt she pleaded piteously i love him let me go i did not answer her and after a while she began again passionately we are free agents in these things individuals must know what is best for themselves if i devote my life to him as i propose who would be hurt by it should i be less pureminded and would he be less upright in all his dealings when things can be legally right though morally wrong can they not also be morally right though legally wrong i have already tried to show you ideala i answered preparing to go over the old ground again patiently that we none of us stand alone that we are all part of this great system and that in cases like yours individuals must suffer must even be sacrificed for the good of the rest when the sacrifice is voluntary we call it noble if i go to him i shall have sacrificed a good deal you will have sacrificed others not yourself he is all the world to you ideala the loss would be nothing to the gainshe hid her face in her handsand what is required of you is selfsacrifice and surely it would be happier in the end for you to give him up now than to live to feel yourself a millstone round his neck i do not understand you she said looking up quickly the world you see will know nothing of the fine sentiments which made you determine to take this step i said you will be spoken of contemptuously and he will be the fellow who is living with another mans wife dont you know and that will injure him in many ways do you think so she asked anxiously i know it i replied and look at it from that or any other point of view you like and you must see you are making a mistake a woman in your position sets an example whether she will or not and even if all your best reasons for this step were made public you would do harm by it for there are only too many people apt enough as it is at finding specious excuses for their own shortcomings who would be glad if they dared to do likewise and you would not gain your object after all you would neither be happy yourself nor make lorrimer happy people like you are sensitive about their honourit is the sign of their superiority and the indulgence of love even at the moment and under the most favourable circumstances of youth beauty and intellectual equality does not satisfy such natures if the indulgence be not regulated and sanctified by all that men and women have devised to make their relations moral this was my last argument and when i had done she sat there for a long time silent resting her head against my knee and scarcely breathing she was fighting it out with herself and i thought it best to leave her alonebesides i had already said all there was to say repetition would only have irritated her and there was nothing now for it but to wait outside i could hear the dreary drip of raindrops somewhere in the room a clock ticked obtrusively but it was long past midnight and the house was still i thought that only the night and silence watched with me and waited upon the suffering of this one poor soul at last she moved uttering a low moan like one in pain i do see it she said almost in a whisper and i am willing to give him up god in his mercy help you i prayed and forgive me she answered humbly she was quite exhausted and passively submitted when i led her to her room i closed the shutters to keep out the cheerless dawn and made the fire burn up and lit the lamps she sat silently watching me and did not seem to think it odd that i should do this for her she clung to me then as a little child clings to its father and like a father i ministered to her reverently then left her as i hoped to sleep my sister opened her door as i passed she was dressed and had been watching too the whole night long well she asked i kissed her it is well i answered and she burst into tears can i go to her now she said yes go i went to claudias room and waited after a long time she returned she is quiet at last she told me sorrowfully and so the long night ended chapter xxvii ideala had returned to us quite under the impression that if she took the step she proposed we should think it right to cast her off and that little tentative must i give you up was the only protest she had offered but such was not our intention far from it we do not forsake our friends in their bodily ailments and we are poor pitiful egotistical creatures indeed when we desert them for their mental and moral maladies leaving them to struggle against them and fight them out or succumb to them alone according to their strength and circumstances the world will forsake them fast enough and that is sufficient punishmentif they deserve punishment of course ideala could never have come back to us as an honoured guest again after taking such a step but she would have continued to fill the same place in our affections if not in our esteem and you will drive everybody else away and keep the house empty all the year round in order to be able to receive herand mr lorrimer whenever they choose to visit us claudia had declared when we discussed the subject that was not quite what i intended but i had made ideala understand that nothing she could do would affect her intercourse with us i told her so at once because i would not have her alter her determination for any consideration but the highest she might at the last have hesitated to separate herself from us for ever but i felt sure if that were the case and it was not a better motive entirely which deterred her she would not be satisfied eventually and i know now that i was right ideala wrote to lorrimer and when she had finished her letter i found that she intended to impose a terrible task upon me until you know him yourself you will always misjudge him she said i want you to take him my letter and make his acquaintance i hesitated it is the least you can do she pleaded i shall be easier in my mind if you will it will be better for him to see you and hear all the things i cannot tell him in my letter andandif i must not see him myself it will be a comfort to see somebody who has do go i shall be pained if you refuse this decided me and i went at once it was a long journey the same that ideala herself had taken under such very different circumstances so short a time before i thought of her going in doubt and uncertainty her own feelings colouring the aspect of all she saw on the way and returning in the first warm glow of her great and unexpected joyher newfound happiness which was destined alas to be so shortlived miserable fate which robbed her of all that would have made her life worth havinga husband on whom she could rely her child and now the man upon whom she had been prepared to lavish the long pentup passion the concentrated devotion of her great and noble nature poor starved heart crushed back upon itself suffering silently suffering always but never hardeningon the contrary growing tenderer for others the more it had to endure itself would it always be so was there no peace on earth for ideala no one who could be all her own i felt responsible for this last hard blow had i done well the rush and rattle of the train shaped itself into a sort of subchorus to my thoughts as we sped through the pleasant fields was it right was it right was it right and i saw ideala with soft sad eyes pleadingmutely pleadingpleading always for some pleasure in life some natural womanly joy while youth and the power to love lasted by an effort of will i banished the question i told myself that my action in the matter had been expedient from every point of view but presently the rush of the grinding steel the thundering crank and the mighty wheel took me to task again and the chorus now became expediency right expediency right expediency right which when i banished it resolved itself into cold proud puritan cold proud puritan for the rest of the way but the journey ended at lastthough that was little relief with the task i had before me still unaccomplished a bulbous functionary took my card to lorrimer when i presented myself at the great hospital next day and returning presently informed me that mr lorrimer was disengaged and would see me at once if i would be so good as to come this way how familiar the whole proceeding seemed and how well i knew the place the soothing silence the massive grandeur the long dimly lighted gallery to the right the door at which the servant stopped and knocked the man who opened it and met my eyes fearlessly bowing with natural grace and bidding me entera tall fair man selfcontained and dignified cold pale and unimpassionedso i thoughtbut my equal in every way the man who was all the world to ideala when i saw him i understood lorrimer after dismissing his secretary was the first to speak you come to me from ideala he said is there anything wrong is she ill and i fancied he turned a trifle paler as the fear flashed through his mind i reassured him physically she is better i said but mentally he interposed you give her no peace i was silent i know you are no friend of mine he added on the contrary i answered i hope i am the best friend you have just now i know what that means he said you have tried to dissuade ideala and having failed you have come here to use your influence with me no i answered i have not come to discuss the subject i have brought you a letter from ideala at her special request and i am ready to take her any reply which you may think fit to send i gave him the letter and rose to go but he detained me stay till i have read it if you can spare me the time he said it is just possible that there is something in it which we ought to discuss i turned to the mantelpiece and tried to interest myself in the lovely things with which it was crowded but never in my life did my heart sink so for another never have i endured such moments of pained suspense i heard him open the envelope i heard the paper rustle as he turned the page and then there was silence full of the citys stilly sound a moment only but filled with something which possessd the darkness of the world delight life anguish death immortal love ceasing not mingled unrepressd apart from space witholding time a moments silence and then a heavy fall lorrimer had fainted i stayed three days at the great hospital three days of the most delightful converse at first lorrimer had rebelled not realising that idealas last decision was irrevocable you have overpersuaded her he said no i answered i have convinced her and i shall convince you too he pleaded for her pathetically not for himself at all she has had so little joy he said using the very words that had occurred to me and i wanted to silence her i wanted to save her from her fate for she is une des cinq ou six creatures humaines qui naissent dans tout un sicle pour aimer la vrit et pour mourir sans avoir pu la faire aimer des autres she must suffer terribly if she goes on this was a point upon which we differed he would have given her the natural joys of a womanhusband home children friends and only such intellectual pursuits which are pleasant i had always hoped to see her at work in a wider field but she was one of those rare women who are born to fulfil both destinies at once and worthily if only circumstances had made it possible for her to combine the two before i had been with him many hours i began to be sensible of that difference of feeling on certain subjects which would have made their union a veritable linking of the past to the futurehis belief that nothing can be better than what has been and that the old institutions revised are all that the world wants and her faith in future developments of all good ideas and further discoveries never yet imagined for one thing lorrimer considered famine and war inevitable scourges of the human race necessary for the removal of the surplus population and useless to contend against because destined to recur so long as there is a human race but he would have limited intellectual pursuits for women because culture is held to prevent the trouble for which the elder expedients only provided a curea point upon which ideala did not agree with him at all nothing is more disastrous to social prosperity she held or more likely to add to the criminal classes than families which are too large for their parents to bring up and educate comfortably in their own station if the higher education of women is a natural check on overproduction of that kind then encourage it thankfully as a merciful dispensation of providence for the prevention of much misery i can see no reason in nature or ethics for a teeming population only brought into existence to be removed by famine and war why this old green ball of an earth would roll on just as merrily without any of us lorrimer wrote to her at last he had been obliged to acquiesce and i took ideala his letter but she womanlike though nothing would have altered her decision was not at first satisfied with his compliance it seemed to her too ready and that made her doubt if she might not have been to blame after all they wrote to each other once again and when she received his last letter she spoke to me about it he must have seen it as you do from the first for he has said no word to alter my determinationrather the contrary she told me we are not to meet again nor to correspond and doubtless it is a relief to him to have the matter settled in this way but one thing puzzles me in my last letter i bade him goodbye adding since that is what you wish and he has replied i never said i wished it will you remember that i do remember it and it comforts me but why i knew that lorrimer had said little in order to make her sacrifice as easy for her as possible and i was silent too for the same reason i thought if she felt herself to blame her pride would come to the rescue and make her loss appear rather inevitable than voluntary for say what we will we reconcile ourselves to the inevitable sooner than to those sorrows which we might have saved ourselves had we deemed it right you insinuated once that it was all my fault she said perhaps it wasif fault there be but if i tempted him it must have been generosity that made him yield to the temptation he pitied me and was ready to make me happy by devoting himself to me since that was what i seemed to require and i agree with you now i dont think we should either of us have found any real happiness in that way but oh how i long for him for his friendship for his companionship for his love it is hard hard hard if he does not miss me as i do him then i told her but he does and he did not yield to your decision until i had convinced him that he could never make you happy in such a position a great sigh of relief escaped her and then i saw that i ought to have been frank with her from the first it strengthened her to know that they still had something left to them in common though that something was only their grief i tried to comfort her by speaking of the many ways in which she might still find happiness she listened patiently until i was obliged to stop for want of words then she said this is all very well but you know you are talking nonsense what is the use of offering people everything but the one thing needful what i say to myself is well i have had my turn have been raised from the darkness of the clod and for a glorious moment seen the brightness of the skirts of god and i try to think i have no right to complain but still i am not better satisfied than the child that has eaten its cake and wants to have it too and i suppose there are many who would call me wretched and say that my life with my sorrowful marriagewhich was no marriage but a desecration of that holy state and a sinand my hopeless love is a broken life certainly i feel it so and yet i dont know with his nature it seems to me that some wrongdoing was inevitable do you think my suffering might be taken as expiation for his sins do you think we are allowed the happiness of bearing each others burdens in that way if we will if i were sure of that i should not fancy as i used to that i had a work to do in the world i should know that my work is done and that now i may rest ah the blessing of rest not long after this a cruel rumour reached us on good authority that lorrimer was engaged to be married i confess that my feeling about it was one of unmitigated contempt for the man and i trembled for the effect of the news upon ideala she made no sign however when first she heard it i was surprised and fear i showed that i was in spite of myself for she spoke about it you do not understand she said one event in his career is not of more consequence to me than another because all are of the greatest consequence but i have none of the doginthemanger spirit i think there must be something almost maternal in my feeling for him which is why it does not change were i less constant it would prove that my affection is of a lower kind less enduring because less pure i do not care to talk about him but i think of him always i think of him as i saw him last with the sun on him do you know his hair is like light gold with the sun on it sometimes the memory of him fades a little and i cannot recall his features and then i am tormented but of course he comes back to meso vividly that i have started often when i looked up and found myself alone the desire to be with him never lessens it burns in me always and is both a pain and a pleasure but my love is too great to be selfish his wishes for himself are my wishes and what is best for him is happiest for me am i never jealous jealous no do you not know that he is mine mine through every change neither time nor distance separates us really no common tie can keep him from me let him be bound as and to whomsoever he pleases his soul is mine and must return to me sooner or later i like him to be happy in any way that is right for i know that what he gives to others is not himself i was not fit for the dear earthly love but perhaps if i keep myself pure body and soul for him i shall be made worthy at last and of something better and my love is so great it would draw him in spite of himself but it will not be in spite of himself for he will find byandby that he cannot live with a smaller soul and then he will come to me do you not understand what i want his soulpurified strengthened ennoblednothing less will satisfy me and his mother might ask as much if i might be made the means of saving it then after a little pause she added ah how beautiful death is he will be glad as i should be now to meet it and yet more glad for then the end will have come for him but i should have still to wait the rumour of lorrimers engagement however proved to be false it was another lorrimer a cousin of his lorrimer is restored to your good graces now i suppose claudia said in her half sarcastic way when the mistake was explained i had not told her what was in my mind she had read my thoughts you think that a man whom ideala has loved should consider himself sacred she added i did not answer but i hold that all men who have felt or inspired great love will be sanctified by it if there be any true nobility in their nature and i knew that one man whom ideala did not love had been so sanctified by love for her and held himself sacred always but it was a relief to my mind to know that lorrimer was not unworthy he was a distinguished man then and i felt sure that he would become still more distinguished eventually he was not one of the many who come and go and are forgotten but one of those destined to live for ever in minds made better by their presence the good in his nature was certainly as far above the average as were his splendid abilities and ideala was right when she declared that she could answer for his principles it is impulse that is beyond calculation and for his own or anothers impulses no wise man will answer ideala continued to droop she will never get over it i said to claudia one day when we were alone together indeed she will claudia answered confidently out of the depth of your profound ignorance of natural history do you speak my brother i dread the reaction though when it comes she will be overwhelmed with shame but it will come all this is only a phase she is in a state of transition now it is her pride that makes her nurse her grief and will not let her give him up she cannot bear to think that she of all women in the world should have been the victim of anything so trivial as a passing fancy not that it would have been a passing fancy if they had not been separated but as it iswhy no fire can burn without fuel claudia had evidently changed her mind and she might be right but my own fear was that her first impression would be justified and that ideala would never be able to take a healthy interest in anything again i cannot care was her constant complaint nothing ever touches me either painfully or pleasurably nothing will ever make me glad again she said this one evening when she was sitting alone with claudia and myself and there was a long silence after she had finished speaking during which she sat in a dejected attitude her face buried in her hands all at once she looked up it is very strange she said but half that feeling seems to have gone with the expression of it i think claudia decided in her commonsense tone that you are nursing this unholy passion ideala you are afraid to give it up lest there should be nothing left to you can you not free your mind from the trammels of it and grasp something higher better and nobler can you not become mistress of yourself again and enter on a larger life which shall be full of lovenot the narrow selfish passion you are cherishing for one but that pure and holy love which only the best and such women as you may always be of the bestcan feel for all if you could but get the fumes of this evil feeling out of yourself you would see as we see what a common thing it is and you would recognise as we recognise that your very expression of it is just such as is given to it by every hysterical man or woman that has ever experienced it it is a physical condition caused by contact and kept up by your own perverse pleasure in itnothing more every one grows out of it in time and any one with proper selfcontrol could conquer it you are wavering yourself you see now that you have crystallised the feeling into words that it is a pitiful thing after all that the object is not worth such an expenditure of strengthcertainly not worth the sacrifice of your power to enjoy anything else such devotion to the memory of a dead husband has been thought grand by some although for my part i can see nothing grand in any form of self indulgence whether it be the indulgence of sorrow or joy which narrows our sphere of usefulness and causes us to neglect the claims of those who love us upon our affection and the claims of our fellow creatures generally upon our consideration but in your case it is simply claudia paused for want of a word you would say it is simply degrading ideala interposed i do not feel it so i glory in it i know said claudia pitilessly you all do and then she got up and laid her hand on idealas shoulder it is time she said earnestly it is time o passionate heart and morbid eye that old hysterical mockdisease should die chapter xxviii i hoped claudias plain speaking had made an impression but for a long time after that it seemed as if idealas interest in life had really ended that her sphere of usefulness had contracted and that she herself would become like the resta doer of unconnected trifles that have meaning only as the straws have meaning which show which way the current sets one cannot help thinking how many of these significant straws must go down to the ocean and be lost their little use unrecognised their little labour unavailing because it does so little good merely to know which way the stream is setting or what ocean will receive it at last if we have no power to profit by the knowledge at this time idealas own life was not unlike one of these hapless straws and it seemed a wretched failure of its early promise that ending as a straw on the common stream when so little might have made her influence in her own sphere like the river itself strong and beautiful those who loved her watched her in her trouble with eager hope that some good might yet come of it but the hope diminished always as the days wore on at first her mind had raged and stormed one could see it though she said so little her renunciation was perfect but nevertheless she could not reconcile herself to it she would not go back but she could not go on and so she remained midway between the past which was hateful to her and the future which was a blank raging at both but gradually the storm subsided and then came a period of calm but whether it was the calm of apathy or the calm of resignation it was hard to sayand meantime she lost her health again and became so fragile that my sister only expressed what i felt when she was speaking of her one day and said sadly her cheek is so waxenly thin as if deathward twere whitening in and the cloud of her flesh still more white were clearing till soul is in sight her large eyes too liquidly glister her mouth is too red have they kissed her the angels that bend down to pull our buds of the beautiful and whispered their own little sister we were anxious to take her abroad but she would not accompany us she talked of going alone but she did not go and after a time we gave up thinking about it then one day quite suddenly she said it is time this old hysterical mockdisease should die and she told us that she had at last decided to travelsomewhere nothing more definite than that for she said she had no fixed plans we concluded however that she meant to be away some time for she said something about perils of the deep and the uncertainty of life generally and she confided her private papers to my care telling me to look at them if they would interest me and make what use of them i pleased and that was how those from which i have gathered much of her story came into my possession and then she left us and for a whole year we heard nothing of hernot one word claudia chafed a little and complained as women will when things do not arrange themselves exactly as they would have ordered them but i was content to wait and because i expected nothing the time did not seem so long as perhaps it might have done we lived our usual lifepart of the year in one of the eastern counties and part in london and then we came north again it was winter weather frosty and clear and bright and i was tempted out a great deal taking long rides begun before sunset and ending by moonlight and generally alone and always when the world seemed most beautiful i thought of ideala and how she had loved its beauty mountain and plain flood and field forest and flower the snow and the sunshine and all the alternations of light and shade the wonders of form and the depth and harmony of colour the blue sky by day with its glories of sunrise and sunset the dark sky by night with its moonlight and starlightthe sky always that cloudland to which when we are wearied by the more monotonous earth we had only to lift our eyes and there the scene is changing for everthe skyand the sea in all its vague immensity would she ever see it again in the old way when she left us one might have said of her mental state o dark dark dark amid the blaze of noon irrecoverably dark total eclipse without all hope of day and where was she now and was she learning to see again i own i sometimes had the presumption to think that if she had stayed with us i might have helped her it seemed hardly credible that she should be able to stand alone at such a time not to speak of the strength required to take her out of herself and was not the loneliness itself an added misery she never could bear to be alone and i always thought the worst trial of her married life was the mental solitude to which it had reduced her by making her feel the necessity for reserve even with her best friends of course she had chosen to go alone it was quite her own doing but i could not help thinking uneasily at times that she would not have gone at all if she had not noticed how anxious we were about her and fancied she could relieve us of our trouble by relieving us of her presence that would have been so like ideala and then my thoughts would wander off recalling her numberless little deeds of love her perfect selflessness and all the depth and beauty of her great and tender nature as we do recall such things of one who has gone and will nevermore return as in the old days to make us glad there was the day i had seen her from the club window stoop to pick up a little ragged barefooted child that was crying in the street and wrap her furs about it and carry it off smiling and happy in her arms with no more thought of the attention such an action would attract than if she had been alone with her waif in the desert but many and many a time and in many a way she had made glad hearts by deeds like that and now where was she and was there never a one in the whole wide world to help her to bear her own sorrow and ease her pain one evening in particular i had been more than usually tormented by such thoughts i had been blaming myself bitterly for having allowed her to go away alone and when i rode up to my own door i was conscious of a halfformed resolution to follow her without delay and bring her back claudia was standing on the steps in the crisp fresh evening air apparently watching for me she put her arms round my neck when i alighted and kissed me has she written i exclaimed for claudia was not demonstrative and this meant something she is here was the answer my heart gave a great leap but i could not ask if it were well with her i could only look at claudia and wonder if it were the moonlight that made the expression of her face so singularly content and sweet i went into the lighted house and being somewhat dazed and altogether too eager to see her at once i dressed for the evening leisurely and then i went to find her there was a change in the house already it was lighted from top to bottom as befits a time of rejoicing and our other guests whom i passed in my search seemed gayeror i fancied so she was not among them but i took the liberty of going to her rooms and knocked at the sittingroom door and entered she rose to receive me stretching out her hands and my first impression was that she had grown afterwards i understood that it was a change in the fashion of her dress that made it appear so she wore a long robe exquisitely draped which was loose but yet clung to her and fell in rich folds about her with a grace that satisfied i cannot describe the fashion of this robe or the form but i have seen one like it somewhereit must have been in a picture or on a statue of a grand heroic woman or a saint and it suggested something womanly and strong but not to be defined it was ideala herselfnot as she had been but as i always hoped she would be and felt she might she showed the change in every gesture but most of all in her clear and steady eyes which made you feel she had a purpose now and a future yet before her she looked as women look when they know themselves entrusted with a work and have the courage and resolution to be true and worthy of their trust she was very gracious but somehow in the first moment of our meeting i felt abashedabashed before this woman who had gone down to the verge of dishonour but whose goodness with the vitality of all goodness had raised her again above the best whose trouble had been to her because of this goodness as is a painful operation which must be gone through if the patient would ever be strong i fancy she thought me cold because my great respect made me shy and i hesitated to show her all the joy i felt wont you kiss me once after my long long voyage she said holding up her face like a child to be kissed and it made me inexpressibly glad to perceive that while gaining in dignity and purpose her character had lost none of the childlike faith and affection which had been one of the greatest charms of the old ideala i could not help examining her curiously looking for traces of a conflict for those lines of suffering which are generally left by fierce mental troubles like scars after a battle showing that the fight has been no childs play but a struggle for life or death such a conflict there must have been but all trace of it was swept away by the wonderful peace that had succeeded it ideala looked younger certainly but the change showed itself most in her perfect serenity and in the steadfast earnestness of her wonderful eyes but i had no time to talk to her for claudia in diamonds and velvet and laceher donning of which is her one way of expressing a satisfaction too deep for wordsblazed in upon us if it had occurred so her she would certainly have had the bells of the parish rung provided my authority as lay rector could have accomplished such an extravagance she took us away with her now to join our other guests and when dinner was announced i offered ideala my arm she was silent as we went but looked about her with a grave little smile on her lips renewing her acquaintance with familiar objects and noting every change and so busy was she with her own reflections so thoroughly absorbed that when we were seated at table she put her serviette beside her plate and her bread on her lap mechanically and took up her knife and fork to eat her soup she seemed puzzled for a moment when she found that the implements did not answer and then she laughed such a fresh girlish laugh it did ones heart good to hear her yes verily ideala was herself again absentmindedness and all and before dinner was over a wonderful thing had happened for whereas we had hitherto been the most commonplace and prosaic party imaginable getting along smoothly taking no particular interest in each other or in anything else and only remarkable for a degree of dulness which would have astonished us by its bulk could it have been weighed and measuredtonight for no apparent reason we suddenly woke up and astounded ourselves by more originality than we had been accustomed to believe was left in the world altogetherwhile something put into our conversation just the right amount of polite friction to act as a counterirritant so that when we left the table each felt that he had been at his besthad been brilliant in fact and shone with lustre enough to make any man happy once in a london theatre i saw an actress walk across the stage she did not utter a word she never looked at the audience she was apparently unconscious of everything but what she had in her own mind yet before she was half across the stage the people rose to their feet with a roar idealas coming amongst us had produced some such startling effect but her power was altogether occult the audience knew what the actress meant but we did not understand ideala and yet we applauded by laying our best before her and acknowledged the charm of her presence in every word she spoke very little however indeed i remember nothing she said until we went to the drawingroom on the way thither claudia had picked up a crumpled paper and glancing at it had exclaimedwhy ideala here are some of your verses do you still write verses it was curious that we all spoke as if she had been away for years yes she answered tranquilly and claudia coolly proceeded to read the verses aloud a difficult task as they were scribbled in pencil on half a sheet of notepaper and were scarcely decipherable ideala meanwhile listened with calm eyes fixed on vacancy like one trying to be polite but finding it hard for lack of interest by arno when the tale was oer at sunset as in days of yore i wandered forth and dreamed the sky above the town below the solemn rivers silent flow the ancient storyhaunts i know in varied colours gleamed by arno calm my steps i stayed just where the rivers bank displayed a tangled growth of weeds tall houses near and on the right an arched bridge upreared its height and boats drew near and passed from sight i heard the tramp of steeds i heard and saw but heeded not my feet were rooted to the spot a fancy checked my breath twas here that tito lay i knew his fair face upward to the blue his velvet tunic soaking through most beautiful in death but baldassarre was not there twas i that stooped to kiss the hair besprent with ooze and dew ah god light gold the locks caressed i saw no greek in velvet dressed but wildly to my bosom pressed not tito love but you the massive godlike head and throat belonged not to those days remote the fine grey eyethe limb it was the soul i know so well so full of earth and heaven and hell that came from out that time to dwell in you and make you him and i the victim of your smiles and i the victim of your wiles my vengeance shall prevail the river time shall float you nigh and earth and hell your soul shall fly and only heaven remain when i the deed triumphant hail it surprised me to find that claudia could read those verses to the end their importto me at leastwas so obvious but ideala continued unmoved and when the little buzz of friendly criticism had subsided she remarked with unimpassioned directness i am quite sure that all my verses are rubbish but nevertheless they delight me i should feel dumb without the power to make verses it is a means of expression that satisfies when nothing else will i always carry my last about in my pocket i know them by heart of course but still it is a pleasure to read them and so it continues until i write some more and then i immediately perceive that the old ones are bad and i destroy themwhen i remember those were condemned ages ago so please oblige me claudia by putting them into the fire claudia was about to obey but i interposed i had a fancy for keeping those verses they are rubbishy if you will but the sentiment which struggles to find expression in them is far from despicable no one smoked that evening no one played billiards no one cared for music we just sat round the fire in a circle and talked and where have you come from ideala was the first question from china she answered there was a general exclamation i have been with the missionaries in china she added oh isnt it very strange the life in china some one asked it looks different she said but its feels like our own to begin with one is struck by the strange appearance of the people and the quaint humour of their art but when the first effect wears off and you learn to know them you find after all that theirs is the same human nature only in another garb the familiar old tune as it were with a new set of variations the like in unlikeness is common enough but still the finding of a remarkable similarity in things apparently unlike continues to surprise us but ideala you cannot compare the chinese to ourselves think of the state of degradation the people are in every crime is rife among them infanticide is quite common yes said ideala as if it were the most natural thing in the world yes doubtless the lower classes in china kill their children here in certain districts they insure them ideala concluded gravely but then said claudiaoh ideala i dont think you can establish your parallel we all know the sort of a life a chinese lady leads when the lady is not at the head of her house it is certainly vacuous ideala agreed like the lives of our own ladies when they are not forced to do anything why at scarborough this year they had to take to changing their dresses four times a day so you can imagine how they languish for want of occupation well at all events english girls are not sold into a hateful form of slavery some one observed contentedly are they not ideala rejoined with a flash i can assure you that both women and men fathers husbands and brothers of the same class in england do sell their young girlsand i can prove it we have the pull over them in the matter of marriage then we dont give our daughters away against their will as they do that is not a fair way of putting it a chinese girl expects to be so disposed of and accepts the arrangement as a matter of course and the system has its advantages the girl has no illusions to be shattered she expects no new happiness in her married life so that any that comes to her is clear gain as to our daughters inclinations not being forced i suppose they are not exactly but have you never been conscious of the tender pressure that is brought to bear when a desirable suitor offers have you never seen a girl who wont marry when she is wanted to wincing from covert stabs mourning over cold looks and made to feel outside everythingsuffering a small martyrdom under the general displeasure of all for whom she cares her world without whose love life is a burden to her whom she believes to know best about everything as mrs bread said about madame de cintre she is a delicate creature and they make her feel wickedand she ends by thinking any sacrifice light at the moment if only it wins her back the affection and esteem of her friends ideala had been carried away by her earnestness and now she stopped abruptly somewhat disconcerted to find every one listening to her the ladies sat with their eyes on the floor the gentlemen exchanged glances but no one spoke for some time at last my sister made a move and the spell was broken we separated for the night and many were the ladylike whispers that reached my ears all ending in so like ideala but as ideala herself remarked on another occasion you cant sweep a room that requires it without raising a dust the thing is to let the dust settle again and then remove it chapter xxix claudia did not see the change in ideala all at once she said she is looking her best and is our own ideala againfaults and all how she talked last night just in the old way i agreed but with a difference for in the old days she talked at random but now i feel sure she has a plan and a purpose and all that she says is part of it this suggested new possibilities to claudia and when ideala joined us presently she asked abruptly are you going back to china ideala answered deliberately i did think of becoming a missionarythat was why i went out there but i know all radical reforms take time and when i saw what the chinese women were doing for themselves and compared their state with our own it seemed to me that there was work in plenty to be done at home and so i returned certainly the chinese women of the day bind their feet when a girl is seven or eight years old her mother binds them for her and everybody approves if the mother did otherwise the girl herself would be the first to reproach her when she grew up it is wonderful how they endure the torture but public opinion has sanctioned the custom for centuries and made it as much a duty for a chinese woman to have small feet as it is for us to wear clothes and yet they do a wonderful thing when they are taught how wrong the practice is how it cripples them and weakens them and renders them unfit for their work in the world they take off their bandages think of that and remember that they are timid and sensitive in a womanly way to a degree that is painful when i learnt that and when i remembered that my countrywomen bind every organ in their bodies though they know the harm of it and public opinion is against it i did not feel that i had time to stay and teach the heathen it seemed to me that there was work enough left yet to do at home but ideala claudia protested what is the use of drawing degrading comparisons between ourselves and other nations you gave great offence last night i said more than i intended she answered i always do it was tourgenieff was it not who said that the age of talkers must precede the age of practical reformers i seem to have been born in the age of talkers but i shall not say much more last night i did not really intend to say anything you led me on but i do want to make their hearts burn within them and if i succeed then i shall not care about the offence an englishwoman is nothing if she is not patriotic she will not bear the humiliation if she is made to see that she is really no better with all her opportunities than a much despised chinese she would not like the contempt the women of that nation feel for her if she were made to acknowledge the truththat she deserved it and so much depends on our women now there are plenty of people you know who believe that no nation can get beyond a certain point of prosperity and that when it reaches that point it cannot stay there but must begin to go down again and they say that the english nation has now reached its extreme point they compare it with rome in the days which immediately preceded her decline and fallwhen men ceased to be brave and selfdenying and became idle luxurious and effeminate and women traded on their weakness and made light of their evil deeds it is a question of the sanctity of marriage now as it was in the days of the decline of rome de quincey traces her fall to the loosening of the marriage tie he says that few indeed if any were the obligations in a proper sense moral which pressed upon the roman the main fountains of moral obligation had in rome by law or custom been thoroughly poisoned marriage had corrupted itself through the facility of divorce and through the consequences of that facility viz levity in choosing and fickleness in adhering to the choice into so exquisite a traffic of selfishness that it could not yield so much as a phantom model of sanctity the relation of husband and wife had for all moral impressions perished amongst the romans and although it is not quite so bad with ourselves at present that is what it is coming to but there are two sides to every question and the one which we must by no means lose sight of just now is not that which shows the respects in which we resemble the romans so much as the one which shows the respects in which we differ from them it is therein that our hope lies and we differ from them in two important respects we differ from them in the matter of experience and in the use we are disposed to make of our experiences we are beginning to know the rocks upon which they split and we shall soon be making use of our knowledge to steer clear of them but there is another respect in which we differ from all the older nations not even excepting the jewish i mean morality we have the grandest and purest ideal of morality that was ever preached upon earth and if we do but practise it there is no doubt that the promise will be fulfilled and our days as a nation will be prolonged with rejoicing the future of the race has come to be a question of morality and a question of health perhaps i should reverse it and say a question of health and morality since the latter is so dependent on the former we want grander minds and we must have grander bodies to contain them and it all rests with us women to us is confided the care of the little onesof the young bodies and the young minds yet unformed ours will be the joy of success or the shame of failure and we should fit ourselves for the task both morally and physically by the practice of every virtue and by every art known to the science and skill of man englishwomen could not sit still and know that their lovely homes will be wrecked eventually and left desolate that this country of theirs will become a wilderness of ruin such as egypt is but rank and overgrown its beauty of sweet grass and stately trees and all its rich luxuriance of flowers and fruits and foliage plants only accentuating the ruinbearing witness to the neglect no our greatness shall not depart the decay may have begun but it shall be arrested i am not afraid but if it is the fate of nations ideala i propose to conquer fate said ideala fate itself is no match for one woman with a will let alone for thousands when horrid war is threatened men flock to fight for their country and they volunteer for every other arduous duty to be done do you think women are less brave no when they realise the truth they will fight for it they will fly to arms they will use the weapons with which nature has provided them love constancy selfsacrifice their intellectual strength and will and so they will save the nation claudia the unimaginative sat silent and perplexed i would join she said at last if i were quite sureoh ideala it is not a sort of womans rights business and all that you are going in for is it a woman can do good in her own sphere only ideala laughed but her own sphere is such a very indefinite phrase she observed it is nonsense really a woman may do anything which she can do in a womanly way they say that our brains are lighter and that therefore we must not be taught too much but why not educate us to the limit of our capacity and leave it there why if we are inferior should there be any fear of making us superior we must stop when we cannot go any further and all this oldwomanish cackle on the subject the everlasting trying to prove what is already said to be provedthe looking for the square in space after laying it down as a law that only the circle existsis a curious way of showing us how to control the exuberance of our own verbosity they say we shall not be content when we get what we want and there they are right for as soon as our own higher education is secure we shall begin to clamour for the higher education of men for the prayer of every woman worth the name is not make me superior to my husband but lord make my husband superior to me is there any more pitiful position in the world than that of a rightminded woman who is her husbands superior and knows it there is in every educated and refined woman an inborn desire to submit and she must do violence to what is best in herself when she cannot you know what the history of such marriages is the girl has been taught to expect to find a guide philosopher and friend in her husband he is to be head of the house and lord of her life and liberty sole arbiter on all occasions it is right and convenient to have him so the world requires him to fill that position and the wife prefers that he should but the probabilities are about equal that he being morally her inferior will not be fit for it and that therefore she will find herself in a false position there will then be an interval of intense misery for the wife her education and prejudices will make her try to submit at first to what her sense knows to be impossible but eventually she is forced out of her unnatural position by circumstances to save her house and family she must rebel take the reins of government into her own hands and face life a disappointed and lonely woman heaven help her said claudia one knows that the future of a woman in that state of mind is only a question of circumstance and temperament she may rise but ideala looked up quickly but she may fall you were going to say yes but you know if she does it is her own fault she must know better she may not be quite mistress of herself at the timeshe may be fascinated she may be led on i interposed quickly claudia seemed to have forgotten but one thing is certain if she has any real good in her she will always stop before it is too late i think said claudia it would be better after all if women were taught to expect to find themselves their husbands equalsthe disappointment would not be so great if the husband proved inferior but when a woman has been led to look for so much her imagination is full of dreams in which he figures as an infallible being she expects him to be her refuge support and comfort at all times and when a man has such a height to fall from in any ones estimation there can be but little of him left if he does fall ideala sighed and after a short pause she said i have been wondering what makes it possible for a woman to love a man not the flesh that she sees and can touch though that may attract her as the colour of the flower attracts it must be the mind that is in himthe scent of the flower as it were if she finds eventually that his mind is corrupt she must shrink from it as from any other form of corruption and finally abandon him on account of it as she would abandon the flower if she found its odour fetidindeed she has already abandoned her husband when she acknowledges that he is not what she thought him she paused a moment and then went on passionately i cannot tell you what it wasthe battling day by day with a power that was irresistible because it had to put forth no strength to accomplish its work it simply was itself and by being itself it lowered me i cannot tell you what it was to feel myself going down and not to be able to help it try as i would to feel the gradual change in my mind as it grew to harbour thoughts which were reflections of his thoughts low thoughts and to be filled with ideas recollections of his conversations which had caused me infinite disgust at the time but remained with me like the taste of a nauseous drug until i almost acquired a morbid liking for them oh if i could save other women from that claudia hastily interposed to divert her that is a good idea the higher education of men she said i dont know whether they have abandoned hope or whether they think themselves already perfect certain it is the idea of improving themselves does not seem to occur to them often and we want good men in society if the clergy and priests are good it is only what is required of them what everybody expects and therefore their goodness is accepted as a matter of course and is viewed as indifferently as other matters of course one good man in society has more effect as an example than ten priests but you have not told us what you propose to do ideala i said i hope it is nothing unwomanly claudia interposed anxiously ideala looked at her and laughed and claudia laughed too the moment after she had spoken the fear of ideala doing anything unwomanly was absurd even to herself an unwomanly woman is such a dreadful creature claudia added apologetically yes said ideala but you should pity her in nine cases out of ten there is a great wrong or a great grief at the bottom of all her unwomanlinessperhaps both and if she shrieks you may be sure that she is suffering ease her pain and she will be quiet enough the average woman who is happy in her marriage does not care to know more of the world than she can learn in her own nursery nor to see more of it as a rule than she can see from her own garden gate she is a great power but unfortunately there is so very little of her what i want to do is to make women discontentedyou have heard of a noble spirit of discontent i thought for a long time that everything had been done that could be done to make the world better but now i see that there is still one thing more to be tried women have never yet united to use their influence steadily and all together against that of which they disapprove they work too much for themselves each trying to make their own life happier they have yet to learn to take a wider view of things and to be shown that the only way to gain their end is by working for everybody else with intent to make the whole world better which means happier and in order to accomplish this they must be taught that they have only to will iteach in her own family and amongst her own friends that after having agreed with the rest about what they mean to put down they have only to go home and use their influence to that end quietly consistently and without wavering and the thing will be done our influence is like those strong currents which run beneath the surface of the ocean without disturbing it and yet with irresistible force and at a rate that may be calculated it is to help in the direction of that force that i am going to devote my life do not imagine she went on hurriedly that i think myself fit for such a work i have had conscientious scruples been sorely troubled about my own unworthiness which seemed to unfit me for any good work but now i see things differently one may be made an instrument for good without merit of ones own so long as we do not deceive ourselves by thinking we are worthy and so long as we are trying our best to become so i think we may hope i think we may even know that we shall eventually she stopped and looked at me be made worthy said claudia kissing her and if it were not so ideala if everybody had to begin by being as good themselves as they want others to be there would be no good workers left in the world at all at this moment a noisy party burst in upon our grave debate and carried ideala off for a ride we saw them leave the house and watched them ride away until the last glimpse of them was veiled by the misty brightness of the frosty air and the morning sunshine how well she looks claudia exclaimed better than any of them she has quite recovered and is none the worse i do not know about recovery i answered dubiously she will never but claudia interrupted hotly i know what you are going to say and i do wish you would leave off speaking of ideala in that way any one to hear you would suppose she had committed a sin and you know quite well that that was not the case if she acted without common prudenceand i will not deny that she didit was entirely your own fault she has never been intimate with any man but yourself and you have made her believe that all men are like you how could she harbour suspicion when she did not know what to suspect of course she saw everything wrongly and awry the old life had become impossible to her and she nearly made a mistake as to what the new one should be that was all i know she wavered for a moment but the weakness was more physical than moral i think her vision was clouded at the time but as soon as she was restored to health she saw things clearly enough she is a great and good woman purehearted and full of charity god bless her for all her tenderness and for her wonderful power to love he alone can count the number who have reason to wish her well that is true i answered and i was merely going to remark when you interrupted me that she will never think herself none the worse i dont see what difference that makes claudia again interposed she always did think herself least of the least when she thought of herself at all and that was not often you are dwelling too long on the past really and making too much of it men when they are saints are twice as bad as women i pointed out to my sister something confusing in her way of expressing the fact but my kindness seemed to exasperate her you know what i mean quite well she said tartly yes i know i rejoined but i wanted to help you to make yourself intelligible to other people claudia made a gesture of impatience but laughed and left me and i remained for a long time thinking over all that ideala had said and also thinking of her as she looked at the time and the subject was so inspiring that although my strong point is landscape in an ambitious mood i began to paint an allegorical picture of her as a mother nursing the infant goodness of the race she saw it when it was nearly finished but did not recognise herself and exclaimed what a gaunt creature and that baby weighs at least twelve stone the picture was never finished chapter xxx we soon found that ideala having at last put her hand to the plough worked with a will and although she was true to her principle that a womans best work is done beneath the surface i think her own labours will eventually make themselves felt with a good result in the world but the life she has chosen for herself is martyrdom and her womanly shrinking from the suffering she would alleviate is never lessened by use yet she does not waver other women admire her devotion and follow in her footsteps they do not doubt but that she has chosen the better part but i fancy that most men who have seen her draw the little children about her and forget everything for a moment but her delight in them have felt that there must be something wrong in the world when such a woman misses her vocation and has to scatter her love to the four winds of heaven for want of an object upon which to concentrate it in all its strength i do not know if her feeling for lorrimer has changed my sister declares in her positive way that of course it has completely but my sister is not always right ideala has never mentioned his name since she returned to us nor given us any other clue by which we could judge only on one occasion when some allusion was made to the course she had intended to pursue in the past she exclaimed oh how could i and covered her face with her hands from where i sit just now i can see her walking up the avenue she is as straight as an arrow younglooking and fresh her step is firm and light and elastic and she moves with an easy grace only possible when every muscle is unconstrained her dress is a work of art light in weight but rich in colour and texture what a beautiful woman i think involuntarily i see her daily and pay her that tribute every time we meet for age cannot wither her nor custom stale her infinite variety her intellect and selflessness preserve her youth she is changed certainly she has arisen and can return no more to the lower walks to the old purposeless life and desultory ways but yet she is the same ideala and holds you always expectantyou who see beneath the surface the world will call her cold and selfcontained till the end and so she is and will bea snowcrowned volcano with wonderful force of fire working within and she will not stop where she is there is something yet to comesome further developmentsomething more something beyond and she makes you feel that there is what she says of other women is true of herself do not stand in their way she begs do not hinder themabove all do not stop them they are running water if you check them they stagnate and you must suffer yourself from their noisome exhalations for the moral nature is like water it must have movement and air and sunshine to stay corruption and keep it sweet and wholesome and its movement is good works its air faith in their efficiency its sunshine the evidence of this and hope comparative anatomists have proved that the human brain from its first appearance as a semifluid and shapeless mass passes in succession through the several structures that constitute the permanent and perfect brains of fishes reptiles birds and mammalia but ultimately it passes beyond them all and acquires a marvellous development of its own and so it is with the human soul it must rise through analogous stages and add to its own strength and beauty by daily bread of love and thought growing to greatness by help of these aliments only and reaching ultimately to such perfection as we cannot divine for the end is not here but we might reach it sooner than we do were it not for our own impatience growth is so exquisitely minute it bursts upon us an accomplished fact we know this and yet we would see the process and not seeing it we lose faith waver hesitate stop and recoila going back pour mieux sauter it is with the choicer spirit but we all are deficient in hope all have our retrograde moments of despair we do not look about us enough to see what is being done for others how they are progressing by what strange paths they are led we keep our eyes on our own ground too much and because we will not compare cheerfully we think our own way the roughest our own journey the longestif there be any end to it at all yet all the time we might see the end if only we would look up and we need never despair and lag need never be cold and comfortless if we would but love and remember for while the tired waves vainly breaking seem here no painful inch to gain far out through creeks and inlets making comes silent flooding in the main ideala raises her eyes to mine now and smiles as she passes beneath my window another womana woman whom claudia had long refused to knowis leaning on her arm talking to her earnestly and that is idealas attitude always she gathers the useless units of society about her and makes them worthy women there is no kind of sorrow for which she has not found comfort no folly she has not been successful in checking no vice she has not managed to cure and no form of despair which she has not relieved with hope her own experiences have taught her to sympathise with every phase of feeling and be lenient to every shortcoming and excess wherever she is you may be sure that another woman is there alsosome one with a sorrowful history probably and you may be equally sure that she is leaning on ideala god bless her
