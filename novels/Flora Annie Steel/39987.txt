debt of honour the village legacy the flower of forgiveness surely this is very rare i remarked as looking through a herbarium of himalayan plants belonging to a friend of mine i came upon a small anemone which contrary to the custom of that most delicate of flowers had preserved its colour in all its first freshness indeed the scarlet petals each bearing a distinct heart shaped blotch of white in the centre could scarcely have glowed more brilliantly in life than they did in death very rare returned the owner after a pause i have reason to believe it unique so far as collections go at any rate i see you have called it remissionensis what induced you to give it such an odd name he smiled dog latin i acknowledge as for the reason can you not guess well i replied looking closer at the white and red flowers i have not your vivid imagination but i presume it was in allusion to sins as scarlet and hearts white as wool ah it was found i see near the cave of amar nath that accounts for the connection of ideas no doubt he said quietly that accounts for the connection in a measure not entirely the fact is a very odd story the oddest story i ever came into personally is connected with that flower you remember taylor surgeon of the st who died of pyaemia contracted in some of his cholera experiments well just after i joined we chummed together in cashmere where he was making the herbarium at which you have been looking he was a most charming companion for a youngster eager to understand something of a new life for without exception he knew more of native thought and feeling than any other man i ever met he had a sort of intuition about it yet at the same time he was curiously unsympathetic and seemed to look upon it merely as a field for research and nothing more he used to talk to every man he met on the road and in this way managed to acquire an extraordinary amount of information utterly undreamed of by most englishmen for instance his first acquaintance with the existence of this anemone grew out of a chance conversation with an old ruffian besmeared with filth from head to foot and it was his consequent desire to add the rarity to his collection joined to my fancy for seeing a real pilgrimage which brought us to islamabad about the end of july about the time that is to say of the annual festival the sacred spring where the pilgrimage is inaugurated by a solemn feeding of the holy fish is some way from the town so we pitched our tents under a plane tree close to the temples in order to see the whole show and a queer show it was brummagem umbrellas stuck like mushrooms over green stretches of grass and giving shelter to a motley crew jogis or wandering mendicants meditating on the mystic word om and thereafter lighting sacred fires with swedish taendstickors government clerks bereft of raiment forgetting reports and averages in a return to primitive humanity taylor never tired of pointing out these strange contrasts and over his evening pipe read me many a long lecture on the putting of new wine into old bottles for myself it interested me immensely i liked to think of the young men and maidens the weary workers and the hoary old sinners all journeying in faith hope and charity or the want of it to the cave of amar nath in order to get the great ledger of life settled up to date and so to return scot free to the world the flesh and the devil in order to begin the old round all over again i liked to think that crime sufficient to drag half hindostan to the nethermost pit had been made over to those white gypsum cliffs and that still summer after summer the wind flowers sprang from the crannies and the forget me nots with their message of warning came to carpet the way for those eager feet seeking the impossible i liked to see all the strange perversities and pieties displayed by the jogis and gosains it was from one of the latter a horrid old ruffian so ridiculously like il re galant 'uomo that we nicknamed him victor emanuel on the spot that taylor had first heard of the flower of forgiveness as the man styled it he and the doctor grew quite hot over the possible remission of sins but the subsequent gift of one rupee sterling sent him away asseverating that none could filch from him the first fruits of pilgrimage namely the opportunity of meeting a protector of the poor so virtuous so generous so full of the hoarded wisdom of ages i recognised the old humbug in the crowd as we made our way to a sort of latticed gallery belonging to the maharajah's guest house which gave on the tank where the fish are fed he salaamed profoundly and with a grin expressed his delight that after all the great doctor sahib should be seeking forgiveness 'i seek the flower only pious one' replied taylor with a shrug of the shoulders 'perhaps 'tis the same thing' replied victor emanuel with another salaam the square tank was edged by humanity in the white and saffron robes of pilgrimage brimming up to the stone step worn smooth by generations of sinners the waters of the spring lapped lazily stirred by the myriads of small fish which in their eagerness for the coming feast flashed hither and thither like meteors to gather in radiating stars round the least speck on the surface sometimes in their haste rising in scaly mounds above the water the blare of a conch and a clanging of discordant bells made all eyes turn to the platform in front of the temple where the attendant brahmans stood with high heaped baskets of grain awaiting the sacrificial words about to be spoken by an old man who with one foot on the bank spread his arms skywards an old man of insignificant height but with an indescribable dignity on which i remarked to my companion 'it is indescribable' he assented 'because it is compounded of factors not only wide as the poles asunder from you and me but also from each other pride of twice born trebly distilled ancestry bringing a conviction of inherited worthiness pride in hardly acquired devotion giving birth to a sense of personal frailty that is the brahman whom we lump into a third class railway carriage with the ruck of humanity and then wonder hush he is going to begin' 'thou art light thou art immortal life' the voice with a tremor of emotion in it pierced the stillness for a second before it was shattered by a hoarse strident cry 'silence' taylor leaned forward suddenly interested 'you're in luck' he whispered 'i believe there is going to be a row of some sort' once more the cry rose harsher than before 'silence sukya thou art impure' a stir in the crowd and a visible straightening of the old man's back were the only results 'thou art the holiest sacrifice we adore thee adorable sun' 'silence' this time the interruption took shape in a jogi who forcing his way through the dense ranks emerged on the platform to stand pointing with denunciatory finger at the old brahman naked save for the cable of grass round his loins and the smearing of white ashes with hair lime bleached and plaited with hemp into a sort of chignon no more ghastly figure could be conceived the crowd however hailed him with evident respect while a murmur of 'gopi 'tis gopi the bikshu religious beggar' passed from mouth to mouth this reception seemed to rouse the old man's wrath for after one scornful glance at the new comer he was about to continue his invocation to the sun when the jogi striding forward flourished his mendicant's staff so close to the other's face that he perforce fell back before the crowd had grasped the deadly earnest of the scene a lad of about sixteen clad in the black antelope skin which marks a religious disciple had leaped quivering with rage between the old man and his assailant 'by george' muttered taylor 'what a splendid young fellow' he was indeed extraordinarily fair even for the fairest race in india he might have served as model for a young perseus as he stood there the antelope skin falling from his right shoulder leaving the sacred cord of the brahman visible on his left while his smooth round limbs showed in all their naked vigorous young beauty 'stand off amra who bade thee interfere' cried the old man sternly the bond between them was manifest by the alacrity with which the boy obeyed the command for to the spiritual master implicit obedience is due at the same moment the chief priest of the shrine alarmed at an incident which might interfere with the expected almsgiving hurried forward luckily the crowd kept the silence which characterises gregarious humanity in the east so we could follow what was said 'wilt remove yonder drunken fanatic or shall the worship of the shining ones be profaned' asked the old brahman savagely and at a sign from their chief the attendants stepped forward but the jogi facing the crowd appealed direct to that fear of defilement which haunts the hindu's heart 'impure impure touch him not hear him not look not on him' the vast concourse swayed and stirred as with a confident air the jogi turned to the chief priest 'these twelve years agone o mohunt ji' thou knowest gopi gopi the bikshu since for twelve years i have been led hither by the spirit seeking speech and finding silence but now speech is given by the same spirit that man sukya anchorite of setanagar is unclean false to his race to his vows to the shining ones i gopi the bikshu will prove it' once again a murmur rose like the wind presaging a storm and as the crowd surged closer to the temple a young girl in the saffron drapery of a pilgrim took advantage of the movement to make her way to the platform with the evident intention of pressing to the old man's side but she was arrested by the young perseus who with firm hands clasping hers whispered something in her ear she smiled up at him and so they stood hand in hand eager but confident as the brahman's voice clear with certainty dominated the confusion 'ay prove it prove that i sukya taught of the great swami twice born brahman faithful disciple blameless householder and pious anchorite in due turn as the faith demands have failed once in the law without repentance and atonement lo i swear by the shining ones that i stand before ye to day body and soul holy to the uttermost' 'god gie us a gude conceit o' oursels' muttered taylor the remark jarred on me painfully for the spiritual exaltation in the man's face had nothing personal in it nothing more selfish than the rapt confidence which glorified the young disciple's whole bearing as he gazed on his master with the sort of blind adoration one sees in the eyes of a dog 'think i am sukya' went on the high pitched voice 'would sukya come between his brethren and the shining ones i chosen for the oblation by reason of virtue and learning i sukya journeying to holy amar nath not for my own sake for i fear no judgment but for the sake of the disciple yonder boy amra betrothed to the daughter of my daughter and vowed to the pilgrimage from birth' a yell of crackling laughter came from the jogi as he leapt to the bastion of the bathing place and so raised within sight of all struck an attitude of indignant appeal 'when was an outcast vowed to pilgrimage and by my jogi's vow i swear the boy amra disciple of sukya to be an outcast a sudra of sudras seeing that his mother being twice born defiled her race with scum from beyond the seas' 'by george' muttered taylor again 'this is getting lively for the scum' 'perhaps the presence is becoming tired of this vulgar scene' suggested an obsequious chuprassi who had been devoted to our service by order of the cashmere officials but the presences were deeply interested for all that i should not care to witness such a sight again the attention of the crowd centred a moment before on the jogi was turned now on the boy who stood absolutely alone the girl moved by the unreasoning habit of race having dropped his hand at the first word and crept to her grandfather's side i can see that young face still awful in its terror piteous in its entreaty 'thou liest gopi' cried the brahman gasping with passion and at the words a gleam of hope crept to those hunted eyes 'prove it i say for i appeal to the shining ones whom i have served' 'i accept the challenge' yelled the jogi with frantic gestures while a perfect roar of assent cries of devotion and prayers for guidance rose from the crowd taylor looked round at me quickly 'you are in luck there is going to be a miracle i saw that gopi at hurdwar once he is a rare hand at them' he must have understood my resentment at being thus recalled to the nineteenth century for he added half to himself ''tis tragedy for all that to the boy' an appeal for silence enabled us to hear that both parties had agreed to refer the question of birth to the sacred cord with which every male of the three twice born castes is invested if the strands were of the pure cotton ordained by ritual to the brahman the boy should be held of pure blood but the admixture of anything pointing to the despised sudra would make him anathema maranatha and render his master impure and therefore unfit to lead the devotions of others i cannot attempt to describe the scene which followed for even now the confusion inseparable from finding yourself in surroundings which require explanation before they can fall into their appointed place in the picture prevents me from remembering anything in detail anything but a surging sea of saffron and white a babel of wild cries 'hurri gunga ji dhurm dhurm' hurri ganges the faith the faith then suddenly a roar 'gopi a miracle a miracle praise be to the shining ones' it seemed but a moment ere the enthusiastic crowd had swept the jogi from his pedestal and crowned with jasmin chaplets he was being borne high on men's shoulders to make a round of the various temples while the keepers of the shrine swelled the tumult judiciously by cries of 'oblations offerings the shining ones are present to day' in my excitement at the scene itself i had forgotten its cause and was regretting the all too sudden ending of the spectacle when taylor touched me on the arm 'the tragedy is about to begin look' following his eyes i saw indeed tragedy enough to make me forget what had gone before yet i knew well that i did not could not fathom its depth or measure its breadth still in a dim way i realised that the boy standing as if turned to stone had passed in those few moments from life as surely as if a physical death had struck him down that he might indeed have been less forlorn had such been the case since some one for their own sakes might then have given him six feet of earth and now even a cup of water that last refuge of cold charity was denied to him for ever save from hands whose touch was to his brahmanised soul worse than death for him there was no future for the old man who burdened by the weeping girl stood opposite him there was no past nothing but a hell of defilement of daily hourly impurity for twelve long years the thought was damnation 'come premi come' he muttered turning suddenly to leave the platform 'this is no place for us now quick we must cleanse ourselves from deadly sin from deadly deadly sin' they had reached the steps leading down to the tank when the boy with a sob like that of a wounded animal flung himself in agonised entreaty at his master's feet 'oh cleanse me even me also oh my father' the old man shrank back instinctively yet there was no anger only a merciless decision in his face 'ask not the impossible thou art not alone impure thou art uncleansable from birth yea for ever and ever come premi come my child' i shall never forget the cry which echoed over the water startling the pigeons from their evening rest amid the encircling trees 'uncleansable for ever and ever' then in wild appeal from earth to heaven he threw his arms skyward 'oh shining ones say i am the same amra the twice born amra thy servant' 'peace blasphemer' interrupted the brahman sternly 'there are no shining ones for such as thou go lest they strike thee dead in wrath' a momentary glimpse of a young face distraught by despair of an old one firm in repudiation and the platform lay empty of the passions which had played their parts on it as on a stage only from the distance came the discordant triumph of the jogi's procession i besieged taylor's superior knowledge by vain questions to most of which he shook his head 'how can i tell' he said somewhat fretfully 'the cord was manipulated in some way of course for all that there may be truth in gopi's story there is generally the devil to pay if a brahmani goes wrong and she may have tried to save the boy's life by getting rid of him if you want to know more i'll send for victor emanuel five rupees will fetch some slight fraction of truth from the bottom of his well and that as a rule is all we aliens can expect in these incidents' so the old ruffian came and sat ostentatiously far from our contaminating influences in the attitude of a bronze buddha his mustaches curled to his eyebrows his large lips wreathed in solemn smiles 'it was a truly divine miracle' he said blandly 'gopi the bikshu never makes mistakes and performs neatly did the presence observe how neatly within the cotton marking the brahman came the hempen thread of the kshatriya inside again the woollen strand of the vaisya all three twice born but last of all a strip of cowskin defiling the whole' 'why cow skin' i asked in my ignorance 'i always thought you held a cow sacred' victor emanuel beamed approval 'the little presence is young but intelligent he will doubtless learn much if he questions the right people judiciously he will grow wise like the big presence who knows nearly as much as we know about some things but not all the cow is sacred so the skin telling of the misfortune of the cow is anathema yea 'twas a divine miracle the money of the pious will flow to make the holy fat at least that is what the doctor sahib is thinking' 'don't set up for occult power on the strength of guessing palpable truths' replied taylor 'that sort of thing does not amuse me but the little sahib wants to know how much truth there was in gopi's story' 'gopi knows' retorted our friend with a grin 'the brahman saith the boy was gifted to him by a pious woman after the custom of thanksgiving gone five years old wearing the sacred thread versed in simple lore intelligent well formed as the ritual demands gopi saith the mother his wife was a bad walker even to the length of public bazaars her people sought her for years but she escaped them in big towns and ere they found her she had gained safety for this boy by palming him off on sukya 'twas easy for her being a brahmani of course they made her speak somewhat ere she fulfilled her life but not the name of the anchorite she deceived so gopi knowing from the mother's babbling of this mongrel's blasphemous name and the vow of pilgrimage for the expiation of sins hath come hither led by the spirit every year it is a tale of great virtue and edification' 'but the boy the wretched boy' i asked eagerly taylor raised his eyebrows and watched my reception of the jog's answer with a half pitying smile 'perhaps he will die perhaps not what does it matter one born of such parents is dead to virtue from the beginning and life without virtue is not life' 'he might try amar nath and the remission of sins you believe in so firmly' remarked taylor with another look at me victor emanuel spat freely 'there is no amar nath for such as he and the presence knows that as well as i do no remission at all even if he found the flower of forgiveness as the doctor sahib hopes to do' 'upon my soul' retorted taylor impatiently 'i believe the existence of the one is about as credible as the other i shall have to swallow both if i chance upon either' 'that may be but not for the boy amra he will die and be damned in due course' that seemed to settle the question for others but i was haunted by the boy's look when he heard the words 'thou art uncleansable for ever and ever' 'after all 'tis only a concentrated form of the feeling we all have at times' remarked taylor drily 'even i should like to do away with a portion of my past besides all religions claim more or less a monopoly of repentance they are no worse here than at home' we journeyed slowly to amar nath watching the pilgrims pass us by on the road but catching them up again each evening after long rambles over the hills in search of rare plants it is three days' march by rights to shisha nag or the leaden lake where the pilgrimage begins in real earnest by the pilgrims men women and children divesting themselves of every stitch of raiment and journeying stark naked through the snow and ice for two days coming back of course clothed with righteousness but taylor becoming interested over fungi in the chestnut woods of chandanwarra we paused there to hunt up all sorts of deathly looking growths due to disease and decay i was not sorry for one pilgrim possessed by frantic haste to shift his sins to some scapegoat is very much like another pilgrim with the same desire besides i grew tired of victor emanuel who felt the cold extremely and was in consequence seldom sober and extremely loquacious i thought i had never seen such a dreary place as shisha nag though the sun shone brilliantly on its cliffs and glaciers i think it must have been the irresponsiveness of the lake itself which deadened its beauties for the water surcharged with gypsum lay in pale green stretches refusing a single reflection of the hills which held it so carefully the next march was awful and in more than one place half hidden by the flowers forcing their way through the snow lay the corpses of pilgrims who had succumbed to the cold and the exposure 'pneumonia in five out of six cases' remarked taylor casually 'if it were not for the churrus concoction of hemp they drink the mortality would be fearful i wonder what exeter hall would say to getting drunk for purposes of devotion' at punjtarni we met the returning pilgrims among others victor very sick and sorry for himself physically but of intolerable moral strength he told us between the intervals of petitions for pills and potions that the remaining fourteen miles to the cave were unusually difficult and had been singularly fatal that year on hearing this taylor knowing my dislike to horrors proposed taking a path across the hills instead of keeping to the orthodox route owing to scarcity of water and fuel the servants and tents could only go some five miles farther along the ravine so this suggestion would involve no change of plan he added that there would also be a greater chance of finding 'that blessed anemone' i don't think i ever saw so much drunkenness or so much devotion as i saw that evening at punjtarni it was hard indeed to tell where the one began and the other ended for excitement danger and privation lent their aid to drugs and a sense of relief to both the very cliffs and glaciers resounded with enthusiasm and i saw sukya and premi taking their part with the rest as if nothing had happened taylor and i started alone next morning we were to make a long round in search of the flower of forgiveness and come back upon the cave towards afternoon the path if path it could be called was fearful taylor however was untiring and at the slightest hint of hope would strike off up the most break neck places leaving me to rejoin him as best i could yet not a trace did we find of the anemone taylor grew fretful and when we reached the snow slope leading to the cave he declared it would be sheer waste of time for him to go up 'get rid of your sins if you want to by all means' he said 'i've seen photographs of the place and it's a wretched imposture even as a spectacle you have only to keep up the snow for a mile and turn to the left you'll find me somewhere about these cliffs on your return and don't be long for the going before us is difficult' so i left him poking into every crack and cranny i could scarcely make up my mind if i was impressed or disappointed with the cave its extreme insignificance was it is true almost ludicrous save for a patch of red paint and a shockingly bad attempt at a stone image of siva's bull there was nothing to distinguish this hollow in the rock from a thousand similar ones all over the himalayas but this very insignificance gave mystery to the fact that hundreds of thousands of the conscience stricken had found consolation here 'what went ye out into the wilderness to see' as i stood for an instant at the entrance before retracing my steps i could not but think that here was a wilderness indeed a wilderness of treacherous snow and icebound rivers peaked and piled up tumultuously like frozen waves against the darkening sky the memory of taylor's warning not to be late made me try what seemed a shorter and easier path than the one by which i had come but ere long the usual difficulties of short cuts cropped up and i had eventually to limp back to the slope with a badly cut ankle which bled profusely despite my rough efforts at bandaging the loss of blood was sufficient to make me feel quite sick and faint so that it startled me to come suddenly on taylor sooner than i expected he was half kneeling half sitting on the snow his coat was off and his face bent over something propped against his arm 'it's that boy' he said shortly as i came up 'i found him just after you left lying here to rest he says it seems he has been making his way to the cave ever since that day without bite or sup by the hills god knows how to avoid being turned back by the others and now he is dying and there's an end of it' 'the boy not amra' i cried bending in my turn sure enough on taylor's arm with taylor's coat over his wasted body lay the young disciple his great luminous eyes looked out of a face whence even death could not drive the beauty and his breath came in laboured gasps 'brandy i have some here' i suggested in hot haste moved to the idiotic suggestion by that horror of standing helpless which besets us all in presence of the destroyer taylor looked at the boy with a grave smile and shook his head 'to begin with he wouldn't touch it besides he is past all that sort of thing no one could help him now' he paused shifting the weight a little on his arm 'the presence will grow tired holding me' gasped the young voice feebly 'if the sahib will put a stone under my head and cover me with some snow i will be able to crawl on by and by when i am rested for it is close quite close' 'very close' muttered the doctor under his breath suddenly he looked up at me saying in a half apologetic way 'i was wondering if you and i couldn't get him up there to amar nath i mean life has been hard on him he deserves an easy death' 'of course we can' i cried in a rush of content at the suggestion as i hobbled round to get to the other side and so help the lad to his legs 'hollo' asked taylor with a quick professional glance 'what have you done to your ankle sit down and let me overhaul it' in vain i made light of it in vain i appealed to him he peremptorily forbade my stirring for another hour asserting that i had injured a small artery and without caution might find difficulty in reaching the tents as it would be impossible for him to help me much on the sort of ground over which we had to travel 'but the boy taylor the boy' i pleaded 'it would be awful to leave him here' 'who said he was to be left' retorted the doctor crossly 'i'm going to carry him up as soon as i've finished bandaging your leg don't be in such a blessed hurry' 'carry him you can't do it up that slope strong as you are taylor i know you can't' 'can't' he echoed as he stood up from his labours 'look at him and say can't again if you can' i looked and saw that the boy but half conscious yet restored to the memory of his object by the touch of the snow on which taylor had laid him while engaged in bandaging my foot had raised himself painfully on his hands and knees and was struggling upwards blindly doggedly 'damn it all' continued the doctor fiercely 'isn't that sight enough to haunt a man if he doesn't try besides i may find that precious flower who knows' as he spoke he stooped with the gentleness not so much of sympathy as of long practice in suffering over the figure which exhausted by its brief effort already lay prostrate on the snow 'what is the presence going to do' moaned amra doubtfully as he felt the strong arms close round him 'you and i are going to find the remission of sins together at amar nath' replied the presence with a bitter laugh the boy's head fell back on the doctor's shoulder as if accustomed to the resting place 'amar nath' he murmured 'yes i am amar nath' so i sat there helpless and watched them up the slope every slip every stumble seemed as if it were my own i clenched my hands and set my teeth as if i too had part in the supreme effort and when the straining figure passed out of sight i hid my face and tried not to think it was the longest hour i ever spent before taylor's voice holloing from the cliff above roused me to the certainty of success 'and the boy' i asked eagerly 'dead by this time i expect' replied the doctor shortly 'come on there's a good fellow we haven't a moment to lose i must look again for the flower to morrow' but letters awaiting our return to camp recalled him to duty on account of cholera in the regiment so there was an end of anemone hunting the st suffered terribly and taylor was in consequence hotter than ever over experiments the result you know yes poor fellow but the anemone i don't understand how it came here my friend paused that is the odd thing i was looking after the funeral and all that for taylor and i were great friends he left me that herbarium in memory of our time in cashmere well when i went over to the house about an hour before to see everything done properly his bearer brought me one of those little flat straw baskets the natives use it had been left during my absence he said by a young brahman who assured him that it contained something which the great doctor sahib had been very anxious to possess and which was now sent by some one to whom he had been very kind 'you told him the sahib was dead i suppose' i asked 'this slave informed him that the master had gained freedom but he replied it was no matter as all his task was this' on opening the basket i found a gourd such as the disciples carry round for alms and in it planted among gypsum debris was that anemone or rather that is a part of it for i put some in taylor's coffin ah i presume the gosain victor emanuel i think you called him sent the plant he knew of the doctor's desire perhaps the bearer said the brahman was a very handsome boy very fair dressed in the usual black antelope skin of the disciple it is a queer story anyhow is it not harvest respectfully dedicated to our law makers in india who by giving to the soldier peasants of the punjab the novel right of alienating their ancestral holdings are fast throwing the land and with it the balance of power into the hands of money grubbers thus reducing those who stood by us in our time of trouble to the position of serfs ai daughter of thy grandmother muttered old jaimul gently as one of his yoke wavered making the handle waver also the offender was a barren buffalo doomed temporarily to the plough in the hopes of inducing her to look more favourably on the first duty of the female sex so she started beneath the unaccustomed goad ari sister fret not muttered jaimul again turning from obscure abuse to palpable flattery as being more likely to gain his object and once more the tilted soil glided between his feet traced straight by his steady hand in that vast expanse of bare brown field left by or waiting for the plough each new furrow seemed a fresh diameter of the earth circle which lay set in the bare blue horizon a circle centring always on jaimul and his plough a brown dot for the buffalo a white dot for the ox a brown and white dot for the old peasant with his lanky brown limbs and straight white drapery his brown face and long white beard brown and white and blue with the promise of harvest sometime if the blue was kind that was all jaimul knew or cared the empire beyond hanging on the hope of harvest lay far from his simple imaginings and yet he the old peasant with his steady hand of patient control held the reins of government over how many million square miles that is the province of the blue book and jaimul's blue book was the sky bitter blue sky with no fleck of a cloud ho brother ox make the plough speed ai soorin straight i say 'tis the usurers' bellies wax fat and proud when poor folk are in need the rude guttural chant following these silent earth deadened footsteps was the only sound breaking the stillness of the wide plain sky dappled grey like a partridge's breast ho brother ox drive the plough deep steady my sister steady the peasants work but the usurers rest till harvest's ripe to reap so on and on interminably the chant and the furrow the furrow and the chant both bringing the same refrain of flattery and abuse the same antithesis the peasant and the usurer face to face in conflict and above them both the fateful sky changeless or changeful as it chooses the sun climbed up and up till the blue hardened into brass and the mere thought of rain seemed lost in the blaze of light yet jaimul as he finally unhitched his plough chanted away in serene confidence merry drops slanting from west to east ho brother ox drive home the wain 'tis the usurer's belly that gets the least when ram sends poor folk rain the home whither he drove the lagging yoke was but a whitish brown mound on the bare earth circle not far removed from an ant hill to alien eyes for all that home to the uttermost civilisation education culture could produce none better a home bright with the welcome of women the laughter of children old kishnu mother of them all wielding a relentless despotism tempered by profound affection over every one save her aged husband pertabi widow of the eldest son but saved from degradation in this life and damnation in the next by the tall lad whose grasp had already closed on his grandfather's plough handle taradevi whose soldier husband was away guarding some scientific or unscientific frontier while she reared up in the ancestral home a tribe of sturdy youngsters to follow in his footsteps fighting and ploughing ploughing and fighting here was life epitomised for these long limbed grave eyed peasants whose tongues never faltered over the shibboleth which showed their claim to courage the home itself lay bare for the most part to the blue sky only a few shallow outhouses half room half verandah giving shelter from noon day heat or winter frosts the rest was courtyard serving amply for all the needs of the household in one corner a pile of golden chaff ready for the milch kine which came in to be fed from the mud mangers ranged against the wall in another a heap of fuel and the tall beehive like mud receptacles for grain on every side stores of something brought into existence by the plough corn cobs for husking millet stalks for the cattle cotton awaiting deft fingers and the lacquered spinning wheels which stand cocked on end against the wall taradevi sits on the white sheet spread beneath the quern while her eldest daughter a girl about ten years of age lends slight aid to the revolving stones whence the coarse flour falls ready for the mid day meal pertabi down by the grain bunkers rakes more wheat from the funnel like opening into her flat basket and as she rises flings a handful to the pigeons sidling on the wall a fluttering of white wings a glint of sunlight on opaline necks while the children cease playing to watch their favourites tumble and strut over the feast even old kishnu looks up from her preparation of curds without a word of warning against waste for to be short of grain is beyond her experience wherefore was the usurer brought into the world save to supply grain in advance when the blue sky sided with capital against labour for a dry year or two the land is ready said old jaimul over his pipe 'tis time for the seed therefore i will seek anunt ram at sunset and set my seal to the paper that was how the transaction presented itself to his accustomed eyes seed grain in exchange for yet another seal to be set in the long row which he and his forbears had planted regularly year by year in the usurer's field of accounts as for the harvests of such sowings bah there never were any a real crop of solid hard red wheat was worth them all and that came sometimes might come any time if the blue sky was kind he knew nothing of statutes of limitation or judgments of the chief court and his inherited wisdom drew a broad line of demarcation between paper and plain facts anunt ram the usurer however was of another school a comparatively young man he had brought into his father's ancestral business the modern selfishness which laughs to scorn all considerations save that for number one he and his forbears had made much out of jaimul and his fellows but was that any reason against making more if more was to be made and more was indubitably to be made if jaimul and his kind were reduced to the level of labourers that handful of grain for instance thrown so recklessly to the pigeons that might be the usurer's and so might the plenty which went to build up the long strong limbs of taradevi's tribe of young soldiers idle young scamps who thrashed the usurer's boys as diligently during play time as they were beaten by those clever weedy lads during school hours seed grain he echoed sulkily to the old peasant's calm demand sure last harvest i left thee more wheat than most men in my place would have done for the account grows o jaimul and the land is mortgaged to the uttermost mayhap but it must be sown for all that else thou wilt suffer as much as i so quit idle words and give the seed as thou hast since time began what do i know of accounts who can neither read nor write 'tis thy business not mine 'tis not my business to give ought for nought for nought broke in jaimul with the hoarse chuckle of the peasant availing himself of a time worn joke thou canst add that nought to thy figures o bunniah ji so bring the paper and have done with words if ram sends rain and the omens are auspicious thou canst take all but food and jewels for the women report saith thy house is rich enough in them already suggested the usurer after a pause jaimul's big white eyebrows met over his broad nose what then bunniah ji he asked haughtily anunt ram made haste to change the subject whereat jaimul smiling softly told the usurer that maybe more jewels would be needed with next seed grain since if the auguries were once more propitious the women purposed bringing home his grandson's bride ere another year had sped the usurer smiled an evil smile set thy seal to this also he said when the seed grain had been measured the rules demand it a plague say i on all these new fangled papers the sahib logue ask of us look you how i have to pay for the stamps and fees and then you old ones say we new ones are extortionate we must live o zemindar ji even as thou livest live retorted the old man with another chuckle wherefore not the land is good enough for you and for me there is no fault in the land ay it is good enough for me and for you echoed the usurer slowly he inverted the pronouns that was all so jaimul as he had done ever since he could remember walked over the bare plain with noiseless feet and watched the sun flash on the golden grain as it flew from his thin brown fingers and once again the guttural chant kept time to his silent steps wheat grains grow to wheat and the seed of a tare to tare who knows if man's soul will meet man's body to wear great ram grant me life from the grain of a golden deed sink not my soul in the strife to wake as a weed after that his work in the fields was over only at sunrise and sunset his tall gaunt figure stood out against the circling sky as he wandered through the sprouting wheat waiting for the rain which never came not for the first time in his long life of waiting so he took the want calmly soberly it is a bad year he said the next will be better for the sake of the boy's marriage i would it had been otherwise but anunt ram must advance the money it is his business whereat jodha the youngest son better versed than his father in new ways shook his head doubtfully have a care of anunt o baba ji he suggested with diffidence folk say he is sharper than ever his father was 'tis a trick sons have or think they have nowadays retorted old jaimul wrathfully anunt can wait for payment as his fathers waited god knows the interest is enough to stand a dry season or two in truth fifty per cent and payment in kind at the lowest harvest rates with a free hand in regard to the cooking of accounts should have satisfied even a usurer's soul but anunt ram wanted that handful of grain for the pigeons and the youngsters' mess of pottage he wanted the land in fact and so the long row of dibbled in seals dotting the unending scroll of accounts began to sprout and bear fruit drought gave them life while it brought death to many a better seed not give the money for the boy's wedding shrilled old kishnu six months after in high displeasure is the man mad when the fields are the best in all the country side true enough o wife but he says the value under these new rules the sahib logue make is gone already that he must wait another harvest or have a new seal of me is that all o jaimul singh and thou causing my liver to melt with fear a seal what is a seal or two more against the son of thy son's marriage 'tis a new seal muttered jaimul uneasily and i like not new things perhaps 'twere better to wait the harvest wait the harvest and lose the auspicious time the purohit hath found written in the stars ai taradevi ai pertabi there is to be no marriage hark you the boy's strength is to go for nought and the bride is to languish alone because the father of his father is afraid of a usurer hae hae the women wept the easy tears of their race mingled with half real half pretended fears lest the great ones might resent such disregard of their good omens the old man sitting silent meanwhile for there is no tyranny like the tyranny of those we love despite all this his native shrewdness held his tenderness in check they would get over it he told himself and a good harvest would do wonders ay even the wonders which the purohit was always finding in the skies trust a good fee for that so he hardened his heart went back to anunt ram and told him that he had decided on postponing the marriage the usurer's face fell to be so near the seal which would make it possible for him to foreclose the mortgages and yet to fail he had counted on this marriage for years the blue sky itself had fought for him so far and now what if the coming harvest were a bumper but i will seal for the seed grain said old jaimul i have done that before and i will do it again we know that bargain of old anunt ram closed his pen tray with a snap there is no seed grain for you baba ji this year either he replied calmly ten days afterwards kishnu pertabi and taradevi were bustling about the courtyard with the untiring energy which fills the indian woman over the mere thought of a wedding and jaimul out in the fields was chanting as he scattered the grain into the furrows wrinkles and seams and sears on the face of our mother earth there are ever sorrows and tears at the gates of birth the mere thought of the land lying fallow had been too much for him so safe in the usurer's strong box lay a deed with the old man's seal sitting cheek by jowl beside anunt ram's brand new english signature and jaimul knew in a vague unrestful way that this harvest differed from other harvests in that more depended upon it so he wandered oftener than ever over the brown expanse of field where a flush of green showed that mother earth had done her part and was waiting for heaven to take up the task the wedding fire balloons rose from the courtyard and drifted away to form constellations in the cloudless sky the sound of wedding drums and pipes disturbed the stillness of the starlit nights and still day by day the green shoots grew lighter and lighter in colour because the rain came not then suddenly like a man's hand a little cloud merry drops slanting from west to the east merrier by far to jaimul's ears than all the marriage music was that low rumble from the canopy of purple cloud and the discordant scream of the peacock telling of the storm to come then in the evening when the setting sun could only send a bar of pale primrose light between the solid purple and the solid brown what joy to pick a dry shod way along the boundary ridges and see the promise of harvest doubled by the reflection of each tender green spikelet in the flooded fields the night settled down dark heavenly dark with a fine spray of steady rain in the old weather beaten face as it set itself towards home the blue sky was on the side of labour this time and during the next month or so taradevi's young soldiers made mud pies and crowed more lustily than ever over the bunniah's boys then the silvery beard began to show in the wheat and old jaimul laughed aloud in the fulness of his heart that is an end of the new seal he said boastfully as he smoked his pipe in the village square it is a poor man's harvest and no mistake but anunt ram was silent the april sun had given some of its sunshine to the yellowing crops before he spoke i can wait no longer for my money o baba ji he said the three years are nigh over and i must defend myself what three years asked jaimul in perplexity the three years during which i can claim my own according to the sahib logue's rule you must pay or i must sue pay before harvest what are these fool's words of course i will pay in due time hath not great ram sent me rain to wash out the old writing but what of the new one baba ji the cash lent on permission to foreclose the mortgages if the harvest failed if it failed protested jaimul quickly and i knew it could not fail the stars said so and great ram would not have it so that is old world talk sneered anunt we do not put that sort of thing in the bond you sealed it and i must sue what good to sue ere harvest what money have i but i will pay good grain when it comes and the paper can grow as before anunt ram sniggered what good o baba ji why the land will be mine and i can take not what you give me but what i choose for the labourer his hire and the rest for me thou art mad cried jaimul but he went back to his fields with a great fear at his heart a fear which sent him again to the usurer's ere many days were over here are my house's jewels he said briefly and the mare thou hast coveted these two years take them and write off my debt till harvest anunt ram smiled again it shall be part payment of the acknowledged claim he said let the courts decide on the rest after the harvest ay after the harvest in consideration of the jewels anunt ram kept his word and the fields were shorn of their crop ere the summons to attend the district court was brought to the old peasant by the great spirit who judges all it is a lie that was all he could say as the long carefully woven tissue of fraud and cunning blinded even the eyes of a justice biassed in his favour the records of our indian law courts teem with such cases cases where even equity can do nothing against the evidence of pen and paper no need to detail the strands which formed the net the long array of seals had borne fruit at last fiftyfold sixtyfold a hundredfold a goodly harvest for the usurer look not so glum friend smiled anunt ram as they pushed old jaimul from the court at last dazed but still vehemently protesting thou and jodha thy son shall till the land as ever seeing thou art skilled in such work but there shall be no idlers and the land mark you is mine not thine a sudden gleam of furious hate sprang to the strong old face but died away as quickly as it came thou liest said jaimul i will appeal the land is mine it hath been mine and my fathers' under the king's pleasure since time began kings ay and queens for that matter are not fools to give good land to the bunniah's belly can a bunniah plough yet as he sat all day about the court house steps awaiting some legal detail or other doubt even of his own incredulity came over him he had often heard of similar misfortunes to his fellows but somehow the possibility of such evil appearing in his own life had never entered his brain and what would kishnu say after all these years these long years of content the moon gathering light as the sun set shone full on the road as the old man with downcast head made his way across the level plain to the mud hovel which had been a true home to him and his for centuries his empty hands hung at his sides and the fingers twitched nervously as if seeking something on either side the bare stubble stretching away from the track which led deviously to the scarce discernible hamlets here and there not a soul in sight but every now and again a glimmer of light showing where some one was watching the heaps of new threshed grain upon the threshing floors and then a straighter thread of path leading right upon his own fields and the village beyond what was that a man riding before him the blood leapt through the old veins and the old hands gripped in upon themselves so he that liar riding ahead was to have the land was he riding the mare too while he jaimul came behind afoot yet for all that gaining steadily with long swinging stride on the figure ahead a white figure on a white horse like death or was the avenger behind beneath the lank folds of drapery which fluttered round the walker the land no he should never have the land how could he the very idea was absurd jaimul thinking thus held his head erect and his hands relaxed their grip he was close on the rider now and just before him clear in the moonlight rose the boundary mark of his fields a loose pile of sunbaked clods hardened by many a dry year of famine to the endurance of stone beside it the shallow whence they had been dug showing a gleam of water still held in the stiff clay the mare paused straining at the bridle for a drink and jaimul almost at her heels paused also involuntarily mechanically for a moment they stood thus a silent white group in the moonlight then the figure on the horse slipped to the ground and moved a step forward only one step but that was within the boundary then above the even wheeze of the thirsty beast rose a low chuckle as the usurer stooped for a handful of soil and let it glide through his fingers it is good ground ay ay none better they were his last words in fierce passion of love hate jealousy and protection old jaimul closed on his enemy and found something to grip with his steady old hands not the plough handle this time but a throat a warm living throat where you could feel the blood swelling in the veins beneath your fingers down almost without a struggle the old face above the young one the lank knee upon the broad body and now quick for something to slay withal ere age tired in its contest with youth and strength there ready since all time stood the landmark and one clod after another snatched from it fell on the upturned face with a dull thud fell again and again crashed and broke to crumbling soil good soil ay none better wheat might grow in it and give increase fortyfold sixtyfold ay a hundredfold again again and yet again with dull insistence till there was a shuddering sigh and then silence jaimul stood up quivering from the task and looked over his fields they were at least free from that thing at his feet for what part in this world's harvest could belong to the ghastly figure with its face beaten to a jelly which lay staring up into the over arching sky so far at any rate the business was settled for ever and in so short a time that the mare had scarcely slaked her thirst and still stood with head down the water dripping from her muzzle the thing would never ride her again either half involuntarily he stepped to her side and loosened the girth ari sister he said aloud thou hast had enough go home the docile beast obeyed his well known voice and as her echoing amble died away jaimul looked at his blood stained hands and then at the formless face at his feet there was no home for him and yet he was not sorry or ashamed or frightened only dazed at the hurry of his own act such things had to be done sometimes when folk were unjust they would hang him for it of course but he had at least made his protest and done his deed as good men and true should do when the time came so he left the horror staring up into the sky and made his way to the threshing floor which lay right in the middle of his fields how white the great heaps of yellow corn showed in the moonlight and how large his heart leapt with a fierce joy at the sight here was harvest indeed some one lay asleep upon the biggest pile and his stern old face relaxed into a smile as stooping over the careless sentinel he found it was his grandson the boy would watch better as he grew older thought jaimul as he drew his cotton plaid gently over the smooth round limbs outlined among the yielding grain lest the envious moon might covet their promise of beauty son of my son son of my son he murmured over and over again as he sat down to watch out the night beside his corn for the last time yes for the last time at dawn the deed would be discovered they would take him and he would not deny his own handiwork why should he the midnight air of may was hot as a furnace and as he wiped the sweat from his forehead it mingled with the dust and blood upon his hands he looked at them with a curious smile before he lay back among the corn many a night he had watched the slow stars wheeling to meet the morn but never by a fairer harvest than this the boy at his side stirred in his sleep son of my son son of my son came the low murmur again ay and his son after him again if the woman said true it had always been so father and son father and son father and son for ever and ever and ever so lulled by the familiar thought the old man fell asleep beside the boy and the whole bare expanse of earth and sky seemed empty save for them no there was something else surely down on the hard white threshing floor was that a branch or a fragment of rope neither for it moved deviously hither and thither raising a hooded head now and again as if seeking something for all its twists and turns bearing steadily towards the sleepers past the boy making him shift uneasily as the cold coil touched his arms swifter now as it drew nearer the scent till it found what it sought upon the old man's hands ari sister straight i say straight murmured the old ploughman in his sleep as his grip strengthened over something that wavered in his steady clasp was that the prick of the goad sure if it bit so deep upon the sister's hide no wonder she started he must keep his grip for men's throats when sleep was over when this great sleep was over the slow stars wheeled and when the morn brought justice it found old jaimul dead among his corn and left him there but the women washed the stains of blood and sweat mingled with soil and seed grains from his hands before the wreath of smoke from his funeral pyre rose up to make a white cloud no bigger than a man's hand upon the bitter blue sky a cloud that brought gladness to no heart the usurer's boys it is true forced the utmost from the land and sent all save bare sustenance across the seas but the home guided by jaimul's unswerving hand was gone the taradevi's tribe of budding soldiers drifted away to learn the lawlessness born of change perhaps the yellow english gold which came into the country in return for the red indian wheat more than paid for these trivial losses perhaps it did not that is a question which the next mutiny must settle for the faith i an old man dreaming of a past day and night as he sat waiting and these were his dreams darkness save for the light of the stars in the sky and the flare of blazing roof trees on earth two shadowy figures out in the open and through the parched silence of the may night a man's voice feeble yet strenuous in appeal dhurm singh huzoor the kneeling figure bent closer over the other waiting the mem sahiba dhurm singh huzoor dhurm nal then silence broken only by the long howl of jackals gathering before their time round that scene of mutiny and murder darkness once more the darkness of daylight shut out by prisoning walls the sweltering heat of july oozing through the shot cracked walls the horrors of starvation and siege and sickness round two dim figures and once again a strenuous voice this time a woman's dhurm singh huzoor the answer came as before broad soft guttural in the accent of the north sonny baba dhurm singh huzoor dhurm nal then silence broken only by the whist ch t of a wandering bullet against the wall of the crumbling fort where one more victim had found peace both the may night and the july day were in old dhurm singh's thoughts as he sat on his heels looking out from the apollo bunder at bombay across the black water waiting after long years for sonny baba's ship to loom over the level horizon a stranger figure among the slight smooth coolies busy around him with bales and belaying pins than he would have been among the dockers at limehouse tall gaunt his long white beard parted over the chin and bound backwards over his ears his broad mustache spreading straight under his massive nose his level eyebrows like a white streak between the open brown forehead and the open brown eyes a faded red tunic empty of the left arm a solitary medal on the breast and above the unseen coils of white hair long as a woman's the high wound turban bearing the sacred steel quoit of the sikh devotee such was dhurm singh akali in other words lion of the faith and member of the church militant pensioner to boot for an anna or so a day to a government which he had also served dhurm nal as he had served his dead captain his dead mistress and last of all sonny baba twenty years ago yes twenty years since he had answered those strenuous appeals by his favourite word play on his own name he had used it for many another promise during those long years as a rule truthfully for dhurm singh as a rule did things dhurm nal partly because a slow invincible tenacity of purpose made all chopping and changing distasteful partly because fidelity to the master is sucked in with the mother's milk of the sikh race very little it is to be feared from conscious virtue twenty years ago he had carried sonny baba through the jungles by night on his unhurt arm and hidden as best he could in the tiger grass by day because of his promise and now as he sat waiting for sonny baba to come sailing over the edge of his world again the broad simple face expanded into smiles at the memory he passed by all the stress and strains of that unforgotten flight in favour of a little yellow head nestling back in alarm against the bloodstains on the old tunic when the white mems in the big cantonment of refuge had held out their arms to the child sonny baba had known his friends in those days ay and he had remembered them all these years he and the mem's sister who had taken charge of the boy in the foreign land across the black waters whence the masters came a gracious miss who wrote regularly once a year to ex duffadar dhurm singh giving him the last news of sonny baba and as regularly urging her correspondent to safeguard himself against certain damnation by becoming an infidel for this briefly crudely was the recipient's view of the matter as he sat staring at the little picture texts and tracts in the punjabi character which invariably accompanied the letters they puzzled him those picture cards in the sacred characters which were printed so beautifully in the far off land by people who knew nothing of him or his people and who yet wrote better than any mohunt puzzled him in more ways than one since duty and desire divided as to the method of their disposal respect for the captan sahib whom he had left lying dead at the back of the native lines on that may night forbade his destroying them respect for his own religious profession forbade his disseminating the pictures irrespective of the letterpress as playthings among the village children so he tied them up in a bundle with his pension papers and kept them in the breast pocket of the old tunic under the bloodstains and the solitary medal which was beginning to fray through its parti coloured ribbon an odd item in that costume of a sikh devotee which he had assumed when the final loss of his arm forced him into peace and a pension as a rule however the tunic was hidden under the orthodox blue and white garments matching the turban just as the huge steel bracelets on his arms matched the steel quoit on his head but on this day loyalty to the dead had spoken in favour of the old uniform it may seem a strange choice this of devoteeship but to the old swash buckler it was infinitely more amusing even in these degenerate days when akali dom had lost half its power to go swaggering about from fair to festival from festival to fair representing the church militant than to lounge about the village watching the agricultural members of the family cultivate the ancestral lands they did it admirably without his help as they had done it always so dhurm singh at a loose end now legitimate strife was over took to cultivating his hair with baths of buttermilk instead adopted the quoit and the bracelets and used the most pious of sikh oaths as he watched the wrestlers wrestle or played singlestick for the honour of god and the old regiment and there were other advantages in the profession a man might take a more than reasonable amount of opium occasionally without laying himself open to a heavier accusation than that of religious enthusiasm since opium is part of the akali's stock in trade as he sat among the tarred ropes with his back against a consignment of beer and rum for the british soldier he broke off quite a large corner of the big black lump he kept in the same pocket with the tracts and swallowed it whole sonny baba's ship was not due they told him for some hours to come so there would be time for quiet dreams both of past and future the latter somewhat confused since the miss sahib's letters had not always been adequately translated by the village schoolmaster only this was sure sonny baba was three and twenty and he was coming out to hindustan once more as an officer in the great army in fact he was a captan already which was big promotion for his few years so dhurm singh who to say sooth was becoming somewhat tired of the church militant now that younger men began to beat him at singlestick had returned to the old allegiance and made his way down country like many another old servant to meet his master's son and take service with him you see them often these old anxious looking retainers waiting on the apollo bunder or coming aboard in the steam launches with wistful expectant faces and some beardless youth fresh from eton or harrow says with a laugh by george are you old munnoo or bunnoo here look after my traps will you and the traps are duly looked after while the philosophical radical on the rampage is taking the opportunity afforded by baggage parade to record in his valuable diary the pained surprise at the want of touch between the rulers and the ruled which is alas his first impression of india in all probability it will be his last also since it is conceivable that both rulers and ruled may be glad to get rid of him on the approach of the hot weather mosquitoes are troublesome and cholera is disconcerting but they are bearable beside the man who invariably knows the answers to his own questions before he asks them dhurm singh's dreams however if confused were pleasant full of strong meats and drinks and men in buckram he could not of course serve the sirkar again with the chance of batta and loot but he could serve the chota sahib and wear a badge after all a badge wearer had his opportunities of hectoring and then how he could talk round the camp fires what tales he could tell bearing in mind of course the advancement of god and the gurus he fell asleep finally in the sunshine blissfully content the tide ebbed in the backwaters the guardship lay white and trim in the open the tram horses clattered up and down the royal yacht club pennant flew out against the blue sky a match was being played on the links hard by and the very coolies as they hauled and heaved used a polyglot of sailors' slang only the palm trees on the point over the bay gave an oriental touch to the scene dhurm singh my dear dear old friend look comrades this is the man who carried me to safety in his arms even as the good shepherd carries his lambs the speech had that unreal sound which is the curse of the premeditated except in the mouth of a born actor which sonny baba was not and yet the young curves of the lips quivered perhaps the commonplace exclamation of the british boy mentioned before would have come more naturally to them but staff captain sonny baba of the salvation army was on parade and bound to keep up his character nevertheless there was no lack of warmth in the grip he got of the old man's reluctant hand huzoor faltered dhurm singh taken aback at this condescension and letting the sword he was about to present fall back on its belt with a clatter the fact being that the said sword had been an occasion of much mental distress as an actual ex duffadar it was irregular but as a possible bodyguard it was strictly de rigueur perhaps however times had changed in this as in other ways during those twenty years the very uniform worn by the score or so of men drawn up on the deck was strange and what did that squad of mem sahibs mean their dress did not seem so strange to the old akali since in those palmy days before the mutiny the fashions were not so far removed from the costume of a salvation lass but the tambourines come and speak to the general said sonny baba somewhat hurriedly he spoke in english but just as the formula look after my traps is understanded of the common people at once so the word general brought a relieved comprehension to the old sikh's face there were blessed frogs on this one's coat also which like the word mesopotamia were charged with consolation the general looked at him with that curious philanthropic smile which while it welcomes the object has a kind of circumambient beam of mutual congratulation for all spectators of the benevolence you have seen service my good old friend he exclaimed in fluent urdu as he pointed with a declamatory wave of his hand to the solitary medal but it was poor service to what we offer you now come to us be our first fruit and help to carry the colours of the great army in the van of the fight a speech meant palpably for the gallery dhurm singh however took it at attention and saluted pension wallah huzoor unfit for duty he replied with modest brevity indicating his empty sleeve the general caught at the occasion for even greater unction with a complacency which could not be concealed the great army is recruited from those who are unfit for duty from those who are sinners is it not so comrades are we not all maimed halt blind yet entering into life hallelujah hallelujah cried the company bursting into the refrain of a hymn in which sonny baba joined with an angelic voice the voice in fact was largely responsible for the position in which he found himself the old swash buckler's eyes grew moist as he looked at him thinking that he was the very image for sure of his dead father who had been the pride of the regiment nevertheless the effervescence of song left the old man still deprecating and fumbling in his tunic the general sahib mistakes these are my pinson papers that proved a climax when just as you are setting foot on a country which you have sworn to conquer an old warrior comes aboard and produces a bundle of scripture texts and salvation hymns out of his innermost breast pocket naturally nothing is left but to enthuse what followed dhurm singh only dimly understood but he stuck manfully to his intention of following sonny baba to the death if needs be the result being that at four o'clock in the afternoon he took part in a procession round the town of bombay mortal man of his mould being manifestly unable to resist the temptation of marching in step behind a big drum with the colours of a whole army on his shoulders especially when unlimited opportunity for scowling defiance at hostile crowds is thrown into the bargain by eight o'clock however matters had assumed a different complexion so had dhurm singh as he sat in the lock up vastly contented with his black eye and an ugly cut on the nose which he explained gleefully to sonny baba put him in mind of old times the latter through the medium of a fellow passenger who knew punjabi was meanwhile trying to make the old sinner understand that he had got the whole army into trouble and that personally he must stand his trial for a breach of the peace and tell him please said sonny baba with grieved diffidence that we all think he must have been drunk an odd smile struggled with the gravity of dr taylor's interpretation of the reply he says of course he was drunk as you all were in fact he bought a bottle of rum instead of taking his opium so that the effects might be uniform i'm telling you the sober truth my dear boy you see you don't know the people or the country or anything about them i do besides the tommies the regular soldiers i mean always make a point of getting drunk if they can when they go down or come up to the sea in ships perhaps it's the connection between reeling to and fro you know i beg your pardon no offence but really what with the tambourines dr taylor paused with his bright eyes on the boy's face they had been cabin companions and despite an absolute antagonism of thought chums it is so sometimes and as a rule such friendships last did you tell him the general was greatly displeased it is such a terrible beginning to our campaign so unscriptural mourned sonny baba evasively i don't know about that wasn't there some one who smote off some one else's ear and that i believe is what the old man is accused of doing i beg your pardon again but the coincidence is remarkable and what is he saying now put in the other hurriedly dr taylor paused he is calling down the blessing of the one true god upon your head now and for all eternity he answered slowly and there was a sort of hush in his voice sonny baba's eyes grew suspiciously moist but he shook his head dutifully how how sad he began very sad that you can't understand what he says interrupted dr taylor curtly because as i've only just time to catch my train i must be off salaam akali sahib dhurm singh standing to salute detained the doctor for a minute with eager questioning what is it asked sonny baba again what is it he wants to know dr taylor gave a short laugh he wants to know who the general's papa and mamma were because he isn't a gentleman you needn't stare so my dear fellow that is the first thing they find out about an englishman and it needs a lot of grit and go in a man to get over the initial drawback well good bye and if you will take my advice come up north see the people learn their language and appreciate their lives before you try to change them and look here don't go taking an akali about in a religious procession with drums and banners it isn't safe especially if you are going to bengal why bengal more than other places accustomed to lick them that's all hereditary instinct well good bye again and take my advice and come north the old swash buckler might be of some use to you there he'll be in the way down country ii some eighteen months afterwards the doctor being busy over that great hunt for the comma shaped bacillus which as is told elsewhere ended in a full stop for the seeker saw a man come into his verandah with a note the old swash buckler by all that's sinful he said to himself now what can he want according to the superscription of the letter it was a civil surgeon according to a few almost illegible words inside help for a suspected case of cholera in the european room of the serai dr taylor with grave doubts as to being able to supply either of these desires went into the verandah is it sonny baba he asked dhurm singh's delight was boundless since a sahib to whom you have once spoken is not as other sahibs just as a sahib whom you have once served becomes a demi god transfigured immortal undoubtedly it was the baba sahib for unto this semi religious title the old man had compounded his memories and his respect who else was it likely to be seeing that he dhurm singh had taken service with the master's son undoubtedly also he was ill though in the poor opinion of the dustlike one it was not cholera at least it need not have been if the baba sahib had only taken the remedy proposed to him opium hey asked taylor who in a huge pith hat which made him look like an animated mushroom was by this time walking over to the serai which was but a few hundred yards off the old akali grinned from ear to ear the massive curves of his lips stretching like india rubber the huzoor knows the great gift of god in the bad places of mind and body but the baba sahib will not have it so he understands not many things through being so young but he learns he learns there was a cheerful content in the apology suggestive of the possibility that dhurm singh had something to do with the teaching if so he had been an unsafe guide in one point for it was cholera cholera of the type which merges into a dreary convalescence of malarial fever during which dr taylor saw a good deal necessarily and unnecessarily of his old cabin companion thus renewing a friendship which like the majority of those struck up on board ship would have been forgotten but for an accident the accident of his doing civil duty for a colleague during ten days' leave civil surgeon indeed he would say as he sat on the edge of the bed amusing sonny baba when the latter began to pull round deuce take me if i could be that to save my life one of my patients the other day said i was the most uncivil person calling himself a gentleman she ever came across just because i told her she couldn't expect her liver to act if she lived the life of a strasburg goose 'liver' she cried 'why doctor it's all heart that is the matter with me' now my dear boy can you tell me why that unfortunate viscera the liver has got into such disrepute you may tell a patient every other organ in the body is in a disgraceful state of disrepair but if you hint at bile it's no use trying to be a popular physician stick to the heart that's my advice to a youngster entering the lists both for the healer and the healed it is ennobling now you for instance you will put it all down to your ardent affection for your fellow man but what the devil have you done with your muscle my dear fellow oh i know you have been doing the dal bhat trick in order to show your sympathy with the people and to assimilate your wants to theirs so that in some occult way they are to assimilate their religious beliefs to yours lordy lordy what an odd creature man is but you didn't get old dhurm singh to give up his kid pullao i'll go bail now he looks fit more like your church militant business than you do i've i've given up the army said sonny baba after an embarrassed pause and dr taylor actually refrained from asking why or from saying he was glad to hear it for there was a puzzled pained look in his patient's face which like any other unfavourable symptom had to be attended to at once in the verandah however he commented on the news to dhurm singh who with his turban off and his long white hair coiled round the high wooden comb like any woman's was putting an extra fine polish to his sword to while away the time huzoor it is true it did not suit us i told the baba sahib so from the beginning they were not of his caste as the protector may see i did all in my power i set aside the steel bracelets and the quoits i refrained myself to humility and carried a tambourine but to no purpose it did not suit so now praise be to the lord we have taken 'pinson' again and the baba is to serve the big lat padre bishop according to hukm orders as all the padre sahibs do as he drove home the doctor decided that he would gladly give a month's pay to know the history of the past year and a half the very imagination of it made him smile yet there must have been more than mere laughter in his thoughts for even when the lad grew strong enough to resume the arguments which had begun in the cabin the doctor never tried to force his confidence and sonny baba was reserved on some points but the enthusiasm and the fervour and the faith were strong in him as ever though the angelic voice now busied itself with hymns ancient and modern especially the ancient for face to face with the rig vedas the advantages of unquestioned authority had begun to show themselves there is no need to repeat the arguments on either side they are easily imagined given the characters of the arguers nor is it difficult to imagine the grip of hands when they parted one of them no doubt said something about the other not being far from a certain kingdom and the saying was not resented though no doubt the hearer laughed softly over the comma shaped bacillus as he watched sonny baba and the old swash buckler set off together to the wilderness again the former to itinerate from village to village learning the language and lives of the people he hoped by and by to convert the latter presumably to complete the education he had begun they were an odd couple ten to one on the swash buckler thought the doctor he is a fine old chap christmas had come and gone ere sonny baba reappeared in civilised society when he did so he looked weather beaten and yet spruce the natural result on a healthy young englishman of combined exposure to sunshine and a good washerman hullo cried the doctor cheerily back again in boiled shirts i see find 'em a bit stiff i expect after kurtas and dhotees the natives know how to dress comfortably at any rate sonny baba blushed under his bronze and hesitated the fact is he said with an effort i did not after all adopt native costume as i intended or perhaps here a faint smile obtruded itself i might say it wouldn't adopt me you see to enter into details i couldn't exactly give up a a night shirt or that sort of thing you know now could i and what with being a very sound sleeper and sleeping in public places serai's and dhurmsalas or out in the open somehow my day clothes were always being stolen as soon as ever i got a new outfit it disappeared until at last dhurm singh said yes what did dhurm singh say that it was very peculiar and that as the thieves didn't seem to fancy my english clothes it might be more economical here a half embarrassed laugh finally interrupted the sentence i don't think i was sorry went on the speaker hastily i found out afterwards that the people don't understand it one old fellow asked me why it was that though a native convert always had to wear trousers like the sahib logue the 'missen' people preferred to preach without them of course it was an exaggeration both ways but the more i see of these people the more necessary it seems to me that we should be ourselves armed at all points before beginning the attack and then their poverty their patience the insanitary conditions the needless suffering surely before we can touch their minds i know broke in the doctor cynically medical missions et cetera so it has come to that already has it old chap i don't know what you mean by its having come to that retorted sonny at a white heat but if you think it right to live in the lap of luxury while these brothers and sisters of ours so the arguments began again more fiercely than ever for the two fought at closer quarters so close that ofttimes the doctor had to retreat from his own position and seek another because sonny baba had already entrenched himself therein the which is a direful offence rousing determined resistance in a real argufier despite this sonny baba rented a room in the doctor's house and shared the doctor's dinners and library and hospital after the easy indian fashion while dhurm singh swaggered about among the dispensary badge wearers explaining at full length why he did not wear a badge like the rest of them his sahib had not yet settled which branch of the public service he would exalt by his presence he was young doubtless as yet but he made strides two years ago he had found him in a very poor naukeri service in which he paid all the rupees and no one gave him anything a topsy turvy arrangement not that his sahib needed the paisas he was rich as a nawab then he thought of being a padre sahib now it was doctore department but in his dhurm singh's opinion that was not much either personally he would just as soon wear no badge as one of those with charitable dispensary on it but only god knew where the baba sahib might end at simla as burra lat sahib no doubt till then it was more dignified to refrain from ignoble badges of which afterwards one might be ashamed and while he talked in this fashion he sat in the sunshine combing his long hair and piously wondering how folk could defile their insides with tobacco then he would stroll off into the shadow and bring out the black lump of dreams yet if sonny baba came out into the verandah calling after the indian fashion for some one the broad northern accent was always ready with its huzoor so the months passed in preparations and the angelic voice might have been heard to sing lead kindly light more often than any other hymn in the book about this time also sonny baba speaking of dhurm singh and his ways used to quote in rather a patronising manner a certain text regarding those who might expect to be beaten with few stripes a speech which roused the doctor to vigorous retort he had observed he said that the remark held good about most honest healthy men who could play singlestick the fact being however that sonny baba was beginning to get obstinate as is only natural when a man passes five and twenty it was time he felt to begin work in earnest for the enthusiasm and the faith and the fervour were as hot as ever in him still looking back on the last three years he hardly understood why he had done so little there seems so much to learn before one can even begin on the problem he sighed and then dear as the old man is i really think dhurm singh is a drawback i hoped when we left the army but indeed taylor i think even you will allow that he is hardly the sort of man for a missionary's servant well i don't know that i should classify him under that head but then he paused thinking perhaps that when all was said and done the master was no more fit for the place than the servant i'm glad you agree with me put in sonny eagerly for i've quite made up my mind to a change you have no idea how the old fellow hectors over getting me a pint of milk or a couple of eggs you would think i was about to loot a whole village i must own that i invariably get what i want that too without the least unpleasantness but it is not edifying not the sort of thing that ought to go on then his habit of eating opium it does not seem to hurt him i own but that again is not what it ought to be it is bad enough to belong to a race who while they go about with words of condemnation on their lips pardon me murmured the doctor i pass on their lips are at the same time battening on the proceeds of an infamous monopoly of a drug dealing death and disease to a whole continent one third of one per cent of the total population murmured the doctor again you forget the opium grown in china put in sonny with great heat my dear fellow isn't there a story somewhere about the emperor of china's clothes if i remember right he forgot to put 'em on and then every one was afraid to tell him he was naked it appears to me that in this opium business the good gentleman hasn't a rag of reason for complaint but that you are all afraid to say so if we can prevent our subjects from growing poppy except under supervision why can't he it isn't jonah's gourd but a three month crop sonny baba began to walk up and down the room excitedly it is perfectly inexplicable to me how a man like you excuse me interrupted the doctor i'll explain i'm forty four years of age two and twenty years of that i lived in a parish in scotland where every decent respectable body would have thought shame to himself if he didn't have more whisky than he could carry on market days the other two and twenty i've spent in india out of cantonments where they've learnt the trick from us i only remember having met two drunken men in all those years and though i see more of the natives than most people i can only call to mind three who might be said to have suffered seriously from the effects of opium but it is a subject which it is quite useless to discuss it turns on a question of heredity like most things the indo germanic races never have taken and never will take to narcotics so naturally they abuse them and drink instead chacun a son gout and mine is to give poor old dhurm singh an extra pension when i go itinerating and send him back to end his days in peace in his village the doctor whistled don't you wish you may get him to do it he must if he is a hindrance to the work and if your work is a hindrance to him that's what it comes to all round he was put in charge of you and mark my words dhurm singh will do it dhurm nal until he goes to settle the vexed question what vexed question whether his work or yours was the better iii dhurm singh huzoor after five and twenty years the same appeal the same reply but on that may night and july day neither the man nor the woman had any doubt as to what was to come next the universe held no possibility save the mem sahib or sonny baba but the latter now it came to his turn hesitated even while he was conscious that to a well balanced mind capable of weighing advantage and disadvantage fairly there ought to be no difficulty in telling any one that you had no further need for his services the recollection of certain thin lipped dignified self respecting conversations overheard at home sprang to memory obtrusively then mary ann it had better be this day month yes ma'am this day month if you please and if you please ma'am wednesdays and saturdays from eleven till one if convenient for a character but things were different somehow in this heathen country which was so backward in education so ignorant of liberty equality and ahem dhurm singh began sonny once more rather hurriedly huzoor i i am going to make a complete change of plan dhurm singh i i am going to begin work on a new principle i i am going to start in another part of the country where i shall not require er many things i have hitherto required he paused well satisfied at his plunge in medias res dhurm singh standing attention at the door smiled approvingly it is a good word huzoor so said the gurus also when do we start half an hour afterwards sonny baba in rather a shamefaced manner told the doctor that after all he had come to the conclusion it would be better not to dismiss dhurm singh to begin with the village children delighted in his tales and then it was a triviality no doubt perhaps in a measure a giving in to prejudice the elders certainly set store by position for instance they were always more ready to listen to him if the old swash buckler had had an opportunity of giving the family history embellishments and all in addition dhurm singh had promised to amend his ways generally to spend his days in compounding pills and potions instead of hectoring about finally he had agreed to an allowance of opium swearing dhurm nal to take no more than was served out by the master of course said sonny baba at this juncture with a considerate superiority which raised every atom of the doctor's original sin i shall be careful i shall not dock it too much at once but in the course of a year or two i hope to break him entirely of this most pernicious habit which has never done him or his surroundings the least harm growled taylor savagely upon my soul i begin to wish i were five and twenty again if only that i might be as cock sure of being right about everything as you are as it is even the bacillus he wrinkled his eyes over the microscope once more and did not finish his sentence after this dhurm singh might have been seen any day of the week in the dispensary verandah grinding away vigorously with pestle and mortar at unsavoury medicaments rolling pills under his flexible brown fingers or polishing up surgical instruments with all the fervour bestowed of yore on the old sword lo if the baba sahib cares not for being a big hakm magistrate ruler sure the next best thing is to be a big hakeem doctor he would say smiling simply at his own wit and doth not the guru say 'fight with no weapon but the sword of the spirit' besides when i feel like fighting i can put an edge to the knives or pound harder with the pestle god knows they may both do more damage than a sabre then the rolling of pills is ever the first step towards dream getting thus in all ways i dhurm singh sikh ex duffadar pinson wallah and akali am consoled but there god is good to the sikh know you that he never made an ugly one yet this was a favourite boast of the old man's backed always should doubts be expressed by a modest appeal to his own looks joined to an assertion which by the way was perfectly true that he was the meanest looking of ten brothers so in due season the doctor once more watched the odd couple pass out together into the wilderness and this time noticing the change in sonny baba and remembering the raw lad who had been his cabin companion he so to speak put his whole pile on dhurm singh unless the boy killed him with philanthropy the rains after an unusually heavy fall had ceased early the result being an epidemic of autumnal fever now the cholera may kill its thousands but year by year with every now and again a sort of jubilee over its own strength malaria kills its tens of thousands quietly unostentatiously so quietly that it is only when the officer in charge of a district finds himself during his cold weather camp deciding the rival claims to hereditary offices day after day in village after village that even he realises how widely the archangel azrael has spread his wings over the people the doctor however judging simply by the weather sent sonny into the jungles well supplied with that carmine tinted quinine which carries the fact of its being government property in its colour a useless attempt to prevent the sale of charity in a land where the regulation five grain powder is as much a part of the currency as a two anna bit well supplied yet at the same time with cautions not to be over generous except in genuine cases let him stick to the country medicines as prophylactics opium and aconite were to be had for the buying and if he did wander into the low jungles close to the hills and if he could be tolerant and learn not to despise old wisdom let him prescribe the former in preference to the latter though perhaps that was too much to expect from a five and twenty year old who was cock sure he knew best i know nothing of myself replied sonny in all seriousness the eternal right decides there lies the difference between you and me pardon me if i say between the christian and the unbeliever you trust to your finite mind i to something which is and was which cannot err and dhurm singh gleefully employed in turning a cash transport mule with its fixings into a perambulating dispensary was keeping up his character of devotee by repeating verses from the adhee grunt'h in sing song his round mellow voice echoing out through the sunshine remember oh man the primal truth the truth ere the world began the truth which is and the truth which must remain how can this truth be told save by doing the will of the lord listen said taylor and sonny baba moved uneasily in his chair when these same preparations were complete the old man's delight was huge and he drove the mule forth to the wilderness before him with much futile waving of the stick which had replaced the sword even over that abnegation he was cheerful lo i am turned a dhundi wallah in mine old age as becomes the pious minded ari thou misbegotten offspring of a mixed race doomed to childless extinction wilt stray from the beaten path wouldst steal the corn of others when thy master is a missen sahib and thy tender a devotee may the uttermost then to sonny's pained reproof he would reply cheerfully as ever that he had understood the refraining of his tongue from abuse was to be towards those born of adam and this was not even a god created thing but a nondescript invented by the sahib logue cheerful always even when as time went on his daily pills of opium were mixed with quinine he sat and compounded them himself dhurm nal keeping no grain of the beloved dream giver from the sacrilegious mixture and telling the full tale of the fiat pillulae into the master's locked medicine chest whence they were doled out daily for the first month or more everything went smoothly never before had sonny baba had such attentive listeners to the great truths he expounded as a preliminary to his other work never before had he felt that he was really on the right tack really had his opportunity of a fair hearing the letters he wrote home to his aunt who fond woman had faithfully followed as woman can do every step in the career of her darling with unswerving confidence filled that excellent creature with sheer unalloyed delight she told all her circle of friends that her nephew had fulfilled her dearest wishes in going in for the medical mission which was undoubtedly the only way of getting at the poor dear natives and sonny in less emotional fashion felt this to be so true that he worked as he had never worked before a sort of feverish desire to utilise every opportunity to lose no occasion for preaching the great gospel of peace came over him and he spared himself not at all after the manner of his kind so that sometimes returning tired out in evening from some long tramp it was a relief to find the old swash buckler ready with kid pullao or rose chikken and to see the tea kettle swinging over a fire of twigs sometimes after they entered the tract of forest land near the foot of the hills the indefatigable old poacher would produce a stew of black partridge and once sonny coming home to the tiny tent late at night found his henchman keeping an eye on roast pork and at the same time utilising the flame light in giving a suspicious clean to the biggest surgical knife a queer picture seen by the fire leaping and dancing up into the shadows of a mango grove but one evening sonny came home with no appetite for dinner and half an hour afterwards he was blue and shivering in the cold fit of ague if the huzoor would take some of my pills said dhurm singh wistfully look at me nothing touches me and lo am i not three times as near the grave as the baba sahib there is no need to describe the scorn which this suggestion met as for the pills where would the old sinner be but for the quinine contained therein this was nothing but a chill an isolated attack he would take an extra dose of the specific and be done with it but the third day suddenly in the very middle of an eloquent appeal he felt goose skin going in thrills down his back and five minutes after the only sound he could make was the chattering of his teeth if the huzoor began dhurm singh but was checked by the frown on the master's face for the lad had grit and fire in him neither of these however avail much against a tertian ague and it was not long before sonny baba in the half querulous half hysterical stage before the hot fit merges into perspiration confided with tears to the old swash buckler that it was no use he was an accursed being from the very beginning had it not been so and then he retailed garrulously many and many an incident of the past three years forgotten by his retainer in which something had occurred to mar the smooth working of good luck something as often as not it struck the listener to be referred to his own share in the business to the speaker it was otherwise he was not fit for the work he was of no account and now when at long last the time had come when he felt that his hand was on the plough it is time the baba sahib took his quinine remarked dhurm singh sagely unsympathetically if the huzoor will give the keys of the chest this dust like one will bring the medicine dhurm nal the last words came softly half to himself and an important self satisfied smile broadened the open face as he made his choice among the bottles lo there it is he continued laying two pills in the burning hand before passing his one arm under the burning body but the huzoor must have faith without it medicine is but a bad taste in the mouth he who believes shall be saved perhaps sonny baba took his advice yet once again perhaps the quinine got a fair hold of the enemy at last certain it is that from the time dhurm singh commenced to bring the pills dhurm nal the ague began to abate at the end of a week sonny baba was eating rose chicken once more with appetite that evening as the sun was setting red over the thick brakes of sugar cane the old man sat pounding diligently with pestle and mortar while he intoned away at the adhee grunt'h god asks no man of his birth he asks him what he has done since all are the seed of god lo what is the world but clay tho' the pots are of many moulds and sonny baba lying out in the shade blissfully conscious that he was getting better nay that he was better raised himself on one arm and looked over with moist eyes to the old man what are you doing dhurm singh this slave makes pills the huzoor hath eaten so many and those of the dust like one have given out also lo i fill the bottles against the return of the baba sahib to his medicine chest but i say are you sure you have made them right the huzoor may rest satisfied five grains of the blessed medicine for the master and the other as before it is dhurm nal huzoor so you call it a blessed medicine now dhurm singh wherefore not since the master is better well the addition of that small quantity of ipecacuanha which i began let me see that day when i was so bad certainly had a marvellous effect i shall write and tell taylor about it he was inclined to sneer at the idea just because he didn't suggest it doctors are awfully jealous of each other that's the worst of them these remarks were made mostly for his own benefit as he lay comfortably watching the stars come out one by one as the daylight died it was that same night that dhurm singh had his first go of ague it shook him as a sharp attack of malarious fever does shake a native past his prime and sonny baba amid his regrets could not avoid a certain elation so much for opium he said and yet in his heart of hearts a fear gained ground that perhaps he might have been over rapid in diminishing the dose now that the old man was actually ill it seemed unkind to deny him comfort so an addition was made to the number of pills thus increasing the amount both of opium and quinine it was more than a month later that a small procession of two men carrying a string bed on their heads and one man driving a pack mule turned into the dispensary compound it is the old man said sonny baba to the doctor and i'm afraid he paused before the break in his own voice it was that terai land i was as bad as could be and thought i should have to give up but under providence quinine and ipec pulled me round to do the best work i have ever done in my life but he he would stick to the opium and then i'm afraid that at first i hardly noticed you see he went round as usual bragging he was better so i didn't think the work was so absorbing and i myself felt so fit otherwise i might have gone to a healthier part though of course the impression would not have been so good still it came upon me quite by surprise three days ago and and i've brought him in by forced marches you the voice failed again indeed there was no need for more the doctor being already on his knees by the bed making his examination suddenly he looked up why the devil did you stop his opium you young fool here boota mull the syringe and a disc of morphia sharp but after all what does anything matter so long as you save your own soul alive sonny baba looking very white drew himself up into dignity we can discuss that question by and by dr taylor in the mean time let me warn you that the man has already had ten grains of opium in the last twenty four hours the doctor's quick hands were at the closed eyelids ten grains bosh but as you say those questions can be settled by and by when he is dead if you like sonny baba's face had grown whiter still i tell you he has had the opium i gave it to him myself i was afraid he paused abruptly and the doctor looking up shot a rapid glance of negation towards him there's a mistake or else it doesn't matter now at any rate the thing is done but sonny baba did not hear the latter words he was beside the mule fumbling hastily in the travelling dispensary of which the old man had been so proud for the medicine chest his hands trembled as he brought it back and dr taylor his face unseen yet with its keenness shown in every movement of the capable hands busy over the morphia heard an odd sound something between a gasp and a cry behind him then some one came and knelt down at the other side of the bed dhurm singh but there was no answer dhurm singh you can tell them it was dhurm nal and that i killed you killed him fudge though upon my soul it would serve you right if you had so the old sinner changed the pills and it wasn't the ipec after all most reprehensible practice and upon my soul it would serve him right if he did die now don't be a fool man i tell you he shan't die i won't let him die besides he can't die it's impossible absolutely impossible despite his despair and dejection the young man gave a wan smile at the other's vehemence and why because of you naturally you don't suppose that you're fit to be trusted alone with a medicine chest do you boota mull if you don't hurry up with that turpentine and the brandy mixture i'll report you so it wasn't the ipec after all i'm glad of that in after years the young fellow used to deny strenuously that it had been the opium either plainly and palpably he had been cured of his fever by faith and as for dhurm singh what the doctor said was true he could not be spared as yet how could he be spared when even now from the verandah came a woman's voice soft confident dhurm singh sonny baba huzoor dhurm nal and any one looking out might have seen a very old man gorgeous in scarlet raiment decked with golden lace and golden curls as a child's head nestled up against a solitary arm and a child's fingers played with the solitary medal or tugged unavailingly at the hilt of the old sword the huzoor is too young would come the broad arrogant voice but he will learn he will learn even a sikh is made not born he must wait till the years bring the sacred steel let the huzoor rest awhile peacefully and old dhurm will sing to him then there would be a surreptitious swallowing of a pill before the drowsy chant began he is of the khalsa who combats in the van who gives in charity who loves the poor he is of the khalsa whose mind is set on god who never fears though often overcome knowing all men created of one god he is of the khalsa who lives in arms who combats with the wrong who keeps the faith so there would be a silence broken only by the even breathing of the old man and the child for sonny baba and his wife watching the scene from within only looked into each other's eyes and said nothing the bhut baby according to established precedent it is reported under section so and so that one buddha singh of kidderjana having died his rightful heirs inherit the court reader's voice hurried the liquid urdu syllables into long sleepy cadences like the drone of a humble bee entangled in the swaying punkah overhead backwards and forwards rising and falling the rhythm seemed to become part of me until the colourless reports were a monotonous lullaby and each wave of sound and motion bore me farther from earth nearer to the land of dreams ah if the right people always inherited and my old uncle received ticket of leave from the gout i might afford furlough and stand once more on that big boulder at the foot of the one stone pool waiting for a new ring of light to show on the dark eddy by the far side a ring with a swirl and a gleam of silver scales in the centre a tightening line under the finger till the reel went whirr rr rr rr it was a lovely dream while it lasted according to established precedent the canal officer reports under section so and so that certain rebellious persons in chori pani have opened the sluices of the cut and taken water that did not belong to them the heather sweet breeze off the one stone pool ceased to blow and i was back with the punkah in the humanity laden atmosphere of the court house where even the mosquitoes were glutted and the lizards hanging head downwards on the wall looked as if they had congestion of the brain stealing water poor wretches who could blame them with their crops withering in the june sun and the sluice doors within reach even a juicy apple on a hot day is irresistible despite farmer smith's big dog watching from below while you sit on the lower branch and jerry sits on the upper eating all the ripe fruit just to pass the time and thanking providence meanwhile for making you christian children in a cider country according to established precedent it is reported under section so and so that the devil was born three days ago in village hairan wallah orders are requested meanwhile the chowkidar watchman remains watching the same startled into wakefulness i looked sharply to see if the reader had not been nodding in his turn but my alertness merely produced a respectful iteration of the paragraph which showed all too clearly my subordinate's explanation of the sudden display of attention the suspicion of sleep is always irritating sarishtadar clerk of the court i began in english what the devil nossir interrupted the reader suavely in the same language pardon the suggestion sir but the devil is somewhat free translation sir in dictionary bhut the word used sir equals an indefinite devil thus a devil a fiend a imp pardon the indiscretion sir an imp a glow of proud humility at his own quick detection of these trivial errors filled up the pause which followed while the punkah went on swinging and i sat wondering if i were asleep or awake finally the sarishtadar dipped his pen in the ink fluttered the superfluous moisture on the carpet and suggested deferentially that the chowkidar was waiting for orders a sudden curiosity as to what his self complacent brain surcharged with western culture would do with the situation made me reply curtly the usual orders i managed to forbear laughing in the grave face raised to mine in deprecating apology i am unable sir he said after a pause to recall at the present moment any section penal or civil suitable to occasion would you kindly jog memory sir by suggesting if it is under judicial or administrative heads or perhaps he added as a bright after thought it is political job then i regret to say i went off into yells of unseemly mirth as most englishmen have to do at times over the portentous solemnity of the aryan brother there was a stir in the verandah a sudden waking to renewed effort on the part of the punkah coolie resulting in a general breeziness or was it that terence o'reilly our young irish doctor as he came into the darkened court brought with him a thought of fresh air a remembrance of nature in her sunniest most lovable moods he invariably suggested such things to me at any rate and as he paused in astonishment at my indecorous occupation i thought once more that it was a pleasure simply to look at him his face sympathised promptly with the unknown joke whwhat the divvle are ye laughing at me he asked in a rich brogue as he seated himself astride a chair in which equestrian position his dandy costume for polo showed to great advantage nero fiddling over the flames of rome is sympathy itself compared to the indifference with which we often speak the first lines of a coming tragedy in every day life so it was with a jest that i introduced terence o'reilly to the existence of the bhut baby and in so doing became instantly aware that he surpassed me in other things besides good looks he could scarcely be said to become grave for to lose brightness would have been to lose the essence of the man but his expression grew to a still more vivid reflex of his mind 'twill be one of those poor little craytures that come into this worrld god knows why he said with an infinite tenderness of voice ten to wan 'tis better it should die fifty to wan i can do nothing to help it but i'll ride over and see annyhow the sarishtadar laid aside his pen somewhat mournfully the practical being out of his line while i smitten by admiration into immediate regret at my own indifference murmured something about having thought of going over next morning there's no time loike the present my dear fellow he replied buoyantly the pony's at the door and sure i'm got up for riding annyhow and as he spoke he stretched out his long legs and surveyed their immaculate boots and breeches critically and what will your team do without their best forward i asked feeling a certain captiousness at his prompt decision get along with your blarney sure it's practising and you can take my place at that anny day indeed 'twas to fetch you i ventured into the dock for whin i caught a glimpse of your face at the jail this morning i said to meself 'terence me bhoy that's a case of polo or blue pill for by the powers his liver's not acting' so 'twas to hound you into exercise i came annyhow a feverish desire to amend and excuse my own lukewarmness shot up through the loophole his words afforded to tell the truth i was feeling a bit slack but if you'll wait five minutes while i slip over to the bungalow and change my clothes i'll ride with you to hairan wallah it will be better for me than polo i might get over heated you know 'tis over eating not over heating that's the matter with you me bhoy he replied coolly but i'm proud and by the powers he added starting up in great excitement you shall ride my pony i call him blue pill for he's better than wan anny day and while you're dressing i'll send me syce round for the lily of killarney i've a bet on her at the gymkhana next monday and we'll try her on the quiet against the stable half an hour afterwards i was enjoying plenteous exercise and it seemed to me far behind as if the lily a great black beast without a single white hair on her was trying to buck terence over into the saffron coloured horizon as she went along in a series of wild bounds he came back to me however after a time as fresh as paint but the mare with head down and heaving flanks appeared to have had enough of it 'tis a pity the faymale sex is so narvous he said casually ye can't hold 'em responsible for annything but if it wasn't for hysteria they'd be angels entirely she has the paces of wan annyhow fourteen miles of constant canal cuts that were a perpetual joy to the doctor and a terror to me brought us to hairan wallah a large village standing among irrigated fields here cautious inquiries for the devil led us to a cluster of mud huts beyond the pale where the low caste servants of the community dwelt apart before reaching it we were joined by the head men and their followers all anxious to explain and excuse the calamity which had befallen their reputation but as the fear of evil eye had prevented any of them from personally inspecting the fiend the accounts of its appearance were wildly conflicting the doctor indeed refused to listen to them on the ground that it was sheer waste of time and rode along affably discussing the crops with an aged patriarch his manner changed however when we were requested to dismount and he led the way into the enclosure where guarded by the police chowkidar the devil baby lay awaiting government orders the courtyard was hung round with coloured thread old iron and other devices against witchcraft and a group of low caste men and women were huddled up dejectedly in one corner so far the crowd followed us but when some of the reputed relations showed us into a dark out house at the further end even curiosity failed to prevent a visible hanging back blinded by the change from the glare outside i could at first see nothing but my companion's tall form bending over a bundle of rags on a low stool beside which a half naked hag sat chanting a guttural charm and before i regained clearer sight his voice rang out in tones of evident relief by the powers 'tis only a black albino the bull was perfect seeing that it conveyed succinctly a very accurate description the bhut baby was a black a very black albino for the abnormal colouring was confined to its hair which was unusally well developed and grew in tight clustering curls over its head like a coachman's wig the faint eyebrows and eyelashes were also white and the result if not devilish was extremely startling for the rest it was as fine a man child as ever came to gladden a mother's heart i deemed it asleep till i saw the doctor bend closer and then raise the eyelid in keen professional scrutiny where's the mother he cried turning like lightning on the nearest male relative and seizing him by the scruff of the neck in order to emphasise his words bring her at once or i'll go inside and fetch her myself the child has been left to starve he added rapidly in english and it's nigh dead of neglect you're a magistrate make them bring the devil of a mother here at once or it will die but they met my commands and remonstrances with frightened obstinacy asserting after some hesitation that the mother was dead had died virtuously of shame at bringing such disgrace to her people i had every reason to believe this statement was a lie but no means of proving it to be one for of course the whole village favoured it then there came to terence o'reilly's face a look that was good to see but not to endure and if the poor little creature has lost its own mother he cried in that strong round voice of his are there no other women among you all with the milk of kindness in their breasts that will give it a drink for the sake of the time when they took suck themselves look at it what are you all frightened of 'tis as fine a babe as a woman could bear only the white hair of it and god knows we shall all come to that if we are spared look at it i say handle it and see for yourselves suiting the action to the word he lifted the infant in his arms and carried it out to the lingering light of day among the crowd which fell back in alarm from him and his burden he did indeed look somewhat of an avenging angel with his face ablaze with indignant appeal there was a scuttling from behind as some of the head men tried to force a sweeper woman to the front but ere they succeeded she had promptly gone into hysterics and so roused a murmur of disapprobation and dismay among the rest her shrieks brought terence back to earth and ceasing to hold the child at arm's length as if offering it for acceptance he turned to me once more at least your magistracy can make them bring me milk if ye can't even do that then god help the british rule stung by the sarcasm i exerted myself to such an extent that three separate head men arrived breathless at the same moment with large lotahs full of nourishment for the devil or any one else on whom the presence was foolish enough to bestow it so much lay within their conceptions of duty the scene which followed will linger in my memory until memory itself ceases to be terence in polo costume seated on a string bed under the darkening skies with the devil on his lap feeding it methodically with the corner of his pocket handkerchief moistened in the milk held by three trembling lambadars beside him the presence with thank god sufficient vitality left for admiration and round about a cloud of awestruck witnesses wondering at his audacity doubtful of its effect on the future sure 'tis the firrst toime i ever did dhry nurse he remarked after a long silence during which i became absorbingly interested in the little imp's growing desire for life hark to that now the ungrateful divvle's wanting to cry just because it's got something to digest as if that wasn't the firrst duty of a human stomach great moses don't ye think it's time you stepped in as ripresentative of the kaiser i hind and took things in hand a bit ah it's after having dill water ye are now is it whist whist whist now he walked up and down the crowd swaying from him as he dandled the infant with what seemed to me marvellous skill while i did my best to argue sense into the dull brains of the villagers i was quite unsuccessful of course and after many words found myself as before with two courses open to me either to leave the bhut baby where it was or give it in charge of the head men the one a swift the other a more tardy certainty of death from that mysterious disease called by the cause of not drinking milk properly which figures so largely in the records of infant mortality in india the former for choice since as terence remarked it would save trouble to kill it at the beginning instead of the end of its life so the magistracy can do nothing he said at last thin i will chowkidar take this baby to the headquarters' hospital i'm master there annyhow and i'll make it anny case i please and dye its hair an' no man shall say me nay so the chowkidar was ordered to carry the devil to hospital to be cured of its devilry and we rode home in frantic haste because terence was engaged to sing killaloe that evening in barracks some of the relations ran about a mile after us yelling out blessings for having removed the curse from them six weeks after i saw an atrocious hag nursing a white haired infant in the doctor's own compound and questioned him on the subject the fact is he said ruefully it gave fits to the patients i tried shaving its head but it grew so fast and the white eyelashes of it betrayed the cloven hoof and dye wouldn't stick on so i've hired a harridan on two rupees a month to look after it under my own eye there was no doubt something of combativeness in this particular instance of terence o'reilly's charity but the bhut baby was by no means the only pensioner on his bounty the row of mud houses beyond the cook room was filled with the halt the maimed and the blind especially the latter for the fame of his infinite skill and patience as an eye doctor was spreading far and wide besides he had the secret possessed by some englishmen unconsciously of inspiring the natives with absolutely unbounded devotion and many of his patients would literally have laid down their lives for him among others his bearer a high caste brahman the man who had originally come to him for blindness of long standing had on recovery made his way straight from hospital to the doctor's house and announced his intention of serving him till death what are hands and feet or brain he answered calmly to all objections if they have not eyes to guide them therefore are they all predestined since all time to be servants to my lord the light bringer for ever and ever treated at first as a joke shivdeo's determination had outlived opposition and at the time of the bhut baby's advent he had achieved his intention of becoming trusted personal attendant to the light of the world for without some such allusion to the benefit he had received at his hands he never spoke of his master the introduction of a baby pariah to begin with and devil to follow brought about a temporary disturbance of his office for he was haughty with all the pride of his race and superstitious beyond belief but after a week of dismissal consequent on failing to provide the harridan with proper milk for the bottle shivdeo almost blind again with fruitless tears crept back to the light giver's feet and swore a big oath to feed the low caste demon himself if thereby he might return to the only life he could live he kept his promise of strict neutrality to the letter never by word or deed showing his aversion to the child affecting indeed not to see it with those mild short sighted eyes of his yet as it grew older he must often have been brought into contact with the child for it would crawl after the doctor like a dog despite the peculiarity of its silvery curls and pale blue eyes it was really pretty and by the time it was two years old had picked up such a variety of comical tricks and odd ways that boots as we called it became quite an institution with the doctor's friends we used to send for it to the verandah and laugh at the silent agility with which it tumbled for sweetmeats and the equally silent quickness of its mimicry for to all intents and purposes the child was dumb beyond a very rare repetition of the feeble wail i had first heard from it in the doctor's arms at hairan wallah it made no articulate sound whatever but once or twice when we tired of it and forgot its presence i have heard a purring noise like a cat and looking down found that the little creature was curled up with its silver curls resting on the doctor's foot in perfect content he spent many hours in demonstrating its full possession of all five senses and always declared it would speak in time certainly if speech went by intelligence it would have been the most eloquent of babies as it was its unusual silence undoubtedly added to its uncanny appearance and helped to strengthen the still lingering belief in its devilish origin as long however as terence o'reilly's voice gave the orders for its well being not a soul in his compound or elsewhere would have dreamt of disobedience indeed it often struck me that poor little boots lived by virtue of his exuberant vitality and by nothing else i remember one evening we had been screaming with laughter over the comical little creature's mimicry of shivdeo's stately short sighted way of bringing in whisky and soda water the applause seemed to get into the baby's brain and it took us off one after the other with such deadly truth that we nearly rolled off our chairs then some one suggested that we should ask it to imitate terence who happened to be absent and when it failed to respond a young subaltern thinking it had not understood came out with a fair copy of the doctor's round rich brogue we were all startled at the result the child made for the speaker like a wild beast stopped suddenly then crept away with silent tears brimming up into its eyes i think we all felt a bit ashamed especially when terence coming in from a patient found boots curled up asleep in a damp corner by the tattie and with a mild rebuke that 'twas enough to give the poor little crayture fayver an' ague lifted the child in his arms and proceeded to carry it across the garden to its harridan but he had hardly raised it before shivdeo gliding in like a ghost from heaven knows where came forward and took the child from him with a rapid insistence that left me wondering so when the man brought me my parting cheroot i questioned him on his interference he looked startled for a moment then replied gravely that it was not meet for the light of the universe to bear a sweeper's child in his bosom nor is it meet for a brahman either i returned feeling sure he had some other reason the man's eyes flashed before they dropped submissively nor is it meet for a brahman to serve but the presence knows that this slave cares not if he wakes as a dog so that the lord of light remains to give sight to the blind shortly after this boots sickened for some childish complaint in the course of which pneumonia developed making it hover for a day or two between this world and the next once more terence stood between the bhut baby and the shadow of death and had it been the heir of princes the resources of modern science could not have been more diligently ransacked for its benefit indeed the doctor looked quite worn out when i met him one morning going as he said to give himself a freshener by taking the lily round the steeple chase course you're over working terence said i noting his fine drawn clearness of feature up all night after boots i'm glad to hear the little fellow's better by the way and blue pill waiting for you day after day till after dark at the hospital gates to say nothing of gymkhanas it won't do for long i'm serious about it old chap are you well it's kind of you to be that he laughed though mayhap 'twould be more of a change for your friends if you were the t'other thing don't fret yourself about me annyhow i'm well enough maybe 'tis having done dhry nurse to him at first that makes me feel boots on me mind but i think he's well through and d'ye know the little beggar wouldn't touch a thing unless i gave it him 'tis a queer place this worrld annyhow his voice had a suspicion of a break in it and his eyes were brighter than ever whence i augured that he felt worse than he cared to confess next day he sent a note asking me to inspect the jail for him as he was going to try conclusions with his liver the day after i found him in bed but lively then the deadly fever which kills so many fine young fellows in india laid fast hold on him and for three long weeks we who loved him watched the struggle for life helpless to do aught save keep up his strength as best we might against the coming crisis it was as if a calamity had befallen the whole station men when they met each other asked first of all how he was and women sent jellies and soups enough for a regiment to the bungalow where the young doctor who had soothed so many of their troubles lay bravely fighting out his own quite a crowd of natives gathered round the gate by early dawn waiting for news of the past night and so far as i knew shivdeo never left the verandah during all those weary days i could see him from my post by the bed sitting like a bronze statue against a pillar whence my slightest sign would rouse him for i assumed the office of head nurse after terence full of gratitude for the kindly offers of help showered upon him had said with a wistful gleam of the old mischief but i loike your sober face best old man it makes me feel so pious i sent in for leave that morning and never left him again it was the twenty sixth day about ten o'clock in the evening that the doctor in charge shook his head over my patient sorrowfully he is terribly weak but while there's life we shall know by dawn the old formula fell on my ears though i had been waiting for it with a sense of sickening failure and unable to reply i turned away from the figure which lay so still and lifeless despite all my care as i did so i noticed shivdeo listening with eyes and ears at the door for the last three days the man had been strangely restless and more than once i had discovered odd things disposed about the room and even on poor terence's pillow things used as talismans to keep away the evil eye such as i had seen in hairan wallah when the bhut baby was born and i had smiled good heavens how ignorant we are in india smiled at the silly superstition which evidently lingered in shivdeo's mind he came to me when the doctor left to ask if he had understood rightly that the great hour of hope or dread drew nigh i told him we should know by dawn and that till then all must be quiet as the grave his face startled me by its intensity as standing at the foot of the bed he fixed his eyes on the unconscious face of his master and salaamed to it with all the reverence he would have given to a god but he spoke calmly to me saying that as i would doubtless be loth to leave the room he would order the servants to bring me something to eat there he presently appeared bearing the tray himself giving as a reason for this unusual service his desire to avoid any disturbance it was just upon twelve o'clock when with shivdeo's help i gave terence who was quite unconscious a few drops of stimulant before sitting down with a sinking heart to my anxious watch it was early april and the doors set wide open to let in the cool air showed a stretch of moonlit grass where shadows from the unseen trees above quivered and shifted as the night wind stirred the leaves in the breathless silence i could hear even the faint respiration of the sick man and found myself counting its rise and fall until the last thing i remembered was shivdeo's immovable figure with the moonlight streaming full in his face when i awoke the rapid eastern dawn had come the sparrows were twittering in the verandah and shivdeo stood by his master's bed holding his finger to his lips hush he whispered as my eyes met his the light has brought life to the giver of light it must have been the sound of wheels which woke me for ere i had time to reply the doctor entered the room and after a glance at his patient shook me silently by the hand i believe he's through he said when he had cautiously examined the sleeping man fever gone pulse stronger i scarcely dared to hope for it even with his splendid constitution hullo what's that it was only a tiny spot of blood on the forehead just where the trident of shiva is painted by his worshippers but it showed vividly against the pallor of the skin there is a little spot by the light giver's feet also remarked shivdeo quietly i noticed it yesterday just after the presence cut his hand with the soda water bottle and sure enough there was one i can't think how i came to fall asleep i said to him after the doctor had gone just at the critical time too when i was most wanted the man smiled we do not always guess aright when we are wanted huzoor you slept and the light giver got better it is god's way he has refreshed you both refreshed i retorted crossly i feel as if i had been pounded in a mortar i had the most frightful dreams but i can't recall what they were it is not well to try replied shivdeo with rather an odd look if i were the presence i would forget them there is enough evil to come without recalling what is past and over for ever perhaps involuntarily i followed his suggestion for though i chased the fleeting memory more than once through my brain i never overtook it terence o'reilly made a quick recovery but in view of the fast approaching hot weather the doctors put him on board ship as soon as it could be done with safety hurry was the order of the day so it was not until my return from seeing him to bombay that i found time for outside affairs then it was that shivdeo informed me of poor little boots' death in the interval as the presence was aware he said it had been thought advisable when perfect quiet was necessary to the light bringer to send the child away from the compound because of the difficulty experienced in keeping it out of the house so it had gone with its nurse to the cantonment sweeper's hut where it had caught fresh cold and died by the advice of the native doctor who had seen it he had kept the death secret at first from fear of the news delaying his master's recovery i made every inquiry but found nothing of any kind to give rise to suspicion of foul play the native doctor had sent medicine three days running as for bronchitis and on the fourth he had seen the child's dead body it had died he thought of croup you will write and tell the light bringer asked shivdeo when the inquiry was over and you will say that i did my best my very best for my lord's interest certainly i replied but he will be sorry the child was so fond of him when people are beautiful as krishna like the lord of light it is easy to be fond of them i did not see shivdeo again for over three months and the bungalow in the civil lines which he kept swept and garnished against his master's return gradually assumed the soulless empty appearance peculiar to the dwelling places of those who make holiday at the other side of the world then a message came to say that he was ill and wished to see me on business i found him a mere wreck and shadow of his former self propped up against his old pillar in the verandah he shook his head over my suggestions of remedies i have taken many he replied quietly for the native doctor is my caste brother the hand of shiva is not to be turned aside and am i not his sworn servant what ails me nay who can say what ails the heart when it ceases to beat men cannot live without the light and it is night for me now perhaps that is it who knows yonder old man is my father come to see me die yet ere the last 'ram ram' sounds in mine ears i want the presence to understand something else would i not have vexed his quiet it will be hard for the huzoor to understand because he is not of our race he paused so long that i asked what he wished me to understand thinking that in his weakness he had drifted away from his desire something new and strange he answered yet old and true see i sit here in the old place and the presence shall sit there as he used to do because old memories return in the old places making us see and remember things that are past or forgotten is it not so truly enough as i humoured him by occupying the familiar chair ready placed half way between the bed and the window it seemed to me as if i were once more watching terence pass through the valley of the shadow the presence once slept in that chair continued the weak voice and he dreamed a dream let him recall it now if he can how or wherefore i know not but as he spoke a sudden certainty as to what he wished me to know rushed in on me great god i cried starting up and seizing him roughly by the shoulder you killed poor little boots you brought the child here you killed it before his very eyes and mine i know it i think i think i saw it done he set my hand aside with unexpected force and a strange dignity i am the prisoner of death huzoor there is no need to hold me i cannot escape him for the rest if i killed the child what then the lord of light lives and that is enough for me what is a sudra or two more or less to the brahman but what if it was a devil sucking his heart's blood because of his beauty shall i not have honour for saving him thus both ways i am absolved but not from my oath the false oath which i swore to my lord for my own sake when i wander through the shades waiting for vishnu's decree it will lead my blind steps to the body of a foul thing so i speak that the presence may judge and say if i were not justified and confess that we people of the old knowledge are not always wrong huzoor you have seen its eyes glisten as its body clung to his beauty you know he sickened after it had lain night and day in his arms you know how it crept and crawled to get at him while he lay helpless now listen one day he was better brighter in all things and bid you refresh yourself in the air i sat here and like you i fell asleep and when i woke the thing was at him close to his heart its arms round his neck its devilish lips at his throat crooning away like an accursed cat and he was in the death sleep that lasted till the dawn came that you and i remember so well then i knew it must be and that my oath was as a reed in the flood yet would i not be hasty i took counsel with holy men men of mighty wisdom men with such tenderness for life that they bid god speed to the flea which keeps them wakeful but they all said 'yea one of the two must die' did i stop to ask which not i so i fasted and prayed and made clean my heart and waited patiently for the moment of fate for so they bid me even then huzoor the holy men would do naught by chance or without proof it was a bright moonlight night and the presence slept by reason of our arts and drugs and so we put the accursed creature we had brought from the sweeper's hut down at the gate yonder by the flowering oleanders and hiding ourselves among them watched it straight straight as a hawk or a bustard until we found it there in the old place devil of hell we made it vomit back the blood we my hand was on his mouth my one thought to stop the horrible words that somehow conjured up the still more horrible sight before my eyes i know there is no need for more i cannot bear it and indeed the vision of poor dumb little boots in their relentless hold froze my blood as my hands fell away from him in sudden shrinking horror he looked at me compassionately the presence does not understand aright let him remember the strange doctor's face when he came in the dawn thinking to find hope had fled one of the two had to die if the presence had thought as i did as i knew what would he have done i was silent his face which had remained calm enough so far assumed a look of agonised entreaty as with an effort painful to see he dragged himself to my feet and clung to them what would you have done huzoor in my place what would you have done then a fearful fit of coughing seized him and his lips were tinged with blood water lay close at hand yet i knew that this murderer would sooner have died than accept it from my defiling hand so i called the old man who all this time had sat like a carven image in the next archway he came and wiped the dews of death from his son's face without a word and as he did so shivdeo looking at the faint stains on the cloth smiled an unearthly smile and whispered i did not suck my lord's blood for all that it comes from my own heart i am not ashamed to say that my brain was in such a whirl that i turned to escape from a situation where i felt utterly lost as i did so i heard shivdeo's voice for the last time the old man was holding a little brass cup of water to the parched lips but it was arrested by the dying hand and the dying eyes looked wistfully up into his father's did i do well o my father he asked you did well my son drink in peace when i reached home the english mail was in it brought a letter from terence he was in dublin and engaged to be married considering that he was an irishman no more need be said he wrote the kindest letter saying that the great happiness which had come into his life made him all the more grateful to me seeing that but for my care he would have gone down to the grave without knowing how the love of a good woman can make existence seem a sacred trust he ended by these words and sure old man if it be true that all happiness is bought some one must have paid dear for mine i could not sleep that night the war of conflicting thoughts waged too fiercely but it was nearly dawn before i found it impossible to withstand the memory of shivdeo's cry if the presence had thought as i did what would he have done he was dead before i reached the house but surely if he knows anything he must know that i for one cast no stone ramchunderji but the tenth avatar of the lord vishnu is yet to come exactly so pundit ji i replied looking at my watch it is yet to come seeing that time's up half past eight so not another stroke of work to day no not for twice a thousand rupees a thousand rupees being the sum with which the government of india rewards what they are pleased to call high proficiency in languages i having regard to its literature had chosen sanskrit as a means of paying certain just debts to which end the head master of the district school came to me for two hours every morning and prosed away over the doings of the hindoo pantheon until i came to the conclusion that my lord vishnu had been rather extravagant in the matter of incarnations the pundit however to whom would be due a hundred rupees of the thousand if i succeeded smiled blandly the tenth avatar will doubtless await his honour's leisure the tenth and last last i echoed with scorn how do you know some authorities hold there are twenty four and upon my soul i don't see why there should not be twenty four thousand 'tis the same old story all through devils and demigods rakshas and rishies noah's ark and excalibur that sort of thing might go on for ever now pundit narayan das was a very learned man he had taken a calcutta degree and was accustomed to educate the rising generation on a mixture of the rig veda and the spectator so he smiled again saying in english 'history repeats itself' thereupon he left me and i going into the verandah with my cigar came straight upon ramchunderji and his wife seeta at least i think so they were the oddest little couple he at a stretch might have touched a decade of life she something more than half such distance of time that is taking them by size in mind and manners and in their grave careworn faces they were centuries old his sole garment consisted of a large yellow turban twined high into a sort of mitre with just a tip of burnished silver fringe sprouting from the top and as he sat cross legged against the verandah pillar a hand resting on each knee his figure awoke a fleeting memory which at the time i failed to catch afterwards i remembered the effigies in indra's celestial court as represented by some parsee actors i had once seen seeta was simply a bundle owing to her being huddled and cuddled up in a veil ample enough for an ample woman i am ramchunderji and this is my wife seeta said the boy gravely if the presence pleases i will beguile time by singing what will you sing i asked preparing to idle away ten minutes comfortably in a lounge chair which lay convenient i sing what i sing give me the vina woman the veil gave up such a very large instrument that the smallness of the remaining wife became oppressive so large indeed was it that one gourd over filled the boy's lap while the other acted as a prop to the high twined turban even the connecting bamboo slender though it was seemed all too wide for those small fingers on the frets is the permission of the presence bestowed suggested ramchunderji with the utmost solemnity twang twang twangle heavens what a vina and what a voice i nearly stopped both at the first bar then patience prevailing i lay back and closed my eyes twang twangle a sudden difference in the tone made me open them again only to find the same little bronze image busy in making a perfectly purgatorial noise so i resigned myself once more palm trees waving odorous thickets starred with jasmin forms half mortal half divine stealing through the shadows the flash of shining swords the twang of golden bows bent on ten headed many handed monsters bah pundit narayan das prosing over those epic poems of his had made me drowsy what have you been singing i asked rousing myself ramchunderji spread his hands thumbs outwards and the three wrinkles on his high forehead deepened god knows it is what they sang before the great flood came the vina was theirs and my turban and my wife's veil the rest was too big altogether so i gave it away for some bread when the belly is full of greed the heart hath none left and the nine lakh necklace is worth no more than a mouthful if the presence could see into my heart now he would find no greed there this delicate allusion to an inward craving produced a four anna bit from my pocket and sent ramchunderji away to the sweet meat sellers in order to appease his hunger for sweet stuff is cheap in the east especially when it is stale seeta and the vina mysteriously intertwined beneath the veil followed duteously behind the next day they were back again and the twang of that infernal instrument broke in on the pundit's impassioned regrets over the heroic days of his favourite poems by the by i interrupted can you tell me what that boy is singing i can't make out a word and yet but it was no use bringing fancy to bear on narayan das so we went out to listen they were sitting under a trellised arch covered with jasmin and roses and a great gloire de dijon had sent a shower of blown petals over seeta's veil a little knowledge is a dangerous thing quoted narayan das sententiously after listening a while it is ramayana the immortal poem your honour reads even now but debase illiterate you say wrong boy it is thus ramchunderji waited till the pompous periods ceased then he shook his head gravely we did not sing it so in the days before the great flood came his words gave me a curious thrill but there is no more matter of fact being in the world than a calcutta bachelor of arts so the pundit at once began a cross examination that would have done credit to a queen's counsel what flood who were 'we' these and many other questions put with brutal bluntness met with a patient reply it had been a very big flood somewhere god knows how far in the south country one two three years ago oh more than that but he could not say how much more the bard who sang and the woman who carried the vina had disappeared been swept away perhaps since then he ramchunderji had wandered over the world filling his stomach and that of his wife seeta with songs their stomachs were not always full oh no of late perhaps because the vina was so old people had not cared to listen and since the great flood nothing could be got without money seeta oh yes she was his wife they had been married ever so long he could not remember the time when they had not been married it was narayan das's opportunity for shaking his head these infant marriages were subversive of due education here was a boy who should be in standard ii doing the compound rules idling about in ignorance it struck me however that ramchunderji must be pretty well on to vulgar fractions and rule of three with himself seeta and the world as the denominators so i asked him if his heart were still so devoid of greed that another four anna bit would be welcome his face showed a pained surprise the presence he said must be aware that four annas would fill their stomachs which were not big for many days they had not come for alms only to make music for the presence out of gratitude thinking that music out of an ill tuned vina was hardly the same thing i forced another four anna bit on the boy and sent him away nearly a month passed ere i saw him again though narayan das and i used as the days grew warmer to sit out in the trellised arch within sight of the road my knowledge of sanskrit increased as i read of ramchunderji's long exile shared by seeta his wife of how he killed the beasts in the enchanted forest how she was reft from him by ravana the hydra headed many handed monster and of how finally she was restored to his arms by the help of hanuman the man monkey the child of the wild winds but though the pundit used to waste many words in pointing out the beauties of a poem which held such hold on the minds of the people that their commonest names were derived from it i never seemed to get into the spirit of the time as i had done when i listened with closed eyes to the boy's debased illiterate rendering of the s'lokas it was after the school vacation had sent narayan das to see his relatives at benares that the odd little couple turned up again ramchunderji's face looked more pinched and careworn than ever and as he held the vina across his knees seeta losing its contours seemed more than ever inadequate to her veil perhaps one of the many devils which beset the virtuous has entered into the instrument he said despondently but when i play folk listen not at all so greed remaineth in the stomach and the heart is empty i offered him another four anna bit and when he demurred at taking it before beguiling the time with music i laid it on the flat skin top of one of the gourds hoping thus to ensure silence the wrinkles on his forehead seemed to go right up into his turban and his voice took a perplexed tone it used not to be so before the flood seeta and i had no thought of money but now he began fingering the strings softly and as they thrilled the four anna bit vibrated and jigged in a murmur of money that fitted strangely to the sort of rude chant in which he went on money is in the hands the head the heart give give give before we give again money hath ten heads to think out evil doing money hath twenty hands to mete out pain money money money money money steals the heart's love from our life money i have not say art thou hungry wife if anything was possessed of a devil it was that four anna bit it buzzed and hummed and jigged infernally as the boy's finger on the strings struck more firmly i'll tell you what it is ramchunderji said i uneasily that vina is enough to ruin orpheus as you don't care for my money i'll give you another instrument instead i have one inside which is easier to play and more your style in every way so i brought out a ravanastron such as professional beggars use a thing with two strings and a gourd covered with snake skin to my surprise the boy's face lost its impassive melancholy in palpable anger the presence does not understand he said quite hotly we do not beg seeta and i fill ourselves with songs that thing whines for money money money like the devil who made it rather would i live by this than by mine enemy and as he spoke he struck the snake skin with his supple fingers till it resounded again yea thus will i find bread he went on but the vina must find a home first therefore i came to the presence hearing that he collected such things perhaps he will keep it in exchange for one rupee it is worth one rupee surely his wistful look as he handed me the instrument made me feel inclined to offer a hundred but in good sooth the vina was worth five and i told him so adding as i looked at some curious tracery round the gourds that it appeared to be very old indeed the presence saith truly it is very old echoed ramchunderji drearily that is why folk will not listen it is too old too old to be worth money nevertheless he cheered up at the sight of his rupee for he would not take more saying he had every intention of returning to claim the vina ere long and that five rupees would be beyond his hopes of gain a fortnight after i came home from my early morning ride by the police office which stood outside the native town close to a brick stepped tank shaded by peepul trees my object being to check the tally of poisonous snakes brought in for the reward given by government for their capture the first time i saw some six or seven hundred deadly serpents ranged in a row with all their heads one way and all their unwinking eyes apparently fixed on me i felt queer and the fact of their being dead did not somehow enter into the equation but habit inures one and i walked along the thin grey fringe of certain death spread out on the first step of the tank with an air of stolid business only stopping before an unusually large specimen to ask the captor who sat behind awaiting his pence where he had come across it six hundred and seventy in all huzoor remarked the deputy inspector of police following me resplendent in silver trappings and white cotton gloves that is owing to the floods and the season since this is the sixth of bhadron august the month of snakes yet the outlay is excessive to the government and perhaps with justice the price of small ones such as these might be reduced one half i looked up and behind a fringe of diminutive vipers sat ramchunderji and the bundle he called seeta on his bare right arm he wore a much betasselled floss silk bracelet bound with tinsel i am glad to see the greed is in your heart again said i pointing to the ornament the ram rucki is not bought but given as in the days before the flood replied the boy every one wears the ram rucki still every one the deputy inspector pulled down the cuff of his uniform hastily but against the gleam of his white gloves i caught a glimpse of bright colours the ram rucki he explained evasively was the bracelet of luck given to ramchunderji in old days before his search for seeta and common ill educated people still retained the superstitious custom of binding one on the wrist of each male during the month of bhadron there was so much deplorable ignorance amongst the uneducated classes and did the presence look with favour on the proposal for reducing the rewards perhaps it was ramchunderji's eager wistful face hinting at the way promises were kept before the flood which made me reply that i considered no one but the viceroy in council had power to reduce the price of snakes several times after this i found the odd little couple disposed behind their tally of small vipers then the season of serpents ceased and one by one the habitues of the tank steps dropped off to pursue other professions the fringe broke into isolated tassels and finally the worn ruddy steps lay bare of all save the flickering light and shade of the leaves above november had chilled the welcome cool weather to cold when a report came in the usual course that a boy calling himself ramchunderji and a girl said to be his wife had been found in a jasmin garden outside the city half dead of exhaustion and without any ostensible means of livelihood they had been taken up as vagrants and sent to hospital pending government orders now the jubilee year was coming to a close leaving behind it a legacy of new charities throughout the length and breadth of india of some the foundation stone only had been laid by direct telegram to the queen empress others had sprung to life in a manner suggestive of workmen's tenements among the latter was a female boarding school and orphanage for the children of high caste hindus which had been built and endowed by a number of rich contractors and usurers not one of whom would have sent their daughters to it for all their hoarded wealth persistent pennies had attracted a creditable if intermittent supply of day scholars to its stucco walls but despite an appropriate inscription in three languages over the gate the orphanage remained empty money can do much but it cannot produce homeless orphans of good family in a society where the patriarchal system lingers in all its crass disregard of the main chance so at the first hint of seeta i was besieged on all sides a real live genuine hindu female orphan going a begging preposterous sacrilegious the chairman of the orphanage committee almost wept as he pictured the emptiness of those white walls and actually shed tears over the building estimates which he produced in order to strengthen his claim to poor little seeta was it fair he asked that such a total of munificent charity should not have a single orphan to show the commissioner sahib when he came on tour his distress touched me then winter hard on the poor even in sunlit india was on us besides narayan das tempted me further with suggestions of a jubilee scholarship at the district school for ramchunderji himself i broke it very gently to the boy as he lay on a mat in the sun slowly absorbing warmth and nourishment he was too weak to contest the point but i felt bad exceedingly when i saw him turn face down as if the end of all things was upon him i knew he must be whispering confidences to mother earth respecting that happy time before the flood and i slunk away as though i had been whipped now if in telling this veracious history i seem too intermittent i can but offer as an excuse the fact that an official's work in india is like that of a jacquard loom a thread slips forward shows for a second and disappears a pause and there it is again sometimes not until the pattern is complete is it possible to realise that the series of trivial incidents has combined to weave an indelible record on the warp and woof so it was early january before the ramchunderji shuttle stirred again narayan das came to me with a look on his face suggestive that neither the rig veda nor the spectator was entirely satisfactory the boy he said was not a bad boy though he seemed absolutely unable to learn but his influence on standard i was strictly non regulation nor did any section of the educational code apply to the case if i would come down at recess time i could see and judge for myself what ought to be done when i reached the play ground the bigger boys were at krikutts cricket or gymnastics the medium ones engaged on marbles but in a sunny corner backed by warm brick walls sat ramchunderji surrounded by a circle of standard i small as he was he was still so much larger than the average of the class that as he leant his high yellow turban against the wall with half closed eyes and hands upon his knees the memory of india's court came back to me once more he was reciting something in a low voice and as the children munched popcorn or sucked sweeties their eyes never left his face look said narayan das in a whisper from our spying ground behind the master's window the song came to an end a stir circled through the audience and one by one the solid children of the fields and the slender sharp little imps of the bazaars rose up and put something into the singer's lap a few grains of corn a scrap of sweet stuff and as they did so each said in turn salaam ramchunderji no wonder the boy has grown fat i whispered dropping the reed screen round which i had been peeping narayan das shook his head if it were only comestibles he replied gravely i could arrange but when they are devoid of victuals they give their slate pencils their ink pots even their first lesson books then if nobody sees and stops there is vacancy when such things are applied for thus it is subversive of discipline and parents object to pay besides the in forma pauperis pupils come on contingent with great expense to government i looked through the screen again with a growing respect for ramchunderji does he eat them too i asked the head master smiled the sickly smile of one who is not quite sure if his superior officer intends a joke and fell back as usual on quotation the ostrich is supposed by some to digest nails but i laughed aloud and being discovered went out and spoke seriously to the offender his calm was not in the least disturbed i do not ask or beg he replied they give of their hearts and their abundance as in old days before the flood is it my fault if they possess slate pencils and ink pots and first lesson books i must confess that this argument seemed to me unanswerable but i advised him seeing that the flood had come to return such offerings in future to the store he did not take my advice and about a week after being discovered selling these things to the bigger boys at a reduced price he was caned by the head master that night he disappeared from the boarding house and was no more seen his name was removed from the rolls his scholarship forfeited for absence without leave and the arrears absorbed in refunds for slate pencils and ink pots so that was an end of ramchunderji's schooling and standard i once more became amenable to the code winter was warming to spring the first bronze vine leaves were budding and the young wheat shooting to silvery ears before the commissioner coming his rounds was taken in pomp to visit the orphanage and its occupants i remember it so well the committee and the commissioner and i and every one interested in female orphans and female education on one side of a red baize table decorated with posies of decayed rosebuds and jasmin in green glass tumblers and on the other seeta and the matron the former to enhance her value as a genuine half caste waif was still a mere bundle and i fancied she looked smaller than ever perhaps because the veil was not so large then the accounts were passed and the matron's report read nothing she said could be more satisfactory than the general behaviour and moral tone of the inmates except in one point and this was the feeding of the monkeys which as every one knew infested the town the result being that the bunder log had become bold even to the dropping down of stones into the court quite large stones such as the one placed as a stepping stone over the runnel of water from the well here i unguardedly suggested an air gun whereupon narayan das who always attended these functions as an educational authority reminded me reproachfully that monkeys were sacred to the god hanuman who if i remembered had finally rescued seeta from the ten headed many armed monster ravana the inventor of the ravanastron or beggar's fiddle it was at this juncture that i suddenly became aware that the jacquard loom of fate was weaving a pattern ramchunderji seeta the exile the killing of the wild beasts the ten headed many handed monster ravana yet i could tell you almost every word of the commissioner's speech though he prosed on for the next ten minutes complacently about the pleasure he felt and the authorities felt and the whole civilised world felt at seeing money the great curse and blessing of humanity employed as it should be employed in snatching the female orphan of india from unmerited misfortune and educating her to be an example to the nineteenth century every one was highly delighted and the committee approached me with a view of adding the commissioner's name as a second title to the school but i awaited the completion of the pattern it was on the eleventh of april that is to say on the high festival of spring at the fair held beside the tank where humanity in thousands was washing away the old year and putting on the new in the shape of gay coloured clothing that my attention was attracted by a small dense crowd whence came hearty guffaws of laughter 'tis a performing monkey said a bearded villager in response to my question as to what was amusing them so hugely the boy makes him do tricks worthy of hanuman yet he saith he taught him yonder down by the canal will not the protector of the poor step in and see ho ho 'twould make a suitor laugh even if the digri decree were against him but i recognised the pattern this time and i had made up my mind not to interfere with the shuttle again as i turned away another roar of laughter and a general feeling in pockets and turbans told me that the final tip had succeeded and that collection was going on satisfactorily a few days later the chairman of the committee came to me in excited despair the real genuine female hindu orphan was not to be found and the stucco walls were once more empty inquiries were made on all sides but when it came out casually that a boy a girl and a monkey had taken a third class ticket to benares i said nothing i was not going to aid ravana or prevent the due course of incarnation if it was an incarnation that great city of men women and monkeys should give the trio fair play last year when i was in simla i overheard a traveller giving his impressions of india to a lady who was longing all the time to find out from a gentleman with a mustache when the polo match was to begin at annandale next day the performing troupes are certainly above the european average he said at benares especially i remember seeing a monkey he his master and a girl did quite a variety of scenes out of the ramayana and really considering who they were i excuse me but oh captain smith is it half past eleven or twelve the vina still hangs in my collection next the ravanastron sometimes i take it down and sound the strings but the waving palms the odorous thickets and the shadowy immortal forms have got mixed up somehow with that infernal humming and bumming of the four anna bit so i get no help in trying to decide the question who was ramchunderji heera nund he stood in the verandah salaaming with both hands in each of which he held a bouquet round topped compressed prim little posies with fat bundles of stalk bound spirally with date fibre altogether more like ninepins than bouquets for the time of flowers was not yet and only a few ill conditioned rosebuds suggestive of worms and a dejected champak or two showed amongst the green the holder was hardly more decorative than the posies bandy hairy brown legs with toes set wide open by big brass rings a sight bringing discomfort within one's own slippers from sheer sympathy a squat body tightly buttoned into a sleeveless white coat a face of mild ugliness overshadowed by an immaculately white turban from the coral and gold necklace round his thick throat and the crescent shaped ear rings in his spreading ears i guessed him to be of the arain caste he was in fact heera nund gardener to my new landlord therefore for the present my servant had i inquired into the matter i should probably have found that his forbears had cultivated the surrounding land for centuries certainly long years before masterful men from the west had jotted down their trivial boundary pillars to divide light from darkness the black man from the white cantonments from the rest of god's earth one of these little white pillars stood in a corner of my garden and beyond it lay an illimitable stretch of bare brown plain waiting till the young wheat came to clothe its nakedness i did not inquire however few people do in india perhaps they are intimidated by the extreme antiquity of all things and dread letting loose the floodgates of garrulous memory be that as it may i was content to accept the fact that heera nund whether representing ancestral proprietors or not had come to congratulate me a stranger on having taken not only the house but the garden also the sahibs he said went home so often nowadays that they had ceased to care for gardens this one having been in a contractor's hands for years had become as it were a miserable low degree native place in fact he had found it necessary to steep his own knowledge in oblivion in order that content should grow side by side with country vegetables yet he had not forgotten the golden age when under the aegis of some judge with a mysterious name he too heera nund the arain had raised celery and beetroot french beans and artichokes asparagus and parsley he reeled off the english names with a glibness and inaccuracy in which somehow there lurked a pathetic dignity then suddenly from behind a favouring pillar he sprung upon me the usual native offering consisting of a flat basket decorated with a few coarse vegetables a bunch of rank smelling turnips half a dozen blue radishes running two to the pound various heaps of native greens a bit off an overblown cauliflower proclaiming its bazaar origin by the turmeric powder adhering to it in patches a leaf cup of mint ornamented by two glowing chillies he laid the whole at my feet with a profound obeisance this dust like offering he said gravely is all that the good god khuda can give to the sahib let the presence huzoor wait a few months and see what heera nund can do for him i shall not soon forget the ludicrous solemnity of voice and gesture or the simple self importance overlaying the ugly face with the smile of a cat licking cream i did not see him again for some days for accession to a new office curtails leisure when however i found time for a stroll round my new domain i discovered heera nund hard at work his coatee hung on a bush his bare brown back glistened in the sunshine as he stooped down to deepen a watercourse with his adze like shovel a brake of sugarcane red brown and gold showed where the garden proper merged into the peasants' land beyond for the well whence the water came that flowed round heera nund's hidden feet as he stood in the runnel irrigated quite a large stretch of the fields around my holding the well wheel creaked in recurring discords every now and again giving out a note or two as if it were going to begin a tune the red evening sun shone through the mango trees where the green parrots hung like unripe fruit the bullocks circled round and round the water dripped and gurgled how about the seeds i sent you i asked when heera nund drew his wet feet from the stream and composing himself for the effort produced an elaborate salaam he left humility behind him as he stalked over to a narrow strip of ground on the other side of the well a long strip portioned out into squares and circles like a doll's garden with tiny one span walks between behold he said his honour will observe that the cabbage caste have life already truly enough the half covered seeds showed gussets of white in their brown jackets but where are the tickets i sent word specially that you were to be sure and stick the labels on each bed how am i to know which is which the presence can see that the sticks are there he answered with a superior smile but there are others beside the sahibs who love tickets he pointed to the tree above us where on a branch sat a peculiarly bushy tailed squirrel as happy as a king over the brussels sprouts' wrapper which he was crumpling into a ball with deft hands and sharp teeth how i came to know it was this particular wrapper happened thus i threw my cap at the offender and in his flight he dropped the paper on my bald head it was hard and had points they are mis begotten devils remarked heera cheerfully but they are building nests sahib and like to paper the inside notwithstanding the presence need fear no confusion his slave has many names in his head this is arly walkrin early walcheren that is droomade drumhead yonder is dookoyark duke of york and that that and that he would have gone on interminably had i not changed the subject by asking what was growing beneath a dilapidated hand light which stood next to a sturdy crop of broadcast radishes only a few panes of glass remained intact but the vacancies had been neatly supplied by coarse muslin the gardener's face always simple in expression became quite homogeneous with pure content huzoor it is the malin female gardener the malin what on earth do you mean have you ever watched the face of a general servant when she takes the covers off the christmas dinner have you ever seen a very young conjurer lift his father's hat to show you that the handkerchief which he has palpably secreted elsewhere is no longer in its legitimate hiding place something of that mingled triumph and fear lest some accident may have befallen skill in the interim showed itself in heera nund's countenance as he removed the light with a flourish thus disclosing to view a fat and remarkably black baby asleep on a bed of leaves it was attired in a pair of silver bangles and a maw's feeding bottle grew like some new kind of root crop from the ground beside it my daughter huzoor little dhropudi the malin his voice thrilled even my bachelor ears as he squatted down and began mechanically to fan the swift gathering flies from the sleeping child you seem to be very fond of her i remarked after a pause it is only a girl after all have you no son he shook his head she is the only one and i waited for her ten years ten long years so i was glad even to get a malin dhropudi grows as fast as a boy almost as fast as the huzoor's cabbages only the other day she was no bigger than my hand your wife is dead i suppose the question was perhaps a little brutal but it was so unusual to see a man doing dry nurse to a baby girl that i took it for granted that the mother had died months before at the child's birth i never saw a face change more rapidly than his the simplicity left it and in place thereof came a curious anxiety such as a child might show with the dawning conviction that it has lost itself she is not at all dead huzoor on the contrary she is very young children cry sometimes and my house does not like crying you see when people are young they require more sleep when she is old as i am she will be able to keep awake his tone was argumentative as if he were reasoning the matter out for his own edification not that dhropudi keeps me awake often he added in hasty apology to that infant's reputation considering how young a person she is her ways are very straight walking and meek if she cries you can always stop her with the watering pot i suppose he looked shocked at the suggestion huzoor it is not difficult to stop them such a very little thing pleases a baby sometimes it is the sunshine sometimes it is the wind in the trees sometimes it is the birds or the squirrels or the flowers when it is tired of these there is always the milk in its stomach dhropudi's goat is yonder it lives on your honour's weeds you are her father and her mother however much i might repudiate the relationship i soon became quite accustomed to finding dhropudi in the most unexpected places in my garden for soon after my first introduction to her the claims of an early crop of lettuces to protection from the squirrels led heera nund to transfer the hand light from one of his charges to another dhropudi he said could grow nicely without it now the black ants could not carry her off and the squirrels had quite begun to recognise that she was of the race of adam at first however he took precautions against mistakes and many a time i have seen the sleeping child stuck round with pea sticks or decorated with fluttering feathers on a string to scare away the birds sometimes she was blanching with the celery and once i nearly trod on her as she lay among the toppings in a thick plantation of blossoming beans but she never came to harm the only misadventure being when her father would lay her to sleep in some dry water channel and forgetting which one it was turn the shallow stream that way then there would be a momentary outcry at the cold bath but the next she would be pacified with a flower and sit in the sun to dry for to say sooth no more good tempered child ever existed than dhropudi in this at any rate she was like her father though i could trace no resemblance in other ways she is like my house he would say when i noticed the fact she is young and i am old quite old indeed as time passed i saw that heera nund was older than i thought at first before the barber came in the morning there was quite a silver stubble on his bronze cheek and his bright restless eyes were haggard and anxious despite his almost comic jauntiness and self importance he struck me as having a hunted look at times especially when he came out from the mud walled enclosure at the further end of the garden where his house lived he went there but seldom spending his days in tending dhropudi and his plants with an almost extravagant devotion his state of mind when that young lady used her new accomplishment of crawling to the detriment of a bed of sootullians sweet williams in which he took special pride was quite pathetic i found him simply howling between regret for the plants and fear lest i should order punishment to the offender his gratitude when i laughed was unbounded after this dhropudi used to be set in a twelve inch pot half sunk in the ground where she would stay contentedly for hours drumming the sides with a carrot while heera weeded and dibbled she grows he would say snatching her up fiercely in his arms she grows as all my plants grow see my sootullians they will blossom soon and then all the sahibs will come and say 'see the sootullians which heera nund and dhropudi have grown for the huzoor' yet with all this blazoning of content the man was curiously restless almost like a child in his desire for action and vivid interest in trivialities see the misbegotten creature i have found eating the honourable huzoor's roots he would say casting a wire worm on the verandah steps and dancing on it vindictively it was in the huzoor's carnations but by the blessing of god and heera nund's vigilance it is dead nothing escapes me have i not fought wire worms since the beginning of all things i and my fathers we kill all creeping crawling things except the holy snake that brings fruit and blossom to the garden one night i was disturbed by unseemly noises coming apparently from the servants' quarters but my remonstrances next morning were met by my bearer with swift denial it is heera he poor man has to beat his wife almost every night now i wonder the presence has not heard her before she screams very loud i stood aghast he should let her go or kill her continued the bearer placidly she is not worth the trouble of beating but he is a fool because she is dhropudi's mother yes he is a fool he beats her when he finds her lover there he should beat her well before the man comes that is the best way with women it was an old story it seemed dating before dhropudi's appearance on the scene it occurred to me that perhaps a deeper tragedy than i had thought for was ripening in my garden among the ripening plants i found myself watching dhropudi and her father with an almost morbid interest and hoping that if my idle suspicion was right kindly fate might hide the truth away forever in the bottom of that well where heera often held the child to smile at her own reflection far down where the water showed like a huge round dewdrop so time went on until the sootullians showed blossom buds and dhropudi cut her first tooth on one and the same day perhaps the excitement of the double event was too much for heera's nerves perhaps what happened was due anyhow but as i strolled through the garden that evening at sundown i saw the most comically pathetic sight my eyes ever beheld heera nund clothed but not in his right mind was dancing a can can among his sootullians while dhropudi shrieked with delight and beat frantically on her flower pot even with the knowledge of all that came after the remembrance provokes a smile the rhythmic bobbing up and down of the uncouth figure the cowlike kicks of the bandy legs the preternaturally grave face above the crushed sootullians below i sent him in charge of two sepoys to the dispensary and there he remained for two months more or less when he came back he was very quiet very thin and there were the marks of several blisters on the back of his head he resumed work cheerfully with many apologies for having been ill and once more he and dhropudi who had been handed over meantime under police supervision to her mother were to be found spending their days together in amicable companionship his only regrets being apparently that the sootullians had blossomed and dhropudi learnt to walk in his absence but for one or two little eccentricities i might have been tempted to forget that can can among the flowers indeed i always met his inquiries as to the sootullians with the remark that they had done as well as could be expected in the circumstances the eccentricities however if few were striking one was his exaggerated gratitude for the blisters on the back of his head the last thing in the world one would have thought likely to produce an outburst of that christian virtue but it did and an allusion to the all too visible scars invariably crowned the frequent recital of the benefits he had received at my hands another was the difficulty he had in distinguishing dhropudi from the other fruits of his labor on two separate occasions she formed part of the daily basket of vegetables which he brought in to me and very quaint the little black morsel looked sitting surrounded by tomatoes and melons but though he treated the matter as an elaborate joke when i remarked on it there was a dazed uncertain look in his eyes as if he were not quite sure as to the right end of the stick nevertheless peace and contentment reigned apparently in his house when i sat out in the dark hot evenings a glow of flickering firelight from within showed the mysterious mud walled enclosure by the wall decorous and conventional the winking stars looking down into it knew more of the life within than i did but at any rate no unseemly cries disturbed the scented night air and the huzoor's slumbers perhaps the police supervision had impressed the lover with the dangers of lurking house trespass by night perhaps the dark browed heavy jowled young woman who had taken my warning so sullenly had learnt more craft perhaps the languor which creeps over all things in may had sucked the vigour even from passion who could say those crumbling mud walls hid it all and heera seemed to have begun a new life with the hot weather vegetables so matters stood when an old enemy laid hold of me ten days after i found myself racing death with a determination to reach the sea and feel the salt west wind on my face before he and i closed with each other the strange hurry and eagerness of it all comes back to some of us like a nightmare years after the exile is over the doctor's verdict the swift packing of a trunk or two the hope the fear the mad longing at least to see the dear faces once more they packed me and a half hundred pillows into a palki ghari one afternoon the servants stood white clad in a row beside the white pillars dazzling in the slanting sunlight i drove through the flower garden dusty and scorched at the gate stood heera nund one arm occupied by dhropudi the other supporting a huge basket of vegetables he looked uncertain which to present finally seeing the carriage drive on he deliberately let the basket fall and running to my side thrust the child's chubby hands forward they held just such ninepin bouquets as he had carried on our first introduction take them sahib he cried take them for luck and come back soon to the madli and the malin as the ghari turned sharp down the road i saw him standing amidst the ruins of the basket with dhropudi in his arms six months passed before i set foot on indian soil again and then fate and a restless government sent me to a new station when my servants arrived with my baggage from the old one i naturally fell to asking questions and how is heera nund was one my bearer smiled benignly huzoor he is well in the month of july he was hanged bearer without doubt it was in the month of july he killed his wife with an axe dhropudi was bitten by a snake while she slept one day when heera had to leave her with her mother and that night he killed his wife as she slept also it was a mistake to be so revengeful for every one knew dhropudi was not really his daughter do you think that heera knew she told him when the child died in order to stop his grief but it did not she was very kind to him after the other one went to prison for lurking about and did no one tell about it all about what huzoor about the vegetables and dhropudi and the sootullians and the blisters on the back of his head did no one say the man was mad there was a new assistant at the dispensary sahib and her people were very rich besides heera was not mad at all he did it on purpose he was a bad man and the sirkar did right to hang him in july but as i turned away i could think of nothing but that can can among the sootullians with little dhropudi beating time with a carrot feroza two hen sparrows quarrelling over a feather while a girl watched them listlessly for the rest sunshine imprisoned

will'st not be decent like little feroz yonder why because my man thinks i'm pretty because i've fine clothes feroza hath old green trousers and her man is learning to be 'wise' forsooth amongst the mems so she is jealous i'm not jealous interrupted the other hotly peace peace little doves expostulated the old nurse feroz is no fool to be jealous of a mem holy prophet kareem hadst thou seen them at delhi as i have inaiyut hath seen them too he saith they are as houris in silk and satins with bare breasts and arms mytaben's bony fingers crackled in a shake of horrified denial silence shameless one i tell thee they have no beauty no clothes there i said they had no clothes pouted kareema the duenna folded her sheet round her with great dignity thy wit is sharp kareema 'tis as well for thou wilt need it to protect thy nose the mems have many clothes god knows how many or how they bear them when even the skin he gives is too hot they are sad coloured these mems with green spectacles serving as veils not that they need them for they are virtuous and keep their eyes from men truck not like bad bold hussies who dance 'tis not true cried kareema shrilly thou sayest it to please feroza inaiyut holds they are houris for beauty and he knows in the wrangle which ensued the london postmark revolved between earth and heaven as the letter turned over and over in feroza's listless fingers i wish i knew she muttered with a frown puckering her forehead he saith they are so wise and yet mytaben paused in the war of words and laid her wrinkled old fingers on the girl's head plague on new fangled ways she grumbled half to herself have no fear heart's life they are uncomely but for all that 'tis a shame of the meer to leave thee pining a hand was on her mouth hush mytaben 'tis a wife's duty to wait her lord's pleasure to stay or come there is a dignity in submission but kareema laughed again and even old mytab looked at the girl compassionately for all that heart's life 'tis well to be sure certainty soothes the liver more than hope so thou shalt see a mem for lo the book readers have come to this town and one passeth the door every eve at sundown oh mytab why didn't you tell us before cried both the girls in a breath because 'tis enough as it is to keep two married girls straight with never a mother in law to make them dance to her tune grumbled the nurse evasively hai kareema i will tell thy father in law the moulvie and then 'twill be bread and water bread and water is not good for brides retorted kareema with a giggle and i will see the mems too or i will cry and then she nodded her head maliciously that evening at sundown the two girls sat huddled up by the latticed window of the outer vestibule while mytab watched at the door of the men's court which with that of the women's apartments opened into this shadowy entrance by putting their eyes close to the fret work they could see up and down a narrow alley where a central drain full of black sewage usurped the larger half of the rough brick pavement look feroza look cried kareema in a choked voice a white umbrella lined with green a huge pith hat tied round with a blue veil a gingham dress a bag of books white stockings and tan shoes that was all they watched the strange apparition breathlessly till it came abreast of them then kareema's pent up mirth burst forth in peals of laughter so distinctly audible through the open lattice that the cause stopped in surprise feroza started to her feet for shame kareem for shame he says they are so good and before they guessed what she would be at the wicket gate was open and she was on the bare indecent doorstep salaam mem sahib salaam rang her high pitched girlish voice i feroza begum of the house of meer ahmed ali barrister at law am glad to see you before kareema by hanging on to mytab's scanty attire lent weight enough to drag the offender back to seclusion the english lady raised her veil and feroza begum moguli caught her first glimpse of a pair of mild blue eyes she never forgot the introduction to miss julia smith spinster of clapham perhaps she had reason to remember it i might have believed it of kareem whimpered the duenna over a consolatory pipe but feroz to stand out in the world yelling like a hawker ai ai give me your quiet ones for wickedness phut in a moment like water from the skin bag spoiling everything 'twas kareem's laugh burst the mashk nursie laughed feroza she and her sister in law seemed to have changed places for the time and she was flitting about gay as a wren while the former sulked moodily on her bed yet as the days passed a new jealousy came like seven devils to possess poor feroza utterly what was this wisdom which inspired so many well turned periods in the meer's somewhat prosy letters beauty was beyond her but women even of her race had been wise passionate nurjehan and even pious fatma god forgive her for evening her chances with that saintly woman's the thought led to such earnest study of the koran that old mytab's wrath was mollified into a hope of permanent penitence and all the time the girl's heart was singing paeans of praise over the ease with which she remembered the long strings of meaningless words buoyed up by hope she confided her heart's desire to kareema eat more butter and grow fat replied that little coquette dress in bright colours and redden thy lips and thou mightest use that powder the mems have to make their skins fair inaiyut saith he will buy me some in the bazaar that is true wisdom the other is for wrinkles despite this cold water the very next london post mark brought matters to a crisis is that all asked feroza dismally when her father in law the moulvie had duly intoned her husband's letter it looks oh it looks ever so much more on paper the old mohammedan stared through his big horn rimmed spectacles at her reluctant finger feeling its way along the crabbed writing quite enough for a good wife daughter in law he replied bring my pipe and thank god he is well as she sat fanning the old man duteously her mind was full of suspicion could she have compressed the desire and love of her heart into a few well turned sentences ah if she could only learn to read for herself the thought found utterance in a tentative remark that it would save the moulvie trouble if she were a scholar 'tis not much trouble said the old man courteously the letters are not long the effect of these words surprised him into taking off his spectacles as if this new departure of quiet feroza's could be better seen by the naked eye so thou thinkest to learn all the meer has learnt he asked scornfully when her eloquence abated wah illah what euclidus and algebra political economy and justinian the desire of the girl's heart was not this but jealousy and shame combined prevented her declaring the real standard of her aims so she replied defiantly why not i can learn the koran fast oh ever so fast it was an unfortunate speech since it brought down on her the inevitable reply that such knowledge was enough for those who at best must enter paradise at a man's coat tails driven into a corner she felt the hopelessness of the struggle until flushed by success the moulvie forgot caution and declaimed against his son's stupidity in desiring more feroza seized on this slip swiftly if it was as she feared if her husband's wishes were kept from her ignorance she must she would learn if she could not go to school the mems would come and teach her at home they did such work at delhi why not here as for the moulvie's determination that no singing should be heard in his house that was a righteous wish and she would tell the mems not to sing their hymns indeed such a question seemed all too trivial for comparison with her future happiness therefore her disappointment when mytaben brought back a peremptory refusal from the mission ladies to teach on such condition was very keen her piteous surprised tears roused kareema's scornful wonder i can't think why thou shouldst weep it thickens the nose and thine is over broad as it is inaiyut offered once to teach me but when i asked him if learning would make him love me better he kissed me with a laugh so i let it alone thou dost not understand sobbed feroza no one does the meer is wise and i am different wah thou art but a woman at best and life is over for us with the first wrinkle no matter what we learn ah feroz let's enjoy youth whilst we have it see i have a rare bit of fun for thee if thou wilt not blab to mytaben promise three days afterwards feroza escaping from the turmoil of a great marriage in a relative's house found herself much to her own surprise and bewilderment forming one of a merry party of young women disguised in boy's clothes and bound for an hour or so of high jinks in one of the walled orange gardens which lay on the outskirts of the quarter the idea which had at first filled her with dismay had next grown tempting and then become irresistible with kareema's artful suggestion that it would give occasion for a personal interview with the mission ladies who had taken up their abode close by so she had allowed her doubts and fears to be allayed though inwardly she failed to see the vast difference on which her sister in law insisted between the iniquity of standing on doorsteps in the full light of day and sneaking out at night on the quiet verily said kareema in a pet thou art a real noodle feroz i tell thee all the good style women do thus and my sister will be there with her boys wah were it not for my handsome inaiyut i should die in this dull old house where folk wish to be better than god made them so it came to pass that while miss julia smith spinster of clapham sat with her fellow workers in the verandah resting after their labours a boyish figure with a beating heart was creeping towards her as the goal of every hope the english mail was in an event which by accentuating the severance from home ties is apt to raise the enthusiasm of the mission house beyond normal how very very interesting it is about the young man ahmed ali remarked julia in a voice tuned to superlatives dearest mrs cranston writes that he spoke so sweetly about his ignorant child wife as she says there is something so so so comforting you know in the thought of work coming to us as if well i can't quite express it you know but from our own homes from dear dear old england there was a large amount of confused good feeling in julia smith a kindly soul she was if a little over sentimental perhaps a broken sixpence stored side by side with a decayed vegetable in her desk formed a creditable explanation of the latter weakness such things account for much in the lives of most women i suppose she continued we were right to refuse without hymns but i shall never forget the sweet child's face as she popped from her prison i am making up the incident for our magazine it will be most touching but now that dearest mrs cranston has written it seems like the finger of providence a boy wanting a miss interrupted the nondescript familiar inseparable from philanthropy in india the one with an umbrella a big hat and a bag of books a very womanly laugh with an undercurrent of militant pleasure ran round the company the description fitted one and all and they were proud of the fact the moon shone bright behind the arches the scent of orange blossoms drifted over the high garden wall and every now and again a burst of laughter close at hand overbore the more distant noise of wedding drums and pipes what do you want my son the soft voice with its strange inflections took away the last vestige of feroza's courage she stood dizzy with absolute fear her tongue cleaving to her mouth a repetition of the question roused her to the memory that here lay her one chance she gave a despairing glance into the gloom in search of those pale blue eyes then suddenly inheritance broke through her terror she flung her hands up to heaven and her young voice rose in the traditional cry for justice dohai dohai we do not keep justice here was the soft answer you must go to the courts for that we are but women and i too am a woman listen the words which had lagged a moment before now crowded to her lips and as she stepped closer her raised arm commanded attention you have taken my husband and left me and i will not be left you gave him scholarships and prizes tempting him away and when i also ask for learning you say 'you must sing' what is singing when i am sad surely god will hear my tears and not your songs her passion swayed her so that but for julia smith's supporting arm she would have fallen i don't understand said the englishwoman kindly what have we done who are you i am the wife of meer ahmed ali barrister at law and i want to be taught euclidus and justinian and the the other things you shall not take him away for always justice i say justice my dears my dears cried julia smith didn't i tell you it was the finger of providence half an hour afterwards little feroza flying back to rejoin her companions felt as if paradise had been opened to her by a promise but if paradise was ajar the orange garden was closed the gate locked the key gone she peered through the bars hoping it was a practical joke to alarm her all was still and silent save for the creak of the well wheel and a soft rustle from the burnished leaves where the moonlight glistened white kareem let me in for pity sake let me in then a wild uncontrollable fear at finding herself alone in an unknown world claimed her body and soul and she fled like a hare to the only refuge she knew the mems must protect her for were they not the cause of her venturing forth at all but for them or their like would she not have been well content at home yea well content the verandah was empty and from within came a monotonous voice she peered into the dimly lit room to see a circle of kneeling figures and hear her own name welded into the even flow of prayer god and his holy prophet they were praying that she might become apostate from the faith of her fathers tales of girls seized and baptised against their will leapt to her memory she covered her eyes as if to shut out the horrid sight and fled whither she neither knew nor cared hai have i found thee at last graceless scandalous scolded some one into whose arms she ran at full tilt mytab oh dear mytab she cried clinging frantically to the familiar figure take me home oh please take me home i will never go out again no never that was the determination of ignorance eighteen months after wisdom had altered it and many other things for during that time julia smith had sung hymns on the doorstep three days a week sometimes she had quite a large audience and sometimes feroza herself would listen at the lattice on these occasions the thin voice had a ring in it for despite the fact that her pupil was taught all the truths of religion in prose and monotone poor julia used to wonder if this relegating of hymns to the doorstep was not a bowing in the house of rimmon nay worse a neglect of grace for she loved her pupil dearly not one but two pair of eyes glistened over the surprise in preparation for the absent husband wherefore a surprise no one knew but surprise it was to be feroza said the idea originated in her teacher's sentimental brain if so it took root quickly in the girl's passionate heart thus beyond the fact of her learning to read and write the meer knew nothing of the change wisdom was working in his wife and meanwhile time brought other changes to the quiet courtyard handsome dissipated inaiyut died of cholera and over him and the boy baby she lost kareema shed tears which did not dim her beauty three months after she was once more making the bare walls ring with her inconsequent laughter she jeered at feroza's diligence with increased scorn no man she said was worth the losing of looks in books and if the meer really spoke of return a course of cosmetics would be more advisable even julia shook her head over feroza's thin face you work too hard dear she sighed ah if it were the one thing needful but i have failed to teach you that dear miss don't look sad think of the difference you have wrought oh do not cry she went on passionately for the mild blue eyes were filling with tears come we will talk of his return full of noble resolutions of self sacrifice to find oh dear dear miss i am so happy so dreadfully happy as she buried her face in the gingham dress her voice sank to a murmur of pure content but some unkind person had poisoned julia's peace with remarks of the mixing of unknown chemicals after all what did she know of this absent husband save that dear mrs cranston had met him at a conversazione i suppose the meer is really an enlightened man she asked dubiously the gingham dress gave up a scared face dear miss why he is a barrister at law her teacher coughed but are you sure dear that he wanted you to learn not everything because he did not think i could but he spoke of many things i have learnt all except except what feroza hesitated i was not sure inaiyut said he would teach it but he died 'tis only a game called whist whist do i not say it right w h i s t wist oh miss is it a wicked game is it not fit ought i not to learn it the fire of questions reduced julia smith's confusion to simple tears i don't know she moaned that is the worst i thought it was the finger of providence and ah feroza if i have done you harm you have done me no harm said feroza with a kind smile you have harmed yourself with cinnamon tea and greasy fritters in the other zenanas and you shall have some english fashion to take away your headache so grumbling mytab brought an afternoon tea tray duly supplied with a plate of thin bread and butter from within and feroza's small brown face beamed over julia smith's surprise he will think himself back amongst the mems won't he she asked with a happy laugh would he as she jolted home in her palanquin julia's head whirled old and new ignorance and wisdom here was a jumble a stronger brain than hers might well have felt confusion for it was sunset in that heathen town and from the housetops in the courtyards in the very streets men paused to lay aside their trivial selves and worship an ideal not one of the crowd giving place to the mission lady but had in some way or another if only by a perfunctory performance of some rite testified that day to the fact that religion formed a part of his daily round his common task and on the other side of the world whence the missions come meanwhile kareema bewailing the useless cards found herself backed up by old mytaben such knowledge the old woman said would have been more useful than learning to be cleaner than god made you 'twas easy to sneer at henna dyed hands but was that worse than using scented soaps like a bad one and living luxurious sheets and towels forsooth why shah jehan himself never dreamed of such expenses i like them for all that cried kareema gaily and i think the mems are wise to have big looking glasses it is hateful only seeing a little bit of one's self at a time and feroza and i are going out to be admired like the mems aren't we feroza if the meer wishes it replied her sister in law gravely mytab looked from one to the other have a care players with fire she said shrilly have a care is the world changed because it reads books and washes lo the customs of the fathers bind the children mytab hath been mysterious of late remarked kareema giving a queer look as the old lady moved away in wrath ah me if i had but my handsome inaiyut dicing in the vestibule 'twould be better for all of us maybe feroza laid her soft hand gently on the other's shoulder i am so sorry for thee dear but we will love thee always and be a sister and brother kareema's look was queerer than ever and she laughed hysterically the day came at last when feroza sat in the sunlit courtyard holding another unopened letter in her hand knowing that ere a week was over the writer would be prisoned in her kind arms surrounded by friendly faces caught in the meshes of familiar custom she was not afraid even though his letters gave her small clue to the man himself her own convictions were strong enough to supply him with opinions also and even if she did not come up to his ideal at first she felt that the sweet satisfaction of a return to home and kindred would count for and not against her so she sat idly delaying to read and dreaming over the past much as she had dreamt over the future nearly two years before only she sat on a chair now and her white stockings and patent leather shoes twisted themselves tortuously about its legs she thought mostly of the childish time when she their cousin had played with ahmed ali and inaiyut it seemed somehow nearer than those other days when the studious lad's departure for college had been prefaced by that strange unreal marriage and kareema watched her furtively from the far corner where she and mytab were making preserves suddenly a loud call fiercely imperative made them come sheepishly forward to where feroza stood at bay one hand at her throat the other crushing her husband's letter what is this what have you all been keeping from me what does he mean this talk of duty and custom ah h h her voice steady till then broke into a ringing cry as a trivial detail in kareema's reluctant figure caught her eye the palms and nails of those delicate hands were no longer stained with henna they were as her own as nature made them as the meer sahib said he liked them she seized both wrists fiercely turning the accusing palms to heaven while a tempest of sheer animal jealousy beat the wretched girl down from each new won foothold down down to the inherited nature underneath then it is true she gasped i see i know holy prophet what infamy to talk of duty he is to marry and i who have slaved he is mine mine i say thou shalt not have him mytab's chill old hand fell on the girl's straining arm like the touch of death allah akhbar wa mohammed rasul hast forgotten the faith feroza begum moguli thine since when has the wife a right to claim all since when hast thou become a mem the girl glared at her with wild passion and kareema gave a whimper as the grip bit into her tender wrists don't you hurt me feroza flung them from her in contemptuous loathing fool coward as if he would touch you i will tell him all he will know ah god my head my head she was in the dust at their feet stunned by her own passion i warned the moulvie to break it by degrees grumbled mytab dragging the girl to some matting but he said 'twould make no more to her than to the meer books don't seem to change a man but women are different it's not my fault whimpered kareema i don't want to marry the meer he was ever a noodle prating of its being a duty forsooth so it is a bounden duty never hath childless widow had to leave this house and never shall till god makes us pigs of unbelievers i wish my handsome inaiyut had lived for all that muttered the girl as feroza showed signs of recovery she resisted all attempts at explanation or comfort however and made her way alone a solitary resolute figure to her windowless room where when she shut the door all was dark there she lay tearless while the others sitting in the sunlight talked in whispers as if the dead were within the moulvie must bid her repeat the creed was old mytab's ultimatum god send the miss has not made a christian of her with all those soapings and washings she had no spark of pity such was woman's lot and to rebel was sacrilege don't make sure of my consent pouted kareema her pretty face swollen with easy tears if he is really the noodle feroza deems i'd rather be a religious 'twould be just as amusing mytab laughed derisively thou a religious the gossips would have tired tongues besides choice is over had the child lived perhaps but now the moulvie hath a right to see inaiyut's children on his knee the sunshine had given place to shadow before feroza appeared bring me a burka i am going to see the miss follow if thou wilt she said and though her voice had lost its ring the tone warned mytab to raise no objection ere she left the sheltering walls she stood a moment before her sister in law all the character and grief and passion blotted out by the formless white domino she wore i could kill you for being pretty she said in a hard whisper as she turned away she had never been to the mission house since that eventful night and the sight of its familiar unfamiliarity renewed the sense of injury with which she had last seen it miss eshsmitt sahib they told her was ill but she would take no denial and so for the first time in her life feroza entered an english lady's bedroom simple almost poor as this one was in its appointments the sight sent a throb of fear to the girl's heart what was not kareema's beauty odds enough that she must fight also against this undreamed of comfort she flung up her arms with the old cry dohai dohai the fever flushed face on the frilled pillows turned fearfully what is it feroza oh what is it the question was hard to solve even in the calm sessions of thought well nigh impossible here why had she been lured from the old life in some ways and not in all was their boasted influence all words then why had they prated of higher things why had they lied to her poor julia buried her face in a pocket handkerchief drenched in eau de cologne and sobbed ah take her away please take her away so they led her gently to the text hung drawing room with a cottage piano in one corner and shook their heads over her passionate appeals they could do nothing they said nothing at all unless she cast in her lot with them absolutely so she turned and left them with a sombre fire in her eyes she never knew how the days passed until as she watched the sunlight creep up the eastern wall of the court it came home to her that on the next evening meer ahmed ali would watch it also she seemed not to have thought and it was kareema and not she who had shed tears on that last night the latter came to where her cousin lay still but sleepless why wilt be so foolish feroza she said petulantly nothing is settled if he is a noodle i will none of him i tell thee if not thou art too much of one thyself to care god knows he may not look at either through being enamoured of the mems and oh feroza she added her sympathy overborne by curiosity think you he will wear the strange dress of the miss sahib's sun pictures if so i shall laugh of a surety a gleam of consolation shot through poor feroza's brain men disliked ridicule of course the meer dresses europe fashion she replied stiffly thou seemest to forget that my husband is a man of culture a man of culture undoubtedly if by culture we mean dutiful self improvement that had been meer ahmed ali's occupation for years and his gentle high bred face bore unmistakably the look of one stowing away knowledge for future use he was really an excellent young man and during his three years at a boarding house in notting hill had behaved himself as few young men do when first turned loose in london he spoke english perfectly and it would be difficult to say what he had not learnt that could be learnt by an adaptive nature in the space of thirty six calendar months spent in diligent polishing of the surface of things he learnt for instance that people looking at his handsome intelligent face said it made them sad to think of his being married as a boy to a girl he did not love thence the idea that he was a martyr took root and flourished and he acquiesced proudly in his own sacrifice on the altar of progress for him the love of the poets was not and even in his desire for feroza's education he told himself that he was more actuated by a sense of duty than by any hope of greater happiness for himself the natural suggestion that he should marry his brother's widow he looked on merely as a further development of previous bondage and he told himself again that not having swerved a hair's breadth from his faith he was bound to set his own views aside in favour of a custom desired by those chiefly concerned besides in the atmosphere of surprised sympathy in which he lived it was hard indeed not to pose as a victim and so just as poor feroza was confidently asserting his culture he having given his english fellow passengers the slip was once more putting on the clothes of an orthodox mohammedan feroza on the other hand had adopted the dress of the advanced indian lady which with surprisingly little change manages to destroy all the grace of the original costume the lack of braided hair and clustering jewels degrades the veil to an unnecessary wrap the propriety of the bodice intensifies its shapelessness the very face suffers by the unconcealed holes in ears and nose kareema stared with a smile akin to tears there is time she pleaded come i can make you look twice as well their eyes met with something of the old affection but feroza shook her head i must find out if he is a noodle the interrupting giggle was almost a whimper you mean if he is blind ah feroza look at me no need to say that the puzzled eyes had taken in the sight already gleams of jewelled hair under the gold threaded veil a figure revealed by the net bodice worn over a scantier one of flowered muslin bare feet tucked away in shells of shoes long gauze draperies showing a shadow of silk clad limbs above it all that dimpling smiling face she shook her head again in the long minutes of waiting she lost herself in counting the bricks on the familiar wall until the sight of a tall man at the door dressed as a mohammedan startled her into drawing the veil to her face in fear of intrusion as the man withdrew quickly kareema's laugh rang out to think feroza thou shouldest be purdah to him after all thy big talk the meer was that the meer faltered feroza i did not the dress bah i knew the likeness to my poor inaiyut see yonder he comes again ushered by father in law now quick feroza the voice quavering over the prepared phrases of thanks to the great giver of home coming was infinitely pathetic and yet as ahmed ali took the outstretched hand he was conscious above all things of a regret almost a sense of outrage for the bondage of custom was upon him already kareema catching his look came forward with ready tact we welcome my lord she said in the rounded tone of ceremony as one who having travelled far returns to those who have naught worthy his acceptance save the memory of kinship my sister and i greet you as sisters nay more she added lightly i too shake hands english fashion and if i do it wrong forgive us both since learned feroza is teacher you make me very happy answered the meer heartily how well you are all looking no need to say where his eyes were you mistake meer sahib cried kareema swiftly feroza looks ill 'tis your blame since she worked over hard to please you the forbidden frown came too late to prevent ahmed ali's glance finding it on his wife's face it was not becoming was it so hard to learn he asked with a patronising smile but your handwriting improved immensely of late the tips of feroza's fingers showed bloodless under their nervous clasp but she said nothing indeed she scarcely opened her lips as they sat talking over the morning meal even when the meer refused tea and toast in favour of chupatties and koftas it was kareema who supplied surprise feroza was all eyes and ears and not till the sun tipping over the high walls glared down on them did she lose patience enough to ask vaguely what he thought about it all wah illah cried the moulvie feroza hits the mark what thinkest thou my son but i fear not for thou hast the faithful air and canst doubtless repeat thy creed purely the young man looked round the familiar scene every detail of which fitted so closely to memory that no room remained for the seven years' absence a rush of glad recognition surged to heart and brain making him stand up and give the kalma i am content oh my father he cried in ringing tones as the sonorous echoes died away to silence i am content to come back to the old life to the old duties the sun makes my head ache said feroza rising abruptly i will go into the dark and rest don't go feroza thou hast not told the meer about thyself pleaded kareema rising in her turn she hath worked so hard she added petulantly to the young man no one is worth it no one the meer looked from one to the other learning is hard for women he began then something in his wife's face roused the new man in him making him say in a totally different tone and manner i am afraid i hardly understand that is what kareema says of me replied feroza icily her cousin as she sat down once more to listen shrugged her shoulders and she counted herself as something better than a woman was her inward comment amid her smiles feroza saw nothing of her husband for the rest of the day the men's court was crowded with visitors and she herself had to bear the brunt of many feminine congratulations only at sunset before starting to attend a feast given in his honour he found time for five minutes' speech with her but almost to her relief he was far too content far too excited by his own pleasure to be able to distinguish any other feeling in her mind yet a momentary hesitation on his part as he was leaving made her heart bound and a distinct pause brought her to his side with wistful eyes only to see kareema nodding and smiling to him from the roof whither she had gone for fresher air what is it he asked kindly though his looks were elsewhere nothing she answered nothing at all go in peace the moon rising ere the sun set stole the twilight so she sat gazing at the hard square outlines of the walls till far on into the night her mind filled with but one thought the thought that by and by ahmed ali flushed with content at things which she had taught herself for his sake to despise would come home to her to his wife the little room she had travestied into a pitiful caricature of foreign fashions seemed to mock her foolish hopes so she crept away to the lattice whence she had had her first glimpse of wisdom even on that brilliant night the vestibule itself was dark but through the door she could see the empty arcades of the men's court surrounding the well where she and her cousins used to play a rustle in the alley made her peer through the fret work for the veriest trifle swayed her but it was only a dog seeking garbage in the gutter then a door creaked and she started wondering if ahmed ali could be home already silence brought her a dim suspicion that but for this wisdom of hers she might have waited his return calmly enough footsteps now she cowered to the shadow at the sight of kareema followed by mytab bearing something he mayn't be back till late came the familiar giggle and a soft pillow will please him the pair were back again before she recovered her surprise and kareema paused ere re entering the women's door poor feroza she will get accustomed to it i suppose of what hath she to complain retorted the old voice he is a properer man than i deemed say heart's desire what said he when i saw thee mytab thou mean spy bah he told me he would change a letter and call me carina since it meant dearest in some heathen tongue they begin thus over the black water likely 'tis not bad and new at any rate feroza scarcely waited for distance to deaden the answering giggle she was on her feet pacing to and fro like a mad creature ah to get away from it all from that name from the look he must have given to get something cold and still to quench the raging fire in her veins suddenly without a waver she walked to the well and leant over its low parapet her hands sought the cool damp stones her eyes rested themselves on the faint glimmer far down ever oh ever so far away hark some one in the alley if it were he ah then she must go away ever so far away meer ahmed ali found his pillow comfortable and only woke in the dawn to see mytab standing beside him feroza she cried where is feroza a dull remorse came to his drowsy brain it was so late i holy prophet she is not here thou hast not seen her then she hath gone to the missen to be baptised why didst turn her brain with books fool idiot the mission meer ahmed ali was awake now and the peaceful party gathered in the verandah for early tea stared as the young man burst in on it with imperious demands for his wife then his surroundings recalled his acquired courtesy and he stammered an apologetic explanation she has gone away cried julia with a queer catch in her breath oh meer sahib what a mistake we have all made it was too late to write and then i got ill but indeed i was going down this very morning to try and make you understand understand what asked the meer helplessly confused adding hurriedly but i can't stay now she must be found i will not have her run away i will have her back yes i will have her back half an hour later julia smith driven to the moulvie's house by remorseful anxiety found the wicket gate ajar she entered silently upon a scene framed like a picture by the dark doorway of the men's court feroza had come back to those familiar walls she lay beside the well and the water from her clinging garments crept in dark stains through the dust she had wrapped her veil round her to stifle useless cries and so the dead face as in life was decently hidden from the eyes of men she lay alone under the cloudless sky for her friends shrinking from the defilement of death stood apart kareema sobbing on mytab's breast with ahmed ali dazed yet indignant holding her hand the moulvie repeating a prayer the servants still breathless from their ghastly toil julia smith saw it all with her bodily eyes yet nothing seemed worth seeing save that veiled figure in the dust she knelt beside it and took the slender cold hand in hers my dear my dear she whispered through her sobs surely you need not have gone so far so very far for help but the dead face was hidden even from her tears in the house of a coppersmith i the clangour of metal upon metal filling the low dark workshop pulsating out into the hot sunshine of the courtyards behind and the hot shadow of the narrow street in front pulsating musically yet with an undercurrent of jarring vibration like a north country burr on a woman's tongue the whole best described perchance in the native name for the copper which the workmen were hammering and welding into pots and pans tambur tam bur tam burr urr ur thus endlessly through afternoon sunshine and afternoon shade as the shine fell full on a woman who was sitting silently beside a row of mud cooking places in the first courtyard so still so silent it seemed as if the waves of sound must break baffled upon the carven folds of the coarse whitey brown veil which covering her almost from head to foot was drawn tight over the forehead to conceal the hair and wound tight under the chin so as to hide all save the oval face barred by level black brows and the brown curves of a wide mouth only about her feet a voluminous petticoat showed its dingy red and green borderings like a frill the typical dress of a widow in northern india and the face matched it more indifferent than sad the lack of vitality inseparable from the conviction that the life is not worth living written on every feature blurring its beauty for durga dei had been beautiful a year ago when sunsetting had sent the master coppersmith to tell her so and praise the order of a well kept house now the shadow creeping inch by inch along the sunlit dust and up the sunlit mud wall brought her no emotion save the mechanical hope that the lentils would be properly cooked by supper time and the vague wonder why her sister in law's shrill voice had not recommenced the conjugation of the imperative mood from the inner court parbutti had been sleeping longer than usual she who but a year agone would no more have dared to sleep and as for command was not a dewarani the husband's younger brother's wife bound by every principle of religion and decency to obey durga dei's black brows grew straighter at the thought of the change one short year had wrought and gopal parbutti's husband was the master now a pretty master for all his good looks for all his learning yet what else could one expect seeing he had spent his youth over books at the municipal school while his elder brother despite his crippled condition had kept the ancestral business a going yes on that point the dead husband had been weak and yet how proud he had been of the handsome lad who was to bring sons to the ancestral hearth but he had not even done so much though to be sure for that parbutti was to blame a jealous wife too selfish durga durga dei the broom quick am i to sit in the dust like a lone widow because thou art lazy the broom i say the voice which overbore one clamour by another was not pleasant but it was so in comparison with durga's face as she rose reluctantly a thousand times more so than that same face when after a few minutes of listening to the high pitched voice the shrouded figure showed again through the doorway leading to the inner court not an ungraceful figure despite its shroud as it leant despondently against the lintel while the black eyes shifted in a sort of helpless indifference over the blank walls imprisoning them a year ago only a year ago her unpractised brain attempted no other complaint but this unformulated sense of injury possessed her utterly and everything in heaven and earth became an outrage on that capable past when she had held the reins of government of a truth in that small kingdom of hers behind the coppersmith's shop naught had been wanting that she could compass naught save children for that parbutti feckless parbutti with youth and health and strength on both sides was far more responsible than she if the curse had been hers would she not gladly have given a handmaiden to her lord but they had waited for the brother's child which would be as their own and in that hope had refused to adopt a son while yet there was time even now the small supple hands sought the crevices beyond the door lintel against which they had been resting slackly sought them as if intent on finding some flaw some finger hold in the blank brick wall yes even now but for parbutti's indecent jealousy the old customs might bring a tardy comfort and give her the widow back something of her lost power and position the mosaic maxim let him take the woman and raise up children to his brother was so familiar to durga dei that its fulfilment in this case seemed to her quite commonplace married to gopal by kurao she would not of course regain her status as the wife but she might find solace as the house mother if there were children the passion of hearth and home was strong in her as it is in most good hindu women and it is not too much to say that the disregard of time honoured custom towards herself counted for far less in her resentment than the disregard of a time honoured custom which was clearly for the good of the family since she would then have the right to keep handsome lazy gopal and his work together for the sake of the son who might be born to the old trade she was of the stern old school but those two were not and so between the hearth and that calm perpetuity in which lay its only chance of success stood a strong woman's jealousy and a weak man's cunning for gopal knew well that sooner or later even the most indecent of barren wives must give her lord a child bringer and in such case without being bad to the heart's core a handsome fellow like gopal might well speculate on a youthful bride in the future rather than take a widow in the present since parbutti would never allow both so on the whole he was not so much to blame men were men when all was said and done they loved beauty yet she had been beautiful surely she had been beautiful the clangour ceased suddenly leaving as it were an echo in the chime of the police office gong at the nearest gate striking the hour five o'clock durga as she counted the strokes smiled contemptuously as usual gopal was seizing on the first excuse for knocking off work though a good two hours of daylight remained for the industrious for the old style masters such as her dead husband had been but this one did not even trouble to see the shop properly closed the implements put aside or guard against the prentice trick of concealing a handful or two of snippings and filings for there was his lithe figure at the door about to cross to the inner courtyard to ease and indolence to his supper to to parbutti a flash of intense vitality came to durga's face despite its silence its absolute stillness her whole figure was instinct with life as she stood looking at the man opposite her he was about her own age and the scanty clothing of the artisan clashes left the strength and beauty of his limbs unconcealed the face was handsome also and pleasant in its beardless contours surrounded by the fringe of silky black hair showing beneath the artisan's round calico cap both figure and features displaying at their best the characteristics of that curious guild which for thousands of years has defied the sudra origin imputed to it by the brahmans and worn the sacred thread of the twice born in the smithy the mason's yard and the carpenter's shop it curved now like a piece of whipcord across the bronze body to which the afternoon sunshine sent gleams of gold as it shone on the sweat dewed muscles a fine young fellow certainly with the thin deft hands and feet which are the outcome of generations on generations of manual dexterity displayed in one and only one direction so far a type of past ages when nasmyth hammers and archimedean drills were unknown yet they were not unknown to gopal the coppersmith he had not been idle at the municipal school where the primers discourse glibly of all the wonders of the world all the marvels born from that curious potentiality the human brain so the forty and odd ounces of grey matter in gopal's own skull were leavened with ideas foreign to those which had been transmitted to him through ages of slow heredity a curious anomaly one which has to be taken into account by the master builders of the great imperial institute when they count the cost of progress and yet as he paused arrested by the glow on durga's face his thoughts defied his education for it came home to him suddenly causelessly that this woman the widow of his dead brother was beautiful and that he had a right to her if he chose yes she was beautiful far more beautiful despite her widowhood than the jealous wife awaiting him within and she was his by right if he chose why should he not choose these thoughts were crowding culture from his brain as he crossed the courtyard without a word for convention so far held him fast only as she stepped aside from the door to let him pass their eyes met when he had gone and the sound of parbutti's shrill welcoming rose over the high partition wall durga crouched down beside the fireplace and blew softly at the smouldering embers under the pot of lentils it was woman's work to fan a flame if if it were not fierce enough to do its duty to the hearth easy work also a woman could do it with no more exertion than would make the bosom rise and fall a trifle quicker or send a tremble through the arm supporting the bowed shoulder no more than that and even that parbutti did not notice as she bustled out full of wifely service and housewifely blame to set the finishing touches to the meal and carry it off to the hungry master leaving a shapeless bundle of widowhood waiting indifferently for such dog's share of food as might be left when other appetites were satisfied then a great silence seemed to take possession of and fill the outer court just as the clangour had filled it and still durga sat waiting her eyes upon the fire the sunlight left the wall to dull shadow the flames died down but no one called perhaps they had eaten everything and she must stave off her whole day's hunger with a handful of parched grain well 'twould count as a virtue not for herself but for the dead husband who had gone down to death sonless not by her fault though not by her fault the old vague sense of injury returned lulling her to a sort of resignation durga durga dei she started from a half doze to see parbutti pausing on her way to the outer door in order to exclaim at laziness exclaiming all the louder because gopal also on his way to the world beyond those four walls stood by listening both to the scolding and the silence suddenly he moved impatiently to the door come wife there is no time for such things nowadays stay wrangling if thou wilt i hate it all holy lukshmi it hath been so since the world began and i am tired of it he scarcely knew his own meaning only this was clear the old customs the old conventional ways were an annoyance yet as he walked moodily down the narrow street towards the police station his mind circled round one thought he had a right by immemorial usage to claim durga if he chose a queer medley altogether was gopal the coppersmith seated in the growing darkness on a certain flight of steps leading at one and the same time to a small hindu temple and the back door of a native printing office just over the way a yellow trousered constable was pacing up and down in front of the police and octroi station between a patent birmingham made weighing machine warranted all the latest improvements and a primitive water clock thus as it were keeping watch over the due measurement of the two great staples of civilisation time and money and looking with equal impartiality at the rising beam registering its burden accurately and the copper bowl made no doubt by a forebear of gopal's sinking lower and lower as the water filtered through the hole in its bottom until it marked the whereabouts of an hour by having to be fished up and set afloat once more on the sea of time like the soul of a man according to the theory of metempsychosis this flight of steps was a favourite resort of the idle for lying as it did just within the city gate it was a coign of vantage whence things new and old might be seen clearly side by side gopal liked it because he himself was compounded of ancient characters and modern ideas he sat gossiping over an ill printed newspaper watching the worshippers go up to do pooja in the temple commenting on the last police news and the chance of so and so being run in for a breach of the bye laws while through the high arched gateway showing in shadow against the darkening sky the herds of cattle came trooping dustily undriven save by custom and the homing instinct a packed throng streaming through the gate in unison then separating into flocks and so by endless unswerving subdivision through highways and byeways into units arriving each at last in the familiar stall one of them a big pearl grey soft eyed creature walked in composedly to the courtyard where durga dei still crouched by the ashes of the fire and sidling into her accustomed corner lowed for her supper the woman rose and brought it mechanically the cow at any rate must not fast as she mixed the portion of parched grain with the fodder it smelt appetising but she did not taste it the hunger that was on her was not to be stayed by food she did not envy parbutti away at the wedding festivities at a neighbour's house those festivities whence the ill omened widow's face was barred she did not envy gopal sitting on the steps watching the current of life slip into the old and the new channels but in a vague way she envied motiya the milk giver her honoured place by the hearthstone she envied her the calf which the milker on his rounds loosed from its tether in the dark shed and an answering quiver seemed to run through her limbs as she saw the mother yield to the first rough touch of the sucking tongue when that was over she crouched down again to brood over the empty house parbutti would not be back till all hours and gopal what of gopal the night settled down there was no moon only a spangled star or two showing in the narrow slip of sky above her the noise of the city without seemed lost in the stillness of the courtyard where through the darkness you could hear the sound of motiya chewing the cud of content that in one corner in the other something different and yet durga durga dei it was gopal's voice through the darkness ii the dark nights had yielded to light ones and drawn back into darkness again more than once before the second act of the drama began such a still night the moon over riding the high walls shone straight down upon a man and a woman standing beside the row of fireplaces where the dead ashes of the past day's flame showed white through the stillness and the moonshine a man's voice petulant almost peevish lo i told thee from the beginning it must be so there is time yet have patience awhile durga when there is no escape parbutti will yield that is woman's way thou knowest that i love thee were it not so why should i have sought thee durga's clasped hands fell from their hold upon his arm listlessly yea thou didst love me that is true and i knowest thou gopal why my heart sinks now as it never did when first i yielded to thy plan for peace then it seemed naught to keep it secret awhile no harm no blame but now gopal knowest thou it comes upon me even as if i were a shameless one since since i have learnt to care her voice died away to a whisper her dark eyes sought his with a passionate gloom in them before which his shifted uneasily a wife should love her husband surely so say the scriptures and thou lovest old sayings o durga yea and she should obey him also so let the question be awhile when due time comes parbutti shall be told that the old custom hath prevailed and that the child is of the hearth she is quick witted and will see that after all 'tis better for her than a stranger wife a certain aggressiveness of accent provoked a sharp half questioning protest and for thee also gopal surely 'tis best for thee if as thou sayest i am dear unto thee for me also if thou desirest it so though we men ask first that our women live in peace but see the moon climbs high parbutti will be returning and she must not suspect yet awhile look not so troubled durga sure i love thee else wherefore should i have sought thee the repetition of this argument seemed as much for his own conviction as for hers and there was something of the same motive in the half hearted kiss he stooped to bestow upon her to his surprise she shrank from it and the unexpected rebuff bringing sudden stimulus to his passion he slid his arm under the widow's shroud and drew her towards him with a patronising laugh lo thou art a fool durga afraid because thou hast found a weak spot in thy heart for lazy gopal when thou shouldest be thanking thy namesake mai bhavani for sending pleasure in the path of duty afraid lest folk should blame thee when woman like thou shouldest be praying the gods parbutti might return even now to see thee preferred before her the words were spoken lightly and the speaker's eyes smiled into the earnest ones raised to his so neither saw a muffled form at the entrance behind them a form which showed itself for a second then shrank back behind the strip of wall built like a screen across the outer door if she came gopal wouldst thou tell her the truth the night was so still that every word of the passionate whisper was audible to that unseen listener sure would i sweetheart if only to prevent her claws from scratching for look you once 'tis known that you and i have settled it she can do naught save quarrel that is why i say wait till the last there will be no time then for words or wiles now durga i must go i would not she had the knowledge secretly that were an evil chance the night was so still that a keen listener might have heard a light footfall behind the screen as if some one were stealing away from it but those two only heard their own soft breathing as their lips met durga durga asleep as usual and i bade thee keep the fire aglow lest i should need aught the familiar fault finding rang through the courtyard and not even a tremble in parbutti's voice betrayed knowledge of that unseen listener who five minutes before had hid behind the screen gopal was right her wits were quick to seize on what was to her own advantage anger and reproach were desirable doubtless but what if they left her helpless besides there was time to spare for such things when she had accepted the inevitable so through the still summer night she lay awake piecing together a plan of revenge against the woman who on the other side of the mud wall lay awake piecing together her plan for peace revenge that was the first consideration if it could be combined with comparative comfort peace yes peace if it could be had without that gnawing sense of shame which had come so unexpectedly to complicate the situation so much for the women's thoughts as for the man's as he sat in the dawning light eating his morning meal they might have been inferred from a certain irritation towards both the women who in one way or another were engaged in ministering to his comfort for polygamy is not altogether tragic it is often comic at times almost farcical the clangour of metal upon metal rose with the sun and all through the long hot day the beat and the burr filled the courtyards where those two women went about their daily tasks when evening came it brought gopal an unusual display of platters at supper time an unusual sweetness both in the viands and in parbutti's voice lo 'tis like a wedding feast wife he said well pleased she gave an odd little hysterical laugh perhaps 'tis time there was a wedding o gopal then she grew grave thy people say so and mine also even last night mai radha spoke to me of her daughter and perhaps 'twere better so thou wouldst not cease to love me o gopal because i brought thee fair sons ay and a fair wife too her face was turned away she spoke softly regretfully dutifully as a good hindu wife should under the circumstances and her husband could hardly believe his ears parbutti jealous parbutti suggesting a wife of her own choice here indeed would have been a chance of peace were it not for durga what a fool he had been to be so precipitate a sudden regard for the wife who was prepared to sacrifice so much to him mingled not unnaturally with a corresponding resentment against the woman whose love was certain to stand in the way of his pleasure yet he was too much taken aback for real assent or denial and murmured something incoherently about there being no need for hurry no need to bring a strange woman to the house as yet parbutti's conventional decorum gave way before even this faint allusion to realities and she turned upon him sharply wherefore no stranger gopal sure it must be so seeing thou wouldst not mock me by thinking of a widow a childless widow 'tis not as if thou didst set store by foolish old ways 'tis not as though thou wast old and foolish thyself thou canst choose a virgin bride and thou shalt choose one else will i not yield thee for thine own sake husband i will not mai radha's daughter is worthy of thee lo i have seen her but if thou heedest me not inquire of her secretly durga is old and a widow we want no more childless ones in this house nor her sons even if fate were kind for look you i hate her i hate her gopal's faint protest died down before parbutti's vehemence if she hated she hated and there was an end of it no use in words or for the matter of that in deeds he went moodily out into the bazaars for comfort telling himself he had been a fool to let his fancy for a woman as old as he was fetter his future he might have known it would not last that was the worst of it had he braved parbutti's shrill wrath at first when the passion was there it might have seemed worth while to suffer discomfort now it was hard to hark back dutywards what a fool he had been halting as it were between the new and the old he had glozed over the secrecy by appealing to the customs of his forefathers and now he hated the tie they imposed upon him durga was his dead brother's widow but what right had she to more consideration than any other woman who had yielded to a man's promise she was no better than those others would be no worse off than those others if he even gopal could not put the thought plainly before himself so he took refuge in a general sense of injury let be let be he said angrily the next time that durga with a growing passion in her voice demanded that he should admit the truth and if thou sayest a word i swear i will deny it nay look not so durga i meant only if thou wilt not obey she stood as if turned to stone thou wouldst deny it deny thy brother's child thou durst not lest the gods should slay thee for the infamy he gave an embarrassed laugh thou believest in the gods more than i durga but i mean no harm to thee none shall say aught against thee if thou wilt have patience iii and see that thou cleanest them well they may be wanted ere long there was jeering malice in words tone and manner as parbutti handed over the tarnished silver ornaments but durga took them without a word that aggressive silence of hers seeming as it always did to defy the ceaseless clang of the copper which as usual filled the sunlit courtyard and yet to a woman less restrained than she here was an occasion for bitter outcry the ornaments had been hers in those past days of honoured wifehood now they were parbutti's to wear or to give as she chose but what did that matter what did anything matter if only gopal could be kept content if only gopal could be kept to his promise two months of patience two months of growing anxiety had told against durga dei's good looks according to native standards though to western eyes the face had gained more than it had lost there was no indifference in it now that had given place to an eagerness almost painful in its intensity and parbutti as she watched the widow begin her task smiled to herself at the certainty of its being well performed for durga displayed a vast anxiety to please nowadays a most convenient state of affairs for the household generally parbutti smiled again thinking what durga would say when she knew the truth that the ornaments were to go in the wedding baskets of the virgin bride who was to be the reward of gopal's treachery they will need tamarinds to give them back their whiteness thought durga looking at the silver with experienced eyes this interest in the drudgery and detail of her life was not a conscious effort on her part of late a sort of dull comfort had come to her in the knowledge that already in a thousand ways she was standing between the household and that disregard of old ways which to her meant disgrace if not disaster and so it was with a certain pride in her work that while parbutti was sleeping she watched the tamarind pulp boiling away in the copper vessel over the fire until her critical eye told her that its office was over and that the ornaments boiling in it would need no silversmith's aid to enhance their lustre with a certain pride also in her own carefulness she let the pulp stay on the fire till it had regained its original consistency and then set it aside in the storeroom against future use parbutti would not have thought of such economy parbutti in a reckless modern fashion would have thrown the pulp away and bought more when next she wanted some the thought cheered her as still with the same careful conservatism she went on to some other process approved by old tradition for the due cleansing of tarnished silver it was no light matter that keeping of the household ornaments as if they were fresh from the goldsmith's hands for did it not redound to the credit of the hearth when she had worn them none could have told they were not newly made out of new rupees but parbutti thought only of wearing them in a becoming manner well this time she should acknowledge that there was some good in having durga in the house there was something infinitely pathetic in the slow workings of this woman's mind as she sat busy over the ornaments something infinitely pathetic in the pride with which after the two or three days of treatment prescribed she showed them white and glistening to her rival ay they are as new mai radha will deem them so at any rate said parbutti with studied carelessness the time had come for revenge gopal's passion for pleasure had been aroused he would allow nothing now to stand in the way of this projected marriage and so and so there was no harm in springing the mine upon durga there is nothing in heaven or earth so cruel as a jealous woman even when her nature is kindly and parbutti's was not mai radha what hath she to do with them the quick anxiety of the widow's tone was as balm to the other's ears what a mother hath to do with her daughter's trousseau for sure she answered lightly i meant to tell thee ere this but gopal would not have it and 'tis true that widows are ill meddlers with marriage he weds the girl next month by my consent the house needs a child so far durga had stood staring at her enemy incredulously now she flung out her arms in sudden passion letting the widow's shrouding veil fall from her figure recklessly 'tis a lie an infamous lie the house needs no stranger's child thou knowest it yea thou hast known it and this is thy revenge but it shall not be gopal shall speak gopal i say gopal parbutti's hands gripped her rival's as in a vice despite her struggles so is it that and thou wouldst lay the burden of thy shame on gopal base walker of the bazaars betrayer of thy dead lord on gopal who weds a virgin let us see what he saith gopal i say gopal it almost seemed as if their clamour must have pierced that of the coppersmith's shop for the latter ceased suddenly in the slow chiming of five o'clock instinctively the women fell away from each other feeling that the crisis had come another minute would bring the man to answer for himself so they stood waiting for the well known figure on the threshold gopal he recoiled from the sight of them coward to the backbone and parbutti knew it knew the man with whom she had to deal a thousand times better than durga knew him so her shrill voice came first allowing no compromise no shilly shallying durga had claimed him as the father of her child was it true for in that case there was no need to bring a bride to the house nor indeed under such circumstances would mai radha ever consent to her daughter's marriage let him take his choice without delay and durga still gauging him by the measure of her own nature claimed the truth also between the two gopal stood irresolute divided between fear and desire 'tis thy choice o husband came parbutti's shrill voice the widow or the bride thou canst not have both he knew it perfectly it was one or the other and a sudden fierce dislike leapt up against poor durga it is a lie he muttered his eyes upon the ground i have naught to do with her naught durga fell back as if she had been struck but parbutti's laugh of triumph failed before the sombre fire of those big blazing eyes for an instant it seemed as if the former would give herself up to vehement upbraiding then suddenly she passed into the silence of the outer court without a word and crouched down in her favourite attitude beside the smouldering fires she felt sick and faint with horror shame incredulity in all her known world of custom and conduct she seemed to find no foothold on which to recover her balance he had denied her he had denied the hearth her tense fingers hung rigidly without clasp or grip on anything just as her mind seemed to have lost hold on all her beliefs all her knowledge in a dim half dazed way she knew what would happen by and by when opportunity occurred gopal would creep out as he had crept out many a time before and seek to soothe her there need be no scandal no open turning into the streets if she would promise to make no fuss perhaps once the marriage were accomplished he might even be induced to acknowledge the child and at this thought something that was not shame nor anger nor horror but sheer animal jealousy leapt up within her for she had learnt to care as women do learn even when they know that he for whom they care is not worth it so parbutti and this new woman were to have him and she when the brain is quick its owner may suffer more from the very variety and complexity it gives to grief but the grief for all that is less absorbing durga was so lost in hers that she scarcely noticed parbutti coming in after a time to see about the supper there was no call on her for help this evening no blame because the fires were slack and nothing ready to tell truth even parbutti did not care to drive the stunned look from durga's face lest it should be replaced by seven devils so she was left alone yet even so something made her start and for a second her hand moved as if she were about to thrust it out in a gesture of dismay then it sank back listlessly the impulse had come and gone the housewifely impulse of warning to the younger woman that tamarind pulp which had been kept for days in a copper vessel was not likely to be a wholesome ingredient in a man's supper after all what did it matter to her surely parbutti should know such things without being told them if not what right had she to be house mother ousting those who did a curiously petty spite against her simmered up in durga dei's mind and like the bubbles on boiling water served for a time to break up the surface of her hot anger against gopal what was she to save parbutti from the consequences of her own ignorance and negligence there was no more than that in durga's mind as she watched the cooking no more than that and a dumb conviction that somehow the future must be changed utterly changed it could not be as the past had been so much was certain yet as she sat thinking not at all something must have been juggling with her brain for parbutti's first words when an hour or so afterwards she came bustling back into the outer court found their reply ready on durga's lips he is not well she fussed durga thou art more learned in simples than most what shall i give to stay the burning in his throat and keep the sickness from him god send it be not the great sickness but 'tis in the city they say the widow stood up mechanically and her right hand sought once more the crevices of the wall against which she was leaning i know not give him tamarind water an thou likest 'tis not my work but thine revenge had sprung full fledged from her slow brain in familiar face and welcome form and it would not be her doing but parbutti's a sort of sensual delight in the idea surged through her making her add as if to give an edge to the sword of fate yet if the sickness be about 'twere well to have more skill than mine i would not have it said i killed him once more the spite against the woman overbore all other feelings for the time that and a dull recognition of the fact that if gopal died he would be beyond the reach of them all that it would benefit no one save that in good sooth the child would be fatherless instead of and then suddenly those black eyes of hers blazed up fiercely yes that was the only possible end as well now when opportunity offered a beginning as later ay give him tamarind water 'tis best for such as he not a shadow of regret came to her as she watched parbutti follow her advice it was as if since all time this thing had been ordained as if aught else were beyond her control the curious calm with which the oriental regards death even for himself does not count for nothing in such situations as this we of the west who reckon the measure of guilt without it judge harshly even while we judge equitably durga dei did not think out the question at all chance gave her quick opportunity and she took it yet as the night wore on bringing a succession of gossiping neighbours she became restless asking herself if the native doctor summoned from the sahib logue's hospital beyond the walls to satisfy that curious streak of education in the sick man's mind said sooth in declaring it to be a case of cholera or whether the wise woman sent by mai radha was right in hinting at the evil eye was it briefly god's judgment or man's the uncertainty oppressed her so the dawn breaking over that unseen unknown world beyond the house of the coppersmith found three haggard faces within it found the same thought in each heart was it to be death or death in life for one or for all yet each awaited the answer with a strange indifference yes 'tis the great sickness he grows blue and cold already said the neighbours in frank wisdom as they looked in the air was cooler then with the sudden freshness which seems to come with the sun's first rays a thin blue smoke began to rise over the awakening city the sparrows sat preening themselves on the tops of the walls the loose slippers of the visitors as they shuffled over the empty courtyards had whispering gossiping tongues of their own which seemed to echo the ominous cackle of the wearers as they left those three faces to their task of waiting one turned passively to the brightening sky from the low string bed the other two bent on the ground as passively a vessel full of tamarind water stood by the sick man but he had scarcely touched it perhaps after all it was the great sickness durga scarcely knew whether she were glad or sorry at the thought so the sun climbed up until with one clear distinct tam burr urr ur r the daily clamour of the shop began maybe the master would not die maybe he would either way work must be done and no one had said the workers nay as yet gopal is still alive commented the neighbours cheerfully as they listened they will stop likely when they hear the death wail and 'tis as well for him to end as he began with the ring of the metal in his ears the water clock from the stairs where gopal used to sit chimed noon the heavens were as brass a perfect blaze of light beat down on the courtyard and those three faces but one of them waited no longer though it still gazed passively into the pale sky from the ground where it lay and parbutti the new made widow glared in terrified hatred at the face of that other widow who stood looking down at the dead man then suddenly the death wail rose loud and clear in a woman's voice naked he came naked has gone this empty dwelling place belongs neither to you nor to me the clangour ceased ending in a faint vibration like a dying breath listen said the policeman watching the waterclock there is death in the coppersmith's house i heard he was ill of the sickness god save him he hath no son faizullah he was beating his wife an occupation which annihilates time dissolves the crust of culture and reduces humanity in both hemispheres to a state of original sin it is therefore immaterial what faizullah and haiyat bibi did or said during the actual chastisement for they behaved themselves as any other couple in the same circumstances would have done that is to say after the manner of two animals one injured in his feelings the other in her body she screamed vociferously but for all that took her punishment with methodical endurance indeed there was a distinct air of duty on both sides which went far towards disguising the actual violence finally he let her drop decisively but gently in one of the dark corners of the low windowless room and laid aside the bamboo in another from a third crept an older woman silent but sympathetic carrying a lotah full of water with which she administered comfort to the crushed victim faizullah khan watched the gradual subsidence of his wife's sobs with evident satisfaction hast had enough for this time o haiyat he asked mildly or shall i catch thee peeping through the door at the men folk again like a cat after a mouse true 'tis the way thou caughtest me for a husband light of mine eyes but i will have none of it with other men or rather thou shalt pay for the pleasure ay every time surely as the farmer pays the usurer for having a good crop and if there be more than peeping then i will kill thee think not to escape as a mere noseless one some may care to keep a maimed wife secure that none will seek her but not i faizullah khan belooch of birokzai did i not marry thee o haiyat marrow of my bones because of thy fair face then what good wouldst thou be to me without a nose therefore be wise my heart or i shall have to kill thee some day the sahibs will hang thee in pigskin if thou dost whimpered the woman vindictively yea i would die gladly to see thee swing like the wild beast thou art the sense of coercion was evidently passing away nor were there wanting signs that ere long tears would be dried at the flame of wrath fast kindling in haiyat's big black eyes faizullah standing at the open door through which the yellow sunshine streamed in a broad bar of light looked across the mud roof of the lower story past the sandy stretches and broken rocky distance to where a low line of serrated blue mountains blocked the horizon they were the takt i suleiman and beyond their peaks and passes lay beloochistan there are no sahibs yonder he said stretching his right hand towards the hills no one to come between a man and his right of faithful wife god knows i am ready for my father's house again 'tis only thy beauty skin of my soul core of my heart that keeps me dawdling here a stranger in the house of mine ancient enemies why wilt thou not come with me to the mountains o haiyat i am not a wild beast as thou art she retorted still with speech checked by sobs i will stay here and get thee swung for the sahib logues worship a woman away over the black water and do her bidding they will fill thy mouth with dirt and burn thy body and curse thy soul to the nether nay innermost apple of mine eye do i not worship thee and art thou not a belooch also by race though thy people have dug the grave of their courage with the plough and tethered their freedom beside their bullocks they were not always dirt eaters mean spirited big bellied hai hai that was the beginning of the storm what followed drove big faizullah into the court below where the voices of the two women ceased to be articulate for it is one thing to beat the wife of your bosom in order to correct a trifling indiscretion another to deny her and her attendant the right of subsequent abuse so he smoked his pipe placidly and amused himself with polishing his well beloved sword which he kept in defiance of the arms act the poorer women of the village nodded at each other as the shrill clamour floating over the high encircling wall reached the well where they came to draw water the stranger hath big hands chuckled one yet are they smaller than haiyat's eye that comes of being a widow so long there will be murder some day mark my words muttered an old hag with a toothless leer what else canst thou expect from a belooch of birokzai peace peace that is what our men say nowadays in my time if a man of his race had laid a finger on a woman of ours there would have been flames over the border and blood enough to quench them afterwards but they are afraid of the sahibs and the pigskin not so faizullah he is of the old sort knowing how to keep his wife he will not keep her for all that mai sneered a strapping girl who by the handsome water vessels she carried showed herself to be a servant in one of the richer houses we shall get her back some day despite her father in law's wickedness in letting her marry a good for nothing soldier just because of keeping a hold on her jewels hold on their honour o thou false tongue shrilled another of the group the daughter of thy house would have brought shame on ours she needed a fierce one to keep her straight after the man woman thy house gave her first o depraved tongue that tasteth not the truth had thy people sent her back our house would have kept her safe enough and her jewels doubtless so the war of words begun on the top story of faizullah's house found its way into the narrow village street and thence into many a mud walled courtyard where the women set down the pots of water and rested themselves in wrangling it even went further for in not a few of them when the men came back from their day's work in the fields the subject of haiyat bibi's peeping eyes and covetous jewels gave rise to slow deliberate conversation over the evening pipe faizullah was right to beat her of course on that point all were agreed the rest was open to argument and had been so any time these last two years ever since the bold belooch of birokzai on his way home from short service in a frontier regiment had halted in his retreat at the sight of a pair of big black eyes behind the chink of a door long before that however the question as to whether those jewels of haiyat bibi's were to come back with her in search of a new bridegroom among her own relations or to remain with her in her late husband's family had greatly exercised the minds of this little village which lay as it were safely tucked away between the sheets of sand in the bed of the indus and the soft pillow like curves of the rising ground it was given to be excited over trifles this far away peaceful looking cluster of mud huts for beneath the newly acquired placidity of the peasant which its inhabitants presented on the surface the lawlessness of the border bravo remained ready for any emergency on the whole however it afforded a beautiful example of the civilising effects of agriculture and as such figured in many reports having as their object the glorification of british rule consequently it was watched with jealous eyes by the district and police officials who felt their sheet anchor of reference would be gone did any serious crime occur to throw discredit on the converted community despite this constant care the village might have been situated in the moon for all the authorities knew of the pretty intrigues the hopes and fears which formed the mainspring of its life even the ordinary human interests of its inhabitants were all too low in tone and insignificant to secure alien sympathy so haiyat bibi's peeping eyes and her delhi made jewels were disturbing elements unknown to those who signed the monthly criminal reports with placid self satisfaction at their own success in securing virtue even when egged on by the family her best looking male cousin made bids for possession of both these charms in various underhand ways the consequent employment of faizullah khan's marital discipline did not resound so far as the hakm's ears therefore it was an unpleasant surprise when some six weeks after the original homily against peeping the significant red envelope which proclaims the shedding of blood found its way into the deputy commissioner's mail bag and brought the news of haiyat bibi's murder by her husband and his subsequent flight to the hills furthermore it was reported by the sergeant of police whose very writing showed signs of trepidation that the whole village was in an uproar and he himself quite unable to cope with the situation as luck would have it some eighty miles of desert and alluvial land lay between the excited village and the fountains of law and order for when the red envelope arrived the responsible officials were in camp at the other end of the district nearly a week passed ere they could arrive on the scene and by that time the villagers had sworn to renew a blood feud which in past days had thriven bravely between their clan and that of the murderer they were in fact on the point of turning their ploughshares into swords an example which is dangerously contagious among the border tribes owing therefore to the necessity of persuading the people to trust the far reaching arm of the law for revenge instead of seeking it for themselves the actual murder itself dropped into comparative insignificance indeed the details of the crime were meagre in the extreme though the evidence of previous jealousy on the husband's part even to the point of grievous hurt was copious nor did the family of the murdered woman's late husband hesitate to accuse her blood relations of a deliberate attempt to seduce her from the path of virtue in order to bring about a poisoning of the bold faizullah and a subsequent transference of her affection and her jewels to a more suitable husband inquiry indeed opened up such a vista of conflicting rascality that the district officer was fain to draw a decent veil over it by accepting the result namely that on a certain specified night between certain specified hours faizullah khan not content with having beaten his wife to the verge of death during the day had stealthily completed his devilish work dragged the corpse of his victim a mile or two from the village stripped it of ornament and left it to be devoured by jackals and hyenas in support of which statements gruesome remains found it was said some days after the woman's disappearance were produced and sworn to vociferously by all relics of this sort are apt to be somewhat indefinite this objection however was met by the subsequent discovery of portions of haiyat bibi's clothing and a golden ear ring which the murderer had evidently dropped in his flight the latter whetted the desire for revenge to a point for as the district officer sorrowfully admitted to himself the old fashioned wrath at injury to their women so conspicuous among these border clans was now freely intermixed with that greed of gold which civilisation brings in its wake finally since nothing else could be done a reward of two thousand rupees was put upon the capture of one faizullah khan belooch of birokzai accused of murdering his wife and stealing her jewels value twelve hundred rupees in addition vague promises were made that on the next punitive expedition into the mountains an eye would be kept on the escaped criminal's particular village and some indemnity exacted there the matter rested peacefully and so on the whole did the village though the friction between the blood relations of the murdered woman and her connections by marriage remained a fruitful source of petty disturbance there is something odd about that case remarked a new magistrate when some fresh complaint of quarrel came in for settlement it is always more satisfactory to have a real whole body but when there is neither corpse nor criminal it is useless depending on facts at all the police officer however declared that having personally conducted the inquiry no mistake in either facts or conclusions was possible eighteen months passed by and early spring was melting the snows on that great rampart of hills which properly guarded would make the rich plains of india impregnable to a western foe the border land was astir its officials busy for the long talked of punitive expedition was about to thread its way through the peaks and passes bearing the rod which teaches respect and perhaps fidelity on the outermost skirts of british territory the district officer sat in front of his tent writing a rose coloured report on the progress of education it was long overdue owing to the pressure of martial preparations so he was in a hurry and superlatives came fast a belooch from beyond the border is seeking the presence with insistence pleaded a deferential myrmidon let him come was the prompt reply and the pen laid aside rolled over blotting the last sentence what matter reports have various values and the belooch might bring information that would make force more forcible an old soldier by the look of him tall and well set up with merry brown eyes and a determined face he brought himself to the salute gravely may the life of the presence be prolonged and may his gracious ears bear with a question is it true that the armies of the lord of the universe march against the village of one faizullah of birokzai the armies of the kaiser i hind march against all thieves and murderers no matter who they are the words of the presence are just altogether yet may the protector of the poor bear with this dust like one is it true that he who brings faizullah captive will receive two thousand rupees reward it is true wah illah the purse of the great queen is big if the long tongue of the presence wags in it so freely the sum is great the crime is great he murdered his wife besides he stole twelve hundred rupees' worth of jewels the smile of contempt which had crept into the listener's face at the first part of the sentence gave place to a frown at the sequel the presence says it shall it not be true he remarked with deference after a pause nevertheless the sum exceeds the purchase does not the price of the calf buy the cow also there is no wisdom in a bad bargain the deputy commissioner looked at the new comer sharply doubtless yet none have given the man up though all know we will keep our threat of burning the village next month the sudden clenching of the slender nervous hands and quick inflation of the nostrils convinced the englishman that there was an envoy prepared with concessions but asking for some in return the presence hath said it shall it not be true came the urbane reply yet we beloochees do not give up our friends readily still faizullah is no friend of mine so for twelve hundred rupees i will bring him to the presence dead or alive if his honour pleases the deputy commissioner stared but the reward is two thousand why do you ask less the price of the calf is the price of the cow huzoor i lack but one thing and the sum is enough for the purchase am i a pig of baniah to fill my stomach with rupees i cannot digest nevertheless the task is hard and those who go near violence may suffer violence what good then would the money be to me if i were dead like many of his race he had a curiously round mellow voice that seemed to linger over the slow stately periods as he went on deliberately surely god will reward the presence for his patience but a man's son is as himself and i have a son huzoor a babe in his mother's arms may the lord bring him safe to man's estate if the great purveyor of justice would cause a writing to be made setting forth that my son is as myself and my earnings as his earnings nay surely the presence will have the best bliss of paradise reserved for it specially and if the munificent keeper of the purse of kings would cause the twelve hundred rupees to be set apart from this day in the hands of some notable banker not that this slave doubts but the presence knows the guile of all women and that all men are born of women and therefore guileful it knows also that without the hope of money naught but the stars in heaven will move and if i say 'lo i will give when i have it' who will listen but if i say 'lo there it is safe do my bidding and take it' 'tis a different matter if therefore the presence will do this his slave will bring faizullah belooch of birokzai to him alive or dead and there will be no need to burn the village and the jewels once more the frown came quick if i bring faizullah to the halls of justice alive surely the mightiness of the presence will make him speak if i bring him dead can this slave follow him and find speech in the silence of the grave say is it a bargain yes or no the anxious brevity of the last question showed the sincerity of the man more than all his measured words and after some further parley the conditions were arranged that is to say the sum of twelve hundred rupees was forthwith to be paid into the hands of a responsible third party and the informer was to bring faizullah to the deputy commissioner dead or alive before reprisals had been taken on the village when even if he lost his life in the capture the reward was to be paid to his heirs and assigns he positively refused to give either name or designation asserting with the measure of sound common sense which characterised all his utterances firstly that no one would know if he gave a false one secondly that if he failed to keep his promise he would prefer to remain in oblivion thirdly that if he did succeed in bringing faizullah to book the presence would be sure to recognise his servant and slave thus he departed as he came a nameless stranger three days after an excited crowd rode pell mell into the magistrate's compound huzoor we have found him we have found him rose a dozen voices as the more influential men of the party crushed into the office room who faizullah the belooch faizullah the murderer the reward is ours praise be to god and to your honour's opulence wah the glad day wah the great day salaam alaikoum friend of the poor man came an urbane voice from their midst the dust like slave of the presence hath kept his word behold i bring to you faizullah khan belooch of birokzai alive not dead a sudden hush fell on the jostling crew as the prisoner raised his fettered hands in grave obeisance and then solemnly vigorously spat to right and left ere he began snakes gorged to impotence by their own greed bullocks with but one set of eyes to seven stomachs listen whilst i recount the tale of your infamies to the ear of this wise judge huzoor i am faizullah husband of the virtuous haiyat mother of my son dwelling content in the house of my father yea it is true for her jewels' sake her father in law bound me by promises when he found me caught in the meshes so for her sake i stayed in a strange land and the fields and the jewels were as his then the old man yonder her uncle wroth at the marriage set his son to beguile her so i beat her till she had no heart to be beguiled for all that they would not cease from evil ways therefore said i to her father in law 'let me go for surely if i stay thy daughter in law will have to die some day and then her blood kin will claim all let me go in peace with the core of my heart but keep thou the jewels for i have no need of them' so in the night he consenting i crept away with her in my arms for she had eaten her full of the bamboo that day and could not walk the presence knows what came next how they called me murderer and thief her blood kin claiming the land her father in law denying that he had the jewels and i nursing her to health in the mountains huzoor the sahib logues are like eagles they look at the sun of justice and see not the maggots it breeds in carrion like these men yet what cared i away in the hills what men called me here save that my house wept for her jewels and i knew not how to get them for the reward was heavy and oaths are cheap in your land then came word that the armies of the lord of the universe were to march on this slave's village and i said 'what is life to me i will try and speak them fair' the presence knows what came next when the paper concerning the twelve hundred rupees had been writ i knew that my house would have her rights anyhow even if the eyes of the just judge were blinded by false oaths or that i came dead into the presence so i said by message to the carrion 'dispute no longer among yourselves let me buy the jewels at the price ye have put on them let one take the money and the other the land or half and half only give me the jewels and say in the court of justice lo we were mistaken faizullah hath not killed his wife he nursed her back to life and she hath a right to the jewels and her son after her but the land is ours by agreement' and to this they said 'yea' guilefully but when i went to the village trusting them not at all they seized me and brought me hither for the reward not knowing that the presence had deigned to cast his gracious eye on this poor man before and that the reward was for me or my son it is spoken let the presence decide nothing is more surprising than the rapidity with which a got up case breaks down when once the judge is seen to have an inkling of the truth suave qui peut is then the motto especially when nothing more is to be gained from consistency haiyat's relations professed themselves both astonished and overjoyed at her return to life and before the inquiry was over had arranged for the discovery of the jewels which were found carefully hidden away in the house of haiyat bibi's female attendant who had died of cholera the year before an ingenious incident productive of injured innocence to all the living it has not emptied the purse of the great queen after all said faizullah with a broad smile as he stood beside the deputy commissioner on the crest of a hill and pointed to a terraced village on the opposite side of the valley nor hath the house of the poor suffered for the dwelling of this slave will not burn the jewels were in a bundle under his arm and he was taking leave of the expedition he had accompanied so far he turned to go then suddenly saluted in military fashion if this dust like one might give freedom to his tongue for a space the wisdom of experience might reach the ear of those above it yea of a surety the patience of the presence is beyond praise huzoor if the reward writ in the police stations had been for me alive or dead peace would have been beyond my fate for the great mind of the protector of the poor will perceive that a man hath no power against false oaths when once his own tongue is stilled by death and that even the justice of kings avails little when the case has been decided already let this memory remain with the sahibs 'peace bringeth plenty and plenty bringeth power' so it comes that false oaths are easy under the rule of the presence that was his farewell the snow still lay low but the orchards were ablaze with blossom as next morning the little force led by white faces straggled peacefully along the cobbled ledges of the steep village lane on either side strips of garden ground where the heart shaped leaves of the sweet yam pushed from the brown soil led up to the low houses backed by peach and almond trees and festooned by withered gourds on the steps leading to a high perched dwelling overhanging the lane stood faizullah khan with a sturdy youngster in his arms the deputy commissioner happening to come last and alone stopped to look at the child with kindly eyes as he did so a door above was set ajar and through the chink he caught a glimpse of a singularly beautiful pair of black eyes and a flash of jewels it is my house huzoor said faizullah with rather a sheepish grin i gave her leave to peep this time the footstep of death godliness is great riches if a man be content with what he hath these words invariably carry me back in the spirit to a certain avenue of shesham trees i knew in india an avenue six miles long leading through barren sandy levels to the river which divided civilisation from the frontier wilds an avenue like the aisle of a great cathedral with tall straight trunks for columns and ribbed branches sweeping up into a vaulted roof set with starry glints of sunshine among the green fret work of the leaves many a time as i walked my horse over its chequered pavement of shade and shine i have looked out sideways on the yellow glare of noon beyond in grateful remembrance of the man who heaven knows when planted this refuge for unborn generations of travellers not a bad monument to leave behind one among forgetful humanity the avenue itself for all its contenting shade had nothing to do with the text which brings it to memory that co ordination being due to an old fakeer who sat at the river end where without even a warning brake the aisle ended in a dazzling glare of sand bank this sudden change no doubt accounted for the fact that on emerging from the shade i always seemed to see a faint half hearted mirage of the still unseen river beyond an elusive mirage distinct in the first surprise of its discovery vanishing when the attention sought for it altogether a disturbing phenomenon refusing to be verified for the only man who could have spoken positively on the subject was the old fakeer and he was stone blind his face gave evidence of the cause in the curious puffiness and want of expression which confluent small pox often leaves behind it in this case it had played a sorrier jest with the human face divine than usual by placing a fat bloated mask wearing a perpetual smirk of content on the top of a mere anatomy of a body the result was odd for the rest a very ordinary fakeer cleaner than most by reason of the reed broom at his side which proclaimed him a member of the sweeper or lowest caste in other words one of those who at least gain from their degradation the possibility of living cleanly without the aid of others there are many striking points about our indian empire none perhaps more so and yet less considered than the disabilities which caste brings in its train the impossibility for instance of having your floor swept unless providence provides a man made on purpose my fakeer however was of those to whom cleanliness and not godliness is the reason of existence that was why his appeal for alms while it took a religious turn as was necessary displayed also a truly catholic toleration it consisted of a single monotonous cry in the name of your own saint or as it might be translated in the name of your own god it thrilled me oddly every time i heard it by its contented acquiescence in the fact that the scavenger's god was not a name wherewith to conjure charity what then the passer by could give in the name of his particular deity and let the minor prophets go the plan seemed successful for the wooden bowl placed within the clean swept ring bordered by its edging of dust or mud wherein he sat winter and summer was never empty and his cry if monotonous was cheerful not ten yards from his station beneath the last tree the road ended in a deep cutting through which a low level bed of water flowed to irrigate a basin of alluvial land to the south but a track made passable for carts by tiger grass laid athwart the yielding sand skirted the cut to reach a ford higher up a stiff bit for the straining bullocks so all save the drivers took the short cut by the plank serving as a footbridge it served also as a warning to the blind fakeer without which many a possible contributor to the bowl might have passed unheard and unsolicited over the soft sand as it was the first creak of the plank provoked his cry it was not however till i had passed the old man many times in my frequent journeyings across the river that i noticed two peculiarities in his method he never begged of me or any other european who chanced that way nor of those coming from the city to the river the latter might be partly set down to the fact that from his position he could not hear their footsteps on the bridge till after they had passed but the former seemed unaccountable and one day when the red funnelled steam ferry boat which set its surroundings so utterly at defiance was late i questioned him on the subject you lose custom surely by seeking the shade i began if you were at the other side of the cut you would catch those who come from the city they are the richest as he turned his closed eyes towards me with a grave obeisance which did not match the jaunty content of his mask he looked sitting in the centre of his swept circle ludicrously like one of those penwipers young ladies make for charity bazaars the presence mistakes he replied those who come from the town have empty wallets 'tis those who come from the wilderness who give but you never beg of me whether i go or come why is that i take no money huzoor it is of no use to me the sahibs carry no food with them not even tobacco only cheroots the evident regret in the latter half of his sentence amused me 'tis you who mistake fakeer ji i replied taking out my pouch i am of those who smoke pipes and now tell me why you refuse money most of your kind are not so self denying that is easy to explain some cannot eat what is given with me it is the other way as my lord knows we dust like ones eat most things your god has made but we cannot eat money perhaps because he did not make it so the padres say ah you are learned but you can always buy begging is easier see my bowl is full and the munificent offering of the presence is enough for two pipes what more do i want viewed from his standpoint the question was a hard one to answer the sun warmed him the leaves sheltered him the passers by nourished him all apparently to his utmost satisfaction i felt instinctively that the state of his mind was the only refuge for the upholders of civilisation and a high standard of comfort so i asked him what he thought about all day long his reply brought total eclipse to all my lights huzoor he said gravely i meditate on the beauty of holiness it was then that the text already quoted became indissolubly mixed up with the spreading shesham branches the glare beyond and that life sized penwiper in the foreground i whistled the refrain of a music hall song and pretended to light my pipe how long have you been here i asked after a time during which he sat still as a graven image with his closed eyes towards the uncertain mirage of the river 'tis nigh on thirty years my lord since i have been waiting waiting for what for the footstep of death hark he paused suddenly and a tremor came to his closed eyelids as he gave the cry in the name of your god the next instant a faint creak told me that the first passenger from the newly arrived ferry boat had set foot on the bridge you have quick ears fakeer ji i remarked i live on footsteps my lord and when the footstep of death comes you will die of one i presume he turned his face towards me quickly it gave me quite a shock to find a pair of clear light brown eyes looking at or rather beyond me from his constantly closed lids i had imagined that as is so often the case in small pox the organs of sight were hopelessly diseased or altogether destroyed indeed i had been grateful for the concealment of a defect out of which many beggars would have made capital but these eyes were apparently as perfect as my own and extraordinarily clear and bright so clear that it seemed to me as if they did not even hold a shadow of the world around them the surprise made me forget my first question in another huzoor he replied i am quite blind the light came from the sky one day and removed the light i had before it was a bad thunder storm huzoor at least being the last this slave saw he deems it bad but it is time the great judge took his exalted presence to yonder snorting demon of a boat for it is ill mannered waiting for none god knows wherefore it should hurry so the river remains always and sooner or later the screeching thing sticks on a sand bank true enough i replied laughing well salaam fakeer ji salaam shelter of the world may the god of gods elevate your honour to the post of lieutenant governor without delay after this i often stopped to say a few words to the old man and give him a pipeful of tobacco for the ferry boat fulfilled his prophecy of its future to a nicety by acquiring intimate acquaintance with every shallow in the river a habit fatal to punctuality it was an odd sight lying out so trim and smart in the wastes of sand and water red funnels standing up from among beloochees and their camels bullocks scarred by the plough zenana women huddled in helpless white heaps wild frontiersmen squatted on the saddle bags with which a sham orientalism has filled our london drawing rooms here and there a dejected half caste or a specimen of young india brimful of the spectator over all on the bridge captain ram baksh struggling with a double nature represented on the one side by his nautical pea coat on the other by his baggy native trousers ease her stop her hard astern full speed ahead all the shibboleths even to the monotonous ba la mar do by the mark two of the leadsman forr'ards then suddenly overboard goes science and with it a score of lascars and passengers who knee deep in the ruddy stream set their backs lazily against the side and the steam ferry boat pioneer built at barrow in furness with all the latest improvements sidles off her sand bank in the good old legitimate way sanctioned by centuries of river usage to return however to fakeer ji i found him as full of trite piety as a copy book and yet for all that the fragments of his history with which he interlarded these common places seemed to me well worth consideration imagine a man born of a long line of those who have swept the way for princes who have as it were prepared god's earth for over refined footsteps that briefly had been fakeer ji's inheritance before he began to wait for the footstep of death whatever it may do to the imagination of others the position appealed to mine strongly the more so because while speaking freely enough about the family of decayed kings to whom he and his forebears had belonged and of the ruined palace they still possessed in the oldest part of the city he was singularly reticent as to the cause which had turned him into a religious beggar for the rest he waited in godliness and contentment or so he assured me for the footstep of death the phrase grew to be quite a catch word between us not come yet fakeer ji i would call as i trotted past after a few days' absence huzoor i am still waiting it will come some time one night in the rains word came from a contractor over the water that a new canal dam of mine showed signs of giving and anxious to be on the spot i set off at once to catch the midnight ferryboat i shall not soon forget that ride through the shesham aisle the floods were out and for the best part of the way a level sheet of water gleaming in the moonlight lay close up to the embankment of the avenue which seemed more than ever like a dim colonnade leading to an unseen holy of holies not a breath of wind not a sound save the rustle of birds in the branches overhead and suddenly causelessly a snatch of song hushed in its first notes as if the singer found it too light for sleep too dark for song the beat of my horse's feet seemed to keep time with the stars twinkling through the leaves i was met at the road's end by the unwelcome news that at least two hours must elapse ere the pioneer could be got off a newly invented mudbank which the river had maliciously placed in a totally unexpected place still more unwelcome was the discovery that in my hurry i had left my tobacco pouch behind me nothing could be done save to send my groom back with the pony and instructions for immediate return with the forgotten luxury after which i strolled over towards my friend the fakeer who sat ghostlike in the moonlight with his bowl full to the brim in front of him that snorting devil behaves worse every day he said fervently but if the shelter of the poor will tarry a twinkling i will sweep him a spot suitable for his exalted presence blind as he was his dexterous broom had traced another circle of cleanliness in a trice a new reed mat no bigger than a handkerchief was placed in the centre and i was being invited to ornament just such another penwiper as the fakeer occupied himself mercy he continued as i took my seat shifting the mat so as to be able to lean my back against the tree blesses both him who gives and those who take even shakespeare it will be observed yields at times to platitude for see he added solemnly producing something from a hollow in the root the presence's own tobacco returns to the presence's pipe sure enough it was genuine golden cloud and the relief overpowered me there i was after a space half lying half sitting in the clean warm sand my hands clasped at the back of my head as i looked up into the shimmering light and shade of the leaves upon my soul i envy you fakeer ji we who go to bed at set times and seasons don't know the world we live in religion is its own reward remarked the graven image beside me for he had gone back to his penwiper by this time but i was talking more to myself than to him in the half drowsy excitement of physical pleasure so i went on unheeding was there ever such a night since the one jessica looked upon and what a scent there is in the air orange blossoms or something it is a tree farther up the water cut huzoor a hill tree the river may have brought the seed it happens so sometimes or the birds may have brought it from the city there was a tree of the kind in a garden there a big tree with large white flowers so large that you can hear them fall the graven image sat so still with its face to the river that it seemed to me as if the voice i heard could not belong to it a dreamy sense of unreality added to my drowsy enjoyment of the surroundings magnolia i murmured sleepily a flower to dream about hullo what's that a faint footfall as of some one passing down an echoing passage loud louder loudest making me start up wide awake as the fakeer's cry rose on the still air in the name of your god some one was passing the bridge from the river and after adding his mite to the bowl went on his way it is the echo huzoor explained the old man answering my start of surprise the tree behind us is hollow and the cut is deep besides to night the water runs deep and dark as death because of the flood the step is always louder then no wonder you hear so quickly i replied sinking back again to my comfort i thought it must be the footstep of death at least he had turned towards me and in the moonlight i could see those clear eyes of his shining as if the light had come into them again not yet huzoor but it may be the next one for all we know what a gruesome idea hark there it was again loud louder loudest and then silence that came from the city huzoor it comes and goes often for the law courts have it in grip perhaps that is worse than death then you recognise footsteps surely no two men walk the same a footstep is as a face sometimes after long years it comes back and then you know it has passed before do they generally come back those from the city go back sooner or later unless death takes them those from the wilderness do not always return the city holds them fast in the palace or in the gutter again the voice seemed to me not to belong to the still figure beside me it makes a devilish noise i admit i said half to myself but perhaps if the huzoor listened for death as i do he might keep awake or perhaps if my lord pleases i might tell him a story of footsteps to drive the idle dreams from his brain till the hour of that snorting demon comes in due time go ahead said i briefly as i looked up at the stars so he began it's a small story huzoor a tale of footsteps from beginning to end for i am blind yet life was not always listening they used to say that cheytu had the longest sight the longest legs and the longest wind of any boy of his age i was cheytu he paused and i watched a dancing shadow of a leaf till he went on the little princess said cheytu had the longest tongue too for i used to sit in the far corner by the pillar beyond her carpet and tell her stories she used to call for cheytu all day long 'cheytu smooth the ground for aimna's feet' 'cheytu sweep the dead flowers from aimna's path' 'cheytu fan the flies from aimna's doll for naturally huzoor cheytu the sweeper did not fan the flies from the little princess herself that was not his work i belonged to her footsteps i was up before dawn sweeping the arcades of the old house ready for them and late at night it was my work to gather the dust of them and the dead flowers she had played with and bury them away in the garden out of sight a dim perception that this was strange talk for a sweeper made me murmur sleepily that was very romantic of you cheytu on the other hand it fitted my environment so admirably that the surprise passed almost as it came she was a real princess the daughter of kings who had been god knows when it is written doubtless somewhere yes a real princess though she could barely walk and the track of her little feet was often broken by handmarks in the dust for naturally huzoor the dust might help her but not i cheytu who swept it for her steps that was my task till the day of the thunderstorm the house seemed dead of the heat not a breath of life anywhere so at sundown they set her to sleep on the topmost roof under the open sky her nurse full of frailty as women are crept down while the child slept to work evil to mankind as women will huzoor it was a bad storm the red clouds had hung over us all day long joining the red dust from below so that it came unawares at last splitting the air and sending a great ladder of light down the roof 'aimna aimna' cried some one i was up first and had her in my arms for see you huzoor it was life or death and the dead belong to us whether they be kings or slaves it was out on the bare steps and she sleeping sound as children sleep that the light came the light of a thousand days in my eyes and on her face it was the last thing i saw huzoor the very last thing cheytu the sweeper ever saw but i could hear i could hear her calling and i knew how her face must be changing by the change in her voice and then one day i found myself sweeping the house against her wedding feast heard her crying amongst her girl friends in the inner room what then girls always cry at their weddings i went with her of course to the new life because i had swept the way for her ever since she could walk and she needed me more than ever in a strange house it was a fine rich house with marble floors and a marble summer house on the roof above her rooms people said she had made a good bargain with her beauty perhaps but that child's face that i saw in the light was worth more than money huzoor she had ceased crying by this time for she had plenty to amuse her singers and players and better story tellers than cheytu the sweeper it was but fair for look you her man had many more wives to amuse him i used to hear the rustle of her long silk garments the tinkle of her ornaments and the cadence of her laughter girls ought to laugh huzoor and it was spring time what we natives call spring when the rain turns dry sand to grass and the roses race the jasmin for the first blossom the tree your honour called magnolia grew in the women's court and some of the branches spread over the marble summerhouse almost hiding it from below others again formed a screen against the blank white wall of the next house the flowers smelt so strong that i wondered how she could bear to sleep amongst them in the summer house even in my place below on the stones of the courtyard they kept me awake people said i had fever but it was not that only the scent of the flowers i lay awake one dark starless night and then i first heard the footstep if it was a footstep loud louder loudest then a silence save for the patter of the falling flowers i heard it often after that and always when it had passed the flowers fell they fell about the summer house too and in the morning i used to sweep them into a heap and fling them over the parapet but one day huzoor they fell close at hand and my groping fingers seeking the cause found a plank placed bridge wise amongst the branches huzoor was there any wonder the flowers fell all crushed and broken that night i listened again and again the footsteps came amid a shower of blossoms what was to be done her women were as women are and the others were jealous already next day when i went to sweep i strewed the fallen flowers thick thick as a carpet round her bed for she had quick wits i knew 'cheytu cheytu' the old call came as i knew it would and thinking of that little child's face in the light i went up to her boldly 'my princess' i said in reply to her question as i bent over the flowers ''tis the footstep makes them fall so thick if it is your pleasure i will bid it cease they may hurt your feet' i knew from her silence she understood suddenly she laughed such a girl's laugh 'flowers are soft to tread upon cheytu go you need sweep for me no more' i laughed too as i went not sweep for her when she only knew god's earth after i had made it ready for her feet it was a woman's idle word but woman like she would think and see wisdom for herself that night i listened once more the footstep must come once i knew just once and after that wisdom and safety huzoor it came and the flowers fell softly but wisdom was too late i tried to get at her to save her from their pitiless justice i heard her cries for mercy i heard her cry even for cheytu the sweeper before they flung me from the steps where the twinkling lights went up and down as if the very stars from the sky had come to spy on her what did they do to her what did they do to her while i lay crushed among the crushed flowers who knows it is often done my lord behind the walls she died that is all i know that is all i cared for when i came back to life she was dead and the footstep had fled from revenge it had friends over the border where it could pause in safety till the tale was forgotten such things are forgotten quickly my lord because the revenge must be secret as the wrong else it is shame and shame must not come nigh good families but the blind do not forget easily perhaps they have less to remember could i forget the child's face in the light as i told the presence those who go from the city come back to it sooner or later unless death takes them first so i wait for the footstep hark loud louder loudest in the name of your own god did i wake with the cry or did i only open my eyes to see a glimmer of dawn paling the sky the birds shifting in the branches the old man seated bolt upright in his penwiper that was the first passenger huzoor he said quietly the boat has come it is time your honour conferred dignity on ill manners by joining it but the footstep the princess you were telling me just now what does a sweeper know of princesses my lord the presence slept and doubtless he dreamed dreams the tobacco he paused well said i curiously huzoor this slave steeps his tobacco in the sleep compeller it gives great contentment i looked down at my pipe it was but half smoked through was this really the explanation but the echo i protested i heard it but now of a truth there is an echo that is not a dream for the rest it is well the time has passed swiftly the huzoor is rested his servant has returned the boat has come all in contentment the shelter of the world can proceed on his journey in peace and return in peace unless the footstep of death overtakes me meanwhile said i but half satisfied huzoor it never overtakes the just death and the righteous look at each other in the face as friends when the footstep comes i will go to meet it and so will you hark the demon screeches peace go with you my lord about a year after this the daily police reports brought me the news that my friend the old fakeer had been found dead in the water cut an unusually heavy flood had undermined the banks and loosened the bridge it must have fallen while the old man was on it for his body was jammed against the plank which had stuck across the channel a little way down the stream he had kept his word and gone to meet the footstep a certain unsatisfied curiosity which had never quite left me since that night in the rains made me accompany the doctor when as in duty bound he went to the dead house to examine the body the smiling mask was unchanged but the eyes were open and looked somehow less empty dead than in the almost terrible clearness of life the right hand was fast clenched over something only a crushed magnolia blossom said the doctor gently unclasping the dead fingers poor beggar it must have been floating in the water there's a tree up the cut i've often smelt it from the road drowning men you know the rest did i the coincidence was to say the least of it curious it became more curious still when three weeks afterwards the unrecognisable body of a man was found half buried in the silt left in the alluvial basin by the subsiding floods a man of more than middle age whose right hand was clenched tight over nothing so the question remains did i dream that night or did the footstep of death bring revenge when it came over the bridge at last i have never been able to decide and the only thing which remains sure is the figure of the old fakeer with blind eyes looking out on the uncertain mirage of the river and waiting in godliness and contentment for what habitual criminals the very mise en scene was indeterminate a straight horizon meeting the blue sky evenly though not an inch of level ground lay far or near in the pathless waste of yellow sand pathless yet full of tracks looking down at your feet which breaking through the rippling crust of wind waves on the surface sank softly into the warm shifting sand beneath you could see the tracks crossing and re crossing each other tracing a network over the world each distinct self reliant self contained yet such tiny tracks for the most part that firm zigzag regular as a gothic moulding is printed by a partridge's foot yonder fine graving is the track of a jerboa rat and there side by side for a space the striated lines of a big beetle and the endless curvings of a snake a certain wistful admiration comes to the seeing eye with the thought that here in the wilderness life is free to go and come as it chooses untrammelled by the fetters of custom free from the necessity for doing as your neighbours do being as your neighbours are something of this was in my thoughts one day when as i rode at a foot's pace across the sand sea to my tents i suddenly came upon a boy he must have been ten years old at least by his size any age judging by his face stark naked save for a string and a scrap of cloth his head would have been an admirable advertisement to any hair restorer for it was thick and curly in patches bald as a coot's in others briefly like a well kept poodle's for the rest he was of unusually dark complexion he was sitting listless yet alert beside some small holes in the sand and when he saw me he smiled broadly showing a great gleam of white teeth i asked him cheerfully who he was and he replied in the same tone huzoor main bowriah hone i am a bowriah it gave me a chill somehow so the lad was a bowriah in other words one of that criminal class which western discipline keeps in walled villages registered and roll called by day and by night not much freedom there to strike out a line of life for yourself unless you began before the time when you were solemnly set down in black and write as an adult bad character the boy however seemed to have no misgivings for he smiled still more broadly when i asked him what he was doing catching lizards huzoor they are fat at this time my chill changed its cause incontinently you don't mean to say you eat lizards he looked at me more gravely wherefore not huzoor the bowriahs eat everything except cats cats are heating to the blood especially in spring time his air of well defined wisdom tickled me perhaps it touched me also for ere riding off i asked him his name thinking i might inquire more of him for the sole reason of my tents being a few miles farther in this sandy wilderness was the due inspection of a bowriah village which had been planted there out of harm's way by the authorities mungal huzoor he replied so i left him watching for the fat lizards and cantered on over the desert suddenly i drew rein with a jerk there he was again in front of me sitting before another group of holes hullo i cried how on earth did you manage to get here mungal the boy smiled his broad white smile the huzoor mistakes i am bungal mungal is my brother over yonder he stretched a thin dark arm into the desert whence i had come mungal and bungal twins of course even so the likeness was almost incredible my memory could find no dissimilarity of any sort or kind no outward dissimilarity at any rate the thought suggested an experiment and i asked him what he was huzoor main bowriah hone came instantly and what are you doing i continued catching lizards huzoor they are fat at this time positively my chill returned making me say quite naturally what do you eat lizards wherefore not huzoor the bowriahs eat everything except cats cats are heating to the blood especially in spring time identical so far the quaintness of the idea prevented me from disturbing it by further inquiry so i rode on dimly expectant of finding a third habitual criminal say jungal this time watching for fat lizards at other holes but i did not they were twins only mungal and bungal out of sheer curiosity i sent for them that evening when i had finished my work of inspecting the adult males and females listening to their complaints and generally setting the odd little village on the path of virtue for the next three months by no means a disagreeable occupation for the bowriahs have always a broad smile for a sportsman indeed several of the most suspicious characters had promised me the best of shikar on the morrow and what is more they kept their promise faithfully as for mungal and bungal even when seen together it was absolutely impossible for me to detect any difference of any kind between the two boys even their heads were shaven in the same tufts and as they invariably repeated each other there was no differentiating them by their words only their works remained as a means of knowledge and with a view to this i questioned the deputy inspector of police who was out with me as to the lads huzoor he said they are of the bowriah race their father and mother are dead but in life these were bowriahs also the boys however not being adult are not as yet on the register but they will be for the rest they are as bowriahs they eat jackals wolves and such unclean things i felt myself on the point of adding but not cats cats etc however i stopped myself in time and asked instead if the boys stole or lied or the deputy inspector interrupted me respectfully yet firmly huzoor not being adult they are not on the register therefore the police have no cognizance of them as yet then why do they make for the village now they hear the roll beginning i persisted somewhat testily as i saw mungal and bungal racing along to the gateway in company with a number of boys about their own age they do it to please themselves it gives them dignity besides in youth one learns habits easily thus it is better since the boys will surely be on the register if god spares them to adult age i looked at the man sharply there was positively not one atom of expression of any kind whatever on his face it is a great art on the morrow mungal and bungal turned up again as part of the shooting excursion for even among their tribe of hunters they had already made themselves a sporting reputation perhaps because being orphans they lived chiefly on their wits it certainly was remarkable to see them on a trail turning and twisting and doubling on traces invisible to my eyes or sometimes like a couple of bassett hound puppies on all fours nose down creeping round some higher undulation to see what lay behind it we had stalked a ravine deer which another party of bowriahs had stealthily driven all unconsciously into a suitable spot and i was just crawling on my stomach to the shelter of a low bush whence i intended to fire when a small dark hand clutched mine from behind and another pointed to something within an inch of where i had been about to place my fingers by everything unpleasant a viper coiled in a true lover's knot t tss ss came a sibilant whisper checking my start the buck is there huzoor the buck is there still and he remained there for my bullet went clean through his heart it was after the excitement of success was over that i turned to the boys and somewhat thoughtlessly held out a rupee which of you two pointed out that jelaibee i asked huzoor i did came both voices simultaneously at first they refused to budge from this simple statement reserving the remainder of their vocabulary for indignant abuse of each other nor could i from their expression or tone glean the slightest corroborative evidence for or against the truth of either the greed in their beady black eyes their scorn at the dastardly attempt at cheating them out of their due were identical finally to my intense bewilderment they suddenly without even a wink that i could see made a demi volte towards a new position and declared in one breath that they both did it and therefore that they both deserved a rupee certainly there had been two hands the one to clutch the other to point but i felt morally certain that they had belonged to one body however to settle the matter i gave each of the boys eight annas and went back to my tents convinced that either mungal or bungal was a liar the question was which that evening when i was awaiting the appearance of my dinner with the comfortable sense of a good appetite i heard trouble in the cook room tent it was followed by the violent irruption into mine of the whole posse of servants gathered round my old khansaman who breathless but triumphant held mungal and bungal each by one ear it was the esh starffit quails huzoor that i had prepared for the protector of the poor two for his honour seeing that he loves the dish and one for barker sahib should god send a guest so that the dignity of the table be upheld even in the wilderness and lo as i sat decorating the dish my mind occupied in desires to please i saw him the infamous bowriah boy make off with one aged as i am i fled after him then remembering boys' ways ran back round the tent in time to see him from fear replacing it finally with hue and cry we caught both escaping into the darkness of the desert both of them i echoed but you said there was only one the huzoor mistakes retorted the khansaman quite huffily perchance there was one who stole and one who gave back this slave had no time for trivial observation these being undoubtedly the thieves he emphasised his words by dragging mungal and bungal forward by the ears and knocking their heads together his following meanwhile testifying its assent by undertoned remarks that being bowriahs the boys were necessarily thieves and that in addition it was superfluous if not impious to draw invidious distinctions where it had pleased providence to make none but my curiosity had been aroused mungal and bungal i said solemnly addressing the culprits who with hands folded in front of them like infant samuels stood cheerfully stolid just as the adult members of their tribe invariably did when brought before me as habitual criminals do you by chance know what telling the truth means as they assured me fervently that they did i went on to explain that my only desire in this case was to have the truth that no one should suffer by it that contrariwise the tellers should receive bucksheesh here their beady eyes wandered in confident familiarity to the rotund person of the deputy inspector who had rushed to the scene in mufti on hearing of the crime and i knew instinctively that they were discounting my words by inherited experience of similar promises so it was with a prescience of what would follow that i put the least formidable question which of you replaced the quail the answer came double barrelled unhesitating i did huzoor let me give the boys five stripes each with the bamboo huzoor suggested the deputy inspector with a stifled yawn when i had wasted much time and more unction it is good for boys at all times and these are but boys as yet it would have been the wisest plan but i could not make up my mind to it so i went to bed that night certain of but one thing either mungal or bungal was a thief the question was which it kept me awake until i made up my mind that somehow by hook or by crook i would find out twenty four hours was after all too short a time for a character study but i was to be on tour for six weeks at least and if i took the boys with me i should have ample opportunity of settling the question besides they would be invaluable as trackers they proved themselves useful in many ways and even the old khansaman grudgingly admitted their skill in the capture of chickens the spectacle of a half plucked fowl defying all the resources of the camp became a thing of the past for mungal or bungal had it fast by the leg in a trice sobhan ullah power of the lord the old man would say piously but there they were made for such work from the beginning we all have our uses my first desire was naturally to distinguish mungal from bungal the camp it is true had no such ambition it was content to speak of them as yeh or dusra this or the other to which they answered alternately thinking to effect my purpose i gave one a necklace of blue the other a necklace of red beads but they were evidently suspicious of some plot for i caught them exchanging decorations several times evidently no reliance was to be placed on beads so i had a brass bangle riveted on the arm of one and an iron bangle on the arm of the other that succeeded for a week at least so i thought till i discovered that they had utilised my english files to cut through the metal so that they could slip their flexible hands in and out quite easily then i became annoyed and pierced the ears of one boy next day the other had his pierced also so i got the two alone by themselves and asked them why they objected to the manifest convenience of individuality it took me some time to worm the idea out of their small brains but when i did it touched me briefly no one had ever made a difference between them before not even the mysterious creator and in the village no one had cared personally they never thought if mungal was really mungal or bungal it was a joint stock company doing business under the name of mungal bungal as they said this they stood as usual when before me in the attitude of the praying samuel but i noticed their shoulders seemed glued to each other and that the whole balance of their lithe brown bodies was towards each other in truth the tie between them was strong indeed by day they and my big dog hunted together and by night the trio slept in each other's arms like puppies of one litter when they pilfered they pilfered in pairs and when they lied they lied in pairs still through it all the idea clung to me that perhaps only one lied and stole but punishment of some sort being imperative i gave in to the impartial bamboo for which to say sooth neither of them seemed to care very much in fact the experiment appeared so successful the boys so happy that the demon of self complacency entered into me on my return to headquarters and i determined to send mungal and bungal to school and so differentiate them by their intellects it was a disastrous experiment both to the clothes in which i had to dress them and to the peace of the compound but it proved one thing that neither mungal nor bungal had any aptitude for learning the alphabet then as the recognised way of reclaiming the predatory tribes is to make them tillers of the soil i set my boys to work weeding in the garden it was a large garden full of blossoming shrubs and shady fruiting trees where the squirrels loved to chatter the birds to sing and i to watch them both within a fortnight neither fur nor feather was to be seen anywhere on the other hand mungal bungal and co had killed five cobras two iguanas and some dozens of cockroaches rats and mice all of which they had eaten it was when failing other game a pet parrot of the khansaman's house disappeared that i solemnly thrashed both boys myself after giving them a moral lecture on cruelty to animals the next morning the bird's cage contained a new and most highly educated parrot which must have been stolen from some one and when i went out into the verandah i found a whole family of young squirrels and two bul buls with their wings cut dotted about the flower stands one of the culprits was evidently bent on restitution and amendment perhaps both that was the worst of it one never could tell for in speech they both clung to virtue and disclaimed vice my commissioner's wife who lived next door and was a very philanthropic woman told me she thought they needed female influence to soften and subdue their wild nature so they used to be sent over to her twice a week she found them quite affable until the khitmutghar accused one of them of sampling the lunch which had been set down on the verandah steps on its way to the cook room then instead of beating them she locked them up without food for twenty four hours and begged me to continue the like discipline whenever the offence was repeated hunger she said had a gentle and humanising influence on all wild animals who might thus be brought to eat from the hand of authority so it seemed for one night the lady's pet persian kitten disappeared mysteriously from her room i tried to persuade myself it could not be the boys because cat is heating to the blood etc etc but i knew they had been hungry and that game was scarce in both gardens and sure enough the police in searching their hut found some gnawed bones poor pussy's white skin neatly stretched on a board to dry and of course both the boys they always were found together this time they attempted excuse the one for the other mungal or bungal had been hungry must have been hungry or he would not have eaten cat seeing that cat etc etc so they were sentenced judicially to so many stripes apiece and i resolved on sending them back to the walled village as incurable it is a good word indeed said the old khansaman pompously thus the huzoor's compound will be free from all kinds of vermin for as i live the boy hath killed a snake in his honour's henhouse every night save the last and that methinks is because there are no more to kill the boy which boy i asked suddenly curious then it came out that every one in the place knew that either yeh or dusra had been locked up in the hen house from dusk till dawn every night for a week or more because some vermin was carrying off the chickens locked up from daylight to daylight without a possibility of caticide the fact revived all my old curiosity all my old determination to differentiate these boys i shall not easily forget the deputy inspector's face of incredulous horror when i told him that mungal bungal was to remain for another trial even the commissioner's wife told me she thought it conceited on my part seeing that female influence had failed so signally and as a matter of fact i gained nothing in the end by my perseverance the nights were growing warm so i slept with the doors open secure however so i deemed from fear of any kind by reason of the mastiff which was chained in the verandah a most ferocious beast to all save his friends they were moonless nights too dark as pitch in the central room where i slept in order to enjoy the full current of air hopelessly dark for the eyes as i woke one night to the touch of a small flexible hand on mine hullo who are you i cried in the half drowsy alertness which comes with a sudden decisive awakening huzoor main bowriah hone i seem to hear the answer as i write confident contented cheerful and then my attention shifted absolutely to a streak of light glimmering under the closed door of my office thieves thieves in the house i was among them in an instant getting a glimpse of dark figures at my cash box before the light was put out one oily body slipped from my hold another fled past me but my shouts had roused the sleeping servants and as the cressets came flickering up like stars from the huts i heard the well known cry bowriah logue bowriah logue and then of course in the centre of the posse of indignant retainers i saw mungal bungal led by the ears caught in the very act of running away in the rear of those adult members of their tribe whose accomplices they had been for the mastiff was dead brutally skilfully strangled by some fiend of a friend whom the poor dog had trusted to slip a noose round its neck one of those two of course who else could it have been but then that small warning hand on mine that answer i knew so well huzoor main bowriah hone great god what a tragedy lay in these words i was too sick at heart to question those infant samuels again i knew the double barrelled denial too well however as i had been roused in time to prevent actual theft i managed to hush the matter up by promising the deputy inspector to send the boys back to their village without further delay there to await due registration as adult male members of a predatory tribe and thus gain the privilege of being within the cognizance of the police i think my decision gave satisfaction to every one concerned except myself for as i watched mungal bungal go from my gate in charge of the constable who was to conduct it back to the hereditary place in life to which it had apparently pleased god to call the firm i knew that if one half was already a habitual criminal the other half was an embryo saint the question remains which mussumat kirpo's doll they had gathered all the schools into the mission house compound and set them out in companies on the bare ground like seedlings in a bed a perfect garden of girls from five to fifteen arrayed in rainbow hues some of them in their wedding dresses of scarlet most of them bedecked with the family jewelry and even the shabbiest boasting a row or two of tinsel on bodice or veil and down the walks drawn with mathematical accuracy between these hotbeds of learning a few english ladies with eager kindly faces trotting up and down conferring excitedly with portly native christian bible women and pausing occasionally to encourage some young offshoot of the tree of knowledge uncertain either of its own roots or of the soil it grew in by directing its attention to the tables set out with toys which stood under a group of date palms and oranges behind these tables sat in a semicircle more of those eager kindly foreign faces not confined here to one sex but in fair proportion male and female yet bearded like the pard or feminine to a fault all with the same expression the same universal kindly benevolence towards the horticultural exhibition spread out before their eyes at the table pale or flushed with sheer good feeling two or three of the chief mission ladies and between them with a mundane married look about her contrasting strongly with her surroundings the commissioner's wife about to give away the prizes a kindly face also despite its half bewildered look as one after another of the seedlings comes up to receive the reward of merit one after another solemnly for dotted here and there behind the screen of walls and bushes squats many a critical mother determined that her particular plant shall receive its fair share of watering or cease to be part of the harvest necessary for a good report the commissioner's wife has half a dozen children of her own and prides herself on understanding them but these bairns are a race apart she neither comprehends them nor the fluent scholastic hindustani with which her flushed excited countrywomen introduce each claimant to her notice still she smiles and says bohut uchcha very good and nods as if she did in a vague way she is relieved when the books are finished and she begins upon the dolls there is something familiar and cosmopolitan in the gloating desire of the large dark eyes and the possessive clutch of the small hands over the treasure standard i mussumat kirpo reads out the secretary and a tall girl of about fifteen comes forward a sort of annoyed surprise passes among the ladies in quick whispers clearly a japanese baby doll with a large bald head is not the correct thing here but it is so difficult so almost impossible with hundreds of girls who attend school so irregularly and really julia smith might have explained this the lady in question proceeds to do almost tearfully until she is cut short by superior decision well we must give it her now as there isn't anything else for her so dear mrs gordon if you please of course as a rule we always draw the line about dolls when a girl is married sometimes it seems a little hard for they are so small you know still it is best to have a rule all these tiny trifles help to emphasise our views on the child marriage question but if you will be kind enough in this case just to avoid confusion we will rectify the mistake to morrow mussumat kirpo took her doll stolidly a sickly stupid looking girl limping as she walked dully stolidly back to her place ari giggled the women behind the bushes that's all she is likely to get in that way lo they made a bad bargain in brides in gungo's house and no mistake but 'twas ill luck not ill management for they tell me kirpo was straight and sound when she was betrothed may the gods keep my daughters in law healthy and handsome then they forgot the joke in tender delight over more suitable gifts to the others and so the great day passed to its ending i do believe poor kirpo's getting that doll was the only contretemps said the superintendent triumphantly and that dear julia you can easily remedy to morrow so don't fret about it with this intention julia smith went down at the first opportunity to her school in the slums of the city a general air of slackness pervaded the upstairs room where only a row of little mites sat whispering to each other while their mistress full of yawns and stretchings talked over the events of yesterday with her monitor briefly if the miss sahib thought she was going to slave as she had done for the past year for a paltry eight yards of sussi trousering which would not be enough to cut into the fassen why the miss sahib was mistaken and then with the well known footfall on the stairs came smiles and flattery but kirpo was not at school why should she be seeing that she was a paper pupil and the prize giving was over if the miss sahib wanted to see her she had better go round to gungo's house in the heart of the hindu quarter so julia smith set off again to thread her way through the byeways till she reached the mud steps and closed door which belonged to kuniya the head man of the comb makers this ownership had much to do with the english lady's patience in regard to kirpo who to tell truth had been learning the alphabet for five years but the girl's father in law was a man of influence and julia's gentle proselytising eyes cast glances of longing on every house where she had not as yet found entrance hence her reluctance to quarrel definitely with her pupil or rather her pupil's belongings since poor kirpo did not count for much in that bustling hindu household but for the fact that she was useful at the trade and as a general drudge mai gungo would long ago have found some excuse for sending the girl who had so wofully disappointed all expectations back to her people those people who had taken the wedding gifts and given a half crippled half silly bride in exchange unparalleled effrontery and wickedness to be avenged on the only head within reach she wants none of your dolls or your books shrilled mai gungo who was in a bad temper they aren't worth anything and i expected nothing less than a suit of clothes or a new veil at least else would i never have sent her from the comb making to waste her time lo miss sahib here the voice changed to a whine we are poor folk and she costs to feed she who will never do her duty as a wife yet must not kuniya's son remain sonless thus is there the expense of another wife in the future so the complaints went on while kirpo in full hearing sat filing away at the combs without a flicker of expression on her face but when julia had settled the business with eight annas from her private pocket and was once more picking her way through the drain like alley she heard limping steps behind her it was kirpo and the japanese doll the miss sahib has forgotten it she said stolidly julia smith stood in the sunlight utterly unmindful of a turgid stream of concentrated filth which at that moment came sweeping along the gutter her gentle womanly eyes saw something she recognised in the child like yet unchild like face looking into hers would you like to keep it dear she asked gently kirpo nodded her head she needn't know she explained i could keep it in the cow shed and they will sell the book you left for me they would sell this too that is why i brought it back this admixture of cunning rather dashed poor julia's pity but in the end kirpo went back to her work with the japanese doll carefully concealed in her veil and for the next year julia smith never caught sight of it again things went on as if it had not been in that straggling hindu house with its big courtyard and dark slips of rooms perhaps kirpo got up at night to play with it perhaps she never played with it at all but having wrapped it in a napkin and buried it away somewhere was content in its possession like the man with his one talent for this miserliness belongs as a rule to those who have few things not many once or twice when julia smith found the opportunity she would ask after the doll's welfare then kirpo would nod her head mysteriously but this was not often for by degrees julia's visits to the house and kirpo's to the schools became less frequent the former because mai gungo's claims grew intolerable and the mission lady had found firm footing in less rapacious houses the latter because to mai gungo's somewhat grudging relief her daughter in law after nearly four years of married life seemed disposed to save the family from the expense of another bride by presenting it with a child nothing of course could alter the fact of the girl's ugliness and stupidity and lameness still if she did her duty in this one point mai gungo could put up with her especially as she really did very well at the combs she was not worked quite so hard now since that might affect the future promise perhaps this gave kirpo more time to play with the japanese doll perhaps it did not outwardly at any rate life went on in the courtyard as though no such thing existed she may die the crippled ones often do said the gossips scarcely lowering their voices but it will be a great saving mai gungo if the grandson comes without another daughter in law they quarrel so besides it is in god's hands may he preserve both to you mai gungo echoed the wish with the reservation that if the whole wish was impossible the child at least might not suffer kirpo herself understood the position perfectly and felt dimly that if she could do her duty she would be quite content to give up the comb making once and for all it was niggly cramping work to sit with your crippled legs tucked under you filing away at the hard wood all day long while mother in law bustled about scolding away in her shrill voice it had been much greater fun at the school and as for the prize giving days kirpo had four of those red letter glimpses of the world to recollect but she always gave the palm of pleasure to the last when they had laughed at her and the japanese doll perhaps because she remembered it best for as has been said poor kirpo's was not a brilliant intellect so just about the time when the mission house was once more buying large consignments of dolls and books and laying in yards on yards of sussi trousering and manchester veiling against another prize giving the mistress of the little school room up two pair of stairs said to julia smith kirpo had a son last week mai gungo hath given offerings galore and kirpo herself she ails they say but that is likely the hour of danger is over that same afternoon julia smith once more picked her way along the gutters to the mud steps and closed door of kuniya's house kirpo was lying alone on a bed in the shadow of a grass thatch and where is the baby asked julia cheerfully mother in law hath it 'tis a son doubtless the miss hath heard so there was the oddest mixture of pride and regret in the girl's dull face she will let thee have it when thou art stronger said her visitor quickly thou must give me back the dolly kirpo now thou hast a live one of thine own the girl's head shifted uneasily on the hard pillow ay and the prize giving day must be close i have been thinking if the miss sahib will look behind the straw yonder she will find the doll it is not hurt and the miss can give it to some one else i don't want it any more she might give it to a little girl this time she could play with it mai gungo said julia severely as on her way out she found the mother in law surrounded by her gossips exhibiting the baby to them with great pride you must look to kirpo she thrives not and give her the baby she pines after it the miss doth not understand flounced gungo what can kirpo do with a baby she is a fool besides a mother like that hath evil influences till the time of purification hath passed ten days afterwards the mistress of the school told julia that kirpo had the fever and they did not think she would recover it was never safe for such as she to have sons and nothing else was to be expected perhaps it was not for julia found her on the bare ground of the courtyard where she had been set to die the oil lamps flared smokily at her head and her feet and mai gungo with the fortnight old baby in her arms cried ram ram lustily but the girl lingered in life turning her head restlessly from side to side on mother earth's bosom give her the baby only for a minute pleaded julia with tears in her eyes mai gungo frowned but a neighbour broke in hastily ay give it to her gossip lest in her evil ways she returns for it when she is dead so they laid the baby beside her but the restless head went on turning restlessly from side to side my doll my doll i like my doll best before they could fetch it from the mission compound kirpo was dead london the rains had fallen late bringing unusual greenness to the stretches of waste land and unusual promise of harvest to the bare brown fields where man and beast were hard at work day and night ploughing harrowing sowing watering waiting that integral part of indian husbandry had yet to come but the memory almost the dread of it lurked ever in the slow brains of the labourers in mine also alien and uninterested though it was for surely no one who has seen a jat cultivator tall meagre soft eyed wandering amongst his green wheat waiting for ram to send rain can ever forget the incarnate tragedy of the sight the sun was setting cloudless in a sea of light that still flooded the scene with the brightness of noon though the shadows lengthened in swift strides i was sitting on a wide flight of steps leading down into a small tank closed in on all sides by masonry viewed thus with the mass of brick work surrounding it this square of placid water reflecting back the lemon coloured sky the fringe of dull farash trees and the gilded spires of the temple rising above them showed like a small dutch picture set in a heavy deep recessed frame on the opposite side a woman in a saffron veil was filling her brass pot and on the trumpery stucco arcades of the temple plinth were painted blue elephants gingerbread tigers and spidery monkeys round and round the central spire the iridescent breasts of the whirling pigeons glinted in the level rays it was peaceful colourful almost in its way beautiful especially after a long day's work in the office tent which rose a few hundred yards away suddenly the clear cut silence of the scene was marred by a deprecatory voice behind me the presence will not think it so fine as 'ide park doubtless so fine as what i echoed carelessly being accustomed to the thousand and one interruptions of a district officer's life so fine as your 'ide par k in the town of london hyde park why what the deuce do you know of hyde park intense surprise had replaced my indifference for there was nothing to account for the strangeness of his words either in the face or figure of the man who stood behind me leaning on a long staff over which his hands were crossed it was just such a face and figure as i saw every day a typical jat in other words a farmer by race and heritage tall high shouldered lank with a bushy shaped turban adding to his height and straight folds of heavy unbleached cotton cloth suggesting the lean bony frame beneath a face well cut but not refined marked but not strong in which the most noticeable features were the large dreamy eyes like those of botticelli's moses in the sistine chapel immovable from the knee downwards he squatted as the americans say in his tracks keeping his submissive face towards mine like a dog awaiting his master's pleasure by the mercy of the presence i have seen 'ide park yes i have been there in the city of london where the sahibs and the mem sahibs sit and walk a vision of the figure before me planted out amongst flower decked mashers and powdery belles aroused such a sense of incongruity in my mind that i could only echo feebly so you have been to london yes he replied cheerfully i've been to london to see the great queen for the life of me i could not help reverting to the sequence of childish days pussy cat pussy cat what saw you there and his reply fitted in so neatly that my query lost its lightness and became serious i saw the sikattar secretary who sits in her chair i laughed then i could not help it for i felt convinced that no other words could have expressed the whole incident more truthfully i went to london o protector of the poor continued the stranger softly because i wanted to get back the land the presence knows we jats cannot live without our land involuntarily his eyes turned to a neighbouring field where a couple of plough bullocks were slowly scoring the levels into feeble furrows whilst the ploughman just such a man as the one before me held his hookah in one hand his goad in the other so you did not get the land after all how was that god knows i was not always so ready of access to the native as the departmental pastorals put it but then one does not meet a jat who has been to hyde park every day perhaps if it had not been a sikattar replied the low soft voice perhaps if it had been the great queen herself here the plough bullocks he was watching turned too sharply and his hand closed mechanically on the stick he held between his knees as if he were responsible for the mistake if the presence has not heard it all before i will tell it why dewa ram the jat went to london i give the story in his own words for mine might fail to transmit the perfection of his patience the land was my father's and my father's father from mahratta times in those days no one could sell the land or prevent the sons from following the father's plough to begin with no one wanted to sell good land and then they could not if they would that was before the great sirkar life and prosperity be with it always came to lift the hearts of the poor and set their heads high there was much land and on some of it in olden days a mortgage had been put the presence will know the kind of mortgage where for a hundred rupees or so of loan another man is allowed to till the soil worth thousands only if it is wanted back then the owner returns the hundred rupees that is all it is done when a family is small and has too much land to till properly so the village accountant's people held the land because they were relations by marriage it was in my father's time that the great sirkar came and we began paying the dues to it instead of to the maharajah then when my father fell into evil ways because of drugs my mother took her sons we were twins sewa ram and i if the presence pleases back to her people far away beyond amritsar for she was of a high proud family and when the hemp gets into a man's head he does unclean things so my father was alone and the accountant made him do as he liked bribing him with drugs that was how it happened as the presence will doubtless perceive so when my father neglected his own land the accountant's people cultivated it for him and gave him what was due my mother heard of this but she said nothing because we were but little lads and the land could not run away it was better that it should be tilled than left to rack and ruin at last my father died but they sent no word to amritsar because the great sirkar was coming to count the village and make a map of it with all the holdings of the proper shape and all the fields coloured green if the protector of the poor will forgive his dust like slave he will remember that fields are not green always and so likewise the holdings are not always right no matter how carefully they are put on the map there was the old mortgage a man who lied tilling the soil and no one to come to the sirkar and say 'here is the hundred rupees give us back the land and write it in our names' because as i have said sewa ram and i were away beyond amritsar and our mother thought the land could not run away it was no wonder the sirkar was deceived no wonder at all but when we came to claim the land even our names were not on the list they had written the wrong thing because the mortgage had been foreclosed and there were no heirs after this one judge may he become the lat sahib said he would put it right but the accountant was rich and made it into an appeal the presence knows what an appeal is doubtless and how when a little thing like this just a mistake in a map gets up amongst the pleaders and the sikattars it is sometimes too small for them to see it would have been different if the sirkar had seen two big noisy boys when it counted the village then sewa ram was set free from the prison of life and i was alone for the presence knows a jat cannot marry without land or have sons when there is no plough to keep the furrow of existence straight so i sold my mother's jewels and went to show the great queen herself that my father really had a son thus i came to 'ide park in london city and saw the sikattar then you did not succeed the presence knows that the vizier is not as the badshah he was very kind sending me back by ship p and o and writing god knows how many letters he wrote and he bade me wait that is two years gone so i am waiting still have you a case in my court he shook his head with a certain pride oh no it is in the big court or with the financial or a sikattar just now but it will come to the presence sooner or later that is why i journey with the protector of the poor when that day comes the presence will remember how dewa ram the jat went to 'ide park as i strolled back to the tent he followed at a discreet distance afterwards as i sat smoking outside i saw him wandering in the fields listlessly his tall figure standing out against the sky as he paused to look at the sprouting wheat when i questioned my underlings as to his story they smiled obsequiously as the native will smile before the master's face the case it appeared had grown to be quite a standing joke in the office nor was this the first cold weather that dewa ram had haunted the camp of the deputy commissioner and waited for news of his land they hemmed and hawed however over the rights and wrongs of his claim until i asked them point blank what their own impressions were then habit gave way to truth and they frankly declared their belief in some miscarriage of justice a man they said would not go all the way to london for nothing as i inclined to the same view i took the trouble to try working the oracle by the back stairs a method no less successful in india than elsewhere replies more or less hopeful as to some ultimate settlement of the question came from various friends in high places some of these i communicated in a guarded way to london who as the sowing time passed fell a victim to fever and deferred hope it was impossible for mortal man to see those dreamy eyes of his watching the crops of other men without feeling an insane desire to bring the promised land within his reach he was very grateful so condescending a presence he said had never before dwelt in the tents of the great sirkar and often on sunday afternoons when the camp was at rest he would steal ostentatiously to a spot about thirty yards from where i was sitting and if opportunity offered enter into conversation generally beginning by some apologetic allusion to 'ide park but ending with a vast amount of information he was a perfect mine of folk lore and many a half hour did he beguile by old world stories and traditions one in particular i will retail in his own words because it seems to me to give insight into the nature of the man and of his race i had been having my sunday cup of afternoon tea in the shade of a huge banian tree and was idly amusing myself by throwing crumbs to a bright eyed bushy tailed palm squirrel that had crept down the trunk not two yards from me attracted partly by hunger but more by the sheer light hearted cussedness which makes the indian squirrel so charming a companion the little creature came nearer and nearer its tail in an aggressive pluff its large eyes scanning my face knowingly a pause a dart and it was chirruping on the branch above my head with the crumb in its deft fingers the presence is a friend of ram's said london deferentially that is why the heart of the presence is so soft and why do you say i am a friend of ram's i asked because the presence is a friend to ram's friend has the huzoor never heard how the squirrel people come to have four black marks on their golden backs then i will tell it was in the old days when ram's parents fastened the silken bracelet on his wrist and sent him out to find seeta his wife the presence will have heard of that and how each year our women folk tie the ram rukkhi to our wrists for luck well when ram the king of all men came to sanderip he found the great monkey had carried off seeta the queen of women then being in distress he bid all the birds and beasts and fishes come to help him for great ram was the lord of the whole earth now the first to answer his call was the squirrel in those days it was all golden like corn in the sunlight and light hearted beyond all mortal things as it is now it leapt on to ram's sword and cried 'master i am ready' but the great god's eyes grew soft as he saw the little thing's slender beauty and perceived that it had the bravest heart of all his creatures so he laid his hand on it in blessing saying softly 'nay tender little warrior thou art too pretty for strife and death live on brave and careless for ever so that weary men may see the beauty of the life great ram has given' but lo when he raised his hand the squirrel's shining coat bore the shadow of ram's tired fingers for even golden life is dimmed by the touch of care this and many another tale he told to me while the green pigeons bustled about in the branches and the squirrels lay yawning amongst the mango flowers for the winter had flown the camping season was at an end and still london was waiting he never complained only when rain fell or when there was a heavy dew or a good winnowing wind anything in short calculated to gladden the heart of a farmer he used to talk of 'ide park and bewail the fact that sikattar sahibs had penetrated even there the hot weather passed as usual in a stagnation of mind and body more or less modified by individual energy and during it london paid me but occasional visits and was fairly cheerful no sooner however did the stir of coming cultivation begin again in the high unirrigated soils than he followed suit with a growing restlessness and still no answer came just then a small piece of government land that is to say land in which no cultivator had a vested interest fell vacant in a village not far from london's ancestral home and i bethought me of putting him in as tenant if i could but it is no easy task to find soil to cultivate in india since farms are not to be let as they are in england and the state though in reality owner has no power to turn out one man or his heirs in favour of another or in any way to manipulate the holdings of hereditary cultivators why knowing this it could have delegated the power to the money lender in giving the right of alienation by sale or mortgage to the cultivator is one of those abstruse mysteries over the elucidation of which volumes have been and are still to be written a mystery moreover which is responsible for half the growing poverty of those whose patient labour is the bulwark of the state the particular village in which i hoped to find a more or less temporary outlet for poor london's hereditary instinct which made the sight of a plough have much the same effect on him as a clutch of eggs has on a broody hen had earned an unenviable notoriety from the number of mutineers it produced in the ' nearly one half of the land had come under direct government control by confiscation and as the country settled down had been leased at fixed rentals to the loyal families or in many cases to the heirs of the dead offenders one of these the son of a notorious mutineer had just died childless and it was into his place that i determined if possible to put london the case dewa ram versus the empress and others had come back to me for the third time with a request for further inquiry and evidence there was none to give for in a country where birth and marriage certificates are unknown quantities and registers of all kinds are inaccurate legal proof of a case like london's is almost impossible as he himself invariably said it was no wonder the sirkar had been deceived by the foreclosed mortgage and the lying man who tilled the soil joined to the newly invented theory that the peasant proprietor had a right to alienate the ancestral property of his descendants so with the prospect of another cold weather camp before me i felt an almost morbid desire to get rid of london and those patient eyes that seemed to me as if they were ever on the look out for the promised land i was told afterwards by my superiors in set terms that my behaviour was illegal and indiscreet and that i should have gone round the mutinous crew one by one giving them the option of leasing the land before offering it to any one else above all before putting in a man whose claim to other ground was in course of settlement i believe my superiors to have been quite right theoretically and i know that practically my philanthropic experiment proved a disastrous failure not a week after london glowing with gratitude set out for the village in which his new holding was situated he was brought back to the hospital on a stretcher with a broken arm and several clouts on the head indeed i have always felt it to be the crowning mercy of my career that no one was actually killed in the free fight which ensued on my protege's arrival in the mutineers' village for he had some friends stalwart as himself and the jats once aroused from their usual calm placidity fight like devils with their long quarterstaves on this occasion they gave the truculent crew as good as they got until overpowered by numbers when the incident occurred i was in a very out of the way part of the district and i well remember having to send a special messenger thirty miles with an urgent telegram in order to allay still more urgent inquiries as to the serious agrarian riot in b when i returned to head quarters i found london convalescent and distinctly cheerful he was sitting on the hospital steps whittling a new staff and expressed his determination of going back to the village as soon as possible with a larger supply of friends i felt constrained however to deny him his revenge to begin with my official reputation could not have stood another agrarian riot in addition the mutineering village had appealed against my action en masse so the matter had passed beyond my control london was sorrowful but sympathetic seeming to enjoy the idea that i too might become a prey to sikattars ere long he took great pride in his broken arm and new stick and more than once suggested that if the great queen only knew how he had clouted the heads of the misbegotten unfaithful devils she might believe that his father had indeed left a son after this i made several attempts to bring a plough handle within london's reach but my philanthropy was guarded and my efforts uniformly unsuccessful once a small atom of land on which i had my eye was taken up by a newly made municipal committee as a public institute it was jubilee year and various things of the kind were being started when i saw this particular one last a stuffed crocodile two spinning wheels some tussar silk cocoons and a specimen card of aniline dyes occupied what they were pleased to call the industrial department in the reading room opposite an interesting collection of seditious journalism lay on the table and a chromo of the kaiser i hind hung over the fireplace then once again when i thought i had found a resting place for those dreamy eyes the military department stepped between hope and fruition with a stout subadar major who had done the state good service finally sick leave the end of so many kindly plans and hopes for those who living amongst the peasantry learn to admire them as they deserve to be admired came to put an end to all my plans for london he bore the tidings with gentle regret the presence he said had not been well for some time it would be the better of seeing 'ide park again and perhaps as it was to be away so long a whole year he was told there would be a chance of seeing not only the sikattar but the great queen herself and if he continued standing up and leaning on his staff as i had first seen him whilst his eyes followed the ploughing for yet another harvest and if the presence is so fortunate perhaps it might find time to remember that dewa ram the jat is waiting for his land the reason for my writing this absolutely true experience is one of those distressing inconsistencies which are part and parcel of poor humanity one might have thought the facts sufficient to excuse a resort to pen ink and paper on the part of one really interested in that peasant life of which the rulers and governors know so little but it needed an unreality a mere feverish fancy to supply the motive power i was in hyde park yesterday at the close of a bright afternoon no need to describe what i saw to those who live in london the scene is as familiar as their own faces while those who do not have at their disposal a thousand descriptions far better than any i could give an unusually thick sprinkling of clerical attire among the crowd testified to the attraction of missionary meetings when combined with london at its best indeed as i had come down piccadilly the vast number of sandwich men advertising lectures meetings and addresses on every conceivable subject struck me as favourable evidence of the growing intelligence and sympathy of the many for things beyond the daily round of english life i sat down and being a comparative stranger amused myself as many have done before me in listening to the scraps of conversation which fell from the lips of the passers by the flotsam jetsam left by the stream of humanity and as usual my initial curiosity and interest died down before the growing perception of some strange likeness underlying all the atoms of thought and speech slowly uncertainly as the confused tints of a child's magic lantern focus into some horrid monster or as the ebbing tide discloses the drowned face of a victim the half heard assertions denials protestations of the pleasure seeking crowd gave up their individual form and colour and were lost in the one unchangeable indestructible characteristic of humanity its selfishness on every face an interest a smile a frown a thought below these the one source of all inevitable no doubt but depressing in the masks are men and women claiming to be the cream of culture and civilisation i wondered if when the best was said and done the art of widening our vitality by our sympathies had made much progress a stir in the crowd a murmur a look of expectation roused me from idle moralisings a couple of outriders in red came down the drive and people paused to look by jove it's the queen herself said some one hurriedly as a brougham drove past giving a glimpse from behind closed windows of grey hair and a widow's cap the murmur swelled to a roar almost a cheer every hat was off and some country cousins stood up in their chairs in order to see better now what followed will i know be set down to the attack of indian fever which some ten minutes afterwards sent me home to shiver in bed nevertheless i am prepared to swear that there amongst the flower decked mashers and the powdery belles i saw the tall gaunt form of london leaning on his quarterstaff the gentle deprecatory smile i had so often seen when he spoke of 'ide park was on his face as if he knew the incongruity of his own appearance in such a scene his eyes were not on the modest carriage in which the kaiser i hind was being partially displayed to her faithful subjects they were fixed on me on me the tape tied sealing waxed representative of a paternal despotism in india the myriad tongues resumed their civilised shibboliths but above them came a well known cadence and if the presence is so fortunate perhaps it might find time to remember that dewa ram the jat is waiting for his land as i said before i went home to bed what else could i do perhaps if other people could have seen what i saw dewa ram and his kind would not be so often in difficulties about their land lal who was lal what was he this was a question i asked many times and though it was duly answered lal remained and remains still an unknown quantity an abstraction a name and nothing more l a l the same backwards and forwards self contained self sufficing the first time i heard of lal was on a bright spring morning one of those mornings when the plains of northern india glitter with dew drops when a purple haze of cloud mountain bounds the pale wheat fields to the north and a golden glow strikes skywards from the sand hills in the south i was in a tamarisk jungle on the banks of the indus engaged in the decorous record of all the thefts and restitutions made during the year by that most grasping and generous of rivers for year after year armed by the majesty of law and bucklered by foot rules and maps the government of india in the person of one of its officers came gravely and altered the proportion of land and water on the surface of the globe while the river gurgled and dimpled as if it were laughing in its sleeve strange work but pleasant too with a charm of its own wrought by infinite variety and sudden surprise sometimes watching the stream sapping at a wheat field where the tender green spikes fringed the edges of each crack and fissure in the fast drying soil a promise of harvest and then sheer down the turbid water gnawing hungrily every now and again a splash telling that another inch or two of solid earth had yielded sometimes standing on a mud bank where the ever watchful villagers had sown a trial crop of coarse vetch thus as it were casting their bread on the water in hopes of finding it again some day but when would it be there at harvest time grey bearded patriarchs from the village would wag their heads sagely over the problem and younger voices protest that it was not worth while to enter such a flotsam jetsam as a field but the ruthless iron chain would come into requisition and another green spot be daubed on the revenue map for governments ignore chance and still the river dimpled and gurgled with inward mirth for if it gave the vetch had it not taken the wheat so from one scene of loss or gain to another while the sun shone in the cloudless sky overhead past pools of shining water where red billed cranes stood huddled up on one leg as if they felt cold in the crisp morning air out on the bare stretches of sand where glittering streams and flocks of white egrets combined to form a silver embroidery on the brown expanse over the shallow ford where the bottle nosed alligators slipped silently into the stream or lay still as shadows on the sun baked sand down by the big river where the swirling water parted right and left and where the greybeards set their earthen pots a swimming to decide which of the two streams would prove its strength by bearing away the greater number a weighty question not lightly to be decided since the land to the west of the big stream belonged to one village and the land eastward to another back again to higher ground through thickets of tamarisk dripping with dew the bushes sparse below with their thin brown stems so thick above where the feathery pink spiked branches interlaced riding through it the hands had to defend the face from the sharp switch of the rosy flowers as they swung back disentangled such tiny flowers too no bigger than a mustard seed and leaving a pink powder of pollen behind them it was after forcing my way through one of these tamarisk jungles that i came out on an open patch of rudely ploughed land where a mixed crop of pulse and barley grew sturdily outlining an irregular oval with a pale green carpet glistening with dew in the centre a shallow pool of water still testified to past floods and from it a purple heron winged its flight lazily craning its painted neck against the sky the whole posse comitatus of the village following me broke by twos and threes through the jungle and gathered round me as i paused watching the bird's flight take the bridle from his honour's pony cried a venerable pantaloon breathlessly let the steed of the lord of the universe eat his fill is not this the field of lal twenty hands stretched out to do the old headman's bidding twenty voices re echoed the sentiment in varying words a minute more and my pony's nose was well down on the wet sweet tufts of vetch and i was asking for the first time who is lal lal came the answer why lal was lal this was his field why should not the pony of the protector of the poor have a bellyful was it not more honourable than the parrot people and the squirrel people and the pig people who battened on the field of lal it was early days yet for the flocks of green parrots to frequent the crops and the dainty squirrels were i knew still snugly a bed waiting for the sun to dry the dew but at my feet sundry furrows and scratches told that the pig had already been at work is lal here i asked a smile such as greets a child's innocent ignorance came to the good humoured faces around me lal they explained came when the crop was ripe when the parrot the squirrel and the pig people and his honour's pony too had had their fill lal was a good man one who walked straight and laboured truly but where is he i insisted face looked at face half puzzled half amused who could tell where lal was he might be miles away or in the next jungle some one had seen him at sukkhur a week agone but that was no reason why he should not be at bhukkur now for lal followed the river and like it was here to day gone to morrow baulked in my curiosity i took refuge in business by inquiring what revenue lal paid on his field this was too much for the polite gravity of my hearers the idea of lal's paying revenue was evidently irresistibly comic and the venerable pantaloon actually choked himself between a cough and a laugh requiring to be held up and patted on the back but some one must pay the revenue i remarked a little testily certainly the lord of the universe was right the village community paid it it was the village which lent lal the field and the bullocks and the plough it was the village which gave him the few handfuls of seed grain to scatter broadcast over the roughly tilled soil so much they lent to lal the sun and the good god gave him the rest all that is to say that was not wanted for the parrot the pig and the squirrel people and of course for the pony of the lord of the universe there are so many mysteries in indian peasant life safe hidden from alien eyes that i was lazily content to let lal and his field slip into the limbo of things not thoroughly understood and so ere long i forgot all about him spring passed ripening the crops summer came bringing fresh floods to the river and autumn watched the earth once more make way against the water but lal was to me as though he had not been it was only when another year found me once more in the strange land which lies as the natives say in the stomach of the river that memory awoke with the words this is the field of lal there was however no suggestion made about loosening my pony's bridle as on the former occasion the reason for such reticence being palpable lal had either been less fortunate in his original choice of a field this year or else the sun and the good god had been less diligent care takers a large portion of the land too bore marks of an over recent flood in a thick deposit of fine glistening white sand a favourite trick of the mischievous indus by which she disappoints hope raised by previous gifts of rich alluvial soil a trick which has given her a bad name the worst a woman can bear because she gives and destroys with one hand here and there in patches the sparse crop showed green but for the most part the ground lay bare cracking into large fissures under the noonday sun and peeling at the top into shiny brown scales a bad lookout for lal i remarked bad they said for the squirrel people and the parrot people no doubt but for lal that was another matter li did not live by bread alone the river gave the river took away but to lal at any rate it gave more than it stole what does it give i asked it gave crocodiles of all things in the world crocodiles not a welcome gift to many but lal it seemed was a hunter of crocodiles not a mere slayer of alligators like the men of the half savage tribes who frequent the river land who array themselves in a plethora of blue beads and live by the creeks and jheels on what they can catch or steal who track the cumbersome beasts to their nightly lair in some narrow inlet and after barring escape by a stealthy earthwork fall on the helpless creature at dawn with spears and arrows lal was not of these he was of another temper he hunted the crocodile in its native element stalked it through the quicksands knife in hand dived with it into the swift stream sped like a fish to the soft belly beneath and struck upwards with unerring hand once twice thrice while the turbid orange water glowed crimson with the spouting blood i heard this tale curiously but incredulously why i asked should lal run such risks what good were crocodiles to him when they were slain there was not so much risk after all they replied for it was only the bottle nosed ones that he hunted and though of course the snub nosed ones lived in the river also god destroy the horrid monsters still they did not interfere in the fight and lal was careful all the more careful because he had but two possessions to guard his skin and his knife as to what lal did with the crocodiles why he ate them of course not all he spared some for his friends for those who were good to him and gave him something in return had the presence never heard that the poor ate crocodile flesh they themselves of course did not touch the unclean animal and their gifts to lal were purely disinterested he was a straight walking a labourful man and that was the only reason why they lent him a field even the presence would acknowledge that crocodile flesh without bread would be uninteresting diet but as a rule the pig the parrots the squirrels left enough for lal to eat with his jerked meat the village lent him the sickle of course and the flail and the mill sometimes even the girdle on which to bake the unleavened bread but all for love only for love yet if the presence desired it they could show him the jerked meat some that lal had left for the poor it was dry oh yes lal cut the great beasts into strips and laid them in the sun on the dry sand sitting beside them to scare away the carrion birds sometimes there would be a crowd of vultures and lal with his knife sitting in the midst he will have to sell some of his jerked crocodile to pay his revenue this year i remarked just to amuse them again the idea was comic evidently lal and money were incompatible and the very idea of his owning any caused them to chuckle unrestrainedly amongst themselves then growing grave they explained at length how lal had nothing in the world but his knife all the rest the sun the river the crocodiles the field the bullocks the plough and the seed grain were lent to him by them and the good god lent to him and to the other people who ate of the field of lal as i rode away a brace of black partridges rose from one of the green patches and close to the tamarisk shelter a brown rat sat balancing a half dried stalk of barley the river gleamed in the distance a wedge shaped flight of coolin cleft the sky all that day when the shadow like crocodiles slipped into the sliding water i thought of lal and his knife was it a crocodile after all or was it a man stealthy swift and silent who could tell when there was nothing but a shadow a slip and then a few air bubbles on the sliding river or was that lal yonder where the vultures ringed a sand bank far on the western side why not none knew whence he came or whither he went what he hoped or what he feared only his field bare witness to one human frailty hunger and that he shared with the pig and the parrot and the squirrel people but though my thoughts were full of lal for a day or two the memory of him passed as i left the river land and once more spring summer and autumn brought forgetfulness there were busy times for all the revenue officers next year the fitful river had chosen to desert its eastern bank altogether and concentrate its force upon the western so while yard after yard of ancestral land was giving way before the fierce stream amidst much wringing of hands on the one side there was joy on the other over long rich stretches ready for the plough and the red tape of measurement in the press of work even the sight of the river land failed to awake any memory of lal it was not until i was re entering the outskirts of the village at sundown that something jogged my brain making me turn to the posse comitatus behind me and ask and where this year is the field of lal we were passing over an open space baked almost to whiteness by the constant sun a hard resonant place set round with gnarled jhand trees and dotted over with innumerable little mud mounds there wheezed the venerable pantaloon pressing forward and pointing to one newer than the rest that is the field of lal then i saw that we were in the village burial ground i looked up inquiringly huzoor repeated a younger man that is lal's field it is his own this time but for all that the sirkar will not charge him revenue the grim joke and the idea of lal's having six feet of earth of his own at last once more roused their sense of humour and the other people who ate of the field of lal i asked half in earnest for somehow my heart was sad the good god will look after them as he has after the crocodiles since then strangely enough the memory of lal has remained with me and i often ask myself if he really existed and if he really died does he still slip silently into the stream knife in hand does he still come back to his field under the broad harvest moon to glean his scanty share after the other people have had their fill i cannot say but whenever i see a particularly fat squirrel i say to myself it has been feeding in the field of lal a debt of honour a flood of yellow sunshine on yellow sand and a horse at the gallop a horse guided by an english boy in blue spectacles sitting squarely enough but somewhat stiffly in his saddle as if too independent to give himself away even to the joyous swing of the handsome little beast beneath him a big boy undoubtedly but a boy for all his size and despite the fact that he was an assistant commissioner of the third grade in other words one appointed to administer justice to the ignorant heathen those ignorant heathen who seemed to have such odd ideas of life and to require such immediate regeneration at the hands of english boys in front across the foreground the glaring white high road for which he was steering to the left centre a gnarled knotted old jhand tree hung with coloured threads and patches proclaiming it to be still sacred to some effete modern form of serpent worship one of those mysterious indian cults of which no one not even the disciples themselves know anything young jones or smith what matters the name when a character has but to figure before the footlights of a single scene noticed these threads and patches with the quick but incomprehensive eye of superiority a not uncommon feeling of contemptuous interest came over him which prolonged itself even when the cause changed into a wonder why the brute he was riding would not keep its head at the proper angle then darkness and silence smith jones's horse had put its foot into a rat hole and given him a bad fall about as bad a fall as could well have been short of those curious plunges over the edge of one world into the next he lay white and still on the yellow sand neither in time nor eternity for a long while how long matters no more than his name for this is the story of smith jones and it is through his eyes and his thoughts that it must be seen and told therefore until he began to gain consciousness the scene remained as it were a blank despite the fact that there were other actors on the stage most people when coming to themselves to use a popular but confusing phrase meet first of all with a sound of slow storm spent breakers rolling in on some unknown shore is it the one they are leaving or the one to which they seek return who knows for the vague wonder is stilled by a whispering hush growing louder and louder as if both worlds were waiting finger on lip for a decision then as a rule comes a kindly familiar voice or touch to settle the question in favour of this earth perhaps some day it may come to summon us to another again who knows smith jones however felt something so distinctly unfamiliar that he opened his eyes in a fright relieved to find himself in that unmistakable flood of sunshine which does not exist out of india briefly he felt or thought he felt a kiss upon his lips now smith jones like most well trained unemotional english boys had a strong dislike to kisses he lumped them with many other things under the generic term bosh and confined himself to reserved pecks at the foreheads of his mother his sisters his aunts and an occasional a very occasional cousin even when they had all stood round in tears while robin the gardener hoisted the brand new cabin trunk on to the fly which from the large white placards on the luggage was evidently destined to carry smith jones part of the way to bombay he had only got as far as a kiss on the cheek despite a choke in his throat and a distinct inclination to cry and now it was startling in the extreme lying on his back a prey to somewhat alarmed surprise he became aware through his nose of a pleasant scent and through his eyes of the pendant mistletoe like twigs of the jhand tree mistletoe yes that might account for the kiss but what about the perfume of roses there it was again in company with an old peacock's feather fan which looked as if it were half through a severe moulting some one was fanning him positively fanning him for the feathers swooped again and again just above his face in composed curves suggestive of leisure and perpetual motion he tried to find out more by turning his head an effort which made him realise that he had been within an ace of breaking his neck and sobered him to acquiescence for a time not for long however seeing that the boy was a pertinacious boy so at the expense of a fearful rick he discovered a hand and arm belonging to the fan at least if it was a hand and arm after all and not merely a withered brown branch smith jones's blue eyes came to the conclusion that it was at any rate the skeleton of a hand and arm and what is more a curiously graceful skeleton then being still confused out of speech he tried to arrest the arm by catching hold of it but either he had not yet recovered a just estimate of distance or it eluded his grasp for the even monotony of the curve continued and on the whole it was pleasant enough to lie on one's back in the yellow sand and be fanned sleepily gracefully an enjoyment however which could not be allowed long continuance when there was a horse to be caught a camp to be reached a judgment to be written the whole burden of a world in short on smith jones's young shoulders i could get up now if you would remove that fan he said at last weakly surprised at his own difficulty in stringing two words together in a foreign tongue there is no hurry huzoor came in immediate reply the protector of the poor being so very young there is naturally plenty of time for all things ere he has to leave life yea plenty of time what a remarkable voice soft as the cooing of the doves in the jhand tree and no louder the far away echo of a voice toneless yet mellow but then the whole experience was remarkable and he lay trying to piece common sense into it with his brain still muddled by the jar which had so nearly sent him to still more novel environments until his hatred of bosh made him sit up suddenly unsteadily one hand supporting himself the other averting the sweep of the fan there was no doubt as to the place yonder was the white road there the responsible hole the wallow in the sand where his horse had rolled the jhand tree gay in its shreds and patches but what was that to one side of him some one either half fledged girl or shrunken old woman seated in one of those flat baskets which packmen use for carrying their burdens it was in effect a pack basket since cords attached it to one end of a banghy or yoke which was resting against a net full of small earthern pots fastened to the other extremity of the pliant lever the sight of a human being in a pack basket was unusual but smith jones during the last six months that is to say during his service in india had seen so many strange things that he set it down as yet another eccentricity of an eccentric people the occupant of the basket however disturbed him more he even thought with a certain sense of shame which would have been wanting had he been older or younger of fairy godmothers as if such banalities could be considered by smith jones assistant commissioner of the third grade and yet he was not without excuse mr rider haggard has described what she became when the fire scorched the charm out of a face and form which but for magic would have mouldered and been remoulded to fresh beauty centuries and centuries before the figure in the pack basket was as shrunken as shrivelled as any she extreme old age had driven womanhood away it had stolen every curve every contour every colour and yet possibly because the slow furnace of natural life is kinder than its artificial fires there was nothing unlovely in the wizened face or form on the contrary smith jones despite the memory of that fancied kiss still haunting his brain looked at her without a shudder she was dressed in a way which even his ignorance of the gala costumes of respectable females told him was unusual a very full red silk petticoat bordered with gay colours was half tucked into the basket half displayed over the edge in coquettish quillings and frillings of the bright embroidery a loose sacque of the same stuff many times too large for the bones it covered lay in wrinkles on arms and bust with here and there a glint of tarnished tinsel while a veil of like material faded to a purplish tint its heavy gold thread tracings torn frayed or wanting hid all but the tiny hand and arm swaying the fan and a shrunken waxen face whence a pair of bright black eyes looked at him wisely the presence would do well to repose once more came the worn out voice he is not to die this time he has broken nought save his blue spectacles and that is well spectacles are not for the young and as this slave said but now my lord is in possession of such great youth that he can afford to rest till dittu returns from pursuing the presence's horse which conceiving that the protector had no immediate need of its services hath retired after the manner of beasts to gorge in a gram field but i being dittu's relation can affirm that he will of a surety return ere long therefore rest is within reach and if the presence will lie down again i will keep the fly people from settling on the presence's face to tell the truth the effort to rise had made smith jones feel decidedly queer so without more ado he lay back on the pillow which the strange watcher had evidently improvised from the coarse outside veil she had worn over her finery he guessed this by the lingering smell of roses which clung to the fabric you might tell me how i came to fall off and who you are said he after a pause a little fretfully for he was unused to inaction and impatient at things he did not understand huzoor rat holes are very simple things or perhaps it was a snake hole if my lord had gone a pace farther from the tree he would not have been on sacred ground and then the serpent might not have revenged himself smith jones gave a little wriggle what bosh he muttered adding aloud as if to change the subject and who are you mother if my lord dislikes old wives' tales came the cooing voice he will not care for mine he is so young if the presence's great grandfather what do you know about my great grandfather he interrupted hotly nothing except that the protector of the poor must have had one that is all nevertheless if the presence's great grandfather heaven cool his grave had been in jodhnagar when he was young he might have heard gulabi sing i am gulabi huzoor the peacock's feather fan with its scent of dead roses swung backwards and forwards backwards and forwards in that even rhythmical sweep which only those accustomed to the task from childhood can maintain for long without break or flaw it was particularly soothing i was singer to the great maharani at the pearl palace went on the voice i had to sing her to sleep whilst i fanned her as i am fanning the pillar of justice even now i used to sing also before the court in the evening sitting in the screened room where only the great and the favoured had sight of my mistress sometimes the presence's people came from over the sea i have seen them they came in those days for gold and jewels sometimes also for love not for justice as my lord comes now nor did they wear blue spectacles but then they were young and i who am so old now i was young also the melancholy cadence of her words was quite lost on smith jones who was fast recovering himself and beginning once more to take a rational view of life and an interest in the situation as a situation among other things he was a student of folk lore and the chance of acquiring information from this old woman something that might even be construed into a sun myth was exceedingly tempting you must know a lot of old songs mother he said in superior tones sing me one while we are waiting for dittu or if you can't sing it you know just say it i only want the words was it a faint chuckle he heard as he lay prone on his back or only a louder gurgle of those ceaseless doves in the jhand tree the old lady's voice imperturbably toneless arrested his wonder why should i not sing huzoor seeing i am of a family of bards we sing both of the old and the new order my father and my father's father sang of them before me yet i have no son to sing them after me so the songs i sing die with me when i am dead no one will hear them any more all the more reason why he should hear them now thought smith jones feeling surreptitiously in his pocket for a note book the presence need not trouble himself he must close his eyes or i shall forget my song my singing is for sleep and dreams and this song has been waiting to be sung so long that it is well nigh forgotten already listen and dream huzoor she began in the usual low chant varied by occasional sudden turns modulating the tone into a higher or a lower key in accordance with the spirit of the story from a musical point of view there was nothing remarkable in the performance save the absolute want of vibration in the worn out voice whose even softness became all the more remarkable when contrasted by the passion in the words yet smith jones felt at once that he was listening to a past mistress in her art the art which in old times represented history literature and the drama and made the desire for or possession of a really good bard a just cause for battle murder or sudden death among rival courts he could not of course recollect the exact words used but in telling me the tale years after he declared that his memory clung close to the original and that her song swept on untrammelled by more rhyme or rhythm than what seemed to come to it spontaneously through the chant she sang in fact as the native bards sing with every now and again an interlude of refrain or exclamation serving as a pause during which the singer grasps a fresh idea a new measure and this according to smith jones was the song that she sang listen pillar of justice listen roses smell sweet but they are silent when the sun kisses them i sing of a rose who sang yet rose like was silent of kisses heart of my heart why should i sing of a kiss which never came of the kiss owed to the rose not by the dead but the living for what is a dead man's kiss to lips that are like the rose he was so fair and young he came from far over the seas was it jewels or gold he was seeking no matter 'twas love that he found his hair was golder than gold his eyes full of laughter were blue blue as the sapphires he sought whilst love was seeking for him yea the black sought for love in the blue oh cold were his eyes cold as the snows in the north when the rose began singing hai golden sun hai cold blue skies grant me but this a look a kiss hai hai hai right to the inner court of marbles and jewels 'mid peacocks' fans waving and tinkling sutaras he came when the stars came and talked to my mistress talked of love and of jewels the one for the sake of the other for the rani grew old and such women are easily flattered but singing rose smiled as she sang though naught but a singing slave men sought her for love and for kisses who sought not her mistress and one a snake of a man sought both without shame he was high in the court and a noble the rani's known lover hai the snake hai venomous thing dead of your own poisoning hai hai but what is a snake to a rose when the gold sun may kiss her so she sang sweeter and sweeter till blue eyes grew kinder what is your price for a song singing rose he asked softly gold from a snake but a kiss from the sun i sang bravely giving no heed to her frown for speech was not mine save by singing night after night singing on whilst they whispered of love and of jewels i owe her a gift of a surety he said the last night to my mistress give her gold she replied with a sneer what more would you give to a slave hai gold nothing but gold the heart of the rose turned cold she sought for love listen listen oh the ways of love are bold and the guiles of love are old the coins were wrapped in a paper it had a voice of its own to night when the gong chimes one the seeker will find a kiss in the twelve doored marble summer house bowered in roses alone in the garden i read it i saw not the snake hid in the bushes with unwinking venomous eyes this to my mistress he laughed and to night when the clock chimes one he dies for the rani sought love and he gave her but words what are words in exchange for the jewels she gave as a bride the jewels he steals from the queen when he leaves us to morrow lies lies nothing but lies from the snake the sun gives gold he does not take lies lies heart of my heart what are words and tears to a snake and the sun far far from the rose too far for a warning listen the rose has thorns to protect her blossoms a woman has guiles and smiles to protect her lover what matters a kiss at one said i take yours at eleven in the twelve doored marble summer house bowered in roses hai the greed and lust in his look the greed at the baited hook he saw not the thorn but the rose saw his lying soul she knew he would take his kiss and betray her when it was over she knew that with venomous snakes there is no safety but death one and eleven when figured on paper show little of change a stroke a scratch of a thorn no need for more than a scratch ere the paper was lost by the maiden and found by her mistress lost by the guile of one woman found in the path of another oh heart waiting 'mid the flowers counting out the hours till the snake's kiss one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven the clasp of a snake is cold but the clasp of death is colder and coldest of all the warm clinging clasp of a rose holding him tighter and tighter when the knife flashed out of the dark let me go he shrieked in his terror but the thorns of the rose held fast the warm blood staining her bosom as she waited for death in her turn then lights and an uproar and lo instead of the stranger the rani's own lover was dead dead who grieves when a snake is dead men are glad that its power has fled they laugh in their sleeve yet was there crying and shouting and noise bringing warning to all reaching the moon in the heavens the sun in its rising hastening its flight from the east to its home in the arms of the west is not that the course of the sun leaving the cast with a smile leaving the rose and the nightingale yea 'tis the course of the sun hai for the rose the singing rose hai for the nightingale yet who kills his own pleasure who kills the bulbul in the rose no they cut its wings they prison it they bid it sing sing with a blood stained heart when the sun shines on other roses so it sang waiting always for the kiss which never came pillar of justice from the land of the western sun say did the rose deserve the kiss which never came hath she not waited long enough for the promised kiss the song ceased as abruptly as it began and smith jones distinctly disappointed at its want of historical value thanked the old lady politely it appeared to him confused and bewildering nevertheless part of it might be twisted into some semblance of a myth the sun was frequently mentioned and the chiming of the hours pointed conclusively to the swallowing up of darkness by light and vice versa and by jove that must be dittu returning with the horse it was dittu the horse a bundle of green wheat and a very broad grin all of which common objects relieved smith jones who to say sooth felt out of his element lying on his back and being fanned by an old mummy in his more collected mood it struck him as undignified he blushed a little rose hastily and prepared to mount his horse and depart at once with this intention proceeding to rummage in his pockets for a rupee which with a courteously intended grunt he tendered to the old woman she might have been a graven image for all the notice she took of him or his coin the hand holding the fan rested on her lap her eyes were half closed the presence wastes time he had better give the bucksheesh to me remarked dittu grinning again the old mother is nigh stone deaf and blind she sits so all day never saying a word save her prayers she is a real pious one hai hai what misfortune the stirrup of the protector of the poor is broken god send the iron may be lying in the sand where the base born beast fell smith jones's puzzled perturbed look as he watched dittu on his knees searching for the missing stirrup iron may have been due to anxiety lest he should have to walk six miles into camp on the other hand he may have been wondering if the fall had seriously injured his brain anyhow there was an unusual air of doubt about him when dittu's grin and the iron came out of the sand together with the remark that if the presence would sit down and wait a while he dittu had some string with which a splice of the broken strap could be made in a minute or two meanwhile as the presence no longer required the pillow he would e'en cover up the old mother again with the veil he had taken from her it was more decent like and she was a decent old creature despite the fancy she had to wear those gay garments of her youth so the white veil was wound about the faded finery leaving nothing visible but the waxen face with its half closed eyes what are you carrying her about for asked smith jones jerkily she is so old huzoor and we her belongings thought she might like to end her long life peacefully in holy ganges so as i had the dead ancestors of the village to carry they are in those little pots on the other side of the yoke huzoor we just put her to make a balance in the basket smith jones's blue eyes they really were fine eyes now the spectacles were away grew big with surprise you mean that those little pots contain your dead ancestors their ashes huzoor the ashes of the village for the year some one always takes them at pilgrimage time and as i was strong i brought the old lady too she doesn't seem able to die up there amongst us all and she will have to be brought along some time she is mostly bones as it is no heavier than the ashes yonder he nodded his head at the net full of pots and went on twining the thread smith jones's face grew more and more troubled he had read in books of old people being brought thus to end their days devoutly in the sacred stream and it had seemed to him an interesting and curious habit that was all it seemed different now the presence is surprised at the ways of the dust like ones continued dittu cheerfully but old gulabi is accustomed to being carried about in a basket when she was quite a girl a long time ago before the gracious and beneficent rule of the presences came to put an end to all wrongdoing she had both her feet cut off for something she did i have heard my grandmother say she was a gay one but it must have been so long ago that we may forget it in her present decency both her feet cut off huzoor the feet of young people lead them into mischief she was a singer and she got into trouble so i have heard old folk say if the presence will cause forgiveness to be awarded to the speaker it may be said that the trouble was an englishman one of the no account wanderers who used to come before the great company bahadur threw the mantle of protection over the poor i know not the story rightly perhaps even old gulabi hath forgotten it seeing it was so long ago the rani she served was jealous and would have killed the singing rose so they called the old mother but for her art that they could not spare what tyrant kills the bulbul in his garden so they cut her feet off to keep her in the paths of virtue it is an excellent plan for those who walk lightly see the stirrup is ready for the foot of the presence and will support him safely on his road smith jones stood irresolute before the mummylike figure in the basket did she ever tell you the story herself he asked at length dittu's tongue clucked emphatic denial from the roof of his mouth huzoor she became decent before my day besides grandmother said even when she was young gulabi held her tongue on that score only if folk pitied her for crawling like a frog she would smile saying some things were worth more than feet and she expected her deserts some day hai hai a bold saying for carnal sinners but holy ganges will choke the wickedness from her for ever then you will take her to to hurdwar and and leave her there smith jones had a difficulty with this euphemism for the strange and barbarous custom he had read about in books he seemed to see the old creature seated in her flat basket in the stream a prey to exposure and cold it would scarcely be worth while her coming back suggested dittu humbly my grannie she is over there huzoor nodding his head towards the earthern pots was the last person who knew her ere she ceased singing now she is gone wherefore should gulabi wait longer she hath waited over long as it is to night when the moon rises we will travel onwards to her rest i must get back to the village by harvest time smith jones gave dittu the rupee he rode into camp sedately he wrote his judgment still more sedately then he ate his dinner and sat down sedately to read one book after another the asiatic antiquary a sermon by his father on the relative guilt of the heathen which in its day had fluttered the fold of muddleton on the fens by its laxity herbert spencer's sociology finally the whole duty of man which had been presented to him by a maiden aunt and outside beyond the thin film of canvas separating him from the calm indian night stretched a flood of moonshine the tent ropes glittering like silver cords against the dark leafage of the banyan tree the white road shining like a straight broad path to heaven or elsewhere sitting beside the reading lamp he could see past the furled chicks of the door right away to east and west west to rajputana and the pearl palace east to holy ganges and the golden gates of the great rest house chink a chink a chink came the brass jingles of a banghy making smith jones lay down the whole duty of man restlessly and move towards the door along that broad white shining path from west to east came a strange sight an old mummy of a woman wrapped in a shroud like veil and balanced by the ashes of the village swaying bobbing dancing mummy and ashes alike as the pliant bamboo lever on dittu's shoulder made the jingles chink and the eyes on the worn peacock's plume at either end look as if they were alive shuffle shuffle shuffle bob bob bob came dittu and his burden hurri gunga hurri gunga hurri gunga just a little guttural grunting like a pig's to keep the shuffle and the bob together smith jones stood staring into the moonlight the picture of irresolution the shadow of the banyan tree lay right across the road in a solid mass of darkness as if a great gulf were fixed between the light westward and the light eastward here in this no man's land dittu set down his banghy propped the lever into position with his packman's stick and made sideways for an interlude of tobacco among the camp followers at the watchfires across the road smith jones and the banghy were alone he could scarcely see it in the darkness though a wayward gleam of moonlight glittered on the brass jingles and lit up the peacock's eyes for all that he saw it clearly in his mind he saw the net of earthern pots the figure in the shroud nay he saw more he saw through the grave clothes to the faded finery within and through that again to something which had not faded despite the long long years to something which was waiting still for its reward and then a strange thing happened smith jones forgot everything he had been taught he forgot his father's sermon he forgot sociology folklore and the whole duty of man he forgot the sun myth and the great fight between darkness and dawn which never ceases he even forgot himself as he stepped into the shadowy gulf stooped and paid another man's debt of honour with a kiss he told me the tale years after when we were sitting over our toddy round a camp fire it was a moonlight night and the shadow of a great banyan tree lay like a gulf across a white road perhaps that awoke the memory he was then a married man with a charming wife and a growing family but never he assured me had he forgotten nor could he ever forget that kiss he declared that for one short second the whole world was at his feet the wilderness a blossoming rose the perfumes of which lingered here he took off his spectacles for though he had given up wearing blue ones years before his kind eyes had become a little dim perhaps with the sympathy they bestowed on all sorts and conditions of men he took off his spectacles i say and wiped them furtively the village legacy the case of mussumat nuttia being without heirs droned the court inspector bring her in she is already in the presence if the protector of the poor will rise somewhat at the other side of the table huzoor beside the yellow trousered legs of the guardian of peace that is mussumat nuttia a child some three years of age with a string of big blue beads round her neck a child who had evidently had a very satisfying meal and who was even now preserving its contour by half a yard of sugar cane stared gravely back at the assistant magistrate's grave face she has no heirs of any kind he asked none huzoor her mother was of the harni tribe working harvests in bhamaniwallah khurd there the misfortune of being eaten by a snake came upon her by the grace of god mussumat nuttia therefore remains oh guardian of the poor said two voices in unison as two tall bearded figures swathed in whitish brown draperies pressed a step forward with outstretched petitioning hands they had been awaiting this crisis all day long with that mixture of tenacity and indifference which is seen on most faces in an indian court give her in charge of the head men of the village they are responsible shelter of the world 'tis falsely represented the woman was a vagrant a loose walker a is the order written then bring the next case one flourish of a pen and mussumat nuttia became a village legacy the only immediate result being that having sucked one end of her sugar cane dry she began methodically on the other half an hour afterwards mounted on a white pony with pink eyes and nose and a dyed pink tail to match she was on her way back to the cluster of reed huts dignified by the name of bhamaniwallah khurd or little bhamaniwallah big bhamaniwallah lay a full mile to the northward secured against midsummer floods by the high bank which stretched like a mud wall right across the punjab plain from the skirts of the hills to the great meeting of the five waters at mittankote but little bhamaniwallah lay in the lap of the river and so bahadur and boota and jodha and all the grave big bearded dogas who fed their herds of cattle on the low ground and speculated in the cultivation of sandbanks lived with their loins girded ready to shift house with the shifting of the river that was why the huts were made of reeds that was why the women of the village clanked about in solid silver jewelry thus turning their persons into a secure savings bank mussumat jewun bahadur the head man's wife wore bracelets like manacles and a perfect yoke of a necklet as she patted out the dough cakes and expostulated shrilly at the introduction of a new mouth into the family when nuttia fast asleep was lifted from the pony and put down in the warm sand by the door she belongs to the village replied the elders wagging their beards god knows what my lords desire with the harni brat but if they ask for her she must be forthcoming ay and fat they like people to grow fat even in their jail khanas so nuttia grew fat she would have grown fat even had the fear of my lords not been before the simple villagers' eyes for despite her tender years she was eminently fitted to take care of herself she had an instinct as to the houses where good things were being prepared and her chubby little hand imperiously stretched out for a portion was seldom sent away empty indeed to tell the sober truth nuttia was not to be gainsaid as to her own hunger my stomach is bigger than that grandmother she would say confidently if the alms appeared to her inadequate and neither cuffs nor neglect altered her conviction she never cried and the little fat hand silently demanding more came back again and again after every rebuff till she felt herself in a condition to seek some warm sunny corner and curl round to sleep she lived for the most part with the yelping slouching village dogs following them as the nights grew chill to the smouldering brick kilns where she fed the little dust coloured puppies with anything above or beneath her own appetite as she outgrew childhood's vestment of curves and dimples some one gave her an old rag of a petticoat perhaps the acquisition of clothes followed as in ancient days a fall from grace certain it was that nuttia in a garment was a far less estimable member of society than nuttia without one to begin with it afforded opportunity for the display of many mortal sins vainglory in her own appearance deceit in attempting to palm the solitary prize off on the world as a various and complete wardrobe and dishonesty flagrant and unabashed for once provided with a convenient receptacle for acquired trifles nuttia took to stealing as naturally as a puppy steals bones then once having recognised the pleasures of possession she fought furiously against any infringement of her rights a boy twice her size went yelling home to his parents on her first resort to brute force consequent on the discovery of a potsherd tied to her favourite puppy's tail this victory proving unfortunate for the peace of the village the head men awoke to the necessity for training up their legacy in the paths of virtue so persistent pummelling was resorted to with the happiest effect nuttia stole and fought no more she retired with dignity from a society which failed to appreciate her and took to the wilderness instead at earliest dawn after her begging round was over she would wander out from the thorn enclosures to the world a kaleidoscope world where fields ripened golden crops one year and the next brought the red brown river wrinkling and dimpling in swift current where big brand new continents rose up before eager eyes and clothed themselves in green herbs and creeping things innumerable going no further however in the scale of creation except when the pelicans hunched themselves together to doze away digestion or a snub nosed alligator took a slimy snooze on the extreme edge if you wished to watch the birds or the palm squirrels or the jerboa rats you had to face northwards and skirt the high bank so much of dame nature's ways and a vast deal more mussumat nuttia learnt ere the setting sun and hunger drove her back to the brick kilns and the never failing meal of scraps never failing because the lords of the universe liked people to be fat and the head men were responsible for their legacy's condition so when an assistant magistrate indefinite because of the constant changes which apparently form part of western policy included the bhamaniwallahs in his winter tour of inspection a punchaiyut or council of five decided that it was the duty of the village to provide nuttia with a veil in case she should be haled to the presence and two yards of manchester muslin were purchased from the reserve funds of the village and handed over to the child with many wise saws on the general advisability of decency nuttia's delight for the first five minutes was exhilarating and sent the head men back to other duties with a glow of self satisfaction on their solemn faces then she folded the veil up quite square sat down on it and meditated on the various uses to which it could be put the result may be told briefly two days afterwards the assistant magistrate being a keen sportsman was crawling on his stomach to a certain long low pool much frequented by teal and mallard in the rear gleaming white through the caper bushes showed the usual cloud of witnesses filled with patient amazement at this unnecessary display of energy yet for all that counting shrewdly on the good temper likely to result from good sport so much so that the sudden uprising into bad language of the huzoor sent them forward prodigal of apology but the sight that met their eyes dried up the fountain of excuse nuttia stark naked stood knee deep in the very centre of the pool catching small fry with a bag net ingeniously constructed out of the manchester veil the punchaiyut sat again to agree that a child who could not only destroy the sport of the guardian of the poor but could also drag the village honour through the mud despite munificent inducements toward decency must be possessed of a devil so nuttia was solemnly censed with red pepper and turmeric until her yells and struggles were deemed sufficient to denote a casting out of the evil spirit it is not in the slow brained calm hearted peasant of india to be unkind to children and so when the function was over mussumat jewun and the other deep chested shrill voiced women comforted the victim with sweetmeats and the assurance that she would be ever so much better behaved in future nuttia eyed them suspiciously but ate her sweetmeats this incident did not increase her confidence in humanity on the other hand the attitude of the brute creation was a sore disappointment to her she might have had a heart instinct with greed of capture and sudden death instead of that dim desire of companionship for all the notice taken by the birds and the squirrels and the rats of her outstretched handful of crumbs she would sit for long hours silent as a little bronze image set in the sunshiny sand then in a rage she would fling the crumbs at the timid creatures and go home to the dogs and the buffaloes they at least were not afraid of her but then they were afraid of nobody and nuttia wanted something of her very own one day she found it it was only an old bed leg but to the eye of faith an incarnation for the leg of an indian bed is not unlike a huge ninepin and even a western imagination can detect the embryo likeness between a ninepin and the human form divine man has a head so has a ninepin and if humanity is to wear petticoats one solid leg is quite as good as two nay better since it stands more firmly arms were of course wanting but the holes ready cut in the oval centre for the insertion of the bed frame formed admirable sockets for two straight pieces of bamboo at this stage nuttia's treasure presented the appearance of a sign post but the passion of creation was on the child and a few hours afterwards something comically yet pitifully like the legacy herself stared back at her from that humble studio among the dirt heaps a shag of goat's hair glued on with prickly pear juice two lovely black eyes drawn with mussumat jewun's khol pencil a few blue beads a scanty petticoat and veil filched from the child's own garments nuttia inspired by the recollection of a tinsel decorated bride in big bhamaniwallah called her creature sirdar begum on the spot then she hid her away in a tussock of tiger grass beyond the thorn enclosures and strove to go her evening rounds as though nothing had happened yet it was as if an angel from heaven had stepped down to take her by the hand henceforward she was never to be alone all through the silent sunny days as she watched the big black buffaloes grazing on the muddy flats for nuttia was advanced to the dignity of a herd girl by this time sirdar begum was with her as guide counsellor and friend whether the doll fared best with a heart's whole devotion poured out on her wooden head or whether nuttia's part in giving was more blessed need not be considered the result to both being a steady grin on a broad round face but there was another result also nuttia began to develop a taste for pure virtue perhaps it was the necessity of posing before sirdar begum as infallible joined to the desire of keeping that young person's conduct up to heroic pitch which caused the sudden rise in principle at all events the legacy's cattle became renowned as steady milkers and the amount of butter she managed to twirl out of the sour curds satisfied even mussumat jewun's demands whereupon the other herds looked at her askance and muttered an indian equivalent of seven devils then the necessity for amusing the doll led nuttia into lingering round the little knots of story tellers who sat far on into the night discoursing of jins and ghouls of faithful lovers virtuous maidens and the beauties of holiness down on the edge of the big stream with the water sliding by nuttia rehearsed all these wonders to her adored bed leg until falling in love with righteousness she took to telling the truth it was a fatal mistake in a cattle lifting district and bhamaniwallah khurd lay in the very centre of that maze of tamarisk jungle quicksand and stream which forms the cattle thief's best refuge so bahadur and jodha and boota together with many another honest man made a steady income by levying black mail on those who sought safety within their boundaries and this without in any way endangering their own reputations all that had to be done was to obliterate strange tracks by sending their own droves in the right direction and thereafter to keep silence and every baby in both bhamaniwallahs knew that hoof prints were not a legitimate subject for conversation all save nuttia and she as luck would have it was a herd girl they tried beating this sixth sense into her but it was no use and so whenever the silver fringed turban white cotton gloves and clanking sword of the native inspector of police were expected in the village they used to send the legacy away to the back of beyont right away to the luckimpura island maybe to reach which she had to hold on to the biggest buffalo's tail and thus with sirdar begum tied securely to its horns and her own little black head bobbing up and down in its wake cross the narrow stream after which the three would spread themselves out to dry on the hot sand nuttia took a great fancy to the island and many a time when she might have driven the herds to nearer pastures preferred the long low stretches of luckimpura where a flush of green lingered even in the droughts of april but even there on one very hot day scarcely a blade was to be found and nuttia careful of her beasts and noting the lowness of the river gathered them round her with the herdsman's cry and drove them to the further brink intending to take them across to a smaller island beyond to her surprise they stood knee deep in the water immovable impassive noses in air with long curled horns lying on their necks the legacy shaded her eyes to see more clearly nothing was to be seen but the swift shallow stream the level sand and gleams of water stretching away to the horizon something had frightened them but what she gave up the puzzle and with sirdar begum bolt upright before her sat on a snag dangling her feet over the stream for the sake of the cool air which seemed to rise from the river the buffaloes roamed restlessly about disturbed doubtless by the cloud of flies the sun beat down ineffectually on the doll's fuzzy head but it pierced nuttia's thick pate making her nod drowsily her voice recounting the thrilling adventures of brave bhopalutchi died away into a sigh of sleep so there was nothing left but the doll's wide unwinking eyes to keep watch over the world what was that something cold icy cold nuttia woke with a start one brown heel had touched the water she looked down at it then swiftly around her the buffaloes huddled by the ford had ceased to graze and a quiver of light greeted her glance at the purple horizon she sprang to her feet and breaking off a root from the snag held it to the dimpling water the next instant a scared face looked at the horizon once more the river was rising fast rising as she had never seen it rise before yet in past years she had witnessed many a flood floods that had swept away much of the arable land and driven the villagers to till new soil thrown up nearer the high bank ay and driven many of them to seek new homes beside the new fields until bhamaniwallah khurd had dwindled away to a few houses a very few and these on that hot april day deserted for the most part since all the able bodied men and women were away at the harvest even the herds had driven their cattle northwards hoping to come in for some of the lively bustle of the fields so there remained none save nuttia on the luckimpura island and mussumat jewun with her new baby and the old hag who nursed her in the reed huts all this came to the girl's memory as the long low cry of the herd rose on the hot air and with sirdar begum close clasped in her veil she drove the big buffalo moti into the stream how cold the water was cold as the snows from which it came the legacy had not lived in the lap of the river for so long without learning somewhat of its ways she knew of the frost bound sources whence it flowed and of the disastrous floods which follow beneath a cloudless sky on unusual heat or unusual rain in those mountain fastnesses the coming storm whose arch of cloud shimmering with sheet lightning had crept beyond the line of purple haze was nothing that was not the nightmare of the river folk she stood for a moment when dry land was reached hesitating whether to strike straight for the high bank or make for the village lying a mile distant some vague instinct of showing sirdar begum she was not afraid made her choose the latter course though most of the herd refused to follow her decision and broke away she collected her few remaining favourites and with cheerful cries plunged into the tamarisk jungle here shut out from sight save of the yielding bushes her thoughts went far afield what if the old nullah between the reed huts and the rising ground were to fill what if the low levels between that rising ground and the high bank were to flood and every one beyond in the yellow corn except mai jewun and people who did not count babies and old women and the crippled girl in the far hut only herself and sirdar begum to be brave for mai jewun was sick wake up wake up mai jewun the floods are out broke in on the new born baby's wail as nuttia's broad scared face shut out the sunlight from the door go away unlucky daughter of a bad mother grumbled jewun drowsily dost wish to cast thy evil eye on my heart's delight go i say yea go grumbled the old nurse cracking her fingers sure some devil possesseth thee to tell truth or lies at thy own pleasure but the crippled girl spinning in the far hut had heard the flying feet caught the excited cry and now crawling on her knees to the door threw up her hands and shrieked aloud the water stood ankle deep among the tamarisk roots and from its still pool tiny tongues licked their way along the dry sand the flood the flood the unavailing cry rang out as the women huddled together helplessly mai jewun there is time came the legacy's eager voice put the baby down and help i saw them do it at luckimpura that time they took the cattle over the deep stream and bahadur beat me for seeing it quick quick simple enough yet in its very simplicity lay their only chance of escape a string woven bed buoyed up with the bundles of reeds cut ready for re thatching and on this frail raft four people nay five for first of all with jealous care nuttia placed her beloved sirdar begum in safety wrapping her up in the clothes she discarded in favour of free nakedness quick quick if the rising ground is to be gained and the levels beyond forded ere the water is too deep moti and a companion yoked by plough ropes to the bed wade knee deep hock deep into the stream and now with the old cheerful cry nuttia clinging to their tails and so guiding them urges the beasts deeper still the stream swirls past holding them with it though they breast it bravely a log long stranded in some shallow dances past shaving the raft by an inch then an alligator swept from its moorings and casting eyes on nuttia's brown legs makes the beasts plunge madly a rope breaks the churned water sweeps over the women the end is near when another frantic struggle leaves moti alone to her task the high childish voice calling on her favourite's courage rises again and again but the others cowed into silence clutch together with hid faces till a fresh plunge loosens their tongues once more it is moti finding foothold and they are safe so far quick mai jewun cries nuttia as her companions stand looking fearfully over the waste of shallows before them she knows from the narrowness of the ridge they have reached that time is precious we must wade while we can saving moti for the streams take up the baby and i her hands busy on the bed stilled themselves her face grew grey she turned on them like a fury sirdar begum i put her there where is sirdar begum that bed leg shrilled the mother tucking up her petticoats for greater freedom there was no room and heart's delight was cold bah wood floats hull lal lal a lalla la the herdsman's cry was the only answer moti has faced the flood again but this time with a light load for the baby nestling amid nuttia's clothes is the only occupant of the frail raft my son my son light of mine eyes core of my heart come back come back but the little black head drifting down stream behind the big one never turned from its set purpose wood floated and so might babies why not why not indeed but as a matter of fact mai jewun was right a dilapidated bed leg was picked up on a sand bank miles away when the floods subsided and moti joined the herd next day to chew the cud of her reflections contentedly but the village legacy and heart's delight remained somewhere seeking for something that something doubtless which had turned the bed leg into sirdar
