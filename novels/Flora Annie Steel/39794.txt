a history it is the life story of a man taken from his own memoirs tinker tailor soldier sailor gentleman apothecary ploughboy thief so runs the jingle the hero of this book might have claimed as many personalities in himself for zahir ud din mahomed commonly called babar emperor of india the first of the dynasty which we mis name the great moghuls was at one and the same time poet painter soldier athlete gentleman musician beggar and king he lived the most adventurous life a man ever lived in the end of the fifteenth the beginning of the sixteenth centuries and he kept a record of it on this record i have worked reading between the lines often at times supplying details that must have occurred doing my best to present without flaw the lovable versatile volatile soul which wrote down its virtues and its vices its successes and its failures with equally unsparing truth and equally invariable sense of honour and humour the incident of the crystal bowl and the details of babar's subsequent marriage to maham the woman who was to be to him what ayesha was to mahomed are purely imaginary i found it necessary to supply some explanation of the curious coincidence in time of this undoubted marriage with the pitifully brief romance of little cousin ma'asuma for babar was above all things affectionate i trust my imagining fits in with the general tone of my hero's life if not he will forgive me i am sure he forgave so many in life that he will not grudge forgiveness in death to his most ardent admirer f a steel contents book i seed time to book ii blossom time to book iii fruit time to book i seed time to king errant chapter i for i know how far high failure overleaps the bounds of low successes lewis morris the fortified town of andijan lay hot in the spring sunshine outside the citadel in the clover meadows which stretched from its gate to the black river a tributary to the swift jaxartes which flows through the kingdom of ferghana a group of boys and men were playing leap frog an ushruffi he falls cried one watching the leaper a dirrhm he doesn't retorted another who had a broad frank good natured face there he's done i said so continued the first not without satisfaction for he was rival for championship not he asserted the second gleefully as the stumble was overborne by an extra effort trust him and his luck he wins babar wins and nevian foster brother's voice was the loudest in acclaim as the frog like figure with wide spread legs after successfully backing the long row of bent slaves arranged with due regard to difficulty adown the meadow path finally overtopped the last and with a hull lul la la of triumph subsided incontinently into the white clover and there it lay on its back gazing at the blue sky cheerfully it was that of rather a lanky boy to western eyes a well grown one of at least fifteen with a promise of six feet and more of manhood in its long loose jointed limbs but babar heir apparent to this little kingdom of ferghana was only in his twelfth year his face nevertheless was extraordinarily intent with an intentness beyond his years as he lay silent among the clover for something had come between him and his game between him and the work a day world something that came to him often with the sight of a wide stretch of blue sky a narrow stretch of blue river or even with the sight of a flower upon that river's brim how glorious how splendid it was this world in which he forsooth played leap frog the clover on which he lay how sweet it smelt how soft it was it was just like a mantle of lambskin covered as it was till you could hardly see a speck of green with its white furry blobs of blossom a lambskin mantle that was a good description and the sky was like the turquoises that folk brought down from the higher hills in the summer when they were not weaving the purple cloth which somehow always got mixed up in his mind with the pale blue why both recalled the multi coloured tulips on the mountain slopes was a puzzle except that one beauty recalled another at that rate however memory in ferghana would be unending for though it was as everyone knew situated on the extreme boundary of the habitable world it was abundantly pleasant the lad's amber tinted hazel eyes darkened as he ran over in his mind the excellencies of his native valley hidden away at the back of the pamirs its snow clad hills clipping it on all sides save the west its running streams its violets so sweet but not piercing sweet like a rose its profusion of fruits truly that way they had over in the township of marghinan of removing apricot stones and putting in chopped almonds instead was excellent indeed most mighty came a voice breaking in on his thoughts there is news bad news the voice was breathless yet full of concern and babar sprang to his feet alert in a second a messenger stood before him one who had come far and fast and in his hand was a blue kerchief therefore he was a messenger of death death incredible in this splendid joyful world a sudden surge of resentful life blood seemed to stop the boyish heart with its tumultuous claim for free passage well he asked thickly the answer came like a blow dully yet with stunning force your father o king his father and he babar was king in the rush of realisation incredulity came uppermost but how he stood there bare headed unbelieving while the others crowded round to listen it was a simple enough tragedy omar shaikh his father had been feeding his tumbler pigeons on the scarp of a precipice which overhung the steep ravine below the fort at akhsi he had been watching them against the blue void throwing golden grain to make them play their antics when the ground had given way beneath his feet and he had been precipitated on to the river rocks beneath that was all the little group of listeners showed shocked faces but babar even as he heard the tale with dismayed grief seemed to see the fluttering white wings of the startled pigeons to see the startled soul amongst them taking its flight whitherwards gone never to be seen again yet how clearly he saw him now short stout a bushy beard hiding a humorous mouth the turban without folds and with such long ends the tunic all over tight how often the strings had burst and how angry he had been at consequent childish gigglings a sudden spasm of remorse for idle thoughts sent the son's memory back to his father's kindness a good sportsman too though but a poor shot with the bow still with uncommon force in his fists everyone he had ever hit had gone down before father's the last word brought memory of a still dearer tie my mother asked the boy swiftly my mother how then the real meaning of what he had heard came to him he gave a little short sharp cry and cast himself face downwards on the sweet smelling white clover and all the joy of splendid life passed from him nevian foster brother who worshipped him went over to him and crouched beside him it is god's will sire he mumbled mechanically kwaja kazi says so and kwaja kazi is a saint but saintship did not interest that young human heart face to face for the first time with the deprivation of death meanwhile those others the bearded nobles and broad faced courtiers who had crowded out at the news looked at each other in doubt what had best be done the times were troublous their new king was over young the king of samarkand the king of tashkend his paternal uncles were already on the war path the former almost within striking distance and this news of death would hasten not retard in such case might not refuge in the hills be wise at any rate till kasim beg most faithful of governors and hassan yakoob wiliest of advisers could be recalled from the front but while they still cogitated babar who even at that age was not to be handled rose suddenly the tear stains still on his sun tanned cheeks his voice however was firm to horse gentlemen he cried i go to secure my kingdom he was on his lean necked goose rumped turkhestan mare zulaikha almost before the words passed his lips and ere two minutes had sped the low arched gateway of the city echoed and re echoed to the hoofs of horses as the riders low bowed upon their saddles they swept through in a stream of tails and tassels so had it echoed many a time to the wild turkhoman cavalry since life in those days was one long war and rumour of war my king said shiram taghai spurring close as barbar drew rein on the citadel terrace and laying a detaining hand on his bridle that way lies death thine uncles mean evil come with us to the hills for an instant the boy hesitated and his eyes sought the distant blue of the mountains there doubtless lay safety but what of that unknown quantity kingship he had no ideals of it he had not even been brought up to expect the chiefship in those days succession was too uncertain for anticipation but it was something now within his grasp what if he lost it still the faces around him were anxious and their owners were old they had experience and he was so young how young none knew but himself as this thought came he felt inclined to cry out loud for his mother as in his heart he was crying for her loving care then from the citadel came a running messenger to bid him enter without fear it is a trick sire protested shiram taghai safety lies with us and others echoed his words so the lad wavered uncertain till an old man seated in the sunshine mumbling to himself his long white beard wagging the while spoke chance words that gave him the clue whatever happens is god's will as the saints say five minutes afterwards the young king knelt before khwaja kazi the saint of his family for his decision he was a thin ascetic looking man whose sunken eyes hollowed by many fasts hardened by much thought but softened by the unshed tears of a lonely life dipped critically into the clear shadowless youth of the hazel ones and appraised the character of the young face with its fine lipped mouth that tempered the strong square of the chin and khwaja kazi knew the inside of the boy as well he had watched him from birth and lawyer and judge by profession had accurately gauged the volatile versatile vitality which would carry him triumphantly over all the obstacles in the leap frog race of life but he saw the dangers ahead also and he loved the lad as his own soul as indeed despite all his faults most people did love babar in fortune and misfortune in sickness and in health and the keen observer noticed how firmly the young hand closed over his scimitar hilt it was enough for one accustomed to weigh evidence and give verdicts draw thy sword my son and stand firm the decree fell on glad ears the boy was on his feet in a second and the war shout of his race rang through the smoke grimed old hall kingship lay before him as yet however the tragedy of death clouded his outlook his dead father awaited burial at akshi thirty miles distant but ere he could start thitherwards many arrangements and new appointments had to be made the novelty of power carried him far from thought it was dream like to be giving orders when but an hour before he had existed solely by the pleasure and permission of his father as every other son in moghulistan lived in those quaint old days it was dark therefore ere he and his galloping party stumbled over the stone causeways leading up to the high perched citadel at akshi too late to disturb the women folk who outworn by wailing had gone to rest but a little knot of long robed physicians showed him the dead body of his father lying ready for the funeral on an open bier in the audience hall babar had often seen death before but never in this guise with watchers and flaring torches and all the insignia of chiefship discarded before the poor deserted shell of power it impressed his emotional nature vividly and the mystery and the pity of it went with him to the dim royal room so rough in its ancient royalty where his father had been wont to sleep and where the very touch of the royal quilts surcharged with the personality of the cold dead in whose place he lived seemed to burn in upon his young body and keep it awake not with concern or regret for things past but with keen curiosity as to what was going to happen in the future to one zahir ud din mahomed commonly called babar lineal descendant of timur the earth trembler also of the great barbarian ghengis khan was he to follow in their footsteps of conquest or would he be snuffed out at once by uncle ahmed of samarkand wherefore god knew since he babar had never done his uncle any harm on the contrary if he lived he would have to marry that uncle's daughter ayesha here his vagrant thoughts wandered to remembrance of how sick he had been from overeating himself on sweets at the betrothal ceremonies that was his very earliest real recollection when he was five years old then there was uncle mahmud of tashkend even in the dark the boy's cheek flushed at the mere remembrance of him equally devoid of courage and modesty of unbelieving disposition keeping buffoons and scoundrels about him who enacted their scurvy and disgraceful tricks in the very face of the court and even at public audiences of no outward appearance either but all rough hewn and speaking very ill the lad always unsparing of epithet painted the portrait with remorseless hand so his thoughts passed to mahmud's sons his first cousins he knew them well but masaud the eldest was a nincompoop and as for baisanghar what was there that jarred at times in baisanghar baisanghar who was so charming so elegant so clever so sweet tempered here the lad's mind passed swiftly without conscious cause to his own sister dearest one as he always called her for he was given to caressing nicknames for those he loved and he loved none better than the tall straight girl five years his senior who hectored him and petted him by turns but she ought really to get married it was nonsense to say you preferred being a sainted canoness baisanghar did not say that though he too refused to marry he said women were unnecessary evils was that true not that it mattered since he babar would have to marry because he was king king would it make him happier he wondered could anyone be happier than he had been in this splendid world supposing it was to make him unhappy supposing it took the charm from life the idle thoughts went on and on he felt sleepy yet he could not sleep and by and by the glimmering oblong of the unglazed window kept him watching the slow growth of light out on the hills the still dawn must be stepping softly so as not to waken the world too soon soft sandalled feet among the snow set flowers the mere thought of it was sufficient to rouse him thoroughly he rose passed to the window and thrust his young body into the chill air of dawn all shadow a deeper shadow in the valley a lighter shadow in the encircling hills and above it all the clear grey pellucid shadow of the sky hark that was the dawn cry of the wild fowl on the marsh and he held his breath to listen like the young narcissus while the whole joy of splendid life seemed to fill his world once more he did not realise few humans do that he was but listening for the echo of himself the self which came back to him from sights and sounds that many a better man might have seen and heard unmoved so he waited and watched till the eastern sky showed pale primrose and the unseen sun encarnadined the distant snows and separated the white morning mists from the blue shadows of the hills it was a new day and yonder over the brow of the road were pennons and lance points the tribesmen were coming to bury the dead to do homage to the living it was a busy day filled up with long drawn intricate ceremonial bare time for more than one tight clasp of tearless mother and tearless son while that dearest one his sister stood by silent the tear stains still on her cheeks but that did not matter those three understood each other and old isan daulet his maternal grandmother had set emotion aside also and stern old disciplinarian as she was had bidden him in high staccato phrases which betrayed her effort to keep calm take his father's place as bravely as he could and he did what he could though it was a strain upon his twelve young years for the long night had left him feverish and the long day with its need for initiative had outwearied him so that when at last the ordeal was over and he was free to seek the women's apartments for rest his nerves were all a rack his pulse fast and irregular he found his grandmother alone by the big coal fire mother and sister outwearied also had gone to bed the best place the old lady said oracularly for sore eyes and broken hearts and babar felt it was better so the company of the stern featured soft hearted old woman of whose sagacity and clear sightedness he stood somewhat in awe would be more bracing than the tears which must come sooner or later people said he was like his grandmother was he he wondered as he lay prone on the sheepskin rug watching the firelight on her fine old face tell me he said suddenly the tale of thy youth of jaimal and the lover who was slain but isan daulet though she smiled shook her wise old head nay child such tales do to stir phlegm they are not meet when the humours are already disturbed the boy leaned over on his elbows and looked up at her like cures like by comparison 'twould steady my pulse to know others throbbed feel mine grandam how it beats she took the thin muscular wrist held out to her and appraised it judicially i will give thee a purge the morrow's morn she said shortly that will keep thy head cooler than idle tales there is nothing for hot boy's blood like a purge babar's face showed obstinate yet whimsical i will not take it nanni if thou wilt not tell so there and kings are not to be coerced see you by black draughts as mere boys are and 'tis the first boon i have asked from thee as i am the ring of almost apprehension in the last words was too much for the old woman who loved the lad as the apple of her eye she laid her hand caressingly on the boy's hair it was cut florentine fashion to the ears and the ends outsweeping in a gentle curve were sun burned browner than the rest of the dark head it is little to tell sweetheart save that it shows how even womanhood may confound strength by being resolute it was not many years after my lord your grandfather married me in my father the khan's tents upon the steppes he was a bold brave man was my lord and like all bold brave ones he fought sometimes and won and sometimes he fought and lost 'no battle is ended save by death' remember that o zahir ud din mahomed and once when he lost his women i was one fell into the hands of jaimal shaikh his enemy and he low bred hound who knew not the first principles of politeness did not even keep me for himself i was not ill looking in those days my child but sent me to his officer i the wife of yunus khan chagatai of the house of timur the earth trembler well the fool came decked as for a bridal with blandishments and perfumes and i welcomed him wherefore not for the supper was good and he played on the lute passably but when that was over and we withdrew smiling to the inner room my maids locked the door by my orders stabbed the silly rake to death and flung his be scented body through the window to the gutter 'twas its proper place the old voice which had gained strength and fire in the recital dropped to cold hard finality and jaimal shaikh queried babar unwilling to lose a word he sent for me and i went 'why hast thou done this evil thing' he asked 'because thou didst worse' i answered 'because thou sentest me the wife of a living man to another's embrace therefore i slew him slay me also if so it pleases thee' but it did not please him 'take her to her husband's prison' he said 'and leave her there they are one flesh indeed' so i stopped with thy grandfather and comforted him until his star rose again now get thee to thy bed child and see thou take the draught without demur remember 'god is no maker of the promise breaker' 'twill make thee feel sick doubtless but what matter if the result be good babar made a wry face and laughed thou hast done me more good with thy tale revered one lo i can see thy would be lover in the gutter and my esteemed grandmother all beautiful as a bride peeking through the lattice for a glimpse of his corpse go to thy bed child put in the old lady delighted there be more than pictures for thy sight now so may the great maker of kings guard thee his creature and that night zahir ud din mahomed commonly called babar forgot that he was king in sound dreamless boyish sleep chapter ii there's a sweet little cherub who sits up aloft to keep watch for the life of poor jack in truth babar needed such a cherub in the first days of his king ship for kasim and hussan his two advisers fell foul of one another the former bluff honest facetious a pious faithful religious moslem who carefully abstained from forbidden meats and drinks and whose judgment and talents were uncommonly good though he could neither read nor write was for the forward policy hussan polished active a man of courage who wrote excellent verses and was remarkable for his skill in playing polo and leap frog was for diplomacy and against these latter qualifications even honest kasim's ingenuous and elegant vein of wit could not stand at least in young babar's judgment old isan daulet his grandmother was however of a different opinion and even dearest one his sister ventured to rally him gently on his choice of prime minister what asked babar hotly in reply is hussan the worse for playing games is a man the worse for doing all things well nay but rather the better so be it that they be men's things she replied going on imperturbably with the embroidery of a new pennon for her brother it was green and violet his favourite colours and she was scrolling a text on it in crinkled gold as she sat in the sunshine on the flat roof of the citadel her bare head gleaming brown in the glare of light her mourning garment of dark blue short in the sleeves and low at the neck showing her wheat coloured skin she was a pretty creature though her nose was too long her chin too short for real beauty that lay in her eyes amber tinted like her brother's man's things what be man's things argued babar irritably is cousin baisanghar no man because he could help thee embroider two years agone the princess held her head very high it was not nice of her brother to import strange young men into the conversation and distinctly mean of him to mention that old breach of etiquette had she not heard enough of it from her mother ever since luckily grandam isan daulet being desert born had not been so shocked or life would have been unendurable and as for baisanghar everyone knew he was not at all a proper young man though he was so charming so sweet tempered so lo brother she said with asperity checking her vagrant thoughts if one fool shook a baby's rattle better than another he would be wise man to thee but 'tis not i only who find leap frog hussan a smooth tongued hypocrite grandmother has her eye on him then can no harm happen said the boy king cheerfully rising however with suspicious alacrity as if to escape from the subject in truth he was somewhat afraid of old isan daulet though he tried to minimise his awe by asserting that very few of her sex could equal her in sagacity events however had marched with great rapidity and sultan ahmed his uncle was now with his army but sixteen miles from andijan so something must be settled kasim was for defiance and defence hussan for diplomatic and dutiful submission since the king of samarkand was ever indubitably suzerain lord of ferghana words against works quoth honest kasim who loved to be epigrammatic his experience told him that if you fought fair you failed at times but in the end you came out top dog in the general scrimmage of claims and clans nay retorted hussan i desire diplomacy not dare devil disregard of common precautions babar however frowned at both as he sat listening to the council of war or peace he favoured neither pugnacity nor deceit look you gentlemen he said frowning all admit my uncle ahmed to be a fool whom fools lead by the nose but is that cause why i should treat him foolishly and so disgrace myself i will neither fight nor yield till i have made him understand how the matter lies so let a scribe be brought and i will indite him a letter no letter ever did any good grumbled illiterate kasim especially if it be not received nor read suggested hussan sardonically the king of samarkand is supreme and may refuse aught but a personal interview kasim shot furious glances such talk savoured to him of treason but babar only looked gravely from one adviser to the other so be it he said cheerfully if he refuse reception or understanding then if so it pleases god i can defeat him at my leisure meanwhile write thus o scribe with all proper titles compliments and reverences 'i zahir ud din mahomed babar rightful heir and by acclaim underline that scribe of this kingdom of ferghana do with courtesy and reasonableness point out that it is plain that if you take this country you must place one of your servants in charge of it since you reign at samarkand now i am at once your servant and your son also i have a hereditary right to the government if therefore you entrust me with this employment your purpose will be attained in a far more easy and satisfactory way than by fighting and killing a number of people and horses needlessly wherefore i remain your loyal feudatory zahir ud din mahomed babar' he beamed round on the council for approval of this logical argument then added hastily and scrivener put 'zahir ud din mahomed babar' large and 'king of ferghana' larger still at the very end that will show him my intentions if it did the effect was poor for though the letter was duly engrossed on silk paper sprinkled with rose essence and gold dust enclosed in a brocade bag and sent to the invading camp at kaba the only answer to its irrefutable logic was a further advance of spear points and pennons to within four miles of the citadel kasim was jubilant jocose and bellicose he routed out armouries for catapults and kept long files of men busy in passing up stones from the river bed while forage parties raided the bazaars for provisions if there was to be a defence it must be the longest on record even if it were unsuccessful in the end babar himself donned mail and corselet for the first time but he discarded the latter soon it made him he said feel like a trussed pheasant and he preferred the wadded coatee which would turn most scimitar cuts it made him look burly as he strode round the ramparts so that the sentries smiled to themselves and felt a glow at the heart remembering how young he was the stoutness resolution and unanimity of his soldiers and subjects to fight to the last drop of their blood the last gasp of their life without yielding filled the boy with unmixed admiration it was part of the general splendidness of things which almost dazzled him my younger troops display distinguished courage he said gravely and kasim hid a smile with difficulty as he replied they have youth in their favour most excellent it is a great gift then he went out and roared over the joke on the ramparts to the sentries' huge delight when next the young king went his rounds smiles greeted him everywhere he was a king to be proud of and his family was worth fighting for all of them especially the tall slim figure with close drawn veil which would often accompany the king at dusk for dearest one was keenly interested in things militant and was free to come and go as the turkhi women were with due restrictions and these were few in babar's clan which as grandmother isan daulet would boast was desert born but after all the preparations were unnecessary the little cherub intervened rather to the boy's chagrin though he admitted piously that providence in its perfect power and wisdom had brought certain events to pass which frustrated the enemies' designs and made them return whence they came without success and heartily repenting them of their attempt an exceedingly satisfactory but at the same time a disappointing end to his first chance of a real fine fight and he watched one reverse after another overtake his foes on the other side of the black river with almost sympathetic eyes there is a murrain amongst their horses now reported the chief farrier one day my sister's son who is in service with the samarkandis crept over last night to beg condiments for prince baisanghar's charger which is down the same that the most excellent gave him three years agone baisanghar echoed babar hurriedly i knew not that he was amongst mine enemies then he paused and reason came to him likely he is with his father of tashkend who hovers on the edge of invasion and hath ridden over there is no harm in that what didst give the fellow the farrier laughed a flea in his ear most clement a likely story indeed that i should help our enemies babar frowned and turned away 'twas a good horse poor beast he murmured and afterwards he went over to the women's quarters and as his wont was retailed the story to those three isan daulet his mother and dearest one the grim old turkhoman lady was sympathetic about the horses as a daughter of the steppes must needs be but stern over the necessities of war his mother more soft hearted than ever by reason of her mourning wept silently but dearest one was as ever a joy i would bastinado the farrier she said vindictively the poor brute and then think of cousin baisanghar he loved the horse her beautiful eyes flashed and yet were melting her long brown fingers gripped her embroidery closer yet more caressingly her brother sate and looked at her admiringly yet with a certain diffidence sometimes dearest one went beyond him she seemed to unfold wings and skim away into another world and when he asked her whither she went she would smile mysteriously and say thou wilt unfold thy wings also some day o little big one and find a new world for thyself there was little leisure now however for aught but watch and ward any moment of the day or night might bring assault but the days passed and none came and then one morning broke and showed a smaller camp than had been on the low lying river bank the night before there was a bustle too about the still standing tent pegs and with the first glint of sunlight one dervish mahomed turkhau rode over the narrow bridge and demanded on the part of his master an audience with hussan old kasim looked daggers but there was no objecting by virtue of his position as prime minister hussan was the man to go and he went so out in the place of festivals beyond the gates they met and parleyed thus patching up a sort of peace as babar reported contemptuously to his faithful three he was intensely disgusted and disappointed while kasim looked sorrowfully at his piles of stones they will do for next time he said finally cheering himself up with the remembrance that there were many other claimants to the throne of ferghana to be reckoned with besides sultan ahmed and by evening most of the garrison had found solace for their disappointment in overeating themselves after the disciplined rations which kasim beg mindful of the possibility of a long siege had already ordained but babar and his foster brother nevian were out all day on their little turkhoman horses chasing the white deer and shooting with their bows and arrows at a cock pheasant or two they brought home one in the evening which as the boy boasted was so fat that four men could have dined on the stew of it 'twill do for our dinner anyhow said babar's mother and thereinafter she and isan daulet bullied cooks and scullions and gently quarrelled with each other for a good two hours over the proper family recipe for making ishkanah and afterwards they sat together in an arched sort of balcony vestibule between the women's apartments and the men's rooms and talked happily yet soberly of the future old isan daulet indeed waxed prophetic see you my sons in law will come to harm not good ahmed has had to renounce his evil desires mahmud will have to do the same and let them pray god he send not punishment also and she pursed up her thin lips and looked as if she knew something but the khanum babar's mother said little her heart was still sad and she crept away early to her bed followed after awhile by isan daulet leaving stern injunctions on dearest one not to sit up over long so brother and sister were left alone and she went and sat beside him as he dangled his legs over the parapet of the balcony for he dearly loved looking down from a height it was to be a dark night so he could see little even of the roofs below or the slabs of stone let into the wall at intervals to form a sort of ladder by which a bold man could climb from one to the other and beyond all was shadow darker in some places than others besprinkled too with stars the moving star or two of a lantern in the earth shadow but in the sky those changeless changeful beacons those twinkling tireless stars motionless in their constellations yet ever moving on and on round what look he cried suddenly the scimitar of the warrior is sheathed in the hills my hills and it was so orion shone to the north setting slowly behind the mighty rampart of shadowed mountains in which the starry sword was already hidden they sat silent for a little while hand in hand like the children that they were and then suddenly a noise below them made babar swing his legs to the ground and stand firm before his sister who goes he asked and his voice rang through the darkness but no answer came 'twas a falling stone methinks said his sister carelessly yet even as she spoke she also sprang to her feet every atom of her soul and body alert for something she scarce knew what she knew however in a second for a darker shadow showed vaguely at the end of the balcony vaulted lightly over the parapet and a pleasant voice said gaily mirza baisanghar of the house of timur cousin to the king of ferghana at your service baisanghar echoed babar how camest thou then even in his confusion remembering as he generally did les convenances for others he added thou hadst best retire my sister after making thy appropriate salutation so for one second the girl's eyes straining through the starlight could see her cousin a charming figure truly not dressed like her brother in country clothes but in the silks and satins of the town a dainty figure too of middle height and slender make yet manly withal the round face unlike the faces of his cousins showing turkhoman descent unmistakably yet with such indescribable attractiveness may the peace of the most high be upon you my cousin she said softly and her voice fluttered and may his peace remain with you fair lady he replied gravely with the finest of court salutes that was all then she withdrew and the shadows hid her going by my soul baisanghar said babar joyously when he had seated himself and his cousin side by side among the cushions i am utterly rejoiced to see thee again though how or wherefore thou camest prince baisanghar interrupted him with a light laugh how sayest thou by the roof of course have i not been in andijan before and did i not once climb hitherwards but of that no more only thou wilt have to set thy masons to work coz for by god's truth my foothold was but rotten more than once sure i must be born to the bowstring since sudden death will not have me elseways yet of all seriousness i came nigh to being dashed to pieces and as for wherefore sure i came in duty bound to thank my kingly cousin for his courteous gift of horse medicine aye and for my horse too for the second time since thanks to the drugs he is alive and kicking babar sat back horse medicines he echoed what horse medicine i sent thee none baisanghar turned his head instantly to the darkness and his voice rose perceptibly yet it came from thee my cousin he replied blandly with thy salutations in a packet of silken paper such as ladies use for their trinkets and tied with crinkled gold thread such as ladies use yea it was i mirza baisanghar came a voice from the darkness a voice clear unabashed i sent it i the princess royal so there is no need for fine wit to beat about the bush i sent it because because my brother the king gave thee the horse and i was loth loth it should die the voice trailed away faintly and mirza baisanghar's eyes brimmed over with soft mirth while babar forgetful of all save outraged etiquette said sternly sister and i told thee to go and i went retorted the voice rebelliously so far as eyesight goes none can see me and 'tis the woman's right to listen prince baisanghar laughed aloud by the prophet she speaks truth coz ladies have the law of listening all over the world aye and of speaking too so let be since we are cousins and free born chagatai of the house of ghengis but babar stickled aye we are but thou art not not on thy mother's side my mother echoed baisanghar his voice full of amusement lo i admit it on my mother's side i am beyond salvation being of the wild horde of black sheep for which may god forgive me since 'tis not my fault i was not born a white lamb he named the two great divisions of his turkhoman ancestry with infinite zest then went on lightly but i fail of myself in other ways many of them i made an ode concerning it a while past that sets baisanghar black sheep prince forth to a nicety and he began airily to hum a tune sing it to us cousin came that sweet voice from the darkness there was a moment of silence as if the hearer were startled perhaps touched then came the almost stiff reply my fair cousin is too kind the ode as verse is nothing worth and its subject is beyond belief bad still since she is princess royal and i am but her slave the order is obeyed so through the night and out into the stars his high tenor voice rose and trilled in minor quavers illustration music notes for first and third stanzas some times with pi ous ness i crawl to wards high heav'n on whit ed wall back to the dust and dirt i fly where un sub stan tial shad ows lie illustration music notes for second stanza or rest a while on tree or flow'r and dream but on ly for an hour the quavers ceased and there was silence from the darkness but babar's boyish voice rose cheerful as ever 'tis good cousin and in a measure true yet need it not be so surely thou hast no lack of parts who is more accomplished of more pleasant disposition or more charming manners i came not hitherto to be catalogued for sale interrupted baisanghar curtly of a truth i am admirable i sing i dance i paint yea i paint uncommon i could paint one fair lady's portrait could i but see her still there was silence from the shadows and a frown came to the laughter loving face but i waste time he continued and i have much to say for thine ear alone he spoke to the darkness and he waited his face softening while a whispering sound as of light departing feet rose for a space then died away in the distance it was a good half hour afterwards that mirza baisanghar who knew his way well about the palace at andijan came with buoyant step down the spiral stairs which ended in a narrow vaulted passage that led to the sally port his cousin from whom he had parted most affectionately had given him the pass word so secure from molestation he was carelessly humming the refrain of his own ode back to the dirt and dust i fly where unsubstantial shadows lie the light hearted cynical words echoed along the arches and on them rose a curious sound half cry half sob followed by a torrent of hot denial it is a lie it is not true and thou knowest it why shouldest thou say such things of thyself o baisanghar they they hurt the young man stood still as if turned to stone dearest one he whispered at last using the familiar name he was accustomed to hear dost really care so much and i he paused and a mirthless laugh rang false upon the darkness princess i cannot even thank thee i i dare not save for the horse medicines here the artificial note left his voice and with a sudden cry if i could if i could beloved his eager hands went out and found what they sought a lithe warm young body ready to his arms but almost ere he clasped it he thrust it from him roughly go he said briefly go girl and forget me if thou canst yet remember this if ever woman's lips touch mine they would be yours but that will be never never the next instant he was gone dearest one stood straining her eyes unavailingly into the darkness for a space then she cowered down in on herself and sat shivering her wide eyes open fixed but there was nothing to be seen in her heaven or earth nothing to be realised save that he would not even touch her chapter iii draw near o man and lift thy dreamy eyes see this the ball this the arena too where mounted on the steed of love the prize is to be won by him who god in view strikes skilfully the goal is distant narrow too the field yet strike with freedom god will send the ball thy hand as sped in faith where it should fall backwards and forward strike and if thou yield yield cheerfully grandmother isan daulet proved true prophet ere forty days had passed from that patched up peace another hasty messenger bearing a blue 'kerchief of death had arrived at akshi whither the court had gone to celebrate the late king's obsequies ahmed the king of samarkand had been seized with a burning fever and after six days had departed from this transitory world babar was sorry his uncle he said had been better than most a plain honest turk not favoured by genius who had never omitted the five daily prayers except when honestly drunk and that was but seldom seeing that when he did take to drinking wine he drank without intermission for a month or six weeks at a stretch and thereinafter would be sober for a considerable time so there had always been periods for piety the womenkind wept of course for blood feuds enhanced blood relationships when death the peace bringer stepped in between the combatants besides mourning was already afoot so they could kill two birds with one stone even fatima begum the late king's first wife who losing her premier position through childlessness had retreated in a huff to a separate establishment joined in the chorus of wailing and she brought her belated son jahangir nigh three years younger than babar to take his rightful place in the palace much to old isan daulet's indignation set her up indeed she said with a toss of her head her and her belated brat mark my words had the child been lawful 'twould have come betimes but when 'tis hoighty toighty and a separate house only god knows to what an honest man may be made father still the function was a function and the ladies enjoyed all the ceremonies for they were simple folk content with little and that little rough and rude for all they were queens and princesses babar however wearied of all save the giving of victuals to the poor he loved to see joy at a portion of pillau and butter cakes indeed he surreptitiously ordered more sugar for the children's thick milk it made him feel hungry he said to see them eat it and there was no better enjoyment in the world than real hunger provided always that food was in prospect for he was tender hearted over frail humanity he could not see for instance why the black eyed princess his father's last and low born wife who was of course quite beyond the circle of distinction should not be allowed if it pleased her to discover a roundabout relationship to the family of timur it did not alter facts but isan daulet sniffed 'twill not alter her manners or her speech anyhow though 'tis true in a way we be all descended from adam as i tell her morn noon and night so babar had to listen to the black eyed one's wails which he did in kindly kingly fashion for he liked the good natured stupid pretty creature he had however other things to think of his uncle ahmed's death had vaguely disturbed him for uncle ahmed left no male heirs and the question of succession was a burning one since by all the laws of moghulistan babar had a double claim to the throne through his maternal grandfather yunus khan of a surety he said to dearest one who was ever confidante of his ambitions and innermost thoughts there is no doubt that now uncle mahmud as brother succeeds of right but at his death cousin masaud and cousin baisanghar are not so close to yunus khan as i then masaud is a nincompoop and baisanghar he paused well what of cousin baisanghar asked the girl hotly babar whittled away with his knife at the arrow he was making for he was ever useful with his hands ere he replied slowly baisanghar will never make a king wherefore i know not but there it is he is not fit for it dearest one was aflame in a second not fit for it she echoed that is not true he is as fit for it really as as thou art brother only he will belittle himself he will talk of himself as a shadow an unsubstantial shadow it is not true it is not right it is not fair and so i told him the other night babar put down his knife and stared thou didst tell him so but when dearest one hung her head though a faint smile showed on her face she had given herself away but she was not in the least afraid of her brother many youngsters of his age might from their own experiences in love affairs have been seriously disturbed at the idea of their sister speaking to a young man on a dark stair but babar was an innocent child to him it would be but a slight breach of decorum yet something made her breath short as she replied coolly i met him on the stairs it was dark so he could not see me brother and i spoke to him as as a mother to her son the head went down a little more over the last words true as they were in one sense she knew better in her heart of hearts and he what said he asked babar alertly taking his sister completely by surprise with the memory of that cry beloved beloved in her mind it had lingered there day and night she faltered dearest one said the boy grave open eyed after a pause did he kiss thee the girl looked up indignantly a dark flush under her wheat coloured skin kiss me she echoed he did not even really touch me and then suddenly she hid her face in her hands and burst into tears true he had not touched her he had shrunk from her eager body why oh why babar was full of concern he laid down his knife and arrow and went over to his sister then there is nothing to weep about see you he said stoutly save lack of manners and for that thou art sorry is it not so dearest the girl's sobs changed to a half hysterical giggle so sorry she assented and thou wilt not tell grandmother the prophet forbid cried her brother aghast i should never hear the last of it and dearest one's tears changed to real laughter brother she cried thou art the dearest darling of all i would do aught in the whole world for thee nay replied babar gravely that will i never ask of thee my womenkind shall have no task to do that my hands cannot compass alone he felt virtuous as he spoke rather uplifted too by that same virtue he did not know what fate held in store for him he did not dream that he would have to ask of her the greatest sacrifice a woman can make and that she would make it willingly meanwhile it was gorgeous summer tide and hussan played forward in the king's game of polo down in the river meadows he was the best of forwards the best of men consequently to the boy king thou art a young fool child said old isan daulet who never minced her words as thou wilt surely find out ere long unless god made thee stupid blind luckily mine eyes are open so go thy way and knock balls about after the manner of men thus it was early autumn ere babar's eyes opened but then what he saw made his young blood surge through him from head to foot the meanness the deceit of it to conspire with the ambassador from wicked uncle mahmud at samarkand who had come ostensibly to present an offering of silver almonds and golden pistachio nuts to depose him babar and put the brat jahangir on the throne and all the while to be playing forward in the king's game it was too much it was not fair it was emphatically not the game throw away bad butter while it's melted said isan daulet firmly send kasim beg and other trustworthy friends to strangle him with a bow string then wilt thou be quit of such devils' spawn but babar was a sportsman even if it came to killing the forward in the king's game he was not going to do it underhand so he looked round the assembly of loyalists who had met to convince him in his grandmother's apartments in the stone fort and said briefly to horse gentlemen i go to dismiss my prime minister from his appointment but that gentleman had already dismissed himself when they arrived at the citadel they found he had gone hunting and from that expedition he never returned someone must have blabbed for he had posted off to samarkand rather to the boy king's relief it would have been a terrible thing to imprison or blind the best forward in the kingdom and even when news came that the offender had paused by the way to make an attack on akshi and in the consequent melee having been wounded in the hinder parts by an arrow from his own men had been unable to escape and so had fallen a victim to the loyalists the boy king was glad that providence had taken judgment from his hands hussan had but himself to thank as the poet said who does an evil deed but sows the seed of his own meed this was finely philosophic but it did not quite comfort the philosopher the first actual experience of ingratitude and disloyalty made its mark upon him and sobered him he began to abstain from forbidden and dubious meats and but seldom omitted his midnight prayers mercifully however the season for polo was past and nevian gokultash was almost as good at leap frog as the deceased statesman nevian gokultash who as foster brother was above the possibility of suspicion truly said babar one evening throwing his arm round his playmate's neck affectionately rightly are thy kind named gokultash 'heart of stone' thy love is founded on rock whereas my brother by blood he broke off impatiently but there 'tis not his fault he is so young two whole years younger than i despite the good natured excuse which in all his chequered life ever came easily to babar's kindly nature he felt the first chill of the cold world at his heart he found to his great irritation and annoyance that his milieu was not nearly so reasonable as he was himself it was the irritation and the annoyance which besets capability and vitality other folk had not nearly such good memories were not half so nimble minded or straight forward as he expected when for instance he sent an envoy to a rebellious chief in order to remonstrate with him before proceeding to arms the wrong headed man instead of returning a suitable answer ordered the ambassador to be put to death such however not being in the pleasures of god the envoy managed to escape and after having endured a thousand distresses and hardships arrived naked and on foot to pour the tale of his wrongs into babar's indignant ears urged by wrath at such ill manners the boy king proposed instant reprisals and set off but a heavy fall of snow on the encircling hills and a slight sprinkling on the clover meadows warned him that winter was approaching and his nobles added their opinion that it was no time in which to commence a campaign so he returned to andijan and to a boy's life of study and sport the saintly kazi was his tutor and kept the boy to his al jabr algebra and arabic and abstruse dialectic dissertations on the nature of the kosmos there were not many books to be read in andijan but babar knew them all he had the epic of kings almost by heart and used to regret there were not more details about the great jamsheed with his wonderful divining cup jamsheed who reigned with might whom the birds and beasts and fairies and demons obeyed jamsheed of whom it was written and the world was happier for his sake and he too was glad that was something like a king and babar learnt also in a rude unrefined way all the accomplishments of a turkhi nobleman he could strum on the lute bawl a song fairly and play with singlestick to admiration the latter was kasim's care kasim who was the best swordsman in the kingdom and who used to quarrel with the kazi as to whether the young student's strongest point was fencing or the fine nastalik hand writing in which babar excelled as for sport the snow falling early brought the deer down to the valleys and the undulating country about andijan was always full of wild fowl while pheasants by the score were to be shot in the skirts of the mountains the boy was growing fast and in his lambskin coat worn with the fleece inside the soft tanned shammy leather without all encrusted by gold silk embroidery to a supple strength that kept out both cold and sabre cuts he looked quite a young man and his high peaked cap of black astrachan to match the edgings of his coat and bound with crimson velvet suited his bright animated face dearest one admired him hugely i would the court painter were not a fool she said regretfully as he came in one day from the chase and held up for her inspection a cock minawul pheasant all resplendent in its winter plumage but he cannot see when he paints thee he makes thee all as one with timur shah and ghengis khan on whom be peace but i want thee in truth it needed a better artist than andijan held to do justice to the fire which always leapt to the boy's face when beauty such as the iridescent bird's struck a spark from his imagination and made the whole world blaze into sudden splendour baisanghar might do it likely replied babar thoughtlessly he hath a quaint turn with his brush that is not as others and he said he would love to paint thy portrait he broke off suddenly aware that this was a subject which had better not have been introduced but indeed there seemed a fate that he should always talk of baisanghar to his sister could it be her fault he looked at her with boyish reproach but the girl's face was lit up with smiles and dimples aye he said that did he say more after i had gone tell me brotherling but he walked off in dignified fashion with the cock pheasant his sister thought too much of baisanghar and it was time she married he talked to his mother quite seriously about it and she met his anxiety by the calm remark why should she not marry baisanghar why not indeed now he came to think of it somehow it had not occurred to him before but when he suggested it to his sister she met him with a storm of tears she was never going to marry she was going to be a sainted canoness and pray for her brother why could he not leave her alone and cousin baisanghar also who apparently was of the same mind since though he was nigh nineteen he had never taken a wife and if it came to weddings was it not high time that he babar king of ferghana bethought himself of bringing his betrothed home that would procure festivities enow if that was what he was wanting from which deft shaft in the enemy's camp babar fled precipitately the very idea irked him he had no time for such nonsense in fact he wearied even of the three loving women who insisted upon consulting him by day and by night but ere the winter was over yet another messenger of death arrived and this one made the boy king feel like a caged young eagle longing for his first flight wicked uncle mahmud after disgusting samarkand for six months with his unbridled licentiousness and tyranny until great and small rich and poor lifted up their heads to heaven in supplications for redress and burst out into curses and imprecations on the mirza's head had by the judgment that attends on such crime tyranny and wickedness died miserably after an illness of six days the women wept of course though old isan daulet's tears were considerably tempered by smiles at her own prophetic powers had she not said that both the men who dared to attack the apple of her eye young babar would suffer and so they had and now the old lips pursed themselves and were silent but the old thoughts were busy her grandson was mayhap over young to try his luck this year yet for all that he was the rightful heir to the throne of samarkand in this way father yunus khan suzerain of all moghulistan had been suzerain also of samarkand none questioned that had not the triple marriage of yunus khan's three daughters with the king of samarkand's three sons been arranged especially in order to put an end to the khan of moghulistan's undoubted claim by joining the two families well one of those marriages had produced no son mahmud who had married the younger daughter had but one son by her a perfect child but babar son of the eldest sister was adolescent therefore by every right every claim he was the heir but she was a wise old woman there was no use being in a hurry samarkand might as well seethe in its own sedition for awhile by all accounts the turkhans were up in arms and the turkhans were ticklish folk to deal with then khosrau shah the late king's prime minister was an able man and might be trusted to fight for what he wanted the time for intervention would be when the combatants had weakened each other and the shrewd old woman once more proved herself right for khosrau shah having plumped for the nincompoop masaud doubtless because he knew that with a nonentity on the throne his power would be absolute the turkhans declared for baisanghar sent for him express and having driven out khosrau who had attempted to conceal his master's death until his plans were completed placed the former on the throne and here another factor came in to the wary old woman's mind what if her granddaughter were to marry baisanghar babar could lay claim to other kingdoms when he was fit to fight for them and thus there would be a down sitting for both her daughter's children so most of the affairs of importance at andijan being conducted by her advice kasim's swashbuckler instincts were held in check for the time something however must be done to occupy the lad meanwhile and the news that his uncle by marriage and cousin by descent hussain king of khorasan meditated an expedition against hissar the neighbouring province prompted the suggestion that the boy king should take advantage of proximity to pay his respects and make acquaintance with the premier prince of the age babar's imagination was aflame in an instant tales of the splendid court at herat were broadcast in asia folk said they had even spread to europe that dim unknown horizon to which the boy's thoughts often reverted and sultan hussain was as his father and his elder brother it was always wise to make the personal acquaintance of such it dispelled misunderstanding on their part and gained for yourself a nearer and better idea of their strength and weakness so one day at the beginning of winter with stout kasim wrapped to the eyes in furs and a hundred and a half or so of hardy troopers equipped for a mountain march babar started for the low passes by the white hills to the valley of the oxus river have a care of thy soul my son said the saintly kwaja and remember what the poet sings the soul is the only thing to prize heed not the body it is not wise the wiles of the devil are millionfold and every spell is a fetter to hold thou hast five robbers to keep at bay hearing and sight touch taste and smell so chain them up and govern them well some things are real and some but seem the mundane things of the world are a dream but isan daulet sniffed so be it that he keep the institutes of ghengis khan as his forebears did he will do they be enough for a brave man and death or the bastinado sufficient punishment the kwaja looked grave yet be they not the law of islam sister and we of the faith are not heathens heathen or no retorted the old lady my grandson will do well if he touch ghengis khan's height and she sniffed again perhaps her words put it into the boy's head but in this his first flight beyond his hill clipped kingdom his thoughts were with his great ancestors he rather swaggered it in consequence round the camp fires at night and was overbold in the chase so that more than once on the higher hills nevian gokultash had to pick him out of a snow drift but his dignity was always equal to the occasion and when at last sultan hussain mirza's camp showed in ordered array on the low ground beyond the passes he took it as if he were quite accustomed to see the large pavilions the rows on rows of orderly tents the laagers of chained carts he held his head very high too as he rode down the central alley his pennant carried before him by two jostling troopers the smart soldiers lavish of buckles and broideries who lounged about smiled at the uncouth troop but each and all had a need of praise for the boyish leader who sat his horse like a centaur and whose bright eyes seemed everywhere he is a gay enough young cockerel admitted a scented noble with a smile let us see if his uncle will make him fight but even if babar had been more pugnacious than he was sheer astonishment at his first interview would have kept him quiescent even kasim beg stickler as he was for etiquette gave up the hopeless attempt at ceremonial thou art welcome nephew said the old man whose long white beard contrasted with his gay coloured juvenile garments that better matched the vivacity of the straight narrow eyes the black astrachan cap perched on the reverend head however suited neither sit ye down boy and watch my butting rams yonder is the earth trembler peace be on my ancestor's grave and this is the barbarian ghengis no offence meant to thine young chagatai three tumans of gold muzaffar he smashes the other's horn first butt the man he addressed who had been heaven knows why prime favourite for years and showed his position by the most arrogant of airs turned to his neighbour not i a certainty is no bet for me though by our compact excellence i would get my fair share of two thirds back if you won but berunduk birlas here having lost his best hawk after bustard to day is in a mood for tears and would like to lose gold also berunduk birlas the ablest man at the court shook his head sadly of a truth friend my loss is great enough to content me had my sons died or broken their necks i could not grieve more than for my true falcon jinny brighteyes no man could desire a more captivating beauty sultan hussain went off into a peal of laughter li where is ali shir where is our poet brighteyes the captivating beauty who catches hairs eh there is a subject for word play out with a ghazel on the spot friend ali a thin elegant looking man with a pale refined face got up and made a perfect salute from head to foot he was exquisite the beau brummel of his age look nudged one young courtier to another enviously he hath a new knot to his kerchief how in god's name think you is it tied the incomparable person paused for one second only then in the most polished of voices he poured out a lengthy ode deftly ringing the changes on the word baz falcon which in persian has at least a dozen different meanings a ripple of laughter followed his somewhat forced allusions and he sat down again amid a chorus of applause babar stood dum foundered yet in every fibre of his body sympathetic here was something new indeed a new world very different from the rough and tumble clash of arms and swords and polo sticks at andijan but a world where mayhap he might hold his own well done well done he cried with the rest and his uncle the sultan nodded approval at the lad sit ye down sit ye down he said and cupbearer a beaker of shiraz wine for the king of ferghana for the life of him the boy could not refrain from one swift look at kasim's face kasim who was all shocked propriety at such a violation of the rules both of islam and ghengis khan but after that one scared glance dignity came back your highness he said with pomp waving his hand towards one of the butting rams like my ancestor the barbarian i drink water only a smile went round the assembly and young babar felt a glow of pride that he had not fallen so far short in wit thereinafter he sat and listened with wide eyes his uncle was certainly a lively pleasant man but his temper was a bit hasty and so were his words still despite that and overfreedom with the wine cup he evidently had a profound reverence for the faith since at the proper hour he put on a small turban tied in three folds broad and showy and having placed a plume on it went in this style to prayers that night when kasim was snoring in the tent and the hundred and a half or thereabouts of his followers were slumbering peacefully full up of kid pullao babar lay awake he was composing an ode for the first time in his life it was a sorry composition of no value except that it filled him with desire to do better chapter iv in this world's inn where sweetest song abounds there is no prelude to one song that sounds the guests have quaffed their wine and passed away their cups were empty and they would not stay no sage no stripling not a hand but thine has held this goblet of poetic wine rise then and sing thy fear behind thee cast and be it clear or dull bring forth the wine thou hast jami babar could not tear himself away from his uncle's camp he lingered on and on watching the military operations with a more or less critical eye but absorbing culture wholesale it was a revelation to him meeting men to whom fighting was not the end and aim of life and these begs and nobles of his uncle's court though they were all supposed to be engaged in warfare with khosrau shah who was holding hissar over the river for his nominee the nincompoop had yet time for other things ali shir for instance was wise beyond belief in all ways incomparable man so kind so courteous babar profited by his guidance and encouragement in his efforts to civilise himself thus becoming since there is not in history any man who was greater patron of talent than ali shir one of that great company of poets painters professors and musicians who owe everything to him who passing through this world single and unencumbered by wife or child gave himself and his time up to the instruction of others so far therefore as the clash of intellect went young babar was satisfied in regard to the clash of arms it was different how such a mighty body of mirzas begs and chiefs who with their followers if they were not double the number of the enemy over the water were at least one and a half times that number could content themselves with practical inaction passed his understanding when too they had such battering rams and catapults as positively made his mouth water there was one of the latter which threw such a quantity of stones and with such accuracy that in half an hour just before bedtime prayers the enemy's fort was beautifully breached but the night being deemed rather dark for assault and the troops preferring the safety and comfort of their trenches no immediate attack was made the result being that before morning the breach was repaired there was absolutely no real fine fighting and at this rate his uncle the sultan would doubtless spend the whole winter on the banks of the amu river and when spring came patch up some sort of a peace from fear of the floods which always came down with the melting snow that is his way asserted kasim with a shrug of his shoulders he leads his army forth with pomp and state and in himself is no mean general but ever it comes to naught it is so always when folk take to rhyming couplets and putting spices to their food give me orders that hang together and plain roast venison but all the while the honest man was stuffing his mouth full of lamb and pistachio nuts and babar smiled still he felt that so far as the art of war went he might go back to little andijan without fear of leaving behind him any knowledge worth the learning it was otherwise with the culture and he flung himself with characteristic vitality into music lessons and dancing lessons elocution lessons and deportment lessons until as he entered the court audience no one could have told that but a few weeks before he had been as rough and as uncouth as old kasim who stoutly refused veneer what i am god made me he would say and if folk like it not let them leave i budge not to which uncompromising independence one pair of hands delicate long fingered ivory hands gave fluttering applause they belonged to a young man who almost at first sight impressed young babar more than anyone he had seen in all his life he was a helpless cripple who yet took his part in life like any other man every evening his spangled litter would be brought into the big audience tent and set down just below the king's for mirza gharib beg who styled himself poverty prince in allusion to the meaning of his name poor was the king's son by a low born woman who had been passionately loved so despite the fact that he had been born misshapen ugly and that ill health had always been his poverty prince still had a hold on his father's affection and no wonder since though his form was not prepossessing he had a fine genius and though his constitution was feeble he had a powerful mind there was nothing it seemed to babar that he could not do he could rhyme with ali shir play the guitar with abdulla marwarid and paint with bahzad what is more he could talk mysticism far better than kamal ud din with his wagging black beard who pretended to raptures and ecstasies and had written a portentously dull book about sufism which he called the assembly of lovers portentously dull and also profane which was inexcusable but when poverty prince spoke of roses and nightingales and even of the red wine cup he took you into another world and he evidently believed what he said whereas kamal ud din was all pose yet the next instant the thin ugly face would show almost impish in its amusement and its owner would burst out with some sally that would set them all a laughing and him a coughing for the change of air which was to have done him good was doing him harm though he would not admit it wherefore should i he laughed gaily in some anxious face a man is as ill as he thinks himself he is all things that he believes himself to be so i am strong and well and young and deeply enamoured of a beauteous lady she is called feramors a pretty name and he would catch up a lute over which his thin long ivory hands would flutter like butterflies and sing say is it love or death o feramors that hides behind thy bosom's pearly doors i care not so i reach the heart within oh let me in open the closed doors o feramors truly he was a marvellous person to babar boy as he was the most marvellous thing in the camp how could he cripple suffering almost dying as he was keep life at bay as it were how could he sit so free of it he babar with his health and strength was not so independent though he was more so than most for almost unconsciously he set himself as free as he could from encumbrance even of thought he shrank even from so much as came to him from gharib and avoided his cousin in consequence spending such time as he could spare from his numerous lessons and the watch kasim made him keep on military matters in hunting amid the low hills but it was no use that dark curiously be scented tent wherein the cripple lay laughing at life had a strange attraction for him he took to dropping into it on his way elsewhere until old kasim grew uneasy he lays spells on you my liege he protested they tell me he can do it to all young folk so have a care smear my forehead with lamp black against the evil eye then shall i be safe laughed the boy and yet in his heart he felt the spell and oddly enough he liked it he was fascinated by something in this distant faraway cousin of his so far away that it scarcely seemed worth while calling him cousin yet as grandmother isan daulet would say all men were descended from adam come in on thy return from the chase said poverty prince one day when he had looked in on the scent sodden tent a picture of youth and strength and health in his fur posteen and his high peaked cap and bring thy bag with thee for this lifeless log to see what shall it contain imprimis a brace of chameleon birds i love to see their iridescent necks and the six different colours between head and tail mark you how i remember thy description cousin ling babar blushed thou said'st thou had never seen them he began apologetically save through thine eyes and they are good enough for most folk be not ashamed coz of the gift god hath given thee and thou shalt bring me a fat deer and some kalidge pheasant and with luck a cock minawul then we will look at it with the same eyes thou and i a wistfulness had crept into his voice and he said no more but the curious thing was that the bag was ever just what poverty prince had predicted neither more nor less thou art a wizard for sure said babar half seriously the thought of thy words makes my aim sure at times and at another sets my bow arm a quiver wert thou to say 'naught' i should return empty handed so be it laughed the cripple why should we kill god's pretty creatures and thereinafter two whole hunts produced nothing whether it was a fresh fall of snow in the hills that brought ill luck babar could not say but he looked at his cousin with awe thou hast more power i verily believe he said than the dream man whom uncle hussain keeps for his amusement put in poverty prince with a frown but that is black magic mine is white i do naught 'tis thy mind that answers he broke off and his large eyes the only unmarred feature in his face narrowed themselves to a piercing glance wherefore should i not say it cousin has it not struck thee that had'st thou been born crooked and not straight or had i been born straight and not crooked we should have been as two twins that is why i like thee and thou likest me the boy sat and stared at him almost incredulously he could not imagine his youth and strength pent up in that prison of a body and yet yes without doubt there was some tie else why should he feel so intimate why should he speak to poverty prince of things which every decent young mahomedan was taught to keep to himself for instance of dearest one and the possibility of her marrying baisanghar the blood rushed to his face however with shame when he felt his cousin's hot long fingered trembling hand close on his wrist in quick arrest marriage say not the word dost not know nay i forgot thy youth and i will not soil thine ears with the tale but we in foul herat know most wickedness most degradations and there is that in miserable baisanghar's life that bars marriage with any woman worthy the name aye and he knows it poor maimed soul enmeshed for ever by the wickedness of one who should have protected him may god's curse light on him for ever so think not of marriage cousin babar shook off his cousin's clasp haughtily it was not that he resented having substance given to his vague doubts of baisanghar it was better to know for sure but interference with his womenkind was intolerable and he had brought it on himself by your leave he said with terrific dignity we will speak no more on such private matters 'tis my own fault such subjects are not meet for public conversations poverty prince lay back on his cushions and kindly raillery took possession of his face not meet sayest thou cousin ling yet are they the best half nay the three quarters of life dost know that even to me cripple marriage hath played the major part babar's eyes involuntarily travelled over the distorted body the crumpled limbs and poverty prince laughed cynically thou art right boy he went on loathsome to sight and touch what had i to do with weddings but princedom weighs heavy with the pandars of the court and 'twas done early mayhap they did not dream i would grow up so monstrous as i did he paused and his pale face grew paler his hot fingers clasped and unclasped themselves mayest thou never nay thou will not see fear upon a girl's face i saw it dost understand nay thou art but a child still thank god i did so she waits for release by my death and then he paused again and this time bright cold raillery took possession of his face as he said thou wilt make a fine bridegroom cousin ling some day fair maids will not be alarmed at thee likely i shall be of them answered the boy stoutly and it was true barring dearest one the stupid mincing creatures filled him with dismay this passed but a few days before kasim who thought his young charge had had quite enough of the camp proposed starting homewards there seemed no prospect of the campaign coming to a close quite a variety of strategical movements had been made mines had been dug forts besieged but the result was nil and time was passing events had not been going smoothly at samarkand the moment for intervention might be near and grandmother isan daulet had sent a messenger advocating return none too soon for the very same day king hussain's runners brought news of a conspiracy to turn out baisanghar and bring in a younger brother ali khan but he is not of the blood either said babar hotly kasim we must go back at once the desire for conquest was stirring in him once more the sooner the better sire replied the stout warrior settling his sword belt he had wearied terribly among the smart soldiers and was longing for a real raid once more to say farewell echoed poverty prince when babar looked in that night at his cousin's tent i thought it was not to be for a week yet and his hot hand clasped the cool one with a lingering touch there was news from samarkand replied the lad regret tempering the keenness which had come to his face with the prospect of action and cousin it matters little 'tis but a few hours' difference a few hours echoed the cripple speaking for the first time since babar had known him almost regretfully that means much to one who has but a few days or weeks to live not that it does so really coz he added recovering his usual serenity and thou wilt spare me one of the hours i dare claim so much of my twin the pathetic playfulness of the appeal went straight to the lad's soft heart he fell on his knees beside the cushions then sat back in the mahomedan attitude of prayer nay brother he said and there was quite a tremble in his young voice say not so i am but a poor creature beside thee thou art truly i know not what sometimes i think an angel from god's paradise thou art so splendid knowest thou if angels be splendid asked poverty prince with radiant raillery for myself i know not only this that i shall miss my double he looked at the lad's lithe limbs at his long legs his great stretch of arm and to think he muttered that i might have been born so my god to think of it then suddenly he clapped his hands and gave a peremptory order to the servant who appeared see that i be not disturbed that no one enters he waited till they were alone then drew something from his bosom and held it before him in both hands it was a tiny crystal bowl scarce large enough for his finger tips but they held the glittering thing lightly it looked like a diamond body to two fluttering ivory wings as he said slowly musically it hath lain in my breast ever i found it in the hand of death he said dreamily but the riddle of life ends for me and begins for thee so take it when i have told thee how it came to me those ivory hands of his seemed more like wings than ever as still holding the bowl before him he lay back and it showed clear against the shadows of the tent thou knowest he went on the graveyards of the hill folk set on an hill and thick with iris flowers the flowers of immortality the green sword leaves guarding the blossoms guarding the quiet dead below it was the day i saw fear in a maiden's eyes there was such a graveyard not far from her father's dwelling he is dead now and she awaits the release of death amongst beneficent ladies in a house of rest at herat and i bid them carry me there for my heart was aflame and i cursed god for this carcase seeing she was fair so they left me there overlooking the valley and when they had gone i lay amid the crushed iris and writhed but of that no more it hath passed so suddenly between my empty wide spread arms and clutching fingers i saw something amid the crushed blossoms it must have been a very old grave on which i lay since the iris roots matted thick upon it as if to hide the dead that lay in the hollow of it for the rams and the winds sweeping on that high exposed spot had torn the covering of soil from mother earth's bosom what i saw was this crystal cup perchance it had been used when the dead was laid to rest and forgotten perchance some sad lover had set it there with flowers and tears in the poignancy of first grief and gone away to love another who knows the iris roots had grown to a cup around it twisted white iris roots like dead fingers and i took it from them take thou it o zahir ud din mahomed from one close to the adventure of death i burden the gift with but one condition if ever thou comest across a frightened maid here his whole face became radiant with smiles be not afraid of her so take it cousin ling it is no cup of king jamsheed to bring thee counsel in thy need yet it hath its virtue to those who like thou hast have eyes to see it can bring content content was this the secret of poverty prince's charm babar bold young every fibre of him keen strung for the life on the brink of which he stood cared little for content yet he took the cup and looked at it curiously quaint of a surety taller than it was broad small enough to lie in the hollow of the hand the brim over thick by reason of heavy bosses below the edge five bosses like those in blown glass but oval like eyes the rest faintly frosted by fine scratchings were they without or within within surely which were they letterings would need a magnifying glass ere they could be deciphered but at the bottom so disposed that one must read in drinking these words showed clear save the cup of life what gift canst thou bring that was from hafiz surely aye divine hafiz replied his cousin answering his thought boldly now hold it to the light cousin ling and see its virtue the boy did as he was bid feeling dazed and dreamful a seven lamped tripod behind his cousin's cushions had been lit at least he could not remember that it had been there when he came in seven little lamps why those five bosses were deftly arranged to gather the light and send it god and his prophet how beautiful through the clear eye before his eyes he saw his cousin's face all glorified splendid utterly that something which came to him ever with the sight of beauty filled him with joy but stay the bosses must be magnifying glasses also he could read something what was it ishk love or ashk tears thou wilt see more clearly when thou hast learnt to use the five eyes of the soul came his cousin's voice then thine own thoughts will return to thee from the mirror of life now put it into the bosom of thy fur coat there is room there for it and majesty likewise and now i will sing the song of the bowl ere thou goest he clapped his hands once more and the boy sighed and rubbed his eyes dreamily surely the seven lamps had been lit but now they were not the semi darkness of the scent sodden tent closed in on him and that was his cousin's every day voice bring me my dulcimer slave lo king ling it suits the measure better than the cithara and i am proud of the tune 'tis my own so after a while the tinkling notes began the voice rose plaintively illustration three bars of music with words clear crystal bowl thy sun sparkles blind every poor soul whose eyes seek to find way through life's wilderness on thy bright brim crystal bowl what wilt thou bring to him darkness or light clear crystal bowl thy touch icy cold chills lovers lips that lay overbold hot clinging kisses on thy bright brim crystal bowl what wilt thou bring to him love or despair clear crystal bowl i laugh like thy wine bring me life's whole all things must be mine is not the wide world mirrored in thee crystal bowl i bid thee bring to me joy grief life death the voice ceased and there was silence for a little while but in all the long after years the memory of those tinkling notes that thin voice claiming the whole of life remained with zahir ud din mahomed well god's peace go with thee said poverty prince brightly at the last methinks thy boyhood is about past and sterner stuff hath to come but keep the gift of death and if thou lose it at least remember my poor verses and coz here the wizened face almost dimpled with laughter if thou comest across the frightened maid i give no names they are an encumbrance remember to make her not frightened of my twin farewell it was a stirring night the river had to be crossed silently in the very face of khosrau shah's pickets for he was holding the north bank for his nominee the nincompoop and a stealthy way made skirting the enemy's camp ere they could reach the hills beyond some of the party felt inclined to put andijan tactics in force make a rush through the out posts give and take a few sabre cuts and so make off but babar even though old kasim hesitated had learnt something besides accomplishments in his uncle's camp he had learnt that time was long and that it was well to choose your own so he rode canny it was dawn ere they reached the last vantage ground whence they could see the camp they had left it lay curiously calm and peaceful kasim more than half asleep on his horse now there was no chance of a fine fight yawned and stretched his arms wide no more of that for me he said lustily i am for cut and thrust and a good bellyful of plain food but i am for all things laughed babar he was trying to pick out his cousin's tent and as he spoke he put his hand into the bosom of his coat to feel for the crystal bowl he could not find it had it dropped out or what i must go back he said half to himself i must i must go back wherefore asked old kasim what is it sire to go back is death the enemy is awake by now the boy king looked at him keenly aye he said shortly and to go on is life i must remember as he said forward gentlemen chapter v the day of delight has come and the wind brings scent of musk and rose and lilies and peppermint oh day of delight pass slow god's flowers must blow the day of despair has come and the wind brings dust to bury the flowers the song of the birds is hushed oh day of despair pass swift let god's clouds lift the days of despair and delight have come ah me i care not away from my home the days of god pass swift and slow allah i hu allah i ho ashraf the exiled old isan daulet who had been queen regent to all intents and purposes during babar's absence welcomed him back to andijan somewhat charily she had sent for him in a hurry when news came that the turkhans of samarkand had revolted against baisanghar captured that prince by stratagem and put mirza ali his younger brother on the throne but now the tables were turned baisanghar whom all knew to be wily as a fox had not only managed to escape but having somehow gained the sympathy of the townspeople they had risen tumultuously against the court folk and the turkhans had besieged the citadel which had not been able to hold out for a single day and had replaced baisanghar why only god knew 'twill be because of his love odes grandmother said babar gravely there is not a house in samarkand where a copy of them is not to be found isan daulet sniffed captiously i would he would keep his love songs to himself there is dearest one sick as a magpie still with the shock of his death and he is not dead the good for nothing babar's lip set he is dead to her anyhow he said so no more dreams of that grandmother i forbid it and so i will tell her hoighty toighty sniffed the old lady but in her heart of hearts she was glad look you she said to her daughter afterwards he spoke for all the world like his grandfather when things went wrong lo he is boy no longer we must treat him as a man with wiles such however was not dearest one's treatment of her brother nor was his of her what might have been expected from his peremptory tone to his grandmother how could it be when he found her pale and dispirited despite her joy at seeing him he beat about the bush uncomfortably for quite a long time until with characteristic clarity he blurted out and sister thou must think no more of baisanghar he is a worthless scoundrel the girl ill as she was looked as if she could have stabbed him with her eyes that he is not she said proudly thou art like the rest of them even the kwaja yea i have talked with him concerning it and he knows mayhap more than thou dost who confound the sinner with the sin but look you zahir ud din mahomed were there no man on earth but mirza baisanghar i would not have him and yet i love him dearly dearly she sank back on her bed hid her face in the quilt and sobbed babar stood aghast yet feeling as if he could cry too i wish thou had'st known cousin gharib he said suddenly causelessly he would have understood i cannot not yet then he turned and left her what was the use of trying to comfort anyone when you did not know the cause of their sorrow and joy and grief life and death had to come if one were to live then life was so full just at the present the very story of baisanghar's escape was enough to make one's heart beat under sentence of death and such a death to be taken with pomp and ceremony to the foot of the throne in the gokserai the green palace that wonderful palace four stories high built by the great timur in the citadel where every kingly descendant of his must be enthroned where every kingly descendant of his must die and there to be strangled with that before him to have the nerve in a few minutes to unbrick a closed door run to the bastion fling himself over the parapet wall and so find shelter in kwaja kwarka's house the holiest man in the city a thousand pities indeed that baisanghar had sunk so low aye dearest one was right one could condemn the sin and yet do justice to the sinner yet there was a lack of kingliness too that was inexcusable to allow his brother ali to escape also was perhaps to err on the side of mercy but to submit to be beaten by him in battle immediately afterwards was distinctly unnecessary it complicated matters too most dreadfully for here was baisanghar acclaimed by the people more or less imprisoned in the city of samarkand and ali mirza nominated by the court beleaguering him from the bokhara side while khosrau shah relieved from the necessity of defending hissar for his nincompoop by the withdrawal of sultan hussain back to khorasan was hastening all he knew to put in his oar for his nominee from the hissar side this being so and neither of the three claimants having a shadow of right beside his babar's there was nothing for it but to be on the spot at once so kettledrums were beat and pennons unfurled while nevian gokultash saw to his young master's coat of mail and the latter pored over the memoirs of his great ancestor timur to see what wrinkles he could pick up in regard to the disposition of troops in a real fine fight for being a born general he was dissatisfied with what he had seen even with uncle hussain's smart soldiers only dearest one took no interest in the military preparations she embroidered no flag with crinkled gold she sat on the roof and watched the young king ride out in all his bravery and then she prayed god for his safety and also for the safety of that other one who deserved none and for a time both her prayers were answered the summer passed on to winter and still samarkand the protected city that has never really fallen sat gaily secure in its wide suburbs and vast network of fortified gardens scarcity indeed pressed harder outside the walls than within then the nincompoop whose only object apparently in advancing on samarkand had been to pursue his mistress the daughter of a high court official succeeded in marrying her and so retreated thus babar found himself confronting baisanghar supported by the populace and ali by the court they waited and looked at each other for some time and then one morning after preliminaries babar moved his army some twelve miles down the right bank of the river kohik and ali mirza moved his down the left so with their armies behind them though it would seem somewhat helpless either for support or protection the two young princes each with five followers rode from their own side to the middle of the stream and with the chill water just touching their horses' bellies agreed that if the summer came again they would harry samarkand together after which solemn ceremonial ali returned to his side of the river and babar to his whence he set off to ferghana it was not a very distinguished campaign but it was his first perhaps it was as well it was uneventful for he was busy working his small army into something like discipline therein he saw clearly boy as he was lay success without it there was nothing but one long succession of isolated raids incoherent useless leaving the people ready as they had been in the beginning for a new and yet another new conqueror it was something therefore when in the next spring he found himself able to restrain his troops and to punish severely many straggling moghuls who had been guilty of great excesses in the different villages through which they had passed it was an unheard of idea but it had a marked effect for shortly afterwards when his camp was close to a place called yam a number of persons both traders and others came in from the town to buy and sell and somehow about afternoon prayer time a general hubbub arose during which every shop and every stranger was plundered yet an order that no person should presume to detain any part of the effects or property thus seized but that the whole should be restored without reserve before the first watch of the next day was over resulted in not one bit of thread or a broken needle being kept by the army it was a glorious victory for pure ethics and quite repaid babar for having to remain for six weeks outside samarkand besides the peach gardens were in full bloom it was curious going out into the pleasure ground of the city to slash and hack and hew and kill but there was no other way for it and many were the sharp skirmishes that took place with the townspeople where folk as a rule had been wont to disport themselves on holidays but in war time things got upside down witness the dastardly deceit of the lover's cave where five of babar's most active men were killed seduced by a treacherous promise to deliver up the fort if a party came thither by night a picked troop was chosen for the service with this result it rankled bitterly in the young commander's heart he felt himself at fault for his greatest weakness an inveterate habit of believing what he heard yet he had his consolations day by day as he waited doing his best with the small force at his command to cut off the supplies from the city the number of townspeople and traders who came out to traffic in the camp bazaar increased until it became like a city and you could find there whatever is procurable in towns and day by day the inhabitants of the country around came in and surrendered themselves their castles their lands high and low only the city of samarkand held out it was in the end of september and the sun was entering the balance when babar weary of waiting made a feint march to the rear and the garrison of samarkand jumping to the conclusion that he was in retreat rushed out in great number both soldiers and citizens then orders were given to the cavalry in reserve to charge on both flanks whereupon god prospering the proceeding the enemy were decisively defeated nor from that time forward did they ever again venture on a rally no though babar's soldiers advanced through the now leafless peach gardens to the very ditch and carried off numbers of prisoners close under the walls and still fair samarkand stood secure seven whole months had the blockade lasted and now the winter's cold was coming on to aid the garrison in addition the great turkhestan raider shaibani khan was said to be on his way with a large force to intervene in the quarrel both dangers had to be faced babar felt in view of the first that he must cantoon his men and set to work marking out the ground for the huts and trenches so leaving labourers and overseers to go on with the work he returned to his camp none too soon for the very next morning a hostile army showed to the north it must be shaibani prince of free lances nothing dismayed by the fact that fully half his soldiers were away seeking winter quarters babar put the forces he had with him in array and marched out to meet the enemy boldness met with its reward shaibani withdrew and after giving the young king some nights of sleepless anxiety went back whence he came and baisanghar disappointed in relief resigned himself to despair and fled accompanied by two or three hundred naked and starving followers in the whole habitable world are few cities so pleasantly situated as samarkand so wrote babar when at the age of fifteen he found himself met as king by the chief men of the city by the nobles by the young cavaliers and escorted to the garden palace where baisanghar had lived it was a great relief to him that his cousin had escaped indeed he had taken no precautions to prevent his doing so babar's quarrel was not with him but with his claim and as the lad for he was but a lad still sat that night under the roof which had sheltered the deposed prince he told himself he had been right when he had said to dearest one that baisanghar would never make a king there were no signs of kingship in that garden palace no plans or sketches no dry as dust schedules not one of the papers and models such as he babar already carried with him only a lute a dulcimer some dice boxes not even luxury poor baisanghar rightly had he called himself an unsubstantial shadow his poetry was the best part of him and his painting babar sitting alone in the alcoved room which baisanghar had evidently left in a hurry lay back among the cushions of the divan and thrust his hand beneath them to adjust them to his head there was something hard beneath their softness he drew it out and found a small square frame of gold no it was green enamel and on it were set like flowers turquoises rubies amethysts topazes why did it remind him of the spring meadows about andijan the spring meadows set with forget me nots and tulips it was a bit too dark where he was to see the pale painting it held so he rose and took it to the light dearest one and with a rush came back accusingly something he had almost forgotten all these months of striving and stress poverty prince the cup of life those bosses that gathered the light and magnified what was written by fate once or twice he had thought of it carelessly but now why had the thought come back to him it was a speaking likeness faint coloured delicate as a dream perhaps baisanghar had meant it to be so it was likely he did poor baisanghar for the life of him babar could not help pity even when he found the back of the frame was covered with fine writing with verses not even when he recollected that it was to his sister that they were dedicated in truth there was little in them of offence and babar as he went to sleep that night king of samarkand caught himself repeating them they were certainly very neat very neat indeed and now that he had had time to think why should not poor dearest one see them they had given him a kindlier feeling towards the writer so why should not she why not indeed the cup of life held all things for all yes he would send or give her the portrait as it stood it was really an excellent piece of work and the words were perfect the construction and the grammar so good he fell asleep reciting them heft aurang the seven thrones seven thrones and each a star set in god's heaven afar seven thrones and each for thee thank god there is no place beside thy face for me for me seven sins ah more than seven to cast me down from heaven seven sins and each of me thank god there is no place beside my face for thee for thee seven stars and one a pole to guide the wandering soul to rest but not for me there is no grace or place beside thy face ah me ah me footnote the persian name for the great bear samarkand is a wonderfully elegant city so wrote its young king the next evening he had spent the day in going round his new possessions and had found them to his liking not only was the little mosque with its carven wooden pilasters quaintly beautiful but the big one was magnificent with its frontispiece on which was inscribed in letters so large that they could be read a mile off and abraham and ishmael raised the foundations of the house of god saying 'lord accept it from us for thou art he who heareth and knoweth' then the gardens were a joy the baths the best he had ever seen the bakers' shops excellent the cooks skilful and the dried prunes of bokhara a fruit renowned as an acceptable rarity and a laxative of approved excellence were to be found in perfection then there was the observatory built by ulugh beg his ancestor who had been a great mathematician babar had never seen an observatory before indeed there were at that time but seven in the whole world so it was an honour to possess one he spent many days poring over its astronomical tables trying to understand them and finally put on a mathematical master since no science could possibly come amiss to a king meanwhile nevian gokultash and kasim and all the andijan nobles bickered inevitably with the samarkand grandees and babar found no small difficulty in keeping the peace still life was once more splendid at any rate for the young king but the soldiers grumbled at the lack of loot it was all very well to say that the country had voluntarily submitted and was therefore beyond plunder and that from a city which had suffered the vicissitudes of war for two years and withstood a siege of seven months it was impossible to levy anything by taxation it was all very well to supply the inhabitants with seed corn and supplies to enable them to carry on till harvest time but charity began at home and home under these circumstances was best the wild moghuls deserted first then by twos and threes the other men slipped away by night yet still life was splendid on those same clear winter's nights babar could watch the stars with new found knowledge if the most excellent would watch the barracks instead growled old kasim it would be well our men grow thin there are scarce a thousand of them left all told and new friends are not so good as old ones the samarkandis are doubtless fine fellows as the most excellent appears to find them but would they follow back to andijan if occasion occur and occasion did occur a letter arrived from babar's maternal uncle the khan of moghulistan who urged doubtless by the deserters wrote saying that as the former had possessed himself of samarkand it was only fair that his younger brother jahangir who after all was the son of omar saikh's first wife should be given andijan kasim who with his usual frown at all letters sat listening spat solemnly on the ground poison breeds poison he said i deemed that talk had been spilt in the blood from hussan yakoob's hinder parts four years past but 'tis never too late for mischief when women are left to themselves as they are at andijan but my grandmother is sagacious began babar kasim shrugged his shoulders saw you ever a woman who could manage a woman sire so have not i begum fatima and she have been spitting at each other like wild cats and what is wanted is a stick now what is to be said babar spoke hotly that i will not hear of it no though i might of myself have made my brother governor but of myself this savours of command he knows my men have gone back i will not hear the tone of authority and babar as he spoke felt himself tremble with anger his voice was hoarse too and his head ached he had been sitting up all night in the observatory to watch an eclipse of the moon and despite his fur coat had felt chill for february had brought bitter winds so be it said old kasim gleefully he was getting weary of samarkandi side and foresaw more fighting now the spring was at hand next day a special messenger foot in hand from andijan found babar in bed with a severe cold and the letter from kwaja kazi did not mend matters briefly the deserting soldiers discontented disloyal were giving trouble and if help were not sent at once events might come to a very bad termination that night delirium came to the young soul as the young body lay fighting for breath against pneumonia the physician bled him of course and fed him with almonds and ginger and they closed every door and window so that the wood smoke filled the room and such little lung space as was left but splendid youth and health were his and after a few days he lay outwearied with his hand to hand fight with death looking at the letters which had followed fast upon each other during his illness and each brought worse news than the last andijan was besieged any moment his women folk might fall into the hands of the enemy he must start at once to set aside nevian gokultash's protestations was easier than to rise and dress once up however he managed the council of war creditably and for a day held his own bravely giving orders for this and that a tall thin haggard young figure with sharpened features and eager eyes defying fate until suddenly voice left him he struggled on for an hour or two then lay unconscious so weak that they did not dare bleed him again but mercifully left him as he was only nevian gokultash at his right hand moistening the dear lips with cotton dipped in water while kasim sat still as a statue the tears running down his furrowed cheeks was this then the end of that vivid young life the like of which had never been seen but the samarkandi fellows who did not really care might go about the city as dogs and yelp the news that zahir ud din mahomed their king was dying nay was dead it was easy to see that this had been done for hour by hour day by day the garden palace became more and more empty more and more solitary a runner from andijan bearing further news found it so and anxious for the truth stole upstairs on tiptoe to see for himself how still how cold how silent and that half seen form in the dusk motionless among the quilts dead dead or so close to death that no alternative remained that night as his bells tinkled from his post runner's pike as he ran past village and field and wood they jangled the refrain that was on his mouth for all who cared to listen babar is dead life has ended the cup is finished yet even as the words rang out on the chill air other words faint scarce to be heard were startling those two sad watchers in the garden palace the crystal bowl give it back to me i i laugh as i drink bring me the whole i say the whole the boy's brain faintly conscious was taking command once more and the body obeyed in four or five days he was reading letters of despair from his mother from old isan daulet from dearest one samarkand they said had been taken with troops from andijan could not one man be spared from samarkand to keep andijan babar had not the heart to delay and ill as he was set off in a litter with such followers as he could gather together it was a saturday in march that he started just a hundred days since he had entered samarkand and he knew he could not hope to return as king one hundred days only he thought as he jolted through the peach gardens that were once again swelling to bud he reached khojend by forced marches in a week's time but by then he was on his horse again beginning to regain strength and colour so he wondered why the people looked at him so strangely as he rode through the town did they take him for a ghost yet he was even as one when they told him the news just a week before on the very saturday when he had started in such haste from samarkand andijan had capitulated needlessly capitulated to the enemy on the news of babar's death brought by a returning post runner for the sake of andijan he had lost samarkand and now found that he had lost the one without preserving the other worse still he had lost a dear friend for the saintly kwaja kazi protesting against the premature yielding of the citadel while there was yet no lack of provisions or of fighting men had been barbarously martyred by being hanged in a shameful manner over the gate of the citadel no wonder babar wrote in the diary he had begun to keep i was in a very distressed condition and wept a great deal chapter vi blest is the soul that is lifted above the paltry cares of self's selfish love which adds no weight to another's care and gives no soul a burden to bear which takes what comes as its part and lot which laughs at trouble and worries not which sleeps without malice or fraud in its breast and rises pure from its daily rest jami there was a sad meeting naturally with the womenfolk babar had hoped to help and who were somewhat contemptuously sent to him unharmed after a few days or perhaps that divinity which doth hedge a king or whatever it was which all his life long ensured babar's own safety extended itself to those who were dear to him anyhow they came and fell with tears on the neck of their dethroned darling dearest one slim and tall her face still showing the lines of conflicting anxieties yet still sweet utterly without trace of bitterness for her brother the khanum too rejoiced at seeing her son alive and well to care so much about his loss of dignity old isan daulet keener of look and sharper of tongue than ever but with a world of sympathy in her stern eyes for the lad who had lost all save honour for she realised that babar had practically given up kingship for the sake of his womenkind he had had fair grip of samarkand and even with but a thousand devoted followers of his own to help him hold it could nay would have done so babar himself did not attempt to deny his virtue he never did he was too frank to gloze over any of his actions good or bad he had done the right thing and he accepted the fact gravely perhaps a trifle pompously but that was his nature in the same way he could not fail to see that what had placed him in the unfortunate position of having insufficient followers to hold both samarkand and andijan was no error of judgment on his part but simply his extreme and unusual justice in refusing to grind down the distressed inhabitants of the former city for the benefit of his soldiery could he only have shut his eyes to the usual undisciplined plunder his army would not have deserted wholesale he was not introspective but he knew vaguely that he had somehow had no choice in the matter he had been born with this strong sense of justice so he could not help himself therefore despite this recognition of his own virtue it slipped from him like water off a duck's back leaving no self conceit behind so he welcomed his loving women quite whole heartedly and then wept more profusely than ever at the difficulty of maintaining them in proper fashion not that they wanted this the khanum gentle kindly soul was only too glad that her quite capable hands should do all things for her darling dearest one brisked up with work that took her out of herself and isan daulet had roughed it too much in her youth not to enjoy the familiarity of roughing it again and life even at khojend a miserable place in which a single nobleman would have found it difficult to support his family was not without its interests of the rather more than two hundred and considerably less than three hundred followers who chose exile with their young king quite a number were men of good family whose wives and children joined them there was therefore company of a sort then babar despite his tears was not one to give in inspired as he was by an ambition for conquest and extensive dominions he could not on account of one or two paltry defeats sit down and look idly about him so at any rate he told the three loving women with his usual serious pomp when he sent a request for assistance to his uncle the khan of moghulistan and then set off to reconnoitre around samarkand he returned ere long disappointed but was soon on the march again to see his uncle in person at tashkend in this he was encouraged by isan daulet who remembered her brother of old lo i know him a good soul but a stupid the brains of my father yunus went in the female line but if you beat his ears with words he will listen and keep on the soft side of shah begum my husband's widow god rest his soul anyhow he is at peace from her a clever woman but like a camel in mud slippery and this expedition was so far successful that the young leader actually returned from it once more at the head of some seven or eight hundred horsemen rather a wild lot mostly free lance moghuls eager for loot and violence but it was better than nothing though khojend was not large enough to hold them even for a night mercifully however there was an enemy's fort some forty miles off so taking scaling ladders with them they rode on to it and carried the place by surprise but even one day of babar's strict discipline was more than enough for the wild men of the desert and the very next morning the moghul begs represented that having but a mere handful of men no possible benefit could result to anyone from the keeping of one miserable castle and so there being truth in this remark they rode off to their desert again unabashed leaving babar to return annoyed but not despondent for at this particular fortress there grew a particular melon yellow in colour with skin puckered like shagreen leather a remarkably delicate and agreeable melon with seeds about the size of those of an apple and pulp four fingers thick which everyone agreed was not to be equalled in that quarter it was as well certainly to have gained something if only a good melon and the little party at khojend feasted on it and thanked god they had their boy back again safe and sound the summer was passing to autumn when another fit of despondency came to young babar in the news of his cousin gharib beg's death the invalid had lingered far longer than had been expected but still the certainty that he was gone brought grief the more so because it re aroused regret for the lost crystal bowl regret which had almost been forgotten in the clash of arms of the last few months but now he had time only too much of it for thoughts not given to mysticism in any form he yet wondered vaguely if the crystal bowl had ever existed or if the whole incident had not been part of the curious hold poverty prince had had upon his imagination and not on his only but on the imagination of all with whom the cripple had come in contact and now he was dead gone for ever like so many friends in these last troublous times babar translucent as the crystal itself gloomed under the shadow of his regrets till his mother began to fret with the fear of on coming illness but dearest one knew her brother better he must get away from us all she said yea even from old kasim and his warriors let him go to the white mountains a hunting for the winter but babar would have none of it the white mountains aye they would be splendid there were more bears there than in any other part of the country aye and snow leopard too the lad's eyes glistened as he admitted this but he could not leave his women folk again and he ought not to leave those who to their own cost had chosen to stick by him then we will go also said dearest one nothing daunted we are not of towns more than thou art and thou canst divide thy magnificent army take a hundred men with thee and leave an hundred to guard khojend her sweet eyes smiled at him and he agreed no one in all his life had understood him like dearest one he thought there was perfect confidence between them though strangely enough he had never yet given her the portrait he had found in the garden palace the portrait left by baisanghar in his flight why had he not done so he scarcely knew except that he had felt shy of broaching a subject that seemed buried 'twas best not to rouse coiled snakes and baisanghar who had taken refuge in bokhara had gone out of their lives altogether out of his babar's at any rate but everything seemed gone out of that as the turkhi couplet said no home no friends no roof above my head six feet of earth no more to make my bed the white mountains however white indeed during winter with their snowy slopes invading all save the tiny cleft of the valley where the skin tents of the little party had been pitched soon brought back content it was as if the soft covering of snow had blotted out the past and the winter slipped by full up with trivial distractions babar returning long after dark to the encampment with half a dozen or so of bear skins forgot he was or ever had been king and when early spring came on and the bears were breeding he took to hunting tulips instead there were so many different kinds of them over thirty and one yellow double and sweet scented like a rose dearest one used to accompany him on these expeditions for she was a real moghul maiden and the bright cold winter had braced her up until her cheeks glowed once more yet still babar had never given her the portrait of herself though he carried it with him more than once with that determination again he scarcely knew why except that it seemed to him the right thing to do why should she not have it but one day the brother and sister had wandered high over the melting snow slopes where the flowers lay thick as a carpet blue spring gentian and clustered pink primrose purple pansy and deep brown nodding columbines above a mosaic of forget me not and yellow crowsfoot great sweeps and drifts of flowers where the snow drifts ended and beyond in the far far distance in a dip of the hills a level line of clear cobalt blue yonder lies samarkand said babar glooming in a second with the thought of past defeat but his mind ever vagrant followed swiftly a line of new thought as he narrowed his long eyes to see better had i the quaint contrivance at the observatory there he went on did i not tell thee of it no well 'twas a thing with curved glasses in a box and it made far off things seem near but blurred sometimes still had i it i could mayhap see the green palace it stands high above the town dearest one her hands clasped idly over her knees as she sat on a little peak of rock and ice that rose out of the flowers was silent for a space then she said dreamily 'twas in the green palace was it not where kingship comes and goes that baisanghar was to die that time he escaped babar hesitated it was the first time his sister had mentioned her cousin's name to him but now that the subject had been broached might it not be better to take the opportunity offered he had the portrait with him why not have it out and have done with it after all it was a fitting place the green alp all starred with flowers reminded him of the andijan meadows and they of the green enamel frame starred with ruby turquoise amethyst topaz i have something here he said fumbling in his fur coat that i have meant to give thee for some months but i know not why so he began haltingly then warming to his subject told her in his own inimitable way every tiny touch giving life to the picture how and where he had found what he finally placed in her hands the girl who had listened coldly looked at it still more chillily 'twas not meant for me she said at last and her tone was as ice and he prized it little since he left it behind him babar with the returned miniature in his hand stared at her in confused amaze feeling that of a truth women were kittle cattle one could never count on them and all these months he had been afraid of exciting a storm of tears distinct ill usage was in his voice as he said gravely but thou hast not seen the verses writ behind and they are good i stake my word they are excellent and correct in every elision every poetic licence it may have been the bathos in the lad's last eager protest which kept the pathos of poor baisanghar's words from making full mark which kept the girl's lips from quivering overmuch which kept the mist of tears from overflowing to her cheeks as the words fell on the flower scented air so little to frail humanity turns grief to laughter and smiles to tears anyhow dearest one sat silent and a faint smile curved her thin red lips yea she said softly they are good verses but he was ever a poet and then suddenly the poetry which lies hid at the heart of all sorrow all longing all deprivation surged on her and her face lit up with passionate feeling give it me back brotherling give it me back let us leave it here here on this high unknown place among god's flowers here amid ice and snow here overlooking the palace where he would have died here close to high heaven where there is understanding her voice had risen as her thought rose and now rang out joyous triumphant lo the heft aurang will look down on my face night after night and the pole star will point the way to him ah baisanghar have patience have patience love will point the way she laid the portrait face upwards to the clear blue sunshiny sky on a cold slab of ice that filled up and looked as if it had filled up for centuries of chill summers and frost bound winters the wide clefts of the rock beside her then stood up and stepped down amid the flowers tearless radiant come brother she said it grows late let us descend they will be waiting but babar looked meditatively at the pictured face and then at the one before him transfigured by emotion so that is love he said at last with a curious impersonality in his tone truly it is wonderful and after all there is not so much difference between it and tears so in a flood came back to him that one glimpse he had had in the crystal bowl of his cousin's face he saw it again clearly he seemed to hear his voice telling of the frightened maiden he had never thought of her since such things passed quickly from his boyish mind but now the wonder came as to whether he would ever meet her he might without recognising her since he did not know who she was but dearest one might know such things were part and parcel of the woman's life his sister however was already half way down the slope and he had to run to overtake her do i know she echoed to his question quite calmly having had time to recover her serenity wherefore not such knowledges have to be kept by someone so we women guard it she whom mirza gharib beg deserted she spoke with distinct blame was well within the circle of distinction being both of the royal house and also of the lineage of sheik jami the divine poet on whom be peace therefore she deserved a better fate than to live her life in a house of rest as i shall live mine she added with conviction but thou art so young protested babar ever ready to follow any new lead of thought dearest one flashed out on him in her old way young one year older than she so there she was but a child and gharib beg remember was but two years older she paused then added hurriedly did i not tell thee we silly women guarded such trivial knowledge as our lives to judge by babar's women folk one of his many widowed aunts had joined the little camp on a visit he had endless aunts and he seemed to be a favourite with all they guarded other trivial knowledges as their lives also babar returning home of an evening would find a regular turkhi feast including goats' milk cheese fritters made of course after the family recipe spread out for his delectation and dearest one never forgot to put violet essence in the thick milk and plenty of sugar for the lad had a sweet tooth then as they sat round the great pine log fire at night isan daulet would call for a song none of those niggling persian odes about the beloved's eyebrows and a cup of wine the which was forbidden though many good men fell away from grace and were none the worse for it not in this world at any rate and for the next who could tell since the dear kazi was not there to lay down the law the kazi was a saint interrupted babar with certainty i know it first because the men who martyred him have all since died that is one proof then he was a wonderfully bold man most men have some anxiety or trepidation about them the kwaja had not a particle of either which is also no mean proof of sanctity old isan daulet chuckled then are all my family canonised she said and paradise will have small peace but sing boy a rattling turkhoman ballad and bawl it fairly if thou canst now a days but babar had learnt better than bawling over in uncle hussain's camp and though his grandmother shook her head over his rendering of toktamish khan still 'twas a fine song with a good stirring chant to it the pale white willows grow in the sand toktamish beg choose one to hobble thy horse's leg that thy bay steed stand thy red blood drips on the yellow sand toktamish khan wilt bind his wound wife of mirza jan with thy jewelled hand the wound is doleful the kiss was sweet toktamish kull which poison man makes thine eyes so dull and thy breath so fleet oh my bay horse neighed when i did sing and mir jan's wife swore she would love me all my life and gave me a ring thy steed will find him a rider soon and fair narghiss will have a new lover to cuddle and kiss ere another moon but thy mother is old she has lost her brave toktamish khan let her carry her sheaf to death's wide barn and dig her a grave the firelight danced on the young face as it sang cheerily the khanum his mother wept unobtrusively at the thought of what she would do if her young brave were to die old isan daulet beat time with precision dearest one smiled gently but nevian gokultash the heart of stone held up his finger hist he said a horse's steps not one but many a little detachment of loyalists headed by kasim beg arriving in hot haste with renewed hope babar stood up tall strong and threw his wide arms out as if to shake off inaction whence he asked briefly east west north or south there was weariness in the thought not in the tone he was ready to fight anywhere for kingship again though his heart sank at the futility of it all bokhara samarkand hissar and half a dozen other chief ships always changing hands but this a message of treaty from ali mirza who had held samarkand since it had dropped from babar's hand might mean something so he was in the saddle and off only to return then and half a dozen other times despondent to admit that his star was not yet in the ascendant isan daulet wearied of waiting at last and set off herself to moghulistan to levy troops to aid her grandson in the name of her dead husband the khanum went with her and dearest one took the opportunity of retiring with one of her old aunts to a house of rest so babar was left alone he would not remain at khojend however he felt that he had already taken too much from the loyalists there so in a state of irresolution and uncertainty he made for the border land of the pamirs beyond the white mountains there he remained amongst the nomad tribes perplexed and distracted with the hopelessness of his affairs and here as winter passed to spring once more a saintly kwaja also an exile and a wanderer came to visit him and having no help to give no advice to offer to one so down cast prayed over him and took his departure much affected and so was i writes babar frankly doubtless he was and yet before sunset that very day he must have been out on the hillside possibly hunting for new tulips in this new country for he descried a horseman making his way rapidly up the valley a horseman within half an hour without an instant's delay babar had backed his lean turkhoman mare and followed by a leaner troop of such friends as still clung to him kasim and nevian gokultash of course amongst the number was galloping for marghinan the place where they remove the stone from apricots and put in chopped almonds for a message had been sent by the governor of the town to say he was ready to give it up to its rightful owner and would hope for forgiveness for past offences it was then sunset and marghinan lay more than a hundred miles away as the crow flies all that night till noon next day the little band rode fiercely on on those wild hills there was no road to speak of one could but follow the water courses as the streams sought their level at noon next day they drew bridle for the first time they had not come far or fast yet so hard had been the way that their horses needed rest twelve hours to give them a chance and also in the close valley of khojend to secure night time for the first part of the march and they were off again this time to let sunrise pass to sunset and sunset pass to night before they again drew rein in the grey dawn drew rein and looked at each other doubtfully yet their goal lay not four miles ahead of them a shadowy hill crowned by a fort and scarce seen in the half light but the doubt was this they had ridden for forty eight hours up hill and down dale over breakneck precipices and roaring torrents without ever considering that they had no real warranty for so doing the governor of the town was one who was known to stickle at no crime with what confidence then could they unconditionally put themselves in his power so at least urged nevian gokultash others joined in and babar ever reasonable saw cogency in the doubt and ordered a halt for consideration out in the dawn the horses heads down taking a nibble of grass between heaving breaths the sweat running down from their polished backs the tired troopers too tired to dismount arguing pros and cons wearily until babar rising in his stirrups showed tall straight strong commanding gentlemen he said our reflections are not without foundation but we have been too late in making them we have now ridden three nights and two days without sleep or rest neither horse nor man has strength left there is no possibility of retreating since there is no place of safety to which we could retreat having come so far we must proceed therefore let us go forward remembering that nothing happens save by the will of god right turn gentlemen forward and forward it proved to be from that moment marghinan his the country people disgusted with the late usurpers crowded round their old young king of course grandmother isan daulet was in at the finish with her horde of two thousand wild moghul horsemen who nevertheless did good if barbarous service at akshi where treachery met with its just reward for the moghuls stripping their horses rode barebacked into the stream and sabred the escaping traitors in their boats so the peach trees had not shed their blossoms before by the grace of the most high and many real fine fights babar recovered his paternal kingdom of which he had been deprived for two years two years he could hardly believe it as he rode through on the mantle of lambskins between the fort of andijan and the river where not so long ago he had been playing leap frog when first king ship came to him nevian gokultash he cried suddenly an thou lovest me off from thy horse and give me a back like a kind soul i must leap to my kingdom once more he stood there laughing the embodiment of boyish youth and energy forgetful of past troubles eager to enjoy life ul la la shouted some of the nobles catching the spirit of the thing and throwing themselves from their horses so leap babar did not over nevian only but over half a score or more of the friends of his adversity including kasim who nearly tumbled over with laughter and joy and the young king as he once more cast himself face upwards on the soft furry little blobs of blossom amid a chorus of applause felt that the whole world was splendid indeed chapter vii blessed is he who has not to learn how the favour of fortune may change and turn whose head is not raised in his high estate nor his heart in misfortune made desolate nizami there is no use in talking quoth isan daulet decisively send the trays to ayesha begum my daughter and prepare the wedding comestibles it has been high time these two years back that zahir uddin mahomed got himself married but of a truth there was not the wherewithal one cannot marry out of a basket but now all is smooth so send for the bride god grant she be not so unwilling as the groom and in truth babar seated on the floor of course between his grandmother and his mother looked far from happy his hands lean supple strong hung over his grasshopper knees and his head small for the rest of his body had not its usual frank bearing i am not unwilling protested the young man lo it has to be done that i know 'tis the duty of kings to marry and have sons but see you i have no experience at all indeed i have never been so circumstanced as either to hear or witness any words expressive of the amorous passion and i have never seen my betrothed since i was five god forbid ejaculated the khanum piously but how then can i love her protested babar 'tis not like dearest one and cousin baisanghar a shriek of outrage drowned what he would have said not that either of the two good ladies really felt shocked but that in dealing with babar they held it wiser to adhere to the strictly conventional otherwise heaven only knew if he would not go off at a tangent as dearest one had done poor dearest one on whom the blow of uttermost fate had fallen at last for a terrible tale had come to andijan but a month before snuffing out the lamps of festival like a dust storm at a wedding for who could rejoice when they thought of a poor young prince who was nobody's enemy but his own like baisanghar strangled with a bowstring by the orders of the miserable and infidel like wretch worthless contemptible without birth or talents reputation or wisdom khosrau shah babar had been beside himself with rage and had expended every known epithet on the murderer who though he prayed regularly was black hearted and vicious of mean understanding slender talents faithless and a traitor a man who for the sake of the short and fleeting pomp of this vain world had done to death the sweetest prince the son of his old benefactor in whose service he had been and by whom he had been patronised and protected thus rendering himself accursed of god abhorred of men and worthy of shame and execration till the judgment day perpetrating his crimes too for the sake of trivial enjoyment and despite his power and place not having the spirit to face a barn door chicken the young man had poured all this and much more into his sister's ears hoping to comfort her but she had only turned her face to the wall and wept strange indeed were women folk she had been so composed when she herself renounced him but now that death had stepped in she was all tears the thought of her weeping brought him a quick excuse anyhow he remarked with evident relief there can be no weddings yet awhile my sister is not in condition for festivals isan daulet sniffed sisters are not indispensables to a marriage so be good boy babar and listen to reason do i not ever advise thee to thy benefit not ever retorted the young king sulkily thou did'st advise me to set my promise aside and let thy cursed moghuls and others plunder those i had sworn to protect not plunder boy replied the old lady shrilly but to resume their own property i care not said babar sternly and rising to go i say i was wrong to yield 'twas senseless to begin with to exasperate so many men with arms in their hands and then lo grandam i was precipitate and in affairs of state many things that appear reasonable at first sight require to be well weighed and considered in a hundred different lights ere orders are given i shall have trouble over that yet he stalked away in dignified fashion and his mother sighed he grows a man indeed 'tis time he married but i wonder will she be good daughter to me she will be good granddaughter to me that i'll warrant me retorted isan daulet viciously she would stand no nonsense from young chits so the marriage went on and babar performed his part of it with grave politeness and propriety he wore his wedding garments with a difference and when he sat beside his bride for the first time holding her hand and repeating the words after the officiating kazi he felt quite a thrill in fact he would like to have squeezed the little hand he held only it was so covered with rings and gew gaws that he was afraid of hurting it altogether the fateful she looked rather small but distinctly fetching though of course he could not see her face in her veil of jasmine blossoms they smelt however rather sickly that was in fact all that he vouchsafed to dearest one who late in the evening slipped in dressed in white from head to foot to wish her darling brother happiness i would she smelt of violets instead he said thoughtfully dost think dearest one it could have been the jasmine perfume and not the sweets that made me sick when i was five and dearest one laughed a laugh with a sob in it and said to her mother ere she returned to her house of rest he is not fond of her see you god forbid snapped isan daulet tartly lo he will love her when she is the mother of his son and dearest one was silent that might be though she doubted it but for the present she was right babar was not in love what is more he was shy the khanum his mother who found her town bred mincing and thoroughly amiable daughter in law quite an amusing distraction began by rallying him on his bashfulness but as the first period of his married life went on bringing a decrease of such affection as he had had and a corresponding increase of shyness raillery turned to tears then to anger until the gentle lady outraged by her son's behaviour would scold him with great fury and send him off like a criminal to visit his wife babar had however some excuse for his lack of interest marriage had come to him in the very moment when he needed all his vitality to keep his newly recovered throne what he had said to his grandmother concerning his overprecipitate permission for modified plunder had been true the inconsiderate order issued without sufficient foresight had caused commotions and mutinies the moghuls still dissatisfied had marched off in a huff good riddance of bad rubbish as babar said though he chafed inwardly at not having been able to control them amicably still the moghul horde had ever been the authors of every kind of mischief and devastation five separate times had they mutinied against him and not only against him that might have pointed to incompatibility of temper on his part but against every one in authority especially their own khans it was in the breed true was the verse if the moghul race had an angel's birth it still would be made of the basest earth were the moghul name writ in thrice fired gold 'twould be worth no more than steel wrought cold from a moghul's harvest sow never a seed for the germ of a moghul is false indeed thank god he was no moghul he was turkhoman born and bred before winter came on indeed the position of affairs had become critical half the nobles had sided with young jahangir who still claimed the throne and fighting was general all over the valley of ferghana to shut himself up in the town of andijan for the winter months would only be to leave the enemy free to ravage the country outside he therefore chose a spot on the skirts of the hills and cantooned his army there a pleasant spot with good cover for game an excellent sporting ground in fact containing plenty of mountain goats antlered stags and wild hogs in the smaller jungle too were excellent jungle fowl and hares then when such sport palled there were always the foxes which possessed more fleetness than those of any other place babar rode a hunting every two or three days while he remained in those winter quarters and regaled himself on the jungle fowl which were very fat keeping an eye all the time however on the enemy's movements and guarding andijan where the khanum and old isan daulet appeared to have forgotten wars and war's alarms in something more cognate to their woman's hearts something that was almost too delightful to be true babar when he first heard of the delightful prospect was all that could be desired affectionate overjoyed proud what else could he be when his mother hung round his neck hysterically and even dearest one's pale cheeks flushed at the future he shall be my son as well as yours brotherling she said lo i will be his best beloved aunt so that settles it and all silly women's talk about my marrying somebody does it not o king and babar as he sat holding his sister's hand as in the old days saw a vista of happiness before him it would be delightful imagine having a son of his very own ayesha begum could not complain of his coldness on that visit and he returned to his camp jubilant but the knowledge of what was to come made him restless of what use was an heir unless he was heir to something tangible ferghana divided against itself was no permanent position for either claimant but what of samarkand there his cousin ali who had no claim had just beaten weis his younger brother who had a claim doubtless through his mother but after his babar's since she was the younger daughter he sat on the snowy slopes waiting for bara singha or bear and ciphered it out he came back to camp and talked it over with kasim and the nobles praise be to god said the old swashbuckler we may see some fine fighting once again they were to see more than they had bargained for since when with the advancing spring babar and his army arrived before samarkand it was to find that they were pitted not against the weakling ali and his half hearted troops but against the great usbek raider shaibani khan who god knows why or wherefore had attacked bokhara taken it marched on to samarkand taken it by the treachery of a woman and was now there in undisputed possession babar felt that to attack the position overtly with his small force was madness but what of a surprise the usbek horde were strangers babar himself had been beloved during his short reign of a hundred days if once he could find himself within the walls the people of samarkand might declare in his favour at any rate they would not fight for the usbek that was certain it was worth a trial but those who were to attempt the forlorn hope must be picked men and there must be no attacking force before the city that would put the garrison on the alert in the meantime he would go to the mountains one thought clearer in high places summer was nigh on ere preliminaries were settled and babar with his picked band ready for swift attempt stood on the heights of yar ailak once more above him unseen in the darkness of the moonless night was the flower carpeted alp where dearest one's face watched the stars wheel the heft aurang the seven thrones showed in ordered array on the purple velvet of the night was one of them kept vacant for him he wondered or had baisanghar's poor ghost found it babar's mind was ever full of such whimsical thoughts they came to him unasked making his outlook on life many facetted many hued like the iridescent edge which had set a halo round all things in the crystal bowl the future seemed thus glorified to him as he sat looking out over the unseen city in the valley beyond his nobles his comrades were sitting round him revelling over the camp fire holding a sort of sacramental feast before the dangerous surprise come cried babar turning a light on his face brighter than the firelight let us have a bet on when we shall take samarkand to night to morrow or never to night cried nevian gokultash and the others followed suit half an hour afterwards they were in their saddles low bowed upon their peaks light scaling ladders slung alongside riding for all they were worth now or never the time was ripe shaibani khan himself lulled in security away on a marauding expedition the garrison unalarmed confident it was midnight when they halted in the pleasure ground before the walls of samarkand here babar detached eighty of his best men they were if possible to scale the wall noiselessly by the lovers' cave most deserted portion of the fortifications make their way silently to the turquoise gate overpower the guard and open the doors babar himself with the remainder of his men was to ride up to the gate and be ready to force their way in how still the night was the stars how bright the seven thrones wheeling in their ordered array to the dawn what had fate ordered in his life babar waiting his hand gripped on his sword hilt in the dark way of the gate listened eagerly for a sound the horses' hoofs deadened by enswathing felt had made no sound the very chink of steel on steel had not been heard all was silent as the grave what did fate hold in store hark a sentry's sleepy call what of the hour of the night what indeed then in one second tumult uproar a clashing of sword on sword the gate open the gate shouted babar a swift bombardment of dull blows stones anything on iron bolts and bars a shiver a sudden yielding and the wide doors swung open an instant after babar was through the gateway king of samarkand he knew it even as he galloped on through the sleeping streets to the citadel a drowsy shopkeeper or two roused by the clatter looked out from the shops apprehensively then offered up prayers of thanksgiving so by ones and twos the city woke to relief and gratitude by dawn the hunted usbeks had disappeared dead or fled and the chief people of the town bringing such offerings of food ready dressed as they had at hand were flocking to the great arched hall of the palace to do homage to their new king and congratulate him on his success' babar received them with his usual frank simple dignity for nearly a hundred and forty years he said samarkand had been the capital of his family a foreign robber none knew whence had seized the kingdom unrighteously but almighty god had now restored it and given him back his plundered and pillaged country which he would proceed to put in order he did it to his heart's content he was now nineteen the birth of his son was nigh at hand and all must be ready for the expected heir so the next month or two passed in preparations and congratulations babar who felt the strength of the pen as well as that of the sword wrote endless letters to the neighbouring princes and chiefs assuring them of his favour and requesting like return from them these he despatched duly accredited with rose scent and gold dust and brocaded bags but not so many came back as went out moghulistan was slow to recognise the value of peaceful persuasion and looked askance at the young general who could surprise so wily a foe as shaibani khan and yet think it worth while to write missives like a scrivener but one letter came which brought the young king unmixed delight for it was from the incomparable ali shir at khorasan an incomparable letter without one word astray a pure pleasure from start to finish the young king answered it boldly even daring so far as to write a turkhi couplet of his own composing on the outside thereof a turkhi couplet that was not half bad for he was growing to be a man in mind as well as body so all things went merry as a marriage bell his grandmother his mother and the mother of his expected heir arrived by slow marches from andijan and were lodged in the birthplace and deathplace of kings the green palace and dearest one came too in the white robes of a sainted canoness eager to take up her position of aunt in ordinary a position of honour with the chagatai family babar himself had half a dozen or so such benificent ladies ready for all festivities all condolences so one hot night he found himself looking distractedly at the moon in a balcony of the women's apartments hurrying feet and whisperings had gone on it seemed to him for hours but these feet did not hurry they lagged a daughter a miserable daughter said his mother's voice full of tears lo i wonder ayesha could think of such a thing it is unpardonable let us say no more put in isan daulet when a woman disgraces herself the less said the better we will get thee a more dutiful wife sonling even dearest one's face was downcast utterly a daughter echoed babar and paused then he said eagerly may i not see it motherling 'tis my first child anyhow and they showed it him a naked new born baby wrapped in a cotton quilt it looks old as if it had been born a long time he said reflectively then his fine strong young hand touched the tiny crumpled fingers tentatively lo they are like little worms he said and laughed aloud suddenly a gay young laugh she is not bad my daughter i will call her 'glory of women' and almost every day he would find time to go in to the women's apartments and look at her but after a month or forty days the little glory of womanhood went to share the mercy of god she was his first child and at the time he was just nineteen chapter viii a moment's halt a momentary taste of being from the well amid the waste and lo the phantom caravan has reached the nothing it set out from omar khayyam fate had called a halt in babar's life a court had once more gathered round him and as king of samarkand a city of colleges and culture this was of different stamp from that of andijan it occupied itself with other things than the edge of a sword blade or the merits of a polo ball lo said mulla binai the poet his voice lubricated with artificial adulation to extreme oiliness i have at last found fitting memorial for the magnificent victory of the king in these poor words 'tell me my soul the conquering day fateh babar bahadur' i say the horrid doggerel with its inlay of numerical letters giving the date of babar's surprise of samarkand was allowed to pass muster in that crowd of flattering courtiers only kasim beg bluff as he had been from the beginning said smartly good enough if so be 'tis accurate but of that thank god i know naught for whilst thou rememberest fine fights by dots and strokes i keep them by the dents on my good sword the old noble disliked binai he disliked all poets in general but this one in particular he knew nothing good of him but his riposte to ali shir who was worth ten of him since he had at least been born a beg and who before he was bitten by the mad craze for jingling words had struck a good few shrewd blows for the right besides he had been author and patron of many useful inventions and it was not his fault if the gilded youth of herat named every new fashion after him and when he in consequence of an earache bound up his face with a kerchief bound up theirs also and called it a la mode ali shir still binai's riposte to the sarcasms which had driven him from herat was a good joke to order a ridiculous pad for the ass he was to ride and call it the ali shir pad the recollection of it always made good old kasim laugh broadly the humour of it suited his sturdy outlook an outlook that was disturbed by the jingle jangle of words and wits that began to arise about his young master it was all very well and affairs were doubtless in a most prosperous state all the same there was no counting on any continuance of fine weather with half a dozen claimants to the throne and shaibani khan close at hand the usbek raider was no man to give in because of one reverse his whole life was war so kasim frowned at culture and as prime minister looked to his weapons it was not however for many months that his fear came true and shaibani reinforced appeared again on the horizon of babar's world but when he did the young king set aside everything else and buckled on his sword once more with zest he had been studying military art in his great ancestor timur's memoirs and was eager for a pitched battle no sooner therefore did shaibani's hordes show themselves than the young general marched to meet them and over impatient precipitated a collision before his own re enforcements of over five thousand men had time to join him but it was his first pitched battle he was keen as mustard and had planned it all out on paper beautifully on strategical lines and the astronomers were to the fore with a lucky conjunction of stars so the right and left wings marched out in orderly array and wheeled admirably to meet the first attack of their flank but somehow this separated babar from his staff of veterans who possibly did not believe in the virtue of disciplined movements and though in person he led a dashing and impetuous charge of his centre on the foe which drove the usbeks back to the point of rout shaibani would not accept defeat he stood firm despite his officers' advice to withdraw while he could and continued the wild desert tactics of repeated charges on the enemy's flank repeated withdrawals to wheel and reform and babar's army but half disciplined divided by conflicting ideals became hopelessly confused his moghul troops refusing to obey orders reverted to their old habit of killing and plundering with the result of rout complete absolute rout that night the young leader stern and calm despite the ache at his heart for his own broken ideals as well as for the loss of the many begs of the highest rank the many admirable soldiers the many devoted friends who had perished in the action held a council of war in the citadel as to what had best be done under the circumstances capitulation on terms or unconditional defence belief in their leader and the devotion of the andijan nobles carried the day against the more lukewarm samarkandis it was resolved to hold the citadel to the death to the very last drop of blood and with vitality renewed by the need for immediate action babar set to work strengthening the fortifications here at any rate he was master bricks and earth could not disobey orders they must remain where they were put yet most of the nobles sent away their wives and families secretly babar's mother and sister however refused to leave their beloved one whose fortunes they had followed for so long through thick and thin grandmother isan daulet also remained of course her brave old heart rather gloried in the thought of a siege and with all the hatred of a desert born chagatai she hated the usbek raider who had dared to beat her grandson though on that point she and babar had many words he reviling her moghul horde as the cause of his failure she asserting it to be his cramping conditions which had prevented the success of the old methods of warfare that had served his fathers well enough as for ayesha begum she had long since retired in a huff to her own relations making as her excuse the plea of grief for the death of the little glory of womanhood but babar knew better she had not cared at all her other plea that he did not love her was more to the purpose anyhow it was as well thought the young husband grimly she would only have wept and been uncomfortable for discomfort was inevitable even from the very beginning of the siege at any rate for the men the nightly round of the ramparts alone entailed lack of proper sleep since but a small portion of them was ridable the rest had to be done on foot and so long was the circuit that starting at dusk it was dawn before every place had been inspected still even with the small force at his command babar kept the foe at bay though more than once he had a narrow squeak of it once when a feint attack of shaibani's on the iron gate covered a daring escalade at the needle makers gate an escalade that was all but successful four of the attacking party were actually over the wall dozens of others were swarming up it when one kuch beg noble by birth and by nature caught a glimpse of someone where someone should not be to draw his sword single handed as he was and spring to the attack was the work of an instant it was an exploit for ever to be cited to his honour though his ringing war shout brought three more heroes to his aid even so there were but four against dozens but furious blows daredevil recklessness do much and almost before the nodding guards were roused the danger was over the escaladers driven back to fall a confused heap of ladders and men leaving a dead body or two on the ramparts then kasim beg sallied out again and again to engage the enemy's pickets and returned bringing heads to set on pikes upon the walls for war was war in those days there was no talk of red crosses and ambulance wagons and yet two women went about inside the fortress bandaging wounds and applying simples for the khanum babar's mother could not bear to see pain and though old isan daulet sniffed at new fangled ways asserting that men could but die once and that it was waste of time to tend a common soldier as though he were a noble she came of a fighting tribe and could give many an inherited recipe for the healing of cuts the prevention of wound fever then dearest one despite her youth had a claim as one who had renounced the world to freedom for good works so mother and daughter went about in their close white veils applying the simples which the old woman pounded and compounded and doing all they could for the brave men who were helping the beloved of their eyes to keep his kingdom they could do no less they could do no more so at least said the khanum as often in the dark nights the mother and daughter lay awake trembling in each other's arms listening during an attack or a sally grandmother isan daulet would fall foul of them for their red eyes when a man comes in to his food she would say reeling from blows at his head or sick at stomach with hunger 'tis no comfort to him to see tears or the signs of tears thou sayest daughter thou can'st do no more for thy son then i can i can make him angry and she did so that babar went from his breakfast with his soft heart hardened to disdain dearest one used to admire her grandmother's pluck not to care if one hurt the beloved for his good that was great and she would wring her hands tight and say to herself i told him long ago that there was nothing i would not do for him but there is nothing nothing i can do so the months dragged by harvest came and went without bringing fresh supplies to the beleaguered fortress and shaibani cynical somewhat afraid of his daring young antagonist withdrew from actual collision and contented himself with blockade starvation would do the work without his aid the grain for the horses had already given out however while the leaves lasted the mulberry trees and the rose wood trees in the fortified gardens were stripped and did for fodder but the winter winds ended this supply and the shift was made to keep some few horses alive with the rispings of wood moistened with water and sprinkled with salt a sorry appearance was that of the poor steeds on such miserable fare but babar's charger did better with a daily share of his master's bread though the big boned lad could ill spare it for all alike were on short commons and they grew shorter day by day the dying horses were killed and eaten the donkeys went next then the cats and dogs when matters came to this pass however night after night men brave men began to let themselves down over the wall and make their escape the haggard young king never knew when he called a council of war what trusted what honoured face might not be absent yet still he clung to that last drop of blood the oath might have been foolish since as the ancients said a fortress can only be maintained by the joint action of head and feet and hands that is to say by generalship two friendly forces on either side and a good supply of water and stores as the starting point of all still he had made it and he meant to stick to it the others might go if they pleased if i could only secure thine and my mother's and my grandmother's safety he said to dearest one the other few women also he added though there is little fear for them they count not enough for harm and shaibani hath his army well in hand that is how he scored against me those accursed moghuls of my grandmother's would not obey orders if they killed a man they plundered him and what is that when a turning movement hath been ordered ah it was devilish devilish and the tall thin young figure would throw out its arms almost appealingly for babar was ever high strung and his nerves were going he gave himself no rest either night and day he was always on the watch so it did not matter so much to him as to others when shaibani khan changing his tactics commenced making the darkness hideous by beating large kettle drums and sounding the alarm yet the young king shook his fist over the battlements at his foe who had now pitched his headquarters tent close to the lovers' cave and said to dearest one it is not fair and yet it is i would do it in his place and yet i don't know i don't know he was very near the end of his tether yet his grip was tight as ever and he would sit on the top of the gateway with a crossbow and shoot at everyone and everything living that showed itself i struck a palish white coloured horse to day he said to his sister with a cruel exultant look in the eyes that had always been so tender for god's dumb creatures and it fell dead would it had been a man and dearest one turned pale this was worse than death worse than anything anything in the wide wide world she lay face downwards beside her mother that night and thought and thought and thought until the grey dawn came then she sat up and looked at her mother sleeping beside her yes it was best the plan was worth the trying at any rate and she would be the only one to suffer she lay down again and laid her head on that gentle loving sleeping breast and the motherly arms unconscious as they were closed round her and held her fast until she too slept outwearied that morning she was closeted with her grandmother for hours and at the midday meal the old woman's eyes showed red but dearest one's were clear and bright when the mind is made up there is no use in tears the evening was stormy the bitter east wind swept along the ramparts and drove the dust in blinding clouds into the eyes of all the very foe ceased from their disturbing shouts of alarm and on many a post the sentry slept awhile did one at the wicket gate by the lovers' cave sleep or did he not and did the white robed figure that slipped after dusk through the deserted streets pass out unseen to challenge fate in the usbek leader's camp or did dearest one send a message only or was it only chance which the very next morning brought the ultimatum to the haggard young king who knows certain it is it came there was no reason shaibani wrote why those who had been brave foes should not be brave friends none could deny the king of samarkand's bravery few would care to deny his own why then should they not be friends a marriage was ever the best way of securing peace let babar therefore give his sister khanzada begum in lawful marriage to his foe who be it said was in strong enough position to take her and so form a lasting alliance my sister burst out babar in a fury go back to the savage usbek shaibani robber raider sir ambassador and tell him that zahir ud din mahomed is not his peer he is his master this was all very well in the saying it sent the blood growing a bit sluggish from sheer starvation flooding to heart and brain but afterwards when the envoy had gone and the hungry anxious faces of the few who still remained to him showed bitter disappointment he leant his head on his hands drearily in the quiet of the women's room and tried to put himself in the place of those bearded begs to whom a woman's honour or happiness or indeed affection was as a rule of small account he could not of course assent and yet it seemed a pity that he could not and while he sat crouched in upon himself spent and weary dearest one herself came and crouched beside him and laid her pretty head on his shoulder brother she said i have heard come let us talk it over as in old days so let me hold thy poor hand as we used to do for we have ever been friends babar ling have we not her voice was calm and steady despite the clamant note of tears that was in every word talk not of it sister i will not have it he muttered and his voice was broken husky by god and his prophet i could strike him dead for the thought that i could be such a cur as even to think of it she shrank just for a second many men would think it naught she said but it is because it means much to thee that thou must think i will not think he cried passionately i will not be coerced i will not be cozened i babar take the consequence he left her baffled yet still determined to return to the charge in a day or two and in starvation times a day or two means much so much that she spoke sternly with finality wilt thou kill thy mother by thy pride babar listen long years ago i said i would do aught for thee and i answered i would never ask aught interrupted her brother hotly but she went on unheeding and now thou deniest me the right to save thee i who have so few pleasures lo as thou knowest my heart is dead for love and this man this shaibani is not all bad i i know he is not brotherling women have borne more for love than i shall have to bear maybe for the man must be kind in a way for for if it ended babar he could take me without marriage so grandmother says babar started up with an oath so she also is against me yet in his heart of hearts he knew that the old woman spoke truth it was generous in shaibani even to offer marriage i will not have it he cried i will not yield i would sooner kill thee myself thou wilt kill us all she said calmly then she broke down and clung to him sobbing let it be brotherling for my sake there is so little i can do let me do this the quick tears of understanding ran down his cheeks but he shook his head and left her so after a day or two yet another proposition came from shaibani to his brave foe babar might go with bare life taking his womenkind with him if he chose provided he capitulated utterly and acknowledged he was beaten there were parleyings and parleyings and who knows what secret promisings beside what innocent lies what heart broken yielding on babar's part at last protesting vainly that had he had the slightest hope of relief or had he had another week's stores remaining he would never have listened to either threats or entreaties he agreed to capitulate for bare life to him and his his mother his sister his grandmother these three must share his freedom the others must take their chance of horses or remain unharmed grandmother isan daulet however flatly refused to come she was too old she said to be cocked up on a horse for days she was not afraid thrice already when she was young and good looking she had fallen into the enemies' hands and had been unmolested save once and how that business ended babar knew so being now wrinkled and undesirable she would just remain and mayhap give shaibani a piece of her mind so her horse had better go to mingilek gokultash who was perchance over good looking it was ever best not to put temptation in men's way besides dearest one might like to have her foster sister with her it was convenient to have some woman one could trust beside one in dangerous times as the old woman spoke she held her granddaughter by the hand and her old fingers tightened themselves on the young ones with a grip firm as steel soft as a caress and dearest one stooped and kissed the old face on the lips so by midnight all was ready for the preconcerted escape the few sorry horses left in the citadel were standing saddled the enemy's pickets it is to be presumed were looking another way babar fierce miserable helped his mother to her pad and settled the stirrups for her he could scarcely see for the hot tears held back so angrily in his eyes he could scarcely speak for the hard held breath that seemed to choke him defeated flying for his life no not for his own only for theirs also he gave a glance round at his party is everyone there is everyone ready and from the midst of the little crowd clustering round the fugitives with sobs and tears a voice came clearly yea brother i am ready it was dearest one's voice that must be she leaning from her horse to whisper a word to old isan daulet who stood waving farewells then in god's name let us begone and end the business he shouted fiercely leapt to his charger dug spurs to its flanks and was off careless of disturbance he had sold himself for the sake of those who loved him man and woman alike but the blackness as of death was before his eyes he could not think he could do nothing but dig spurs to his horse and ride on recklessly and the night itself was dark as death he had to rein up amid the great branches of the soyd canal and with difficulty rallied his party to the right road yet still entangled in the intricacies of the irrigated fields there was time for no other thought save that of getting as far from samarkand as possible before the dawn since though the usbek leader himself had given order for free pass his followers still less his allies were not to be trusted the sky was grey with coming day before they reached the comparative safety of a wild valley set amid encircling hills here babar called a minute's halt to breathe the horses and for the first time turned to take stock of those who followed him his keen eye took in his mother's veiled form but that bundle like a sack of corn that crumpled heap like a withered rose leaf neither of these were dearest one she rode in a flash a sense of pride at her upright carriage on her horse came to him even as a suffocating leap of his heart made him speechless for a second an awful fear seized him he knew and yet he would not know what had happened khanzada begum he muttered hoarsely where where is she no one spoke and anger hopeless helpless anger and grief kept him silent then someone said almost fearfully mayhap in the night time in the darkness it is a lie burst out babar it is a lie i have been tricked then something of the innate truth that was ever in his soul made him pause he ought to have known he ought to have guessed foes were not usually so generous and he saw himself not altogether free from blame i have tricked myself i ought to have known he burst out i oh may god's curse light on everyone everyone so he stood his face turned towards the distant city for a moment then with a reckless laugh he loosed the rein on his horse's neck and threw his arms above his head come on he shouted as the horse bounded forward we are free let us ride to hell to hell and damnation and his laughter echoed back bringing terror to his mother's heart he is beside himself she cried after him kasim for god's sake keep him from harm but kasim and kambar ali his squire were already at the gallop and the sound of their horses' feet followed babar as he fled from what from everything in the wide world from anger love remorse helpless grief even from resolve not to be beaten his nerves were unstrung for the moment his one thought was escape but only for a moment the sound of those galloping hoofs behind him brought immediate self control immediate grip on kingly dignity he turned back on his saddle to cast a word that would re instate him in sanity to those following fools a race he cried gaily come on a race let it be ten dinars but even as he spoke he overbalanced perhaps he felt giddy perhaps the girths on his starving horse were all too slack anyhow the saddle turned with him and he fell fell clear on his head he was up again however ere they reached him standing unsteadily with dazed eyes passing his hand gently backwards and forwards over his brow what was it all about he murmured cheerfully i've clean forgotten it all and he had he mounted again after a minute and rode on but the memory of that night had gone out of his mind for ever and aye chapter ix think in this battered caravanserai whose doorways are alternate night and day how sultan after sultan with his pomp abode his hour or two and went his way omar khayyam those first few days of despair were as a dream the world and all that is in it showed to babar's eyes like a phantasy of sleep he lay and rested at a friendly village passing from the extreme of famine to plenty from an estate of danger and calamity to peace and ease the nice fat flesh the bread of fine flour well baked the sweet melons and excellent grapes in great abundance all these made him feel sensibly the pleasures of peace and plenty for enjoyment after suffering abundance after want come with an increased relish and afford a more exquisite delight it was the first time in his life that he had passed from the injuries of his enemies and the pressure of actual hunger to the ease of security and he revelled in it like the wholesome hearted and for the time mindless creature that he was but memory of a sort came back to him after a few days and he grew restless so they marched on and as he rode over the hills or walked leading his mother's pony discontent began once more to leaven his glad content the world in these lower lying districts was beautiful in the early springtide but there was something more in life than mere beauty there was something else needed to make it splendid i will go back to where we were in the white mountains he said one day i was happy there and so was dearest one it was the first time he had mentioned his sister's name and his mother looked at him anxiously but he said no more nature was dealing in kindly fashion with him and bringing memory back by slow degrees but at bishagher where they halted a few days it was like to have been otherwise for there they came across an old duenna of babar's mother who having been left behind in samarkand because of the scarcity of horses had nothing daunted trudged after her mistress on foot the two women sobbed on each other's necks while the one told and the other listened to the piteous tale of a marriage which after all had not been so bad as it might have been because of old isan daulet's masterful spirit but they said nothing to the menfolk about it all it was as well that their boy should hear as few details as possible and here the first possible place for news since those long months of siege tidings came of family deaths at tashkend it was fourteen years since babar's mother had been there and seen her people and now when they were hopeless homeless and when moreover she had her old governess to serve her once more the time seemed fitting for a visit so she went and for the first time for many years babar was left alone without any hostages to fortune and one of the first things he did with his liberty was to climb a certain hill all set with flowers which he and his sister had climbed one spring day in the past the gentians were as blue the primulas as pink as ever and the mosaic of forget me nots and yellow crowsfoot lay almost inconceivably bright as ever the blue sky grazing ground for fleecy white flocks of clouds stretched away beyond the hills to that faint bluer line of distant samarkand all was as it had been and the green enamel frame set with jewels like flowers lay on the transparent ice where she had put it he had not noticed that before one could see through the slab see green grass blades and a half opened flower bud that had been held in chill prison for years and years and years it was quaint utterly when her face her portrait had gone the rain had washed it away the vellum on which it had been painted lay white as snow yes quaint utterly the icy grip had kept its hold the warm sunshine had let slip its prize he sat down idly his head resting in his hands yes her face had gone what matter now if there was place or grace beside it for another poor baisanghar and poor infinitely poorer dearest one for the first time the full meaning of what had happened came over him he turned round passionately hid his face among the flowers and cried like a child ishk and ashk love and tears how little divided them so the thought of his dead crippled cousin came to him and the memory of that vivid fate defying face stood between him and despair the crystal bowl yes he would laugh as he quaffed life had brought him strange adventures let her bring more he was ready for them quite ready in his manhood to take what the years might hold for boyhood had gone that had capitulated with samarkand he did not formulate all this clearly he simply felt it felt the keen joy in life come back to him as he sat up once more and looked out over god's beauties with still swimming eyes and the tears were magnifying glasses a quaint conceit that might be worked up into a couplet or perchance a quatrain baisanghar would have done it finely he worked well on such finniken fancies but he had been wrong in the verses he had written on the back of the enamel frame were they there still aye they had been protected from the tears of rain he read the lines over feeling as he read them that there was something in them that lacked so as he felt words came to him for he was born with that artistic temperament which cannot help trading on its own most sacred emotions perhaps because such natures see vaguely that individualism is a snare to the soul that all things worth recording are part of a greater personality than their own and the outcome of feeling and words ran thus seven thrones seven sins seven stars but not one thing that bars life's love life's tears the crushed grape fills the bowl with wine for the sad soul beyond these years he jumped up feeling quite pleased with himself for they were the first verses in that measure he had ever composed after this when he was wandering barefoot over hill and dale he would sit down when he found some pleasant spot and string rhymes together for he was in a backwater mentally and bodily for twenty years he had battled with fate over trivialities since what after all were ferghana and samarkand and hissar only tiny little bits of god's earth he was beginning to be a trifle weary of it all to long for a larger horizon so he sent off on the pretext of getting news the few followers who had remained with him while he nevian gokultash and another wandered farther and farther higher and higher up the white mountains until they reached the roof of the world and there they lodged awhile in the felt tents of a shepherd and lived on sheeps' milk cheese and buckwheat cakes their host was a man of some eighty years but his mother was still alive and of extreme age being at this time no less than one hundred and eleven years old and in full possession of her faculties indeed the circumstances of the great timur's invasion of india remained fresh in her memory owing doubtless to her having been in her youth greatly interested in one who had been in his army she was a hale old woman smoke dried yet apple cheeked who loved to hear herself talk especially when the tall good looking young stranger sat at her feet fixing his hazel eyes that were at once so sad and so merry on her whirling pirn as she twisted the brown wool for the blankets how it whirled and leaped and spun as the withered old hand jerked the thread so the hand of fate jerked men's lives setting them spinning like tops into the shadows out into the firelight again always always spinning so the great khan was feeding his dogs being in those days infidel when shaikh jumal ud din the divine came to him 'am i better than this dog' quoth timur 'or is he better than i' and the shaikh smiled 'if the king has faith he is better than his dog but if he has no faith then is his dog better than he since the dog believes in a master' so the great khan said the creed immediately wah murmured the circle of shepherds but babar would press for tales of the great invasion and sometimes the old lady would begin at the very beginning and tell how timur's soldiers imitating their leader would make their left arms straight as the letter i and their right arms crooked as a k and so write death in the blood of their enemies how they let fly their arrows as the moon lets fly shooting stars so that the blood sodden hillsides showed like a drift of red tulips or she would drone on it was a long story over the battle of the mire where the enemy not having strength to fight sought help from the magic rain stone so that though the sun was in the warrior a host of dark clouds suddenly filled the sky the thunder resounded the lightnings flashed the water descended from the eyes of the stars until the voice of noah was heard praying a second time for deliverance from the deluge then the beasts of the field swam like fishes the skin of the horses' bellies adhered to the crust of the earth the feathers of the arrows damped off their notches came out neither men nor horses could move by reason of the rain so she would maunder on until babar would say impatiently get on to india mother i would fain be there myself and he would hardly listen as she once more beginning at the very beginning would detail the eight hundred thousand men provided with rations for seven years and each accompanied with two milch kine and ten milch goats so that when stores were exhausted they might live on milk and when milk dried up they could convert the animals themselves into provisions it was all doubtless very wise of timur god rest his soul who was ever great on the commissariat but he babar preferred the laconic remark in his great ancestor's autobiography the princes of india were at variance with one another resolved to make myself master of the indian empire did so it was however the more intimate personal experiences which the old woman held by virtue of that dead interest of hers which fired babar's imagination but these fragments of a half forgotten past were not always to be got at the long years of common round and daily task had overlaid them it needed a subtle touch upon the instrument to make it vibrate once more but babar found a key there was a certain turkhoman ballad called the maid of the spring which invariably unlocked the old woman's memory so often as they sat over the camp fire at night babar smiling to himself would say a song a song let us sing 'the maid of the spring' together once more grandmother there is none sings it as thou dost which was true still the toneless treble of the old voice whining away like the fine whing of a mosquito did not sound so bad against the rich baritone and the youngest maiden could not have nodded and becked more or looked more arch and perhaps the old heart beat as quickly as a young one such things do not go by age and this is what they sang in somewhat monotonous antiphon he maid of the spring i'm thirsty i pray a drop of water i must away god bless you my girl and don't be slow give me a drink and let me go she i don't give drinks to strange young men who come a swaggering down the glen naught you'll get from my pitcher to day drink for yourself and go your way he maid of the spring i cannot alight i'm far too tired i'm wearied quite i haven't time god bless you my dear give me a drink i can't stay here she the birds sing sweet in the spring they say it's sweeter still when i tune my lay but tired man should sleep in his bed farewell god's blessing be on your head he give me some water you pretty dear if i'd only time you need not fear my darling a drink from that stoup of thine be it water or be it wine she many men travel along this way all are thirsty but none can stay take my pitcher and drink if you will a thirsty man must have his fill he your brows are arched by a pen i swear your teeth are pearls i will treat you fair get down from my horse and wait an hour give me your lips my sweet my flower she roses and violets grow our groves no one may pluck them but he who loves my brother has slaves and sticks a main drink and be off it soon will rain he darlingest dear let it storm or rain my wide felt cloak shall shelter us twain pitcher and all leap up and ride we'll find a kiss at the water's side she my love my love have you come at last drop the pitcher and hold me fast there are my lips before we fly out to a new world you and i and now for india babar would cry when the applause was over i want to hear about the size of it and the fruit and flowers of it and all about it see you grandmother begin and tell me of the young woman thy man met at lahore then thou wilt remember to a nicety so the summer passed until old isan daulet arriving from samarkand with news of dearest one set babar's mind a jogging once more over his enemy shaibani but there was nothing to be done in winter time such a bitter cold winter too more than one man died of it and even babar himself admitted that after diving sixteen times in swift succession into a river that was only unfrozen in the middle by reason of its swift current the extreme chilliness of the water quite penetrated his bones as well it might then early spring brought a great grief which gave pause to energy nevian gokultash was done to death by a scoundrel who was jealous of babar's affection for him and who had the temerity to say that faithful creature had fallen over a precipice when he was drunk nevian who adhered so strictly to the law of islam nevian who had always sided for sobriety who had been to the full as urgent as old kasim beg against a king giving himself up to wine babar helpless to follow the murderer felt deeply the death of his playmate in childhood the companion of his boyhood there were few persons for whose loss he would have grieved so much or so long for a week or ten days he thought of nothing else and the unbidden tears were ever in his eyes after this a great restlessness set in fostered by old isan daulet whose whole life had been one long succession of battles and murders and sudden deaths and whose belief in moghul troops never wavered why she suggested not go to his uncles the khans at tashkend his mother had been ill she would like to see him once more and if his tongue was sufficiently careful amongst his thirty two teeth he might get substantial help for what gloomed babar to get back akshi and lose andijan or get andijan and lose akshi 'tis all one in the end not the fine fighting child replied the old lady craftily that is the same be it in gehannum or bihisht hell or heaven that was undoubtedly true and there was no good to be gained by rambling from hill to hill as he had been doing so once more the young adventurer gathered together a very scanty band of followers for old kasim beg who till then had never left him had come to words with isan daulet over these same moghuls and refused to accompany him i say not sire remonstrated the wise old soldier that these men are bad soldiers for me but they are for the most exalted who has ideas of discipline besides i care not to risk my own neck for a chance in obedience to the most exalted's commands i beheaded quite a number of these men in the last campaign for marauding wherefore therefore should i go amongst their mourning relatives i will come if there be fighting then there is no leisure and little desire for private revenge blood can be let anywhere and one corpse is as good as another so kasim went with his immediate adherents towards hissar and babar set off to tashkend with rather a heavy heart in a somewhat didactic mood also for resting for a day or two beside a spring in the lower hills he caused a verse to be inscribed on a stone slab which formed one side of the well where the water gushed in from the hill above to disappear into the earth when it had run through a masonry trough many a man has rested and has drunk thy water and like thee o spring has sunk swift to a grave where he lies all forgot conqueror or vanquished libertine or monk he was not however at home in the rubai as he had not at that time studied with much attention the style and phraseology of poetry indeed one of his first actions on reaching tashkend was to submit some of his compositions to the khan who had pretensions to taste and who moreover wrote verses himself though his odes to be sure were rather deficient in manner and substance the younger poetaster however did not get either explicit or satisfactory criticism and came to the conclusion that his uncle had no great skill in poetic diction he did not know for instance that in the turkhi language it was allowable by poetic licence to interchange certain letters for the sake of the rhyme he will think thee a nincompoop stormed isan daulet why did'st not show him thy sword play he may see that ere long quoth babar grimly and went straight away to write the first ghazel of six couplets he ever composed i have found no faithful friend in the world save my own sad soul dear heart thou must give and spend on thyself thy confidence whole nightingale sings to the rose roses give scent to the bird dreams one of the thorny foes the other of passion deferred the exile must live apart to his coffers none give or lend the banished one holds his heart to his soul as lover and friend he was quite pleased with this effusion and sang it at a festive party soon after with great gusto but the next morning he found that the golden clasp of his girdle had been stolen by one of the appreciative audience moghuls again chapter x a blow or two and then the fighting ends the sword seeks scabbard and the warrior wends through death's wide door were it not wiser then to sleep until retreat its message sends so vaguely thought babar as life went on dully with the family party at tashkend most of his servants had left from absolute want one or at most two attendants were all that he could muster when he went to pay his compliments to the khan his uncle once indeed he accompanied the latter on a foray but it was a useless sort of expedition he the khan took no part beat no enemy he simply went out and came back again the young man spent much of his time with his mother who was convalescing but slowly and she naturally after so many years of absence saw much of her sisters and cousins most of them elderly women inclined to make much of the handsome young king errant whose melancholy never could withstand the faintest joke for all that babar at the bottom of his heart was utterly dissatisfied with himself and his world never since the debacle at samarkand had he found himself again the light hearted intensely vital person who taking things as they came could yet turn them to his own uses he began to tell himself privately that rather than pass his life as he was now doing homeless and purposeless it would be better to retire into some corner where he might live unknown and undistinguished that rather than exist in distress and abasement far better were it to flee away from the sight of man so far as his feet could carry him in his infancy he remembered he had always had a strong desire to see china but had never been able to accomplish his wish because of being a king and having a duty towards his relations and connections now he no longer had a throne now his mother the only tie left for ayesha his wife had never returned to him was safe with her mother and her brother now therefore was the time his mother however he knew well would not support the proposition besides he had still a few followers who having attached themselves to him with very different hopes would be bitterly disappointed at his project he could not bear to hurt anyone's feelings so he devised a plan in order to get away quietly he had never seen his other uncle the younger khan of outer moghulistan why should he not go in this slack time and pay him a visit there seemed indeed no reason against this and babar was on the very point of starting when a messenger arrived hot haste to say that the younger khan himself was on his way to see his nephew and his nephew's mother it was a blow babar's plan was utterly disconcerted but being like all his race full of family affection he set off with ever so many elderly khanums with beautiful high sounding names to meet his uncle such a meeting as it was so many embracings and kneelings and yet more embracings some ceremonious others quite without form or decorum after which the great circle of cousins and aunts and uncles and nephews sat down and continued talking about past occurrences and old stories till after midnight his younger uncle had according to the custom of his tribe brought babar a complete dress of state a cap embroidered with gold thread a long frock of china satin ornamented with flowered needle work a cuirass of fine chain mail chinese fashion with a whetstone and a purse pocket from which were suspended a lot of little trinkets such as women wear including a bag of perfumed earth he looked very smart in it indeed and when he returned to his own tricked out in all this finery they declared it was only by his voice they recognised him that they had thought he was some grand young sultan life at any rate did not seem quite so empty since the two khans having got together began to propose a joint expedition to recover andijan for babar being an understood corollary so long as they remained under the influence of stern old isan daulet who ruled her sons in matriarchal fashion so they set off with flaunting pennons and kettledrums after the manner of moghul armies and at their first halt held a muster of the troops also in the moghul fashion in groups of three three horse tail standards were erected and from the centre staff of each a long strip of white cloth was fastened on the loose end of which stood the foot of the leader of that division all around in a huge circle the troops were drawn up then with many ceremonials and sprinklings of mares' milk spirit each leader estimated the total number of the force the final verdict being received with a wild war shout and then at full speed the whole army galloped centre wards the foremost troopers drawing bridle within a foot or two of the standards on this occasion babar looked with a certain awe yet some misgiving at no less than thirty thousand wild horsemen of the desert but he had more certain aid than this he found that he was not all forgot in the little valley at the extreme limit of the habitable world and the country people welcomed his return with acclaim so as soon as he could with that curious distrust of moghul blood which makes the name given to the dynasty he founded in india so quaintly ironical he parted company with his uncle's forces and pushing on with such of his own people as had come together sought for fine fighting and he got it still reckless almost without definite aim he followed swift on every opportunity for a skirmish when he saw a body of the enemy he advanced at full gallop without minding order or array and in nine cases out of ten the sheer daredevil clash succeeded the enemy could not stand the charge and fled without exchanging blows but sometimes his ill luck with the moghuls pursued him once when he with his staff was waiting outside andijan for the return of a messenger it was about the third watch of the night and some of them were nodding others fast asleep on their horses when all at once the saddle drums struck up with martial noise and hubbub the few men who were with babar were seized with a panic and took to flight except three all the rest ran off to a man in vain these four galloped after the fugitives in vain they horsewhipped some of them all their exertions were ineffectual to make them stand there was nothing for it but to try and check the pursuers themselves as best they could so the four turned stood and discharged flights of arrows until the enemy was almost within sword thrust then wheeling swiftly they galloped on to take up a fresh position of offence in this way they covered and protected the retreat until by good fortune they fell in with a patrol party of their own then of course came immediate charge to discover that the pursuers were moghuls from his uncle's force who were out on a pillaging expedition of their own in this manner by a false alarm the plan which babar had conceived came to nothing and he had to return after a fruitless journey truly if the young man had wished to throw away his life he could scarcely have dared fate more recklessly more than once he found himself almost alone facing stupendous odds once when surprised at night in negligent security without advanced guard and without videttes he had to gallop out almost unarmed to meet a large body of the enemy and found himself in the midst of them with but three supporters even so fate was against him he drew out of his quiver by mistake a green tipped finger guard instead of an arrow and being unwilling to throw it away because his uncle the khan had given it to him lost as much time in returning it to its place as would have sufficed for the despatch of two arrows and ere he was ready his companions had been swept back by the onslaught and he was alone to draw up to his ear and let the foremost foe have it for all he was worth was easy but at the same instant an arrow struck him on the right thigh unsteadying his aim and the next moment that foremost foe was on him and smote him such a blow on the head with a sword that despite his steel cap he was nigh stunned and then through his having neglected to clean his sword after swimming a river it had rusted a little in the scabbard and he lost time in drawing it still he won through that time and despite continual anxiety and irritation because of the behaviour of the moghul troops which his uncles detached to help him and who would insist on plundering and were with difficulty restrained from putting honourable prisoners to death he was fairly successful until a final act of treachery threw him on his beam ends and he was forced to retreat fairly beaten he was invited to a parley by the enemy and the moghuls urged him to accept the invitation and by hook or by crook to seize or murder the leaders babar was indignant such artifice and underhand dealing were he said totally abhorrent to his habits and disposition if he made an agreement for peaceful interview he would not violate it nor did he but whether from perversity or sheer stupidity his orders were disobeyed and he found himself committed to battle in the very heart of the opponents' defences and without a sufficient force to secure success even then he challenged fate by waiting for personal retreat a full hour or more unwilling as he thought to leave some of his friends in danger finally news came that having been beaten at the other side of the city in about as much time as milk takes to boil they and half babar's men had escaped long before by another gate only about twenty men were left to the young king it was no longer season to tarry they set off a great band of the enemy's troops in full pursuit and then commenced a memorable ride for life man after man dropped out maimed by the flights of following arrows help help cried a well known voice behind him and babar instantly turned bridle to aid a dear friend but those who rode on either side the young king would not have it this was no time to defy death it was the time to keep hold on life so with strong hands upon his reins babar had no choice but to ride on there were but eight of them left now a wearied hurried band of hunted men struggling through broken glens remote from the beaten road the enemy behind was now out of sight but as at sunset the fugitives passed into more level ground a shadow darker than the shadows of evening should be showed on the plain placing his men under cover babar dismounted and on foot ascended an eminence to see what this might be when suddenly from behind a number of horsemen showed coming towards them it was too dark to see their number but doubtless it must be a detachment in pursuit and the only hope flight there is no use sire said a noble going on thus they will outweary and take us all better by far that you and kali gokultash choose two extra horses from amongst us your devoted servants so by keeping the four horses at full speed you may escape it is a last chance but babar shook his head to leave anyone dismounted in the midst of the enemy was beyond him so he set his teeth and rode on the most high is heavier than i am urged an entreating voice at his elbow and it is my lord they want not this slave whose horse is fairly fresh babar set his teeth again but he felt the truth of the words and exchanged horses jan kali could slip aside down some ravine they would not follow him it was he zahir ud din mohamed babar that was wanted again came the plea my horse is fresher than the most high's and yet again babar exchanged steeds on and on the horses flagging followers dropping out until but two remained the king and his foster brother kali gokultash sire you had best go on muttered the latter as his horse stumbled and almost fell whither called back the king bitterly come on be it life or death let us meet it together and ever and ever as they went on blindly he paused to look back to wait and once when he looked back there was no one near at hand only in the far distance coming closer and closer dark figures were there two or more but now alone hopeless the worst seemed over babar dug spurs into his horse weary but willing and was off with renewed vigour in his veins it was himself against the world once more he would fight it out to the end the bitter end it was now dark and before him lay a hill if he could reach it and dismount he might trust to his own nimbleness in climbing but his horse was dropping and two of the pursuers were within bowshot ere he could fling himself from his steed on rising ground and dash up a glen to the right he did not pause to shoot though he had arrows in his quiver a few of these he had stuck in his belt as he flung off his accoutrements piece meal they were for use at the last the very last but voices followed him eager protesting voices they were no enemies neither were they friends but they could not leave a king in such a desolate situation let him confide in them and he might yet find safety it was a desperate chance still it was a chance and there were but two of them one brave man could surely keep them in check or kill them before he died babar pulled up went back to his horse and faced fate so all that night they rode together and when dawn came one of the troopers commandeered some loaves of bread all that day they lay watchfully in hiding and when night came they passed on to a half ruined house on the outskirts of a town here the troopers brought babar an old fur coat which was welcome for the nights were bitterly cold they also brought him a mess of boiled millet flour pottage which he ate and found wonderfully comfortable so comfortable that having lit a fire babar actually fell asleep beside it despite his imminent danger despite his distrust of his comrades who were for ever whispering amongst themselves but he was outwearied after three nights' riding and two days of watchful hiding indeed when they roused him at dawn on the pretext that there were spies about and that a change was imperative he was so spent and outdone that he felt inclined to bid them do their worst or leave him to his fate yet he followed them dully to a garden on the outskirts of the town as well die there as elsewhere but it was a primrose dawn with a promise of brilliant sunshine and the garden partially walled held a few flowers a few birds it needed no more to re arouse vitality and babar with fresh vigour in his veins after his few hours of sleep began to emerge from the slough of despondency in which he had passed the last three days these would be guides of his were doubtless traitors could he escape them the day passed on to noon babar in a corner of the garden performed his religious ablutions and recited his prayers adding to them the consolations of poetry by repeating the couplet long or short be your tenancy past you must quit the palace of life at last that was a self evident proposition and as such gave his simple clear sighted soul much comfort so much so that he fell asleep under the trees and dreamt a dream of victory and triumph from which he awoke to find three men standing over him to hear whispers of how best to seize and throttle him to spring to his feet and face them did not take long ill begotten treacherous hounds he cried ablaze with anger so canst thou dare when babar sleeps let us see who will lay hands on him awake the villains fell back but at that moment the tramp of horsemen was heard beyond the garden wall and one of the trio laughed crow away cockerel he cried mayhap hadst thou trusted us at first we might have let thee escape according to our oath but now is the work of death taken out of our hands for yonder comes a troop to seize thee and save our promise unbroken he turned as he spoke to welcome the newcomers then started for the horsemen hurrying in to the garden were not babar's foes but his friends kutluk babai cried the young king recognising two of his most devoted adherents they flung themselves from their horses the king long live the king they shouted as bending the knee at a respectful distance they rushed forward to fall at the feet of their dear leader it had been a wonderful ride for life yet in a way a needless one as babar told his uncles when he rejoined them since had he but known as he afterwards discovered that the following party was not a whole detachment but only a band of twenty troopers he and his seven would of course have made a stand and engaged them with every hope of success not that it would have made much difference for both the elder khan and the younger one had become weary of their expedition and on news of the great usbek raider shaibani's appearance in their country had retired in hot haste to their dominions so babar once more was at the end of his tether the moghuls he told his grandmother to her great dudgeon were no good as conquerors nature had made them pillagers and an inch of plunder was worth more than an ell of honour he is out of joint with life said his mother weeping old isan daulet sniffed try him with a pretty girl she suggested the khanum shook her head he is not that sort he will not even marry and that is nigh shameless since he is one and twenty yet without a child 'tis hard indeed on a woman of my age to have no grandchild except dearest one's boy said the old woman her stern face softening lo perfidious barbarian though the father be i should like to see the child it should have the makings in it of a man from its mother and she was silent for awhile perhaps she was thinking of that night in samarkand when a girl had waited patiently for worse than death then she spoke see you daughter your boy is not all king no more than he is all my grandson he hath material for half a dozen different persons in him and he hath not yet made choice of which to take lo mayhap i have had too big a hand in the pease porridge let be a bit let him do as he likes for a while and if that be to leave us for the time so be it hurry not god's work it was wise advice none wiser so for two whole years the king was king errant indeed even whither he went none know most likely he fulfilled his boyhood's desire to see china but this much is certain he and a few intimate friends not half a dozen at most wandered for months and months over the white mountains likely amid eternal snows across the high lying steppes to kashgar and so onwards or perhaps from tashkend he may have wandered over high plateaux and past wide lakes to the great tian shan mountains but either way from some high peak he must have caught one glimpse at least of a sight never to be forgotten the sight of the wide plain of eastern turkhestan lying like a lake of pale amber beneath an encircling rim of snowy pearls that change to rubies in the sunset marvellous indeed all around the everlasting hills contemptuous of man and his finite work glittering icily on that ever present haze of dust which effaced alike the sand of the central desert and the faint fringe of cultivation on the skirts of the hills over a thousand feet of golden dust pall covering the corpses of the six sand buried cities of khotan buried when and how and wherefore in god's name did humanity found its houses on the moving sands fine stimulation here for the imagination of a poet born babar must have sat and looked sat and learnt from the slow invincible march of the sand waves piled by the desert winds something of the strength of patience slow and sure under the gentle call of a summer breeze mayhap one sand atom shifting place then another and another but in the end a high piled wave ready to fall over and engulf what lay beyond when the whistle of the winter winds rang over the wastes rousing the hidden devil in those harmless sand grains to whirls of death shifting shifting never still for a second unearthing there burying here with what end and doubtless babar heard the oft told tale of the muazzim of kar and of the minaret of the mosque which the sand can never hide for long which even in these later days the dry biting winds of the desert lay bare ever and anon until the golden final of its blue dome shines bright as ever over the wide plain perhaps being a poet born he may have tried to put the legend into verse with better success than the following the preacher preached his words were austere so was his life oh sinners hear i oft have warned you oft and amain gentle and stern yet all in vain from off my feet by order of god shake i the dust in which i've trod i rend my garments go on my way not for my soul his judgment day no more i preach no more will i warn wait till the resurrection morn he left the pulpit garments he rent forth from the lord's own house he went thou com'st with me he said as he strode past the muazzim thine the road of mercy too the singer bowed bit at his lips then said aloud the grace of god i cannot gainsay fain would i go fain would i stay once more i'd waken sinners to prayer frowning the priest said fool beware our god is fire he burns and he rends message of peace once only sends the singer shivered so be it yet prayers must be called from the minaret yet once again singing must rise out of the night to dawning skies the preacher spat it lies on thy head gripped at his purse smiled as he fled the minaret was slender and high blue was its dome blue like the sky its gilded finial shone like a star over the sinful town of kar the singer climbed its narrowing stair stood in his place then breathed a prayer o god most great no atom of sand slips through thy fingers' grip thy hand heeds not man's worth thou fillest his need wake those who sleep dear god i plead no star no moon the gloom of the night making the snow peaks rim with light the purpling sky the darkening world was it a sand grain sharp that whirled to touch the watcher keen on his cheek waiting so patient until a streak of cold grey dawn should come to the sky bringing the time for clamant cry ul sul lah to khair un mun nun nu sleepers awake prayer time has come to you awake far better prayer than sleep to you ul sul lah to khair un mun nun nu the night was silent that was a gust wind hot as fire laden with dust the singer wiped salt tears from his eyes god if the sand storm should arise the storm of sand that comes like a pall gliding soft as snow flakes to fall on good on bad oh sleepers awake waken and fly his voice could make small sound against the sound of the storm whistling the sand grains rise and form in serried order carry the town bury each fool knave sinner clown who sleeps unheeding god's gracious grace mercy is tired go leave no trace of saint or sinner within this place the singer fought for breath as he prayed lord give me one more chance he said and lo the sand storm faltered away still as the grave the city lay the singer he sang as never before piercing through gateway wall and door the clamant cry oh sleepers rise better is prayer than sleep be wise awakened all they saw and they fled forth from the town bewildered forth from the town bewildered to seek for refuge far from the sands out of the wind but still he stands and still he sings perchance there be one soul in the town who might be won the storm fresh gathered swept on its task covered all things with deadly mask of sand high piled like waves of the sea till there was naught save sand to see no soul was left no need for him more downwards he crept he found the door was blocked by sand waves merciful heav'n not for his soul was ransom given so back he went to the minaret stood in the wind the sandy fret giving the call it echoes yet o'er wastes of sand when the sun has set when shifting winds in gusts and in whirls part of the dead town's shroud unfurls when dimly blue the minaret shows dim as a lamp its finial glows and soft and low and faint as a sigh comes to the ear that clamant cry ul sul lah to khair un mun nun nu awake awake prayer time has come to you awake better prayer than sleep to you ul sul lah to khair un mun nun nu book ii blossom time to chapter i youth asked the lark 'why dost thou sing when clouds are darkling' replied the lark 'behind the dark the light is sparkling' youth begged the hours death not to bring though clouds were lowering replied the hours 'in heaven's bowers roses are flowering' to day i will shave said babar with conviction and his long fine fingers felt his rather ragged young beard reflectively he was altogether a bit ragged after his long wanderings but he had come back from them wiser steadier in mind still stronger in body the record of years of clean hard living showed in his bright hazel eyes and the general alertness of his lithe young body but he was ragged the brilliant june sunshine poured down on the sorry encampment set out on the summer pasturage of the high alps of ilak and revealed the rents and patches of the two tents which were all that babar possessed his own terribly tattered in its royalty reserved for his mother's use a common felt tilt flexible in its cross poles for his own and then his followers some two hundred in all mostly on foot with brogues to them blanket frocks over their shoulders clubs in their hands a miserable court indeed for a prince of the blood royal yet the sense of kingship rose stronger than ever in the young mind yea i will be shaven he said magisterially and summoned the court barber he came running barefoot with a tin basin there should be ceremonials and entertainments said the khanum his mother plaintively even at my brothers' first shavings there were ever illuminations and feastings and thou art king but what will you here in the wilderness babar laughed one king is as like another king as split peas when there is lather to his face motherling so quick barber image me to sulaiman the wise or haroun ul raschid lo i could be emperor as well as they were fate but kind so out in the june sunshine the young man sat while the white lather foamed up into his eyes and made them smart have a care slave he said sharply lo i shall see things cloudy and i would fain see clear see clear aye that was what he wanted the past was leaving him with his beard he had made up his mind to that never again would he quarrel possession of that sweet valley on the extreme limits of the habitable world he would go farther afield how far depended on what on himself chiefly so for the present he was on his way to khorasan the centre of civilisation ay bare feet and blanket frocks were well enough in boyhood but when a man came to his own there were other kingships to be fought for besides those which involved a temporal throne there was kingship in thought kingship in art a dozen or more kingships ready to be gripped the razor sweeping backwards and forwards seemed to be shaving away all the disappointments of his past life he leapt to his feet when the business was over and stretched his strong young arms out as if to embrace the whole world lo i feel a new man i am ready for anything for everything so as he stood there the memory never very far distant from his mind in his moments of exaltation of the crystal bowl of life came back to him and he sang the last verse his full voice rolling away among the hills clear crystal bowl i laugh as i quaff bring me life's whole i won't take the half crystal bowl i bid thee bring to me joy grief life death where didst learn that song sonling said his mother fondly and how well thou singest now thou hast learnt much of late babar i learnt it replied her son his face sobering from my cousin gharib dost know motherling he added swiftly the light coming back to his eyes i learnt more of him than i wist at the time sometimes i think i owe all to him all echoed the khanum hurt dost owe nothing to me or at least to thy grandmother babar's face showed whimsically reverent oh yea oh yea he assented readily i owe much to my revered grandparent yet at this present it shows but little and he pointed to the two ragged tents the two hundred tatterdemalions i would i were a tulip at times he added irrelevantly as he flung himself down on the grass that was all starred with the blood red blossoms think of it motherling to lie cosy all winter at your own heart and when the sun has warmed the world to unfurl your banner and flaunt it independent disobedient if you choose he rolled over on his stomach to look clear into one ruby cup yea little one he said patronisingly rightly art thou called 'na farman' thou holdest thine own treasure secure caring for none yet will i touch it with my hand and the tip of his long finger dived into the chalice to touch the stiff stamens and come out all covered with pale yellow pollen an augury he said gravely as he smeared his forehead with the powder of life lo i am marked like a hindu i shall conquer hind yet footnote contempt god forgive thee child exclaimed his mother hastily say not such things they tempt providence even not thyself to an idolater babar looked contrite yet if i conquer hind i cannot kill all my subjects he replied thoughtfully there is a puzzle for thee motherling how to be true mussulman and yet not a fool his mother looked at him and shook her head dear son as he was always loving always affectionate he had a bad habit of getting away from her ken mentally and bodily it all came of leading such a wandering life if only he would marry and settle down but there seemed no chance of either yet fate held the latter to close quarters it almost seemed as if that shaving of his beard that setting aside once and for all of his boyish aspirations had had a magical effect on babar's environments for within two months seated at his ease in a splendid tent he was writing in his diary the lord is wonderful in his might that a man master of twenty or thirty thousand retainers should in the space of half a day without battle without contest be reduced to give up all to a needy fugitive like myself who had only two hundred tatterdemalions at his back and they all in the greatest want that he should no longer have any power over his own servants nor over his own wealth nor even his own life was a wonderful disposition of the omnipotent undoubtedly and as the enemy who was thus discomfited was no less a person that khosrau shah the man who had so treacherously caused prince baisanghar to be strangled it is certain that his lack of power over his own life was a sore temptation to babar the man undoubtedly deserved death it was indeed conformable to every law human and divine that such should meet with condign punishment but an agreement had been entered into so he must be left free and unmolested and allowed to carry off as much of his personal property as he could for babar was no promise breaker perhaps also the memory of poor miserable khosrau's appearance when this pompous man who for years had wanted nothing of royalty save that he had not actually proclaimed himself king presented himself for audience and bent himself twenty five or twenty six times successively and went and came back and went and came back till he was so tired that he nearly fell forward in his last genuflection may have weighed with the keen young observer the man was getting old let him go with his sins upon his head so he went and babar with the thirty thousand retainers at his back set out promptly for kabul his paternal uncle its king had died leaving a young son a perfidious minister had ousted this boy from the throne but had himself been assassinated at a grand festival thereinafter all was disorder and tumult fitting opportunity then for a coup d'etat so over the peaks and passes babar at the head of a movable column passed swiftly still more swiftly since surprise is the essence of success when news came that the usurper for the time being had left kabul at the head of his army to intercept another adversary the instant this information was received the young leader gave his orders within an hour the force was on the march a hill pass lay before them it must be mastered ere dawn they must go up and up all the night through the laden mules stumbling over the stones dismounted troopers hauling their horses up rock ladders a troublous time indeed but at last the crest of the hill was reached and there bright to the south showed a star the young leader's heart leapt to his mouth could it could it be canopus the lucky star of the conqueror the star of which he had read the star he had never seen before that that cannot be soheil he said almost timorously it is soheil most high replied baki cheghaniani in a courtier's voice then repeated pompously the well known verse how far dost thou shine soheil and where dost thou rise who knows but this cannot fail thy light brings luck to the eyes who see it and cry 'all hail soheil' gentlemen rang out babar's jubilant young voice cutting the clear night air like a knife let us give it all we can all hail soheil all hail soheil the cry clamoured round the rocks and surged up from the ravines where men were still striving upwards while on that downward path to the pleasant valleys below where spear points were already beginning to cluster the troopers paused to echo and re echo all hail soheil and babar's star was veritably in the ascendant within a month yet once more without battle without contest he had gained complete possession of kabul and ghazni with the countries and provinces dependent thereon it had been almost unbelievable success ever since that day when on the uplands of ilak he had shaved off his beard and set aside once and for all his childish hopes and aims really it was rather quaint the thought of it with its hint of imagination its something beyond the dull routine of the inevitable added zest to the young king's almost rapturous appreciation of his new dominions to begin with kabul was in the very midst of the habitable world that was a great point in its favour then it was in the fourth climate and so of course its gardens were perfection its warm and its cold districts were close together in a single day you could go to a place where snow never falls and in the space of two astronomical hours you might reach a spot where snow lay always except now and then when the summer happened to be peculiarly hot then the fruits grapes pomegranates apricots peaches pears apples quinces jujubes damsons walnuts almonds to say nothing of oranges and citrons the wines also were strong and intoxicating indeed that produced on the skirts of one mountain was celebrated for its potency this however was only a matter of hearsay since babar was still a tee totaler and as the verse says the drinker knows the virtue of wine which those who are sober can't divine then the honey was delicious the number of beehives extraordinary and the climate itself was so extremely delightful that in this respect there was no other such place in the known world but it was the gardens after all which made kabul what it was a place that filled the imagination with joy years and years afterwards the mere thought of them was to make babar homesick almost to tears now every moment of time he could spare was spent on the skirts of the shah kabul hill where terraces rise one above the other to touch the summer palace of the new year it was early october the plane trees were dropping their golden leaves the peaches were crimson and pale red the vines vied with each other in vivid colouring it was all so much pure joy to the young king and he passed on his content to all his dearest mother was housed as she never had been before and when old isan daulet came just to have a peep at her grandson's success he lodged her in the new year's palace where the old lady could have her fill of the garden since quaintly enough it was from the ancient desert born dame that babar inherited his keen delight in flowers kasim beg was back too and so was dost ali his oldest friend amongst the nobles of andijan but kambar ali had left he was a thoughtless and rude talker and the more polished courtiers of kabul could not put up with his manners not that he was a great loss for besides talking idly and those who talk persistently cannot avoid at times saying foolish things his wits were but skin deep and he had a muddy brain there was but one fly in the honey and that was the desire of all babar's female relations that he should marry there was justice he felt in his mother's claim for grandchildren undoubtedly it was his duty but he was too good natured however to resist making everyone as happy as he was himself especially after old isan daulet arrived with a bride in her pocket so before he quite realised the magnitude of the affair he was duly wedded to yet another cousin a half sister of dead prince baisanghar she was some years older than her groom and very very beautiful but babar came out from the bridal chamber with a stern set mouth and went straight to his mother tell her to say no more of dearest one he said briefly or there will be trouble and 'twere as well if she left baisanghar in peace also she loved him doubtless but but so did i his voice softened over the last words trouble however was not to be avoided babar made no more complaints possibly because he gave few opportunities for fresh injury his mother wept and scolded in vain that hurt him but for his cousin wife he cared not at all he was proud he could not understand a woman's petty spite especially when shown to him a good looking young king in the zenith of success we do not agree he said gloomily lo it is true what saadi saith 'in a good man's house a cross grained wife makes hell upon earth with ill tempered strife' mayhap if we part we may come together again in better fashion and sure i pray god that such a thing as a shrew be not left in the world he would not acknowledge any fault on his side perhaps there was none anyhow he was determined this year of good fortune should not be marred by silly domestic squabbles so with affectionate farewells to his mother whom he left determined to bring her choice to reason he set off in light hearted fashion to make that irruption into hindustan which he had threatened when he had marked his forehead with pollen dust he was not strong enough as yet his army was not yet sufficiently disciplined for any attempt at real conquest but he meant at least to cross the river sind and set foot on indian soil the expedition however fizzled out into a mere plundering raid along the western bank of the indus but babar at least saw india getting his first glimpse of it across the wide waters and sandbanks of that great stream he was deeply impressed by the sight at some places the water seemed to join the sky at others the farther bank lay reflected in inverted fashion like a mirage and he saw other strange and beautiful things also once between this water and the heavens something of a red appearance like a crepuscule cloud was seen which by and by vanished and so continued shifting till he came near and then with a whirr of thousands nay not ten thousand nor twenty thousand wings but of wings absolutely beyond computation and innumerable an immense flock of flamingoes rose into the air and as they flew sometimes their red plumes showed and sometimes they were hidden so with his mind stocked with endless new ideas for he had been struck by astonishment and indeed there was room for wonder in this new world where the grass was different the trees different the wild animals of a different sort the birds of a different plumage the very manners of the men different he returned in early summer to kabul but here he once more found trouble there was an epidemic of measles in the town and one of the first victims was his cousin wife he was vaguely distressed mostly it is to be feared because of his mother who had nursed her daughter in law devotedly partly also from a remembrance of his own parting wish yes it was distinctly wrong to say such ill advised things for if anything did happen one always regretted one's own words and yet one had meant nothing i will marry again motherling i will indeed but this time let me choose for myself he said consolingly as the fond woman clung to him in mingled joy at seeing him again and grief at the failure of her schemes not that they would have come to much likely even had the cousin wife not died for she had been a handful doubtless all those months lo motherling said her son once more let us forget the mistake for a time thy hands are hot thou art outwearied lie so among the cushions and i will sing to thee she loved to hear him sing and even in the old turkhoman ballads she did not like old isan daulet claim to have them fairly bawled this new soft fashion was utterly sweet so was her son's close shaven chin he had gone far from the wild turkhoman tents far ahead of her god only knew how much farther he was to go motherling thou art not so well to night he said with solicitude as he noticed how fever bright were her kind worn eyes i will bid the court physician send for him of khorasan he will likely know all methods for i cannot have thee ill my motherling the khanum held him fast with her hot hands i care not sonling she sobbed suddenly so long as thou art here to the last the best the bravest son but i he said in tender raillery though a sudden fear gripped at his heart whom have i in the wide world but thee mother lo thou art the one thing feminine left to me after all these years and his eyes grew stern as he thought of that dearest dearest one away in far samarkand thank god she had a child have i not always said so wailed his mother have i not bid thee have children ah babar if i live promise thou wilt marry i will marry either way motherling he said lo i promise that so cease thy tears and try to sleep thou wilt be better by morn but morning found the palace hushed with the hush of mortal sickness there was no longer any doubt that the khanum had contracted measles in its worst repressed form and regret vague almost unreasonable regret seized on babar he was responsible it was his fault his mother had nursed his wife the khorasan physician came and ordered water melons he of kabul let blood and babar sat dry eyed beside his mother holding her hot hand she did not know him those words of hers begging him to marry had been her last to him his to her his promise that he would marry even amid his dazed grief he remembered this remembered it keenly as when the end came in quiet unconsciousness he bent over her to give the last caress before death claimed the body and it lay soulless impure but she she was received into the mercy of god he said that over and over again to himself as on the sunday morning he put his strong shoulder under the light bier and carried it to the garden of the new year it was summer time now the roses were beginning to blow the tulips were nigh over but the wild pansies were in full blossom they had dug a grave under the plane trees and here after the committal prayers had been said and flowers strewn babar holding the head and kasim his foster brother the feet laid the light muslin swathed tinsel bound corpse in the long low niche cut coffin wise in the side his voice scarcely trembled at all as he laid a handful of earth upon the breast with the solemn words of admonition and hope out of the dust i made you and to dust i return you to raise you yet once more out of the dust upon the day of resurrection but his eyes brimmed with tears as with lavish hand he scattered pansy blossoms till the white shroud was hidden by them then without one word he drew himself up from the grave and taking a shovel worked his hardest to fill in the earth afterwards he sat down and looked out over the valley when his time came he also would lie here one could not desire a more peaceful a more beautiful spot but he would have no tomb built over him to blot out the blue sky no he and his mother should rest together till the resurrection morn out in the open among the birds and flowers chapter ii i set death's door wide open for thee friend that thou might'st go i did not weep i did not even send one sign of woe to follow lest the way thou had'st to wend the harder show but thou thou shut'st the door upon my face thou hid'st from me one tiny gleam of glory from the place where thou would'st be in this world or the next there is no trace no trace of thee with the swift family affection of their clan relatives gathered round babar in his bereavement his paternal aunts came from khorasan and ere the forty days of mourning were over a small cavalcade arrived from tashkend but it brought an aggravation of grief for old isan daulet had predeceased her daughter by a few days babar's uncle the little khan had also died but beyond the fact that this deepened the shadow of death which seemed to have fallen over his young life it brought no sorrow to the king it was different with his grandmother with her passing he had veritably no feminine thing left to whom he owed affection and duty to whom he could go for comfort and counsel there were his paternal aunts of course good creatures every one of them especially ak begum though the others always flouted her because she had not married which was very unkind since anyone with half an eye could see it was because she had devoted her life to her fat half witted lame sister poor badul jamal begum what an irony of fate it was that she had been called that the lady of astonishing beauty but feminine names were beyond reason even ak begum the fair princess what a name for that little bird like dark creature who twittered and preened herself at every word yet she was the only one of them who understood who gave the young man's sore heart any comfort at all she came to him looking as if no pin were out of place so natty with her scanty hair still braided in virginal fashion on her wrinkled forehead and said in her high piping voice lo nephew here are violets a man brought them from the snows are they not sweet sniff them thy mother was ever so fond of them and babar sniffed at them and afterwards took them to his mother's grave yes the fair princess was certainly his grandfather's daughter of the same blood as he was still grief must have its way and here it was unbounded regret and remorse were mixed with it and yet once again babar gave way before the mental strain he tried to resume his ordinary life and actually started to lead his army afield but was struck down with a sort of sleeping sickness for days no matter what efforts they made to rouse him his eyes constantly fell back to sleep yet after a time he pulled himself together again and started once more but this time with no definite plan nor did he quite recover his normal health all that winter which was spent in half hearted attacks and whole hearted forgiveness of all and sundry of his enemies for it was not his wish to treat anyone harshly the snow lay very deep that winter in the high glens and passes at one place off the road it reached up to the horses' cruppers and the pickets appointed for the night watch round the camp had to remain on their horses from sheer inability to dismount half the army suffered and babar himself had to be carried back to kabul helpless with lumbago mental unhappiness always seemed to affect his bodily health but spring comes early in kabul and the pulse of renewed life began to beat once more in babar's veins by march when the red tulips he had planted there were in full bloom about his mother's grave in the garden of the new year he was once more looking out from that high ground at the world beneath his feet and straining his bright eyes over new horizons one thing he must do he must marry but this time he would choose for himself this time he would give himself a chance of finding that new world he had seen when he was a boy in dearest one's eyes poor dearest one he had had letters from her concerning their mother's death and their pitifulness had almost broken his heart yet he could do nothing nothing she was as one dead only not at peace like his mother but she also had urged marriage yes he must marry and no one should have a finger in the matrimonial pie but himself least of all his paternal aunts if needs be he would marry privately the idea attracted him he pondered over it the question arose in that case whom he was to choose amongst the well born those who lived in the circle of distinction as the phrase ran it would be impossible without a confidante the mere broaching of marriage was out of the question and yet the very idea of one low born was distasteful to him so as he pondered vaguely over possibilities an idea came to him what of the frightened girl why not she could not be more than a year or two his senior if that for she had been much younger than his cousin gharib and her father was dead and she lived in a house of rest that is to say if she still lived or if she was not married bah he was a fool to let his fancy run so far still he could enquire when he went to khorasan as he meant to do some time that summer meanwhile a feeling of content came to him partly because his imagination endorsed the idea as delightfully sentimental mostly because it postponed necessity for immediate action and yet when a day or two after a missive arrived from his uncle sultan hussain begging for his assistance at khorasan against the arch enemy and raider shaibani khan who threatened an inroad babar felt pleased at what seemed an order from fate especially as the missive came by the hands of rather a quaint ambassador namely by the son of his uncle's professional dreamer of dreams to be sure cousin gharib had made fun of the man's pretensions but there was more in that sort of thing than could be accounted for by reason anyhow it was a clear duty to set off at once if shaibani was the enemy then if other princes went to the attack on their feet it was incumbent on him to go if necessary on his head and if they went against him with swords it was his business to go were it only with stones the most high must have a care of kabul nathless said wary old kasim look you the saying runs ten dervishes in one rug lie comfy and warm and snug but two kings upon one throne such a thing never was known the most high's brother and his cousin but babar cut him short he never would listen to suspicions of his own relations i have done nothing he said with just that little touch of conscious virtue that in him was so translucent so simple though in one less artless it might have been offensive to provoke either of them to hostility neither have they given me ground for dissatisfaction kasim shrugged his shoulders and muttered under his breath that it would need the day of judgment to make some folk believe in sin and applied himself to seeing that the garrison left was sufficient to keep order babar himself was full of spirits apart from other considerations the prospect of at last seeing herat the most civilised city in central asia filled him with keen interest it was full he knew of poets painters philosophers and its luxuries were things to speak of with bated breath in addition he had a pleasant remembrance of his uncle hussain it was more than ten years since he had seen him over in the camp which had struck him the hardy barbarian with awe did the old man old now with a vengeance since he had reigned a good fifty years still keep butting rams and amuse himself with cock fighting above all did he still on festival days put on that small turban tied in three folds broad and showy and having placed a plume nodding over it in that style go to prayers babar wrote in his own hand in the babari writing which he had just invented and of which he was vastly proud a letter to the kindly old man telling him that he had set out from kabul and hoped to be with him shortly this he entrusted to an ambassador who with the dreamer of dreams started express for herat he himself having a small job on hand by the way in the punishment of some wandering tribes to the west it was not much of a task but summer quarters in the hills had a fascination for babar and he remained on the top of one of the many ranges he had to cross despatching kasim beg meanwhile with a body of troops to scour the countryside for rebels there was a sense of freedom about the wide upland stretches of sweet grass where flocks and herds grazed placidly where flowers blossomed by the million and the tall fir forests edged the downward slopes the whole world of blue waving hills touched the blue sky one might be adrift on a huge raft in the river of life babar would doff shoes and wander barefoot for hours content with a chance shot after an escaping deer or a chance following of his own vagrant thoughts and these often fled in the direction of a house of rest wherein dwelt a frightened girl he could not help it he was made sentimental to his heart's core remove the pressure of fine fighting of ardent ambition and there he was ready to be touched by pity love admiration and the thought of the woman to come was a perpetual stimulus to his imagination the mere fact that he did not know her name was delightful it took from the idea all trace of earth and babar though the very reverse of ascetic in his tastes and pleasures had ever been repulsed by sensuality his was the epicurean enjoyment of the spirit as distinct from that of the mind or that of the body so in his thoughts he called the woman he intended should be his wife my moon which is the eastern equivalent of my queen and in easy dilettante fashion wrote more than one ode to that luminary most of them were in persian and contained exactly the proper number of feet and rang the appointed interchanges of meaning and words with faultless accuracy he was quite proud of them and thought better of them than of the one in turkhi which however he set to music and sang for his innate good taste was for ever breaking loose from scholastic tradition he twanged the tune on a cithara as he sat on a rock in the moonlight and felt quite light hearted over his own unworthiness it fitted so neatly into the rhyming fall moon of still night whence the bright light that enfolds in its pure smile earth's untold guile that upholds silver in glow whiter than snow this my hand tuning thy praise whence come thy rays from what land bringest thou peace thus to release from its sin stricken sad heart wailing its part in life's din lo from god's sun must thou have won thy kind light though i am clay watch me alway through the night i am of earth thine is the birth right divine moon of my soul thine is this whole heart of mine the distance from kabul to khorasan was over eight hundred miles so with even every day marching the journey would have taken some time and babar was in no particular hurry less so than ever when news came to him with the return of his ambassador that sultan hussain had suddenly died from an apoplectic seizure at first babar felt inclined to turn back his uncle he knew had left his kingdom in unheard of fashion to his three legitimate sons in defiance of the old saw about the ten dervishes and babar had too much experience to believe that such an arrangement could work satisfactorily however he had other motives for advancing and therefore he continued his route and passing over the last range of high hills found himself in the country where the advanced detachments of the usbek force were already raiding this in itself was an attraction bringing as it did a chance of fine fighting he found his cousins the new kings encamped ready to meet the advancing foe on the murghab river or rather he found two of them the third from private motives of pique had refused to join the confederacy this appeared to babar to be inexpressibly mean when everyone else had united and were sparing no efforts to oppose an enemy so formidable as shaibani he could not understand how any reasonable man could pursue a line of conduct which must after his death stain his fair fame surely everyone with the commonest grace would push forwards his career so that even if closed it would conduct him to renown and glory since fame is truly a second existence these sentiments however fine as they were did not make much mark on the luxurious camp on the banks of the murghab his cousins received babar fairly well though their manners required some polishing up by old kasim beg's inflexible rules of etiquette of course the fact that two of the younger and illegitimate princes did not come out as far as they ought to have done to welcome their kingly cousin was objectionable but that might be put down to delay in starting due to an over night debauch rather than to intentional slight but when it came to the state reception in the audience tent kasim had to pluck at his young master's girdle and remind him with this jog that he was to go no further but to await his eldest cousin's advance which he did obediently knowing that old kasim held his king's honour as his own and was keenly alive to his consequence but he himself was always forgetting these convenances where he was concerned if you really felt affectionate it was a nuisance having to wait and bow and scrape the state reception however went off very well and it was followed by a sort of entertainment at which wine was served in goblets of silver and gold that were put down by the meat fateful innovation which sent old kasim back to his own camp hungry in the highest of dudgeons had it been a drinking party sire he protested 'twould have been my own fault for being there but at an official dinner 'twas scandalous no faithful mussulman could touch a morsel of food so defiled babar somewhat regretful at a rather abrupt departure murmured an excuse to the effect briefly of autres tempes autres moeurs whereat kasim beg a purist for the old ways broke out hotly lo sire the institutions of ghengis khan have brought your highness' family well through much trouble sacredly have they observed them in their parties their courts their festivals their entertainments their down sittings their risings up and it would ill become their descendant to flout them babar flushed up in his heart of hearts he was not quite such an admirer of the old turk lo the institutes are good enough he said a man may well follow them yet are they not of divine authority so that one be damned for disobeying them besides see you what hope would there be for the world if folk made no change if a father has done wrong why should not a son change it to what is right old kasim munching away at the dry bread and pickles which was all his servants could produce snorted 'tis the other way round most times and see you sire i give those kings your cousins one year one little year to hold herat then the kingdom of their father god rest his soul since he had gleams of grace and once let one of his god forgetting sons go before the magistrate held despite wine bibbing for nigh fifty years will have gone for ever aye replied barbar thoughtfully i have noticed that myself some men drink with impunity i wonder if 'twould hurt me god forbid your majesty said old kasim with a tremble in his voice shall all our care mine and the saintly kwaja who held you as a boy in his guardian care be wasted god forbid say i but babar said nothing he knew that in his inmost heart he had had for years a great longing just to see what it was like to be drunk it could scarcely hurt for once and the land of inebriety could hardly be the arid desert it had been painted for him or so many folk would not wander in it he was always open to reason on all points nevertheless he gave out solemnly that he drank no wine and his cousins being good hosts refrained from pressing him to do so badia zaman the elder of the three doubtless thought little of him for the abstinence to be young good looking able to enjoy yourself in every way and yet not to take the best of life seemed to him sheer foolishness and he showed his estimate in his manner so that babar came home from his second interview in a fume of anger this shall not be he said hotly kasim send proper representations that young as i am i am of high extraction twice have i by force regained my paternal kingdom samarkand to show want of respect to one who has done so much for his family by repelling the foreign invader is not commendable for a marvel the young king was on his dignity much to old kasim's joy and with good result for nothing more could have been desired at the next audience which babar attended with his full retinue and a fine figure he looked dressed in the very latest fashion with a gold brocade coat a flowered undershirt and white silk baggy trousers all lined with gold thread his hair too was scented and curled and his turban tied with a difference a very different person this from the ragged out at elbow fugitive or even the stern young soldier in his tarnished coat of mail fighting for life against overwhelming odds he rather liked the change it was a new experience to ruffle with gilded youth and he ruffled fairly until his boon companions began to play indecent and scurvy tricks when he left disgusted for the time being but the entertainments were wonderfully elegant there was every sort of delicacy on the comestible trays and kababs of fowl and goose indeed dishes of every sort and kind the prince kings vied with each other in the refinement of their luxuries and certainly badia zaman's parties deserved to be celebrated they were so fine so easy so unconstrained on the other hand mozuffar's entertainments were more amusing especially when the wine began to take effect there was a man who danced excessively well a dance of his own invention dance or no dance grumbled old kasim the princes thy cousins have taken four months to reach this place and now news comes that a plundering party of usbeks is well within touch not more than forty miles off and they dance 'twill be to another tune ere long mayhap they would let me go said babar eagerly 'twould be a diversion so he was off to lay his proposition before his cousins but they afraid of their own reputations would not suffer him to move the fact was as he admitted to old kasim privately the princes though very accomplished at the social board or in the arrangements for a party of pleasure and though they had a pleasing talent for conversation and society yet possessed no knowledge whatever of the conduct of a campaign and were perfect strangers to the arrangements for a battle or the danger and spirit of a soldier's life this left nothing more to be said especially as his hearer agreed with every word early autumn however had passed and shaibani being a careful general prepared to withdraw his forces against the winter's cold this being so there was no longer any reason there had been but little before for remaining in camp at the murghab and the prince kings proposed a return to herat and invited babar to accompany them were i your highness said old kasim sturdily i would not go so far god in his mercy has kept virtue on the lips of the king and kept wine away from them but in that god forsaken city of herat who knows what might happen they tell me even the women there are castaway and that your uncle the late king's widow drinks like a fish may god reward her i have never seen a woman drink wine said babar quite thoughtfully have you kasim looked at his young master critically new things are not always good things sire he replied drily and as was mentioned ere we set out from kabul god only knows what may happen there if we delay our return too long already have five months passed and 'tis a fifty days' march homewards not if we take the high road said babar the high road echoed the old general that may be covered with snow any moment now yet will i chance my luck returned babar gaily see you old friend i have my reasons i must see herat in the whole habitable world they say there is not such a city besides he paused for his was a truthful soul even to itself and he knew that the past six weeks of jollity and convivial male merry making had considerably dimmed his desire to do his duty and marry still he had promised himself he would try and seek out his cousin gharib's betrothed for she had never been his wife and he meant to do it between whiles of course for he must make the most of his time in herat yes it would be a pity to miss the chance of his life to be in the most refined of cities which possessed every means of heightening pleasure and gaiety in which all the incentives to and apparatus for enjoyment were combined into one vast invitation to indulgence and not to indulge would be foolish if he did not seize the present moment even to the point of tasting wine he was not likely to have such another and certainly wine seemed to raise the level of a man's mind his cousins were but dullards out of their cups and there was no need to exceed to be dead drunk was no pleasure to anyone chapter iii the load of love nor earth nor heav'n can bear yet thou improvident wouldst lightly wear the lovers' yoke give up the flaming sword fool love only can bear love beware beware ebd ul homid herat was entered it was his babar his eyes wide with curiosity and appreciation had ridden through what were to him interminable streets he had seen towers and pleasure houses and palaces rising on all sides had noted the crowds which surged out from every side alley to see one who was already renowned in the songs of half central asia as the embodiment of youthful valour and all had been simply inconceivable in its beauty its size yusuf ali who had been appointed his guide rode at his right hand and supplied him with endless information close on a million of people in the town and suburbs over a hundred and seventy thousand occupied houses nigh on four hundred public schools shops why there must be at least fifteen thousand of them the statistics went in at one ear and out at another it was the sheer beauty of the place which held babar's mind the wide valley the surrounding hills just touched with snow the white buildings following the blue curves of the river the marble colonnades terracing the slopes the marble palaces crowning the heights and dense packed between high carven houses the multi coloured crowd all intent on pleasure roars of laughter rising from it at every passing jest a chorus of victory young champion following him as he rode along by god and his prophet life was a splendid thing to live had he had prince fortunatus' purse in his pocket he would have flung gold pieces along every inch of the way even in the mausoleum of his lately deceased uncle where in accordance with etiquette he had before even taking up his quarters in the palace assigned to him to pay his respects to the female members of his uncle's family his ceremonial condolences were somewhat marred by the joie de vivre which simply exhaled from him yet he was none the less sympathetically impressed by the dim dome of kings all lit up darkly by swinging lamps by tall funereal tapers throwing flickering shadows on the purple crimson pall fringed with gold that covered the catafalque dim blue clouds of incense filled the air their scent mixed with the perfume sodden rustle of the silks and satins beneath the circle of ivory tinted mourning veils that enshrouded the crouching figures of the female mourners the low guttural chant of canons appointed to sing prayers for the repose of the dead rose monotonously a fitting background to the little conventional sobs and cries as each lady in turn stood up to embrace the newly arrived member of the family there were so many aunts to embrace but babar went through them decorously with a little real emotion when he hugged aunt fair and some rather obvious impatience when fat silly astonishing beauty who loved young men hugged him they did not however keep up the marsiah for long the ladies who after the expiry of five months had got over the first flush of grief being anxious to have their handsome relative's budget of news so they all repaired to khadijah begum's house and had a repast it was very refined and rather to babar's disappointment for he was curious to see a woman drink wine strictly teetotal doubtless because payanda begum the late king's chief wife and as his father's sister babar's real aunt was present and she was naturally of the highest circle of distinction and of the most correct behaviour khadijah begum on the other hand whom babar now saw for the first time showed her low birth despite the fact that as favourite wife she had managed the court for years even the knowledge that she was cousin gharib's mother could not prevent babar's putting her down at once as a vulgar talkative woman who posed for being a person of profound sense there was another begum of the late king's present however on whom the young observer seeing her for the first time passed a very different opinion this was one lady apak a delicate fair woman who spent her childless life in nursing other people's children and who babar felt deserved all the respect and kindness it was in his power to give he was not sorry however when various other visits paid he found himself in the house assigned to him and sure no better place could have been discovered in the whole habitable world for it was the garden palace which the great master of all arts messer ali shir dead this while back god rest his soul had designed and built for himself babar spent hours wandering through its cool corridors sitting awhile in cunning alcoves whence the enchanting view framed in gilt filigree arch showed like a picture indeed he sampled the rose water baths all mosaicked like a garden with buds and leaves and blossoms he sat stroking the soft silk pile of carpets green and set with flowers as thick as andijan meadows in spring and there was one deeply darkly verdant and almost covered with the softest fleeciest white furry blobs on which he could have lain down and cried so keenly did it bring back the mantle of clover lambskin into which he had poured the first grief that had come to his young life he read round the walls of the central marble hall veined and mosaicked with precious stones the boast that in after years one of his descendants was to use in the court of private audience at delhi if earth holds a paradise it is this it is this it is this yes it was true not only in the hall but in every niche and corner in the ivory carven bedstead in the crystal goblets inlaid with coral in the curiously beaten metal work in the very shading of the coloured tiles here was perfection of beauty even with their shoes doffed in respectful oriental fashion babar could hardly endure to see servants whose minds he knew were not attuned to that high level passing backwards and forwards in what he felt to be a shrine he dismissed them all and sat pillowed by the softest down looking out from the colonnade which gave on the garden it also must be beautiful beyond compare he would see that to morrow to night it was sufficient to revel in the burnished dusk of the orange trees seen in the soft moonlight to watch the glittering radiance of the fountain drops against that background of distant hills purple aye positively purple even in this light lo it was beauty concentrated almost to pain beauty unearthly beyond the senses something not to be seen or heard or tasted or touched or even felt beauty that brought an utter abnegation of self this slave has a letter for the most high came a clear sweet voice it is from his cousin gharib it was to be given if occasion came in private and in person if possible so i have brought it babar turned quickly at first to see nothing then several paces away faintly outlined against one of the square white pilasters he caught the silhouette of a white curiously shadowless figure a woman's figure surely slim elegant despite the enshrouding veil he rose swiftly his heart beating his dead cousin could it be no impossible and yet with deepest reverence mother he said almost mechanically as the figure remaining quiescent he stepped forward to take what it held out he could see the hand a marble hand in the moonlight beyond the line of the pilaster a pretty hand too with fingers pointed and delicate may god reward you came his mechanical thanks as instinctively he stepped back again the figure remained quiescent silent in the moonlight he could see clearly the sweeping black curves of the writing the letter was very brief shouldst thou cousin ever come to khorasan i have counselled her who was my wife in name to give you this i make no claim i express no wish save this i should like her to be happy for i have loved her and thou also o babar farewell may the crystal bowl give love not tears for an instant babar stood confounded irresolute it was so unconventional so almost impossible yet it fitted strangely with the place with his vague feeling that had been beyond even time and space illustration 'this slave has a letter for the most high' there was a ruby jewelled lamp swinging from the arch between them it scarce gave light but it sent a patterned shimmering rose upon the white marble floor a gentle breeze swayed the lamp the rose flickered between them backwards and forwards his eyes were on it as he stood holding the letter the moonlight catching at the signet ring he wore dallying with the gold embroidery of his light silken coat is it possible he said at last fluttering a bit like a girl that she who stands before me yea i am she came the composed reply it settled the young man by bringing conviction of his own confusion but how he began a certain blame in his surprise and once again the answer was ready grave sufficient my lord's slave comes every friday after the custom of her family she is of the blood of the divine jami as doubtless my lord knows to place flowers on the tomb of the now sainted messer ali shir may his ashes rest in peace who is interred by his own wish in this garden and who was her distant relative but in life he was ever kind to this dust like one teaching her and allowing her to be his disciple so her litter comes hither often it awaits her return yonder at the grave thus the letter was easy to deliver in person and it is delivered may god keep the king faintly the figure moved as if to go but babar stepped a step forward his head was in a whirl his heart curiously steady and has the cupola of chastity no word to say of herself he asked what word is there to say my lord came the quick reply i have performed my duty the rest lies with my lord there was just a suspicion of raillery in the voice which spurred babar to hardihood then i would fain know if if she who thus deigns to honour me is satisfied with with what she sees but yea my lord quite satisfied and this is not the first time she has seen my lord she was at the window when he made his entry to the town then the lady has doubly the advantage said babar with an irrepressible laugh yet will i not ask her to make us equal and unveil that were not meet at such a time and place there was just that faint suspicion of conscious virtue about the remark but it was met promptly coolly nor is there need my lord would not be frightened at what he saw as i poor foolish child was frightened but i lived to be wiser i lived to know that deformity of body is as naught before deformity of mind but my lord has neither nor has this dust like one she is counted beautiful and though she catalogues not her own charms she hath two eyes somewhat large that look straight a passable nose thirty two sound teeth even and white and a mouth that can say kind things harshly and an' it please my lord harsh things kindly shall the recital proceed further my lord by god and the prophets no cried babar catching fire at last there is but one more thing between us lady wilt thou take me for husband of a surety therefore came i here so far the reply was as ever cool collected without shadow of emotion now the sweet polished voice broke faintly there is but one matter of which i would remind my lord i am older than he by three years and i am not quite like other women messer ali shir taught me much if my lord would rather someone else the rose light on the pavement flickered between them backwards and forwards lady said babar and involuntarily he drew himself up to his full height in my childhood they married me to one for whom i cared little she left me saying truly i did not love her awhile back my mother god rest her soul for she was very dear to me married me to yet another wife whom mercifully god took since we were as cat and dog but i have never loved a woman i do not now perhaps i never shall 'tis well to be prepared was it a faint sigh or only another breath of wind that set the swinging lamp swaying i am prepared and god may send the father's love to the mother of his son there was silence the splash of the glistening fountain made itself heard faintly the soft coo of a dove in the orange trees seemed a lullaby to the whole wide world lady said babar when he spoke at last i have sworn to myself that none should know of my marriage till it was accomplished till i could place my wife before them and say 'see her whom i have chosen' i stay but a week or two in herat my kingdom calls me back is it possible that ere i go the formulas may be said privately so that when good fortune enables me to send to herat it may be for my wedded wife that i send there was a pause then the cool quiet voice replied wherefore not my lord i have said i am ready but when babar spoke anxiously almost appealingly he felt himself as wax in a woman's hand a woman he had never seen next friday my lord when i come again to lay the flowers at the shrine if my lord makes preparation and if he changeth not his mind his servant will be there unless she also changeth her mind interrupted babar with forced lightness that might be came the answer yet is it not so likely as the other the caged bird does not choose its song and now farewell god have you in his keeping the figure stooped to gather its flowing robes together and something in the supple elegance of the movement sent babar's blood to his heart and head not so my moon he cried every atom of him vibrant with emotion not so do we part and with two swinging strides he was across the flickering rose light on the marble floor took the hand held out to him unflinchingly and stooped to kiss it wife and mother guardian and friend so shalt thou be to me so help me god the next instant he was alone staring into the night wondering if he had fallen asleep and dreamt it all no it was a reality his signet ring was gone he must have put it on that firm delicate hand the memory of whose touch thrilled him through and through and he had called her his moon yet his heart was beating tranquilly when he lay down on the carven bed he did not toss and turn he did not even feel inclined to indite a sonnet to his mistress's eyebrow or compare her to anything in heaven above or the earth beneath he was simply content and fell into a dreamless sleep it was not till the next morning that he recollected that he did not know the lady's name nor where she lived not that either ignorance mattered he would find out next friday chapter iv noisy the tavern where life's wine has sped from variant cup to fuddle variant head love peeps through crannied door each drinker straight flings cup aside to follow her instead ebd ul hamid there was not much time for thought in herat early in the morning babar was astir to ride out with yusuf to some of the sights and find the first collation of the day spread in some suitable place then on his return there was the state visit to the court where with pomp and circumstance he took his place as king of kabul after that each day had its entertainment at some new palace of delight and sometimes after dinner had been served the party would be carried off by one of the guests to a further and more intimate circle of amusement once this was done by no less a person than khadijah begum herself she took a few of the young princes to the king's pleasure house a delightful little edifice of two storeys high which stood in the midst of a still more delightful garden the upper storey was simply perfect four little apartments at the four corners each with a wide balcony and between them and enclosed by them one large central arched hall every portion of this upper storey was covered with frescoes representing the battles of babar's grandfather sultan abusa'id and it was all so charmingly arranged carpets and hangings everywhere especially in the balcony where the party assembled and where babar as the guest of the evening was placed above his hosts these little attentions always flattered babar and he never failed to notice them so the entertainment began with a cup of welcome which was charged and drunk by the host in chief then the cupbearers began to fill up the cup of the others with pure wine which everyone including khadijah begum quaffed as if it had been the water of life only the tall good looking young king refused even when the party waxing warm and the spirit mounting to their heads they took a fancy to make the young abstainer drink also the night was fine the moonlight streamed in upon fruit and flowers jelal the flute player fluted to perfection and bechab on the harp might have wiled doves from their nests then hafiz sang well in the herati style low delicate equable everything tempted to pleasure and babar sat with a half frown on his kindly face watching the others get lordily drunk then mercifully a false note was struck by one of his own following jahangir mirza who was far gone insisted that his favourite singer of samarkand should delight the company and the man sang as he always did in a loud harsh voice and out of tune altogether a dreadful disagreeable performance so disagreeable that the khorasan princes though far too polite to stop it out of respect to babar had to yawn and furtively protect their ears this and the reflection that if he was to yield and taste wine it would be more courteous to do so when he was the guest of the eldest of the princes and not of the younger decided him not to give way at that party at any rate but he was no wet blanket for after a time having had enough of the pleasure house they repaired to the new winter palace where yusuf being by this time extremely drunk rose and for a marvel danced remarkably well possibly because he was a musical man here they all got very merry and friendly babar was presented more or less ceremoniously with a corselet a sword a belt and a whitish tipchak horse and someone sang a turkhi song well on the other hand while the party was hot with wine two slaves again performed indecent scurvy tricks but this time babar did not leave he remained to the bitter end when the party broke up at such an untimely hour that babar thought it best to stay where he was the others doubtless being too drunk to move perhaps it was this experience coming in such close contrast to the marvellous peace of that moonlight night when as if in a dream he had handfasted a nameless woman that made babar listen to old kasim's horror struck remonstrances concerning his young master's failing adherence to orthodoxy in the matter of wine the rigid old mahomedan was fairly scandalised and made such a fuss that the khorasan prime minister intervened and took his young masters to task so severely that they wholly laid aside any idea of urging their cousin further to drink rather perhaps to that cousin's private regret it seemed a thousand pities to leave herat without having tasted all life's pleasures all that is that were not indecent or scurvy and a man could be drunk and yet remain a gentleman still when the elder prince did give the promised party at which babar had promised himself he would for once drink wine he still refrained though he fretted because his nobles thought it necessary only to drink by stealth hiding their goblets and taking draughts in great dread it was so foolish when they knew he was never one to object to the following of common usage if so be the follower could reconcile it to his own conscience he was altogether a trifle hoity toity at this supper party for a whole goose after herati fashion being set down before him he did not touch it and on his host's asking if he did not like it said frankly that being accustomed to the unrefined habit of having his food served in gobbets he did not know how to carve it whereupon his host obligingly sent for the goose cut it up and placed it himself before his guest badia zaman was of course unequalled in such attentions and life was very delightful yet still babar's thoughts began to turn to the next friday and after that to kabul his future life seemed more settled than it had ever been before but fate had a surprise in store for him as he found out one afternoon when after his usual kindly custom he had gone to pay a duty visit to his paternal aunts running down the narrow stairs which led to payanda begum's upper storey he came full tilt on two veiled women coming up the stair was but shoulder wide no room to pass even had the first figure not been so appallingly stout impossible to pass rude to turn one's back on those who were evidently of the circle of distinction nor could he king of kabul retreat step by step like a lackey he stood for a second gracious debonnair then with a merry your pardon mother wedged his arms tight between those narrow walls so swung himself back and there in two such bounds he was up the six steps and at the top of the stair have a care nephew shrieked a fat familiar voice from the first bundle thou wilt fall and crush thy yenkam my bridesmaid cried babar joyously repeating the pet nickname say not so when didst thou come and he was down the stairs again to embrace a favourite aunt he had not seen for years and help her mount the remaining steps so still panting the elderly matron unwound her veil and stood revealed fat indeed lo yenkam said babar his eyes twinkling had i fallen i should have fallen soft fie on thee scapegrace god send thee not a skinny old age retorted habee ba begum good humouredly but what of thy cousin ma'asuma here ma'asuma that is like the fairy princess weighing but five flowers have a care of thy veil child the tiny little figure slim and graceful which now stood beside the fat one apparently made a court salutation beneath her thick veil and a bird like voice said with a laugh in every tone my cousin babar never having seen my smallness mother cannot gauge it the young king returned the salute in his best manner if the gracious lady would allow me to judge he began when his yenkam cut short his hardihood fie no nonsense children ma'asuma follow me thou must be presented at once to thy eldest aunt i shall see thee scapegrace doubtless later on so with a nod to babar bundled propriety moved off down the corridor was it chance was it really a trip over a tiresome veil anyhow habee ba begum had rounded a corner and those two young things stood staring at each other as if they had never seen anything in the wide world before it was a real case of love at first sight as for him he did not even realise what she was like he only knew that she was beautiful exceedingly and she knew he was a prince indeed the mirth in their eyes died down then hers grew startled his caught fire so they stood till suddenly hers flamed back into his and with a low cry she huddled her draperies round her turned and fled after her mother babar stood still as a stone what had happened to him he felt confused lost yet utterly entirely absurdly happy after a time he walked soberly downstairs feeling vaguely that the world was a new world and that he must go and find himself once in the street he went on walking blindly on and on till he found himself in desert places outside the town then aimlessly he turned back and walked as he had come wandering through the city as though in search of mansions and gardens yet all the while he felt as if he could neither sit nor go neither stand nor walk he was literally obsessed by a passion pure in its very intensity a passion which at one and the same time made him long to be with its object yet covered him with shame and confusion at the mere thought of her beauty he returned after long hours to ali shir's palace worn out in body but yet more restless in mind he had decided that this must be love love at long last in that case he must write verses and began to catalogue the beauty of the face he had seen he remembered now that they were unusual for little cousin ma'asuma had the rare distinction of fairish hair and blue eyes a little flowerful face merry sparkling rebellious curling hair flecked with red gold a tint of rose and creamy champak all this he remembered dreamily as he laboured to fit together the fine mosaic of a persian love ode impassioned loved one fairest of the fair the waving tendrils of thy bronze gold hair spread round thy face each one a separate snare thine eyes are vi'lets centred by black bees who seek to drain their sweetness to the lees thine eyebrows arch he got so far as this then threw away his pen in disgust anyone could write that sort of stuff he had read pages of it in books had sung such rhymes by the score but that sort of thing had nothing to do with his great love for ma'asuma and hers for him for she had loved him of course the reverse was incredible absurd he turned round and buried his face in the downy cushions that had as usual been spread for him in his favourite corner of the colonnade he had had no dinner he did not want any he had refused his cousin's invitations with some excuse he forgot what it did not matter nothing in the wide world mattered but his love for ma'asuma and hers for him the moon was still bright not quite so bright as it had been that night five days ago when he had promised to marry someone else babar sat up leant his head on his hand and began to consider how matters stood oriental in mind marriage was to him by no means synonymous with love he could legitimately have four wives at a time if he liked but honestly he felt he would rather not still as nothing possibly could prevent his making ma'asuma his wife if the other nameless lady wanted to be his wife also he would acquiesce he would not go back from his promise only what a pity he had called her his moon that name belonged to his love by right so as he sat dreaming a voice said with the nasal twang of the common folk a letter for the presence the coincidence of time and place startled him he looked up half expectant of that tall slim female figure but this was a lad in the uniform of the palace servants a message mayhap from one of the begums he took it carelessly from an awkward brown hand and opened its seal a scent of fresh violets came to him as he did so and the letter it was written in the finest babari hand the hand he had invented with a delicacy an accuracy at which even the inventor of it marvelled and it contained but a quatrain but such a quatrain babar's scholastic appreciation of the form forced its way through his emotional delight at the words ali shir himself could not have written anything neater more absolutely correct in prosody and in such difficult metre too with its enlay of rhymes my heart has part in this thy smart dear heart have part in this my smart our sighs do rise twin to the skies thy heart my heart are not apart and it was signed thy true friend ma'asuma yea that was worth writing that told the tale babar sprang to his feet the whole world seemed filled with radiance he and ma'asuma were the only people in it but what should he answer what should he write nothing but the truth god's truth i love thee i love thee ma'asuma i love thee in his haste his brimming emotion the words fell from his lips as seizing pen and paper he set them down and signed them is that the answer asked the waiting lad as babar held out the missive impatiently am i to take that to my mistress a faint hesitancy over the latter words made the young man look at the boy a dull rather sullen face but not ill looking yes he replied joyously take it to thy mistress it is my answer now and always the lad salaamed and went leaving babar in a heaven of perfect content two days later on friday evening however he was waiting to fulfil his promise in ali shir's tomb absolutely oriental as his outlook was so far as marriage was concerned he yet wondered vaguely if he were fool or knave in acting as he did for the path of true love never very rough when kings are concerned had been made very smooth indeed for the two young people babar had sent his akam to see his yenkam and the whole affair had been settled in five minutes with enthusiasm even the preliminaries had been arranged it being nigh december babar should return to kabul and make preparations there while yenkam would complete hers at herat and with the first blink of returning spring the marriage should take place at some intermediate place meanwhile the young people after chagatai fashion had been allowed to see each other and were in the seventh heaven of delight the betrothals were to be made public in a few days though already babar's conduct was suspicious for he refrained from his cousin's convivial parties and mooned about in the gardens composing sonnets of the heart as he was pleased to call them in his native turkhi which gave him much more freedom than the severely technical persian odes these he sent as written to his dearest dear and they invariably brought back the most beautiful replies more correct if not quite as genuine in feeling as his own effusions he felt he was indeed in luck to find so peerless a maid perfect in beauty and in intelligence one of these compositions the last lay in his waist wallet as he waited in ali shir's tomb the moon had not yet risen and all was dark yet he got up once or twice from the parapet rail on which he sat and paced aimlessly up and down in truth he was restless vaguely dissatisfied with himself he was going to explain of course oh yes he would explain but it might have been better to write yet how could he knowing neither her name nor where she lived he could have found out of course but that might have been to put his paternal aunts on the scent they were dear creatures but dreadful scandalmongers besides he had so much to say a personal explanation would be easier less abrupt kinder not that he meant to back out far from it he was ready to be a good just generous husband unless of course the nameless one preferred not to take second place as she must do there was no helping that it was not his fault love had come he paced quicker as he remembered the words which had so touched him and god the father may send a father's love to the mother of his son well god send he might though that would be a different sort of love altogether from this absorbing passion anyhow he could do no more a kazi able if necessary to perform the marriage ceremony was within call he himself was ready all that was wanting was the lady surely she was late in coming a rustle made him start and listen but it was only the doves in the orange trees no one no one the moon rose after a time over the garden and flooded the terraces with such silvern brilliance that the very pebbles on the path showed distinct but no one came no one could she have heard impossible it was still a court secret and she was a religious recluse so far as he knew besides even if she had changed her mind she might have come or sent a message so at last in rather an ill humour he went back to the palace and dismissed the waiting kazi with a handsome fee there was one more friday ere he left herat and feeling ill used sore yet in a way mightily relieved he waited in ali shir's tomb for another hour or so no one should say he had failed in his part of the bargain he was quite ready besides he had told the woman plainly that he was not in love with her so she had no right to feel aggrieved if she did but that could scarcely be every good mussulman knew she had no claim to a whole man though little ma'asuma had every bit of him yea every bit so it was as well doubtless that no one came and as he went back to the palace his only regret was that he should have called the nameless one my moon the title belonged to his love of right but she would she could never bear it because of the nameless one who had changed her mind apparently but she had not sent back his ring chapter v forward and onward do not ask the task fortune importune is not strife true life kasim beg was in a fever to leave herat marriage he said was good and it was proper to choose a cousin who was doubtless charming though for his part he believed the rather in choice by outsiders for if the result was not happy there was no self blame and self blame was the devil for destroying decent calm but kingship was more important still and as the most high had not been so very secure on his new throne before he had started he simply could not afford to be away more than six months and babar could not but admit his faithful old minister was right so he said farewell reluctantly to little ma'asuma and started at the head of his small army for kabul and as he rode up the last slope whence he could see the gilded city of herat he told himself he could not have done it better he had seen everything he ran over the list of the sights in his mind and found eighty two of them in fact the only one worthy of notice which he had omitted was a certain convent he flushed a little at the remembrance and set the thought aside with self complacence that he had come through the temptations of the most luxurious town in the world quite unscathed he had not played any indecent or scurvy tricks he had not touched wine he had altogether been quite a virtuous prince so with characteristic buoyancy despite the fact that he had said good bye to his first and only love he settled himself in the saddle and his face for home here difficulties arose at once it began to snow the very day they left herat and babar was for taking the low road for safety's sake it was the longer of course but the hill road was at all times difficult and dangerous in snow practically impassable but kasim beg who had been in a fuss for days behaved very perversely so that in the end babar gave way and they started for the passes taking one binai an old mountaineer as their guide now whether it was from old age or from his heart failing him at the unusual depth of the drifts is uncertain but this is sure having once lost the path he never could find it again so as to point out the way however as kasim beg and his sons were anxious to preserve their reputation as route choosers they dismounted beat down the snow and discovered something like a road along which the party much reduced by defections due to the delights of herat managed to advance for a day when it was brought to a complete stand by the depth of the snow which was such that the horses' feet did not touch the ground seeing no other remedy babar ordered a retreat to a ravine where there was abundance of firewood and thence despatched sixty or seventy chosen men to return by the road they had come and retracing their footsteps to find on the lower ground any huzaras or other people who might be wintering there and to bring a guide who was able to point out the way this done they halted in the ravine for three or four days awaiting the return of the men who had been sent out these did indeed come back but without having been able to find a guide what was to be done nothing but place reliance on god and push forward so said babar a light in his clear eyes as he recognised that he was in a tight place that before him and his lay such hardships and sufferings as even he had scarcely undergone at any other period of his life but then at no other period of his life had love been waiting her rosy wings fluttering for him to win through warm yourselves to the marrow this night he said to all eat your fill and carry firewood in place of the victuals we shall need every atom of strength we can save and spend but he himself spent a wakeful night and wrote a turkhi verse to console himself it ran thus and was rather poor though nothing else was to be expected under such circumstances fate from my very birth has marked me down there is no injury i have not known not one so what care i what fortune bring no harm unknown can come to me the king they were up betimes a long straggling party doing their best to struggle on by beating down the snow and so forming a road along which the laden mules could go it was luckily a fine day and by evening they could count on an advance of three miles what was more as no snow had fallen they were able to send back along the beaten track for more firewood so it went on for two or three days then the men began to be discouraged and babar set his teeth with love awaiting him at the other side he meant to get over the pass he only had about fifteen volunteers from his immediate staff but those fifteen headed by vitality incarnate worked wonders every step taken was up to the middle or the breast in soft fresh fallen snow but still it was a step and he who followed did not sink so far thus they laboured as the vigour of the person who went first was generally expended after he had gone a few paces another advanced and took his place lo gentlemen 'tis as good as leap frog cried the young leader joyously and thereinafter they strove for steps and as ever babar came out first see you he said gravely in explanation of his own prowess 'tis i brought you hither and if we do not beat hard we shall be beaten at which mild joke kasim laughed profusely though he felt as if he could have killed himself for having thus jeopardised his young hero's life the fifteen or so who worked in trampling down the snow next succeeded in dragging on a riderless horse this generally sank to the stirrups and after ten or fifteen paces was worn out the next fared better and the next and the next and after all the led horses had thus been brought forward came a sorry sight the rest of the troops even the best men and many who bore the title of noble advancing not even dismounted along the road that had been beaten down for them by their king some of them certainly had the grace to hang their heads but this was no time babar felt for reproach or even for authority every man who possessed spirit or emulation must have hastened to the front without orders and those without spirits were worse than useless at such a time we must do without them kasim said the young king when his minister would have spoken his mind 'twill not mend matters with cowards to tell them they be such could any tongue circle the lie i would praise them for their bravery but with death staring us in the face i stick to truth and to work also the life and soul of the fifteen he kept them going by jokes and quips and the singing of songs aye even when storm and snow came with blinding force and they all expected to meet death together then it was that ahead of all babar's full mellow voice rang out in such ballads as the hand of the thief the bog was black outside kazan now it is red last night there came a rich car wan blood has been shed now adham khan was over lord judging the right of quarr'l betwixt the black sheep horde and they of the white oh adham khan avenge the wrong thou art the head my hand holds fast the skirt that's long smiling he said then rose in wrath young zulfikar girt on his sword now show i him in full durbar right is the lord he saddled steed and rode away over the sand his hauberk rattling roundelay god at his hand and adham khan he sat in state holding his court now who is he who comes so late what has he brought i bring a gift from the black horde chief thy honour's friend and lay the hand of a common thief on thy skirt's end the stiff dead hand skimmed through the air lay like a stone of all the court not one did dare right to disown oh warrior hear against the right keep thou from strife but if the wrong is done then fight fight for thy life they were in truth fighting for dear life and there was a chance of it ahead of them for nigh the top of the great zerrin pass lay a cave wherein shelter might be found at least so said binai the guide but the snow fell in such quantities the wind was so dreadful so terribly violent it needed all babar's courage not to give in but the rosy fluttering wings of love would not let him yield he could not lose little cousin ma'asuma the very thought of her warmed him the scent of her hair came to him with the snow the drifts deepened the possibility of path narrowed in the steep defile the days were at the shortest with difficulty could the horses be kept on the trampled road yet all around was certain death in unfathomed snow depths babar's face was stern he was nigh his end and he knew it and then suddenly a shout from keen eyed tengari old kasim's son the cave the cave yonder is the cave and it was but to all appearance disappointingly small not large enough to hold one half of those seeking shelter though the surrounding cliffs in some measure tempered the bitter fierceness of the wind the most high had better go in said kasim as babar set to work arranging what best he could for his troopers i will see to the men but babar shook his head and went on he felt that for him to be in warmth and comfort while his men were in snow and drift for him to be enjoying sleep and ease while his followers were in trouble and distress would be inconsistent from what he owed them and a deviation from that society in suffering that was their due 'death in the company of friends is a feast' at any rate so runs the proverb he remarked lightly and indeed kasim having brought these poor souls to this pass it is but right that whatever their sufferings and difficulties whatever they may have to undergo i should be equal sharer in all so when he had done what he could and shown others what to do he took a hoe and dug down in the snow as deep as his breast without reaching the ground then crouched down in it the day was darkening evening prayer time had passed and still belated troopers came dropping in the snow was now falling so fast that the men in the dug out shelter ran some chance of being smothered as they slept from sheer fatigue babar himself found four inches of snow above him as he scrambled out of his hole when a last party straggled in bringing binai the guide with the welcome news that the cave was far larger than hasty observation would expect and that a narrow passage led to quite a spacious cavern within where there was ample room for all joyful news indeed sending out to call in all his men babar soon found himself by one of his own extraordinary changes of luck in a wonderfully warm safe and comfortable place for there proved to be firewood within the cave and such as had any eatables stewed meat preserved flesh or anything else they might have produced them for a common meal thus all escaped as by a miracle from the terrible cold the snow the bitter bitter wind and the rosy wings of love fluttered gaily as babar laid himself down to sleep the first sleep he had had for days it was the turning point though there was still distress and misery to come the snow however had ceased to fall by the morning the wind had died down moving with the first blink of dawn they still had to tread down the snow in the old way but it was with more hope the cave in which they had rested was as they were aware close to the beginning of the last steep ascent to the great pass this the shortest way they knew to be impassable and even kasim and his sons warned by experience did not advise its attempt bad enough was a lower valley road of which old binai the guide had vaguely heard yet it was their only chance so they took it but evening found them still in the defile and such was its precipitate nature that there was nothing for it but for every man to halt where he found himself dismount scrape a hole in the snow for himself and his horse if possible and so await the tardy dawn to bring sufficient light for safe advance it was an awful night the retreat of the storm had brought frost icy keen piercing and though none of the hardy troopers actually lost their lives many lost hands and feet from frostbite babar himself kept his blood warm by pacing up and down singing at the top of his voice with that curious instinct of shouting which comes always to humanity with the grip of cold mayhap it cheered the others to hear the mellow melodious chants echoing so blithely over the snow he sang many things but his favourite was the song of the smiling shepherd from sunset until dawn of day my forehead frozen with the frost i shut mine eyes like wolf at bay and sing to find the sheep i've lost when angels walk at break of day among pale wormwood on the lea upon the night of power they say my smiling soul came unto me it had a palace of pure gold in paradise and yet it chose to leave the heat of heaven for cold and help me find the sheep i love so in the dark and in the snow we twain make up one perfect whole and sing glad songs the while we go a smiling shepherd smiling soul dawn came at last and they moved down the glen it was not the usual road that was more circuitous but with the snow filling up the valley and obliterating precipices ravines crevasses there seemed a chance of being able to manage a shorter route and time meant so much to those exhausted men yet babar himself halted for awhile and so did a few of his immediate followers when his horse stumbled fell could not rise take mine my liege said half a dozen voices but the young man's face set i will not leave the beast he said resolutely it hath done me good service and may do it again see you bring some of the men's lances and their halter ropes samur and i live together or die together and he laid his young cheek to the horse's soft muzzle affectionately then starting up he set the men to work to form a criss cross raft or sledge of lances on to which samur was pulled by main force 'tis all down hill now said he when it was finished and seizing a rope strained at it nay sire remarked old kasim drily if the most excellent choose to risk lives for the sake of a dumb brute let them be the lives of dumb brutes not kings troopers six horses to save one babar hung his head but held to the rope doubtless i am a brute also he murmured half to himself so let me be dumb save for this god made me so the staunch old warrior heard the words and shook his head yet in his heart of hearts he would not have altered one jot or one tittle in his idol zahir ud din mahomed babar was for him the first gentleman in the world truly said the latter with pious cheerfulness after a time during which the sledge slipped easily down the steep slopes of snow it is well said 'looked at wisely with clear eyes ills are blessings in disguise' but for this extreme depth of snow which till now hath seemed our worst enemy we should all be tumbling down precipices and being lost in crevasses this was obvious but it cheered the party until in the far distance something more tangible showed to bring sudden alacrity to outwearied steps a hut surely and that figure on the lessening snow slopes was it a man still it was nigh bed time prayers before they extricated themselves from the mouth of the valley and the villagers of yaka aulang came out to meet the forlorn party to help and even to carry some of them into warm houses and thereinafter to slaughter fat sheep for them bring a superfluity of hay and grass for their horses and abundance of wood to kindle their fires once again babar felt that to pass from the cold and snow into such a village with its warm houses and to escape from want and suffering to find such plenty of good bread and fat sheep as they did was an enjoyment that can only be conceived by such as have suffered similar hardships or endured such heavy distress but better by far to him than this material satisfaction was the glow at his heart when an old white headed patriarch nodding by the fireside mumbled never has it been done before never since the memory of man hath zerrin been passed in such snow never hath any man ever conceived even the idea of passing it at such season never never it was something to have done after this marching was easy but the strain had told upon the courage of the rank and file and once when the little party came upon a clan of hazaras who disputed passage in a narrow defile there was near disaster the young king who was in the rear galloped up to find his force retreating before a deadly flight of arrows stand he shouted stand but the men would not be rallied fools he cried rising in his stirrups a fine young figure unarmoured without sword or lance without helmet or aught but his bow and quiver for the attack was entirely unforeseen and he had been for the time off duty call ye yourselves servants to stand still while the master works lo he who hires a servant hires him for his need not to stand still like a slipped camel so with a wild huroosh he set his horse spurring forward the reckless bravery did its work the men roused by it turned to follow the ambuscade was reached the hill beyond climbed after the enemy who seeing the troopers were in real earnest fled like deer so the danger passed but babar wondered vaguely that night if it was to be ever so if the great mass of humanity ever needed a flaming match ere they would catch fire but there was more trouble to come as with such haste as was possible for the snow which was very heavy that winter hindered them even in the valleys they pushed on towards kabul it was one day at noon when being almost perished with the frost they had alighted to kindle fires and warm themselves ere going on that a messenger on horseback arrived with ill news the moghuls left behind in kabul had risen and aided by outsiders and some of the immediate relations of the king had declared for babar's young cousin weis khan on whose behalf they were now besieging the fort which in capable and loyal hands was still holding out for the rightful king said i not so sire remarked old kasim drily the devil is in it when women are left alone too long babar flushed the devil is in a moghul thou meanest kasim sniffed the most high's step grandmother shah begum is of pure moghul descent i grant if that is what my liege means i stake my word she is in it did i not beg the most high to send her packing back to tashkend aye and the boy and his mother too also the other aunt of my liege's who married the commoner doghlat wherefore god knows since some of us had better right to royal wives than he but if 'tis a question of aunts the most high is soft as buffalo butter babar bit his lip he felt that old kasim had right on his side but what could one do they were women and he was undoubtedly the head of the family but this was serious the more so because the messenger said that reports had been diligently circulated to the effect that he babar had been imprisoned in herat by his cousins and would never return they must know that i shall return said the young leader grimly and forthwith wrote despatches to be conveyed to known loyalists in the town advising them of his immediate appearance of which however they were to say nothing a blazing fire on the last hill top would herald his approach this was to be answered by a flare on the top of the citadel showing that it was ready for a combined surprise attack on the besieging force with these orders given stringently babar set out at nightfall by dawn kabul lay before them and a glow of light from the citadel answered their signal fire all therefore was in readiness so they crept on to syed kasim's bridge here babar detailed his force sending shirim taghai with the right wing to another bridge he himself with the centre and left making for the town here instantly all was uproar and alarm the alleys were narrow the assailants and defenders crowded into them could scarce move their horses dismount cut your way through rang out the order and it was obeyed a few minutes later babar was in the four corner garden where he knew the young aspirant was quartered but he had fled babar followed in his track at the gate he met an old friend the chief constable of the town who made at him with a drawn sword babar after his usual fashion had despised either plate mail or helmet and when whether from confusion of ideas arising from the battle of fight or from the snow and cold affecting his eyesight the swordsman failing to recognise his king or heed his cry of friend friend hit a shrewd blow babar was like to have his arm shorn off but the grace of god was conspicuous not even a hair was hurt so as quick as he could to the palace of doghlat commoner where he found kasim already on the track of the traitor but the latter had escaped here a moghul who had been in babar's service deliberately fitted an arrow to his bow aimed at the king and let go but the uproar raised around him the cries and shouts that is the king that is the king must have disconcerted his aim for he failed of his mark and here also one of the chief rebels was brought in ignominiously a rope round his neck he fell at the young king's feet sire he whined what fault is mine the young face was stern indeed is there greater crime came the clear cold answer than for a man of worth and family as thou art to conspire and associate with revolutionaries then the contemptuous order came sharp but remove that rope and let him go hang himself he is of my family no harm shall happen to him through me so on again through the town where the rabble had taken to clubs and were making a riot in order to station parties here and there to disperse the crowds and prevent plunder thus growing cooler more dignified as stress ceased to the paradise gardens where the begums lived no time like the present to show his mettle to let these foolish women know that he did not consider their intrigues worth a man's consideration he found the chief conspirator shah begum huddled up out of all measure alarmed confounded dismayed ashamed all the more so when that brilliant young figure paused at the door to make its accustomed and reverential salutation he looked well did babar with the fire of fight still in his eyes a certain quizzical affection about his mouth i salute thee o revered step grandmother he said cheerfully good humouredly so crossing he went down on his knees in filial fashion and embraced the old lady cordially whereupon of course she began to whimper babar sat back and looked at her kindly wherefore revered one lo i am not vexed what right has a child to be so because his mother's bounty descends upon another the mother's authority over her children is in all respects absolute save that this grandson and not the other is king of kabul then he laughed lo he added i am so sleepy i have not slept all night let me rest my hand on thy bosom grandmother as i used to rest it on my mother's the whimper changed into a storm of sobs and afterwards when the young aspirant and the doghlat commoner had been caught and brought up for condign punishment by kasim he forgave them both but the traitor deserves death sire stuttered the stern old martinet he hath been guilty of mutiny rebellion he is criminal guilty and the younger one is devil's spawn you mistake old friend said the young king quietly they are of my family poor old kasim had to content himself by assenting loudly in whatever company he found himself that however much the king might try to wear away the rust of shame with the polish of mildness and humanity he was unable to wipe out the dimness of ignominy which had covered the mirror of those miscreants' lives chapter vi yes love triumphant came engrossing all the fond luxuriant thoughts of youth and mind then in soft converse did they pass the hours their passion like the season fresh and fair nizami the judas trees were in full blossom but a day or two before they had been dry branches brown wrinkled to all appearances dead now with a swiftness nigh miraculous they had flushed every inch of finest twig to rosy red under their mantle of sweet scented bloom the ground underneath them was already carpeted with fallen flowers their five petalled cups like those of a regal geranium still perfect utterly 'tis like the blossoming of love in the heart is it not little one said babar idly as lying amid the spent blossoms he raised one to perch it coquettishly on the goldy brown curls that rested on his breast he had been married five months to little cousin ma'asuma but it seemed to him like five days aye though happenings stern and sad had filled the interval kasim had been right herat had been plundered by the arch enemy shaibani his cousins had fled leaving wives and children to fall into the hands of the conquerors at another time babar's hot anger might have led him to attempt reprisals though he knew it would be but an attempt but in these first months of marriage he could not find it in his heart to leave little ma'asuma for any time if indeed she would have allowed him to do so for small young delicate as she was those violet eyes of hers could set hard as sapphires aye and have a gleam in them too like any gem the first time babar saw it he caught her in his arms and half smothered her with kisses until she bade him peremptorily put her down and then they had both laughed and babar had vowed in his heart that never had lover been so fortunate as he his mistress was what was she not briefly she was all things to him he had never been in love with a woman before and his self surrender was complete small wonder indeed if it were for there was something almost uncanny in the beauty of the face which looked up at him love in its eyes put it on thine own rough head man she said superbly thou needest ornament more than i and it was true from the tiny silvern and golden slipper she had kicked off to the light gold spangled veil which just touched her curly head she was ornament personified the dainty heart shaped opening of the violet tinted gauze bodice she wore over a pale green corselet was all set with seed pearls and turquoises hung on cunning little silvern tendrils and the corselet itself all veined with golden threads and pale moonstones so with the flimsy full almost transparent muslin petticoat pale pale green that lay in shrouding folds over the violet tinted under garment all edged and embroidered all scent sodden with the perfume of violets his favourite flower then to be his favourite flower till his death truly a marvellous small person from head to foot have a care man she said sternly as he crushed her closer to him or we shall quarrel and 'tis not good for me to quarrel now he released her quickly yet cautiously gentle as he was he was always forgetting he told himself that she was doubly precious to him now lo dear heart he said penitently we have not quarrelled these five days not since i was angry because the tire woman overdyed my hands with henna she replied mischievously and thou didst tell me there were worse evils for tears as if i cared so long as my hands were not pretty for thee she held them up for him to admire and they were pretty delicate and curved and pink like rose petals he kissed them dutifully so much he knew was expected of him and he loved the task and as penance for rudeness man she went on her face all dimples thou wert to write me a love ode on the subject hast done it sirrah that have i assented her lover husband gladly dost know little one i string more pearls now than ever but thou thou hast not written one line since we were married yet thou hadst the prettiest art ma'asuma lay back on her resting place and laughed softly someday stupid i will tell thee why but now for thy verses babar caught up his lute and sat tuning it his eyes wandering away to the girdle of snows that clipped the blue hill horizon they were in the garden of the new year alone save for that dear grave yonder where the jasmine flowers were drooping their scented waxen stars dear mother how glad she would have been to see ma'asuma to think of the grandson who was so soon to make life absolutely perfect yes the cup of life the crystal bowl could hold no more he lost himself in dreams to be roused by an impatient well i listen then he turned and smiled at her as he began with exaggerated expression oh fair impassioned whom god hath fashioned my love to be thy hands so tender thy fingers slender rosy i see be they flower tinted or blood imprinted from my poor heart torn by thy smiling tears and beguiling feminine art yet sweet calamity dwell we in amity each perfect day yea in the bright time yea in the night time lovers alway sweet calamity she echoed pouting her lips and trying hard to frown as the song finished couldst find no other title for thy lawful wife and yet here smiles overcame her lo babar 'tis a beautiful name and i am thy sweet calamity alway alway then suddenly to his dismay she began to cry softly the big tears running down her pretty cheeks in easy childish fashion nay she went on half smiles again at his solicitude i am not ill there is naught wrong 'tis only that i am lonely when thou art doing king's work which must be done if only foster sister would come i should not be so frightened but my yenkam thy mother will be here protested babar ma'asuma shook her head it is now dear heart and foster sister will not come unless thou askest her she said so couldst not write to her babar but i know not foster sister nor aught of her save that she was good to my ma'asuma for which may heaven reward her ma'asuma sat up her charming face happy in thought oh so good my lord not a real foster sister either but we sat under one veil and drank milk out of one cup that was when we first came to khorasan thy yenkam and i and since then she babar be not angry but i will tell thee i meant to have told thee i should have told thee before the violet eyes showed trouble once more and babar kissed them deliberately what sweetheart he asked carelessly he knew the gentle kindly heart too well to fear any revelation only it was she not i who wrote the verses the verses i sent i was too stupid and she is clever oh so clever despite his certitude the young man looked startled so he said at last fortune hath not given me the grace of a poetess to wife so be it but who is this paragon ma'asuma however was too delighted at having got over her confession so happily to refrain from autocratic dignity that i have said she is foster sister and of the circle of distinction thy yenkam can tell thee of genealogies they tire my head so write dost hear babar laughed he loved to take orders from those sweet lips besides a certain zest came with the idea of writing to an unknown poetess yea i will write he said meekly but i will have to regard zals and zes for more elegant nastalik saw i never than hers so the letter was written and despatched express to the care of his yenkam at khorasan and six weeks later little ma'asuma sat beside her foster sister in the summer house of the new garden of fidelity which babar was laying out at adinahpore and whither he had taken his young wife whose daily increasing delicacy filled him with concern of all the gardens that babar planted and watered this was the one nearest his heart in a most romantic situation on the south side of and overlooking the river its groves of oranges and citrons grew untouched by hard winter frosts while every flower every tree of his beloved hill country flourished side by side with those of warm climates above it towered the white mountain and the almond spring pass below it the valley debouched into wide fertility and babar was hard at work delving away himself like any adam making a four square cross of marble reservoirs through which the clear hill stream might run planting new flowers from here there everywhere the tan of his sunburnt face and hands contrasted sadly with the sallowing skin of the girl wife who despite his care was sinking under her task of son bearing then he knows not who i am said the tall slender woman on whose knee ma'asuma was resting her pretty weary head i deemed thou hadst told him as we agreed she spoke gravely and her level black brows were faintly knit the rest of the face was richly beautiful in strong sweeping curves but those level brows and the dark thoughtful eyes beneath them held the attention not that it matters she added quickly seeing tears ready to brim over the violets upturned to her after all 'tis nothing to thy lord or to any other man whether i be widow to mirza gharib beg or no so long as i be honourable woman therefore tell him not now that i am here and babar coming in to see his wife found the veiled new comer courteous in speech charming in manner found also such favourable change in his darling's spirits that a glow of comradeship for his aide rose up in his soft heart at once so they were very happy together those three and by degrees foster sister's thick enshrouding veil was changed for a more filmy one and babar could get a glimpse of those glorious eyes and see the little satirical smile about the strong curves of the mouth they reminded him vaguely why he knew not of his dead cousin gharib but he never spoke of this to ma'asuma with her burden of coming life it would be unlucky to speak of the dead thus a week or two went by and all insensibly the man learnt to rely on the woman who shared with him the charge of the girl the most benevolent one is very good to my wife he said suddenly one day and my gratitude can only lie in words the most benevolent bowed gravely thanks are not needed ma'asuma begum came into this dust like one's life when it was unhappy she hath been god's best boon to me and to me also answered the young husband sadly do what he would he could not escape from fear the shadow of impending evil seemed to darken his life he had to brisk and hearken himself up to face the future for perilous times were at hand the fateful seventh month so much dreaded by indian midwives was beginning but his yenkam would be with her daughter in a day or two they would together take ma'asuma back in her litter to kabul by easy stages and all would all must go well it was one glorious morning in early august when this feeling of ill to come made him catch up his lute to chase away thought by song he had carried little ma'asuma himself down to the tank half surrounded by burnished orange trees which was the very eye of the beauty of the garden they had dismissed all attendants bidding them leave behind them their trays of sherbet and sweetmeats but not even the perfect loveliness of hill and sky and garden not even the faint flush as of returning health on the invalid's face could charm the splendour of life into babar's soul the crystal bowl seemed dull opaque this must not be he set the strings of his lute a twanging and began clear crystal bowl thy wine bubbles laugh the figure seated by the tank side its reflection in the water rose suddenly as if startled gathered its draperies round it so with face averted strolled off into the garden there came ma'asuma's reproachful voice thou hast driven her away stupid the young man arrested in his song looked hurt but wherefore 'tis a good song good mayhap came the thoughtless answer but see you it reminds her of gharib beg who wrote it and wherefore not asked babar swiftly little ma'asuma looked scared lo there i have told thee and i said i would hold my tongue because see you gharib beg married and left her in the old days whether rightly as some say or foolishly as others i know not but 'twas so she was religious for long years and when i went to the school to learn the holy book we became friends and oh babar thou wilt never know how good she was to me when i fell in love with my lord and he with me the roguish face looking more like itself than he had seen it for months nestled on to his shoulder he put his arm round the slender figure and drew it to him mechanically grateful that her words had given him time to pull himself together gharib beg's wife the woman he had called maham his moon so he said with an effort she was my cousin's wife but wherefore was i not told ma'asuma pouted because i did not at first and then when she came she would not have it why i know not save that mayhap before the son was coming i wanted thy praise for for such things as verses and now my lord must say naught promise me he will not or she will be vexed i will not vex her he said diplomatically and changed the subject adroitly by picking up a tiny red silk cap half embroidered with seed pearls on which his wife had been working and which had fallen on the path lo he laughed is that the way to treat my son's head dress and he held the ridiculous little object out on his forefinger and twirled it round so the question passed but he was of too frank a nature to palliate concealment and that night when the moon had risen he found himself once more confronting a tall slender figure that stood aggressively this time against a marble pillar but there was no swinging lamp to cast a rose reflection between them yea zahir ud din mahomed babar said the proud voice it is even as my lord hath divined i knew i was the lad who brought my lord his mistress's message which i had written it was to me that my lord gave his 'i love thee ever ever' this being so what else was there left to do save what was done the finality of her words struck babar like a blow he never minced matters even with himself naught he said gloomily naught then he added but now the veiled figure caught him up quickly now she must not know she must never know babar stood still and leaning his head on his arm against the pilaster looked out into the garden it lay silvern peaceful a thing of perfect beauty a place wherein no sinful man should walk or set foot lo came the sweet voice i have kept i will keep my lord's ring it was not he who broke faith but i the most noble is very good he said simply and left her there was no more to say had there been more there would have been little time for it a hasty twinkling light showed ere long adown the palace colonnade voices came in excited whispers her highness the begum was not well god send it might be nothing but 'twas the fateful month fateful indeed all that night long babar waited in a fever of anxiety listening to the fitful wails the thousand and one slight sounds of sudden direful sickness what were they doing to his ma'asuma his little ma'asuma his love his heart's darling his little one would he ever see her again the dawn came and still he watched still he waited the birds in the bushes began to sing to sing forsooth while she lay in the shadow of death heartless cruel for she must die so small so slender how could she stand out against those long hours of agony noon passed and still he waited every nerve in his strong young body wearied by imagined pain it was not till sun setting that a voice roused him as he sat crouched in on himself my lord has a daughter he was on his feet in a second setting the idea aside as trivial what was son or daughter to him beside his dearest dear she he asked breathlessly my lord had best come and see replied the kind sympathetic voice he recognised it faintly but it made no impression on him the small room was hot and close full of smoke also from a useless fire hastily lit up and ma'asuma lay covered by endless quilts but it was ma'asuma herself who lay there peaceful as if already dead but her face was alight with feeble smiles only for a moment however then the curly goldy brown head turned restlessly on the pillow i am sorry she murmured i i wanted it to be a son but but the voice trailed away into weaker sobbing hush silly one said babar gently his heart in his mouth as he noted her looks what god gives is best if she is like thee she will be all i need a small trembling hand fluttered out to a corner of the coverlet like me i know not babar what wilt thou call her when i am gone the words cut him like a knife because he knew they were true there was something which told him that the dearest thing on earth to him was fast slipping from his grasp yet the simplicity of his nature kept him calm i will give her her mother's name he said quietly ma'asuma sighed with content and was silent for a space then after a while her voice weaker than ever rose again a low monotonous voice that told of ebbing strength babar who will nurse my child give her not to strange women lo i never loved strangers nor dost thou thou dear heart foster sister where art thou send the strangers away and the slaves and come close i want thee one wave of babar's hand cleared the little room and once more came that faint sigh of content that is nice only thou and i and she and little ma'asuma all the folk i love in the world that is right for a moment she seemed to sleep and when she opened her eyes there were dreams in them set the window wide i would see the sunset she said in quite a strong voice and when the red light flooded into the little dark room she lay in it peacefully will it not mayhap hurt whispered the tall figure in white she is past hurt whispered babar back his heart was as a stone he could not have wept he could not even feel grief thy hand my heart came the voice feeble again and thine sister how warm they are and mine grow so cold so cold yet that matters not i am only only the kazi the ghost of a flickering smile hovered over the lips that in the monotonous arabic drawl of the professional priest began on the opening sentences of the mahomedan wedding service the man and the woman standing instinct with life looked helplessly at each other and instinctively drew apart ma'asuma's violet eyes seemed to strive with coming darkness don't she murmured it is not kind look you i cannot see and my hands are so weak be quick or i shall not hear say it quickly and then there will be peace then i shall have given my lord a son then we shall all be at rest it is the last thing there was a second of silence and then babar's clasp on the hand he held beneath that small chill one tightened and his voice rang clear before god i take this woman to be my wedded wife and swift on the words came a woman's voice before god i take this man to be my husband the father of our son a sigh of content seemed almost to end life and there was silence for a space but it was broken by a pitiful helpless murmur the ring i have forgotten the ring i have it already sweetheart came the woman's voice soft calm soothing so they stood till the chill little hands grew more chill in the warm clasps that held them finally one withdrew itself slowly slowly and babar was left alone with death and love the tall white figure fell on its knees and wept softly but babar stood still stern calm what use to kiss unconscious lips what use to strain at broken cords she hath found freedom he said after a time then he turned to the kneeling figure maham he said quietly thou wilt see to little ma'asuma for me wilt thou not it was sunrise when they laid to rest babar's first and in a way his only love the birds were singing in the garden he had made so beautiful the roses that decked the grave were full of scent but babar noticed none of these things he moved about calm self controlled conscious of but one thing that he was glad he was not at kabul where he would have had wailing women and ceremonial condolences here in the open among the flowers all was peace he need not even realise that his dearest dear was dead but he had overrated his emotional strength or rather he had underrated it as he always did all the day long as he went about as usual his face haggard his manner courteous and gentle a storm was brewing within and when sunset came again bringing the sadness of a dead day with it the tempest burst maham her eyes red with weeping was seated in the dusk of the little room where ma'asuma had died with the dead woman's babe on her lap when she looked up to see a tall swaying figure standing at the door a helpless bewildered figure that stretched out bewildered hands to her maham maham it cried save me save me from myself she rose instantly laid the sleeping infant on the bed and went to him thou art tired she said as a mother might have said it come hither and rest awhile my lord sleep will bring peace chapter vii i am the dust beneath thy feet my sweet thou art the cloud that sprinkleth rain amain lo as green tongues of grasses spring to bring their thanks for moisture given to root and fruit so all my being blossometh and saith dear god be praised for love of thee and me maham had her work cut out for her but she was a wise woman and from the first gauged babar's volatile kindly affectionate nature to a nicety he had had a shock and one with such fine strung nerves as his required time for recovery therefore with easy ability she took the tiller ropes and steered his craft and hers through the troubled waters which instantly raged about him she even rather to their resentment succeeded in pacifying babar's step grandmother and his paternal aunts as to her position which she claimed at once as babar's wife they had been betrothed for months she told them indeed for long years the intent to marry had been existent so much so that they had her late husband gharib beg's hearty assent to their union she had come from khorasan at ma'asuma begum's earnest wish and the marriage had taken place when it did this she left hazy entirely to please her when she was ill and ailing doubtless the dear little thing had had a prescience of her own death such angels of paradise often had she maham could never hope to hold the same place in the king's affection still it was lucky things had happened so or the most clement might have gone out of his mind with grief deprived as he was in the wilds of adinapur of the consolations of all his womenkind and the gracious ladies knew how dependent he had always been on them as well as on his deceased mother on whom be god's peace and his unfortunate sister besides she could be useful in bringing up the king's little daughter if thou wilt give him a son 'twould be to more purpose quoth outspoken shah begum god helping me i will madam came the cool reply she is well spoken admitted the old lady grudgingly after the interview was over and of the inner circle 'deed now that one comes to consider it wept babar's yenkam more suited for the work than my fairy who was ever too lightsome for such task and look you there be no question of evil eye or such things she loved my ma'asuma as herself and was ever good to the child it is doubtless god's will yea yea god's will snivelled fat silly princess astonishing beauty but little ak begum's keen eyes were soft there is more in it than mayhap we know she said softly and she hath a good clever face so god send our kind babar peace good wishes were well enough doubtless but maham felt that action must be taken and at once my lord the king must not be allowed to lounge at home eating his heart out and to this purpose she sent for old kasim and explained her views lady he replied i would rather in faith have had my master free of all feminine wiles the last seven months have passed without much glory and my sword rusts in its scabbard but this i will say for a woman the cupola of chastity shows much sense the king would be best away from kabul and from me added maham coolly so look to it sir general and take him where thou canst as it so happened the times fell in with her desire the timurid family was at its lowest ebb babar himself being for the moment the only member of it which had kept his kingdom independent the rest having either succumbed utterly to the great usbek raider or become mere vassals to his power thus the king's position was weak even if he had been himself but maham's clear eyes appraised her haggard young king as he went about grave silent doing everything by an effort that was not the stuff for single handed combat against fate then sorrow set his feet firmer than ever on the path of what he considered right and this mood was not one in which to rely on those moghul troops of his who were ever ready to take offence at strict discipline no he must be induced to divert attention from kabul by carrying war to some further field the further the better so long as it gave those same moghul troops opportunity for legitimate raiding babar himself never knew how much one woman's influence had to do with his resolution to march on hindustan even old kasim though he had the key did not realise how maham managed to set aside his proposal of an attempt on badakhshan in favour of the larger more imaginative project but it was done so one day babar sad faced still but with a certain spring in his walk came to say good bye to his little daughter and to the woman who quietly unobtrusively had done so much for him yea she said smiling i will be queen whilst thou art gone babar never fear nor shah begum nor mihr nigar nor any other woman in the palace shall give trouble this time i warrant me and the child will thrive aye it will thrive so there is no gnawing thought at thy heart remember she paused for a second and something in her face made babar say hastily nor in thine i pray kind wife nor in mine she echoed with a brilliant smile and now ere he go i have something for my lord a remembrance of someone he loved well and whom i respected she put her hand in her bosom and drew out thence all warm and faintly scented a small crystal bowl babar gave a cry of delight the bowl the bowl how didst find it did he give it thee did he really give it me her kind eyes smiled on him that i cannot say and this is not the bowl but perchance a likeness of it 'twas the dear dead one my lord who told me the tale when thou didst tell it to her so knowing what sort the cup must be since there is an old man in my native village who still can make them after a fashion i sent to him pressingly for one my lord will remember that 'twas in this village graveyard that the crystal bowl was found doubtless one of olden time this is but a copy and poor doubtless since the old craftsman can scarce see but it may serve to remind my lord of many things and much kindness said babar gravely and as he took the bowl he kissed the hand that held it out to him no it was not the bowl it was but a dim likeness of it but as he placed it in his bosom he felt vaguely that he had more than he deserved the next few months passed swiftly once in the saddle and out of kabul babar's spirits began to rise but he soon found it inadvisable to pursue his intentions on india the very idea of his absenting himself so far roused the insolence of the wild border clans here was their opportunity whilst the cat would be away to resort to their favourite plunder so it was mid winter before it was possible for him to advance and by that time the complexion of affairs had changed to begin with the usbek raider had retreated patching up a sort of peace hurriedly and returning westward over more important business then whether by reason of maham's firm hand or from mere ambition old grandmother shah begum announced her intention of leaving babar's protection and going with her grandson to snatch at the sovereignty of badakhshan the crown had been hereditary in her family she declared for over years and though as woman she could not claim it she knew her grandson would not be rejected this intention involving as it did a breaking up of conventional family life brought back babar in protest the old lady had never been on the best of terms with him she had once almost succeeded in her intrigues against him but he had always treated her generously and then worse than her defection was that of his own mother's sister who insisted on accompanying her it was intolerable babar went straight to his grandmother and argued with her coming back irritated and annoyed by failure to make any impression on the old lady's obstinacy to his own palace where without giving notice he made his way alone to maham's apartments as he entered her room he could see her reclining amongst cushions in the cupola'd balcony his little sleeping daughter in her lap she was crooning to it the lullaby which turkhoman women sing sleepily during a night march her pose was exquisite there was a look of almost motherhood in her face he paused to listen as she sang sleep croodie talk with god know not the path i've trod dad knows not why shouldst thou sleep childie sleep just now don't fear i keep awake heigh ho my bones do ache heigh ho my horse does pull can't it see river's full no pebbles in that bed mine holds an hundred dreams dreams who lies dead someone in the river's bed praise god he rests his head hush hush i hear thee sweet mums arms around thee meet praise god the night's nigh past darling sleeps at last at last the curious drowsiness of the rhythm held him almost silent for a while so did a great surge of admiration for this self restrained kindly capable woman who had taken her full position as his wife so firmly without any feminine flutterings or sentimentalities truly that sort of thing was what he with his volatile emotionality needed to make him not only successful but persistent maham he said almost timorously i have come back to thee and the child she gave a little cry started to rise then pointed to little ma'asuma i should waken her she said in a low voice but welcome thrice welcome is my lord to me and to the child her voice lingered over the words her smile had a certain gravity in it but thou he said anxiously hast not been well wife thy face shows ill why didst not write to me because 'twas not worth while she replied and i am most better the spring comes and with it health and i have had anxiety over thy grandmother what said she the deft turn succeeded babar gave vent to his dissatisfaction in no measured terms see you he said have i ever failed in my duty or service when my mother and i had not even a single village nor a few jewels i treated all my relations male or female as members of my family i have made no difference between my maternal and my paternal connections i say not this to appraise myself i simply follow the scrupulous truth as everyone knows and now even my mother's sister desires to leave me i am her nearest relation it would be better and more becoming for her to remain with me maham's face showed whimsical smiles not my lord unwillingly god's earth holds not a more deadly poison to happiness than a discontented woman so let them go my lord has plenty of paternal aunts there was a certain patience in her tone but babar still protesting yielded and set himself solemnly to settle the judicial as well as the executive system of his kingdom it was about this time that he wrote his famous essay on jurisprudence which for many long years was to be a work of reference his enquiries took him out often into the out districts which now that spring was advancing were excessively pleasant abounding in tulips and indeed in all plants of every description he began again to write poetry pretty things still touched by profound if somewhat scholastic melancholy such as this my heart's a rose full flaming its petals opened wide to give her without shaming myself and all beside ah me in vain i lavished my love on her dear heart an envious thorn has ravished her hand with deadly smart her life blood is a falling to dim my petals o'er oh springtime cease thy calling this rose will bloom no more he used to send them to maham who used to reply in her beautiful nastalik hand that was always a joy to babar's simple delight in anything and everything artistic and he wrote also and told her of the thirty five different kinds of tulips he had gathered and of the inscriptions he caused to be cut on springs and rocks and of a certainty when he visited as he did the garden of fidelity at adinapur he must have had much to tell her of a small flowerful grave there where his sad heart was laid it was all very pathetic sweetly pathetic a noble young king doing his duty bravely though glad life was over for him forever even the crystal cup which he carried in his bosom and from which he drank ever the water of the cool mountain springs brought him only modified comfort perhaps because from a sense of duty to himself he would not allow it to bring more and then suddenly the whole wide world changed for him maham my son my son was all that he could say when urgent summons brought him to a smiling mother and a new born infant he is like thee she said a tremor in her calm voice god forbid interrupted the father hastily god send he be like thee the best woman in the world the best the very best never were such rejoicings the paternal aunts who of late months had been let into the secret were almost crazy with delight and wherefore not when a king has lived to be six and twenty without a son when despite three marriages only two children have been borne to him miserable little daughters one dead one but a few months old it is time to be festive over a proper birth and was there ever such a baby so tall so strong so handsome and so altogether satisfactory no wonder his father who ever had a pretty wit called him humayon that might portend the phoenix the bird of good omen besides half a dozen other side meanings each charming in its way but babar leaning over the happy mother said softly he shall be my protection in the future lo maham i have put myself outside myself as they say in the child stories of our youth who was't who put his life safe in a gold box well my life is hid in my son's so there my wife have a care of us both for verily in some ways maham i need looking after like an infant the feast of nativity was a very splendid feast everyone who was big and everyone who was not brought their offerings bags on bags of silver money were piled up until everyone was forced to confess that never before had they seen so much white money in one place and the entertainments there were fireworks and marionettes and conjuring tricks in fact a perfect fair for a whole week in the great four square garden on the hill but the greatest amusement of all was one to which the palace ladies invited a select audience it was organised by the fair princess who had a genius that way and its piece de resistance was a huge roc egg brought in by fairies which cracking in most realistic fashion disclosed the most magnificent phoenix that ever was seen with feathers of every hue and plumes galore it had of course a gold crown on its head which monstrous bird being removed like a tea cosy appeared no less a personage than the heir apparent humayon endless was the laughter the tears the embracings the gratulations but that evening as maham and babar sat hand in hand looking at the sleeping infant its mother cried suddenly 'tis ma'asuma's child also thou must remember husband 'twas for her sake i married thee not for mine own one little bit maham he queried a trifle sadly well if that be so i must be lover instead of husband for a time chapter viii like a wide spreading tree whose roots en thread earth's bosom gaining life from out a grave so stood he stalwart while each weary head sought for the shelter that his courage gave look you what a young man sees in a mirror an old one can see in a burnt brick quoth old kasim crossly to shiram taghai did i not tell the most clement that benevolence such as his is doubtless fit for paradise where man shall have shed his sins but 'tis in this world pure incentive to wickedness to leave prince abdul risak in kabul where seeing he is the late king's only son he hath some right to claim power was foolish not to believe when old servants as you and i shiram tell him intrigue is going on is well nigh criminal yet god knows it all comes from kindness of heart in truth old friend to be king one should be as timur the earth trembler who never spared man woman or child who stood in his way aye assented shirim beg whose beard by this time after long years of faithful service required a purple dye to pass muster and yet to my mind the king is most hard on the moghul soldiery what means life to a moghul without rapine and plunder bread without salt friend bread without salt yet the most clement is so inclement that thou hadst trouble to save the lives of those three last week kasim gloomed aye and i know not now if i were not wrong since those same are the head and front of this present offending of which god save his innocence the king takes no heed having it forsooth that my surmisings art not entitled to credit look you he is so set on making his men wheel in step and to time that he hath forgotten how quick honest rebellion can step when it chooses it was true babar profoundly happy in the birth of his son profoundly absorbed in the new title of emperor which he had in consequence bestowed upon himself was impervious to suspicion and busy expending his exuberant vitality in marshalling and manoeuvering his troops he was out all day in camp thus at once being more ignorant than usual of what was happening in the city and having less time to listen to cautions the latter being in truth the last words suitable to his feelings he could not for the life of him see a single cloud ahead and being absolutely full of good intentions towards his world refused to believe that the world could have any ill intentions towards him but his eyes were opened one night and that rudely he took his evening meal as a rule in the four corner garden on his way back to sleep in the secluded palace it was a charming place the summer house all lit with coloured lamps hung with beautiful draperies and there were ever musicians singers and dancers ready to amuse the king who lingered late at times especially on moonlit nights when the garden showed entrancingly beautiful but it was moonless and fairly early when two friends arrived from the city in hot haste full of the discovery of a plot to seize and assassinate his imperial majesty that very night babar downright refused to believe it even treacherous moghuls he said must have some reason for rebellion and what had he done to them nothing nor to anyone else there might be disaffection in what kingdom was it not to be found but for wide spread disloyalty no it was frankly impossible so he set warning aside nevertheless the party broke up early and started through the darkness for the city the running lanterns ahead threw light only on the forward path and babar was engrossed in solving a question of drill so it was not till he reached the iron gate that he realised he was alone save for the three or four household slaves who ran beside his horse in the darkness every one of his escort had disappeared in a second he saw that something was indeed amiss but in the same second he saw what had to be done maham and her son must be reached and placed in safety that accomplished he would have time to consider but as with a rapid order to the slaves he turned sharp down a more secluded alley a man running full tilt brought up suddenly at the sight of him it was an old friend one mahomed ali thank god i have you sire cried the runner breathlessly go back go back the moghuls are in arms the traitor abdul risak at their head i was in the market place a minute syne and they await the most clement there go back go back babar dug his spurs to his horse's flank nay i go on he said recklessly but mahomed ali hung to the bridle most clement listen they will await thee there till midnight if the king does not come till then what signifies it naught since the most high is given to gardens and is often late so they are there safe now 'tis not yet ten of the chime if therefore the king will be wise turn his horse and ride out to the camp of the veterans beyond the hill garden i and my following if the most noble will send a token to the gracious lady will bring her safe thither before the carrion have wind of anything sire 'tis the better way to go on is certain death for all the moghuls god curse them muttered babar but he was no fool to let his own wild anger needlessly endanger those two precious lives therefore his resolution was taken at once and he fumbled for his signet ring no not that it might be used to ill purpose the crystal bowl was better none would send that but he and so she would be the readier to act upon it aye he said slowly but mark you i turn but to the ditch by the khorasan gate there will i wait take this to the queen and say i pray her come in half an hour mind in half an hour if thou comest not by then his face said the rest and augured ill for failure as gathering the few slaves together lest any might escape and blab he drove them and the torch bearers before him towards the further gate with time for thought he reviewed the position and was satisfied at his action at the worst it meant but a delay of half an hour when time was literally no object since it was his appearance which would start the traitorous scheme he set his lip and his hand clenched on his sword at the very thought again his retreat amongst tried loyalists might save the situation altogether for he would be ready for instant retaliation if needs be if not no harm was done he had simply spent the night amongst his oldest friends the andijan troopers yet as he stood waiting in the darkness of the ditch at the khorasan gate his heart beat in his ears he could hear nothing and time passed it must be nigh on the half hour time to tighten sword belts hark that was a jingle the jingle of a swift borne doolie maham my lord i am here came the answer and babar shook his fist at the darkling city all was quiet nigh at hand but from the distant market place came sounds of rough merriment till to morrow friends he muttered then paced his horse beside the doolie with a whispered word or two of encouragement now that imminent danger was over anger sheer almost reckless anger took the place of anxiety to morrow he whispered to himself again to morrow but that to morrow to which he had appealed so confidently brought bitter disappointment dawn showed him an almost empty camp out of all his soldiers a bare five hundred remained with him the rest with most of the kabul courtiers had slipped off to the city during the night on pretence of looking after their families or saving their property from the moghul plunderers disloyalty was widespread indeed kasim beg of course was at his beloved young master's side and so was shiram taghai and half a score other trusty friends all of the old school they waited the livelong day for the old order to up saddle and away since what could five hundred swords be they ever so nimble do against a city full of soldiers but the order never came it was close on sunset when kasim impatient at the delay suggested that it was time to move i go not replied babar coolly see you old friend never again do i seek shelter like a rat in its hole till i have no other chance i fight in the open old kasim's jaw dropped my liege he exclaimed when fortune was against the chagatai in one place he ever sought her favour in another and found it not most times put in babar with a grim smile i have had too much of fighting and running away i have been at it my life long now let us see how it does to fight and stick to it to the death to the death by all means sire said old kasim with affectionate admiration but 'tis madness all the same if it were so there was distinct method in it babar threw up strange earthworks round his camp and disposed pickets in quaintly modern fashion on the points of vantage in the hills this done he sat down calmly and awaited events much to the discomfiture of those within the city they were not besieged of course but there was an enemy to be reckoned with beyond the gates where an enemy should not be being hopelessly in a minority he ought to have run away lo said one soldier to another doubtfully as hand over his eyes eaves wise he looked out keenly from the watch towers i dare swear that is the king going his rounds how i mind me of his smile as he passed the meanest aye would come the assent but none were mean in his army we all felt brave men at least so 'twas with me i could have swaggered it with rustam and both pair of eyes would hold a vague regret a regret that deepened as day after day skirmishes that were almost battles resulted invariably in a retreat back to the walls of kabul for the night for babar's five hundred were ready to fight all the twenty four hours while the insurgent twelve thousand preferred their beds and the next dawn rose calm over that orderly encampment which it was no use trying to rush because of its cunning defences then babar's cavalry had learnt to charge without an inch of spare room between stirrup and stirrup so that there was no hope of passage or escape between that close linked supple chain of lance and sword altogether it was disconcerting then no one had a moment's peace to show your head beyond the gates was to bring down on you the king in person heading a reckless band of picked swordsmen kasim beg is the best fencer in asia murmured a trooper with a slash on head and arm 'tis small wonder i got this from him and his teaching hath made even the rank and file better at swordsplay than our leaders curse them who sit at cards and drink while we the rest was sullen silence yea said another with a leg bandaged and i got this from a mere back blow of the most clement's see you he hath youth on his side as well as all old kasim's art i saw him as i fell cleave a moghul to the very chin so round the watch fires at night it became the fashion to applaud the prowess of the foe with this result that in the morning more than one place was vacant on the ramparts the holder of it had slipped away in the night to join babar's forces as time went on the latter grew more and more adventurous his military skill his personal strength his courage his invincible spirit brought mingled admiration and dread to his enemies lo he is a true shaitan admitted one of the chief rebels didst hear that when he was at the kharwa fort he amused himself by leaping from battlement to battlement and there is sheer fall of a thousand feet to the river below aye assented another gloomily and shirbash saith he hath seen him do it with a trooper under each arm so ran the stories the one outdoing the other at last one day just before the opposing forces began the clash of arms the armies stood thrilling aghast expectant as a tall young figure rode out alone and in a voice that echoed and re echoed challenged abdul risak the usurper to single combat the challenge was refused then send your best man cried babar and may god show the right there was a pause and then from out the rank and file of the insurgents rode one ali beg and a chorus of approval went up on both sides the opponents were well matched both young both in the very pink of training art ready friend came babar's clear joyous voice and with a dash they were at each other now god send he remembers the trick of wrist said kasim beg under his breath for ali beg hath it to perfection he was my best pupil at samarkand but babar remembered it how he felt could he forget anything with so much for which to fight his eyes blazed not with anger what cared he for the actual enemy he was but the dummy of possible defeat but with calm will he meant to disarm this fellow not to hurt him the horses reeled against each other the sword arms were interlocked for babar at close quarters would not let his antagonist break loose god and his prophets they would be down nor horse nor man could stand that boring pressure that invincible strength wrist against wrist and beneath them struggling legs and tails and fear snorting crests there over a confused heap upon the ground but babar uppermost with two swords in his hand a shout of triumph rose from the five hundred but as the discomfited champion rode back without his sword another rode forward to take his place this was not in the bond still babar checking his laboured breaths to more even rhythm threw away the second sword and sprang to his horse which had risen unhurt but dazed come on friend he shouted i am ready this was a very different sort of adversary a lean ewe necked horse a nimble dapper little swordsman with a blade like a razor who buzzed and wheeled and settled and fled again like a hungry mosquito babar with his half dazed horse was at a disadvantage for a time and the razor like edge caught him on the little finger once but only once the next instant in one furious charge a back hander with the flat of the sword had sent the king's antagonist spinning from his saddle like a tee totum so it was with five champions one after the other babar more and more weary yet more and more triumphant in fierce vitality with every victory unhorsed disarmed or routed every one of them raising a laugh indeed in his own favour when yakub beg last but one escaped by hard riding from the rain of pitiless blows which fell instead on his horse's rump urging it to greater speed only once did sheer merciless anger leap to babar's eyes and that was when nazir the usbek letting go his horse's bridle during a close locked tussle of sword arms drew a dagger with his left hand and would have plunged it in his adversary's heart then with one wild cry of rage babar's hand left his sword clipped his adversary round the middle literally tore him from his horse and flung him head downwards on the ground where he lay unconscious the dagger still in his hand the blood oozing from his nose and ears take the carrion away shouted the young champion breathless and come on if there be any more but there were none ready for personal combat so the battle began it was one of babar's best battles at least in his own opinion and it was the prelude to many another in every one of which babar drove home his lesson of sheer courage finally abdul risak fell into his hands and from that moment there was peace since folk could withstand the king's prowess but they were helpless beneath his magnanimity to be forgiven not grudgingly or of necessity but with open hearted friendliness was disarmament pure and simple for all but moghuls and the horde in this instance disgusted at defeat took abrupt french leave abdul risak also ever a weakling had the gratitude and good taste to die comfortably and conventionally ere long so kabul was left at peace such peace as babar's life had never known before he was in the plenitude of his manhood his strength and even after all these years the imagination warms to the picture of his glad content a trifle flamboyant perhaps he may have been in his consciousness of virtue in his very successes but nothing came amiss to his happy nature the plants he planted throve the flowers he loved blossomed he was as keen over repairing a ruined aqueduct as he had been over taking a fort he knew the name of every bird and beast in his kingdom he learnt their habits when and where they are to be caught he tells of the strange migration of fishes and with keen appreciation of the pathos and poetry hidden in the tale how the flights of summer birds are driven in stormy weather against the chill glaciers of the hindu kush mountains and perish in their thousands then he interests himself in his people knows the race of which they come the language they speak and the superstitions in which they believe and he is stern over some of these there is a celebrated rocking tomb much frequented by pilgrims of which he discovers the trick and visits his hot wrath on the manipulators daring them to repeat the imposture for deceit is the one thing he cannot forgive so during the next three years not only peace but happiness reigned at kabul humayon grew and flourished a daughter and then a son were born and maham remained the anchor to which babar's versatile volatile affectionate nature was moored a woman of education of natural talent she could enter into that side of his life from which the majority of his companions were shut out and between the two there was always the inward and spiritual tie of which the crystal bowl was the outward and visible manifestation there was another soul however which touched babar in a lower plane sultan said khan his cousin the son of the dead and dispossessed younger khan of outer moghulistan sought refuge at kabul and there sprung up between the two young men perfect love accord and trust the two and a half years i spent as exile in kabul writes this same said khan were the freest from care or sorrow of any i have experienced or am likely to experience i lived on friendly terms with all welcomed by all i never had a headache except from the effects of wine and never felt sad except on the account of the ringlets of some beloved one but babar himself still abstained from wine or at any rate from intoxication love had stepped in at herat to keep him from yielding to the first of said khan's temptations and the other form of amusement was never to his liking then there was another refugee who forty years afterwards sets down his impressions of kabul and its king this was haidar yet another cousin ten year old orphan whose father had been that doghlat commoner rebel of two years back what matter his mother had been a maternal aunt that was enough for babar besides the poor child had no other protector his welcome must have made a vivid impression on haidar for as one reads the scene rises before one the timid child wrapped in the one old shawl which the forlorn party of refugees possessed attempting to kneel at the feet of that glorious figure with life or death in its hands the merry laugh the swift stoop to catch up the child and hold it close with comforting words then afterwards the elegant mansion its rooms all spread with many coloured carpets and soft cushions with everything in the way of furniture food clothing servants and slaves so fully prepared as to leave nothing to be desired in the whole building and afterwards again the promises of kindness the threats of severity by which the little lad's love of study was stimulated and encouraged the lavish praise bestowed on any little virtue or new accomplishment the quick blame for anything mean or lazy these were such as most men would scarce do for their own sons it was a hard day for me when i lost my father writes haidar but i scarce felt the loss owing to the kindness of the emperor have a care youngster he would say when study time over young haidar came as usual to play with baby humayon he is smaller than thou art never be rough with weaklings 'tis not their fault god made them so and he is thy cousin likewise but humayon holds his own already said maham proudly there is no boy of his age in the court can come nigh him babar laughed and put his arm round her yea yea little mother he is true phoenix and we are the happiest folk in kabul which means much then his face fell he walked to the arched window way and looked out over the garden what is't my lord said maham at his elbow in an instant he looked at her affectionately nothing my moon 'tis only this the dear mother lies yonder in the mercy of god i would not bring her back if i could and little ma'asuma he paused i would not bring her back either wife if i could she was too tender for this world aye even for me so she sleeps peacefully god rest her but dearest one his voice broke he turned away and maham had nothing to say that thought was the fly in the pot of ointment it was the one bitter drop in the crystal bowl of life chapter ix bring bring the musky scented wine a draught of wine the memory cheers and wakens thoughts of other years so the months even the years sped on bringing calm sometimes babar felt a trifle regretful over the old storms the glints of sunshine between had seemed mayhap the brighter for them he was now only nearing his twenty ninth year and yet he felt almost as if life had ended for him he looked round on his growing family on his gardens his aqueducts his highly disciplined small army all were well in their way but for all that his restless eyes followed the doings of shah ismael of persia who young as he was a mere boy in fact had dared to send the arch enemy the usbek raider shaibani khan a spinning wheel and a spindle and bid him if he would not fight go sit in a corner and busy himself with the little present like the woman he was it had been splendid that interchange of discourtesies first of all the shah's demand for a treaty followed by shaibani's contemptuous advice to make no claim for kingship through his mother who had withdrawn herself from the circle of distinction by her marriage since he shaibani made one through his father a sultan and son of a sultan this was accompanied by a beggar's bowl and staff with the script in case you wish as is fitting to follow the profession of your father i remind you of it and the verse 'clasp the bride of sovereignty close to you if you will but don't you dare to kiss her until the swords are still' shah ismael however had been no whit behind back had come the spindle and distaff with the rhyming insult who boasts of his dead fathers only owns himself a dog that loveth ancient bones after that naturally there was but one end extermination of one or the other which would it be shah ismael with his thousands of disciplined and heretical kizzilbashes or shaibani khan with his hordes of wild mongols god's truth said babar to old kasim who had been ailing this while back i scarce know which to choose i hate the red caps almost as much as the moghuls old kasim's eyes were growing a little dim for the things of this world perhaps he saw those of the next more clearly in consequence there be good men on both sides most clement a flat face and split eyes count no more than a red cap when we have lost clothes and bodies at the day of judgment the shrewd commonsense of the remark clung to babar's receptive brain long after the speaker had gone to his account yea i am restless admitted babar to calm maham i cannot help it my moon i am not made as thou art there was a book at samarkand when i was a lad that treated of the great waters and it said they rose and fell as the moon waxed and waned so 'tis thou who art responsible sweetheart though god knows thou art ever full moon to me and he sat down instantly to write a rubai on that fancy he had not half finished it however when news came that drove everything else out of his head shah ismael had defeated shaibani in full force at meru the usbek raider was dead smothered in a band of escaping mongols i must go muttered the young king hoarsely i must go samarkand is mine by right so with hardly more than an hour's preparation he was off though it was the dead of winter across the snows to join forces with his cousin of badakhshan the fighting fever was on him once more he could not he did not even try to resist it and maham let him go she was too wise to attempt to chain her wild hawk when spring comes we will meet in samarkand she said quietly he took haidar the boy with him though because the lad wept and refused to be left behind and right proud was the lad when at the very first fight it was the opportune arrival of a party of his father's old retainers who had come out to join their young master that turned the tide of victory towards babar let the name of haidar mirza be inscribed on the first trophy said the emperor smiling and the boy's blood went in a surge of sheer delight to his face but despite the fact that he was able to reach the river and settle himself in some measure of security at kundez babar felt himself not sufficiently strong to attempt samarkand without help and there was none to whom he could apply save shah ismael who had already sent him a letter containing guarded offers of friendship it rather went against babar's orthodox grain to ask a favour from a persecuting shiah heretic but old kasim's words came back to him yes there was good on all sides and pace the priests a man might be an honest fellow in spite of his saying ameen in schismatic fashion for babar like many of his like had no taste for dogmatic differences and preferred to differentiate by visible and audible signs so mirza khan his cousin was despatched to irak in order to make the best terms possible and babar meanwhile sent for his family from kabul the spring had passed to summer ere they arrived at kundez and babar now reinforced by some of the surrounding tribes crossed the amu and marched on to await events at the strong fortress of hissar it was close on eighteen years since he had been encamped with his old uncle sultan hussain upon the opposite bank close on eighteen years since one darkling dawn he a lad of thirteen dear old kasim beg and half a hundred or so of rough honest andijan troopers had ridden through khosrau shah's picket and he babar had lost the crystal bowl which gharib had given him and now he looked across to the frightened girl the mother of his children in a way the mother of himself and thought what a marvellous thing life was even as he saw it limited by birth and death isolated by those five personal bodily senses which none could say he shared exactly with his fellow how strange it was to watch the compensating balance at work on all things keeping all things as it were to true perfect level he looked back over his life and saw that balance everywhere save in one thing the tragedy of dearest one remained as ever poignant unappeased thou art sad husband what is't asked maham fondly she was ever quick to see his moods nothing wife he answered gaily save that today or to morrow at least comes the answer from shah ismael what will the red cap heretic reply god knows so with a laugh he left her for the cares of state but he had scarcely gone before he was back again white trembling a gold dust sprinkled letter in his hand it hath come he said brokenly it hath come and oh maham dearest one dearest one he fell at her feet buried his face in her lap and sobbed like a child she must be dead thought maham and to her lips came the usual blankly tame commonplaces of consolation nay 'tis not that he said recovering his calm she is alive and well and shah ismael who hath found her is sending her back to me with all honour he sprang to his feet suddenly and raised his right arm high oh god may my arm wither if ever it strike a blow against this just man may my tongue dry up if ever it utter word of blame i babar am his servant for ever there is nothing i will not do for him does he not desire aught of thee in return asked maham when babar had fairly outwearied himself in joy in confessions of past regret in promises of future content aye yea he asks much but not more than he has a right to ask not more than i will give cheerfully and he is sending men also maham i shall have an army of sixty thousand with that samarkand is assured and of a truth no man can deem it a disgrace to own justice as his sovereign lord i hold it an honour and he upheld this view of shah ismael's proposal that if the aid of the persian kizzilbashes were given to conquer samarkand babar should acknowledge the persian satrapy as over lord against all the criticism of his nobles not that there was much for it was indubitable that without such help samarkand would remain unwon and babar had many arguments in favour of this nominal vassalage to be part of a great empire was always an advantage besides the kings of samarkand had always in the past acknowledged a suzerain lordship it had given stability to the dynasty and it was of late years only since this dependence had been removed that samarkand had been bandied from one ruler to another when a man is set on a thing arguments for it grow in the very hedgerows and babar with the tempting bait of his sister's safe return before his eyes was too full of real gratitude to hesitate an instant but it was not for a month or more that he was to enter samarkand victorious it was a perfect autumn day when after dismissing the persian contingent babar made his triumphant entry all along the route high and low nobles and poor men grandees and artisans princes and peasants alike testified their joy at the advent of one who had already twice before come to them as king and who had endeared himself to them by his kindness and generosity the streets were all draped with cloth and gold brocades pictures drawings wreaths were hung up on every side such pomp and splendour no one has ever seen or heard of before or since he was received at the gate by the great men of the city who assured him that the inhabitants had for years been longing that the shadow of his protection might be cast upon them babar who was dressed rather to their regret in the uniform of a kissilbash general which smacked of heresy almost of unbelief responded heartily and all eyes followed his splendid figure as he rode through the streets saluting the crowd right and left he was in the highest spirits for he knew that in the very palace where she had been left ten long years before his dearest sister was awaiting him dearest one it seemed almost too good to be true god save the man who had brought this happiness into his life impatient headstrong in all his emotions he would gladly have cut short his reception and gone straight to her but the people would not be denied a sight of their hero if the angels were crying aloud enter in peace and the populace was shouting god save the emperor the least he could do was to listen to them patiently so it was nigh dusk before he found himself trembling with sheer joy in the garden palace and saw before him a tall slender figure in white dearest one dearest one he cried and was kissing her feet her hands her thin worn face brotherling brotherling that was all they said and then they held back to see each other she saw strength and health and manhood such as she had scarce dreamed of even for him a man of past thirty in the very prime of all things and he saw a woman of nigh forty with streaks of silver in her dark hair upright tall but with a weariness even in her joy i am sorry dearest one he said humbly as he had said to her many a time when as a child he had grieved her and i am glad she replied softly that night the city seemed on fire flares blazed from every house the flickering lines of countless lights seemed to interlock one street with another vast crowds surged through them and far and wide rose babar's praise but at the door of a mosque an old white bearded mullah sat and spat calmly he wore the accursed red cap of the schismatic wherefore and the folk who heard him looked at each other and echoed wherefore that was the question asked by one to day it was asked by half a dozen the next by a hundred the week after when babar faithful as ever to his promises had the kutba the royal proclamation read in the name of shah ismael as over lord a thousand asked it when the first gold coin was struck bearing the hated shiah legends the emperor the man they had welcomed was a heretic he and his army wore the red cap samarkand head centre of orthodoxy became alarmed began to whisper i am no heretic but a keeper of promises said babar grimly and went on his way he had become a trifle arrogant and inclined to resent any interference the samarkand folk were rude ignorant bigoted he would not even try to pacify them so the winter passed and spring set in the plentiful drops of her rain having clothed the earth in green raiment and with the warmer weather the usbeks once more appeared like locusts on the edge of the turkhestan desert and the fight for samarkand began all over again and this time babar with not a wish ungratified babar in the plenitude of his pride and strength was forced to flight for religious bigotry is the hardest of all foes to fight a horde of kizzilbashes it is true was sent by his over lord to help him but they only made matters worse first by their confirmation of heresy next by their brutality in murdering high and low the sucklings and the decrepit sick at heart babar found himself once more a wanderer once more a prey to the treachery of moghul troops from which he escaped one night with bare life and in his night clothes his one consolation was that maham dearest one and his children were safe with relatives in khost no he had another consolation for the man who had set aside wine as an enhancement of pleasure now took to it as a lessener of care the cup of life for him was filled again and again with the wine of death and he laughed as he quaffed at its bubbles on the rim vaguely too came to him a sort of disgust at dogmatic creeds he would sit and sing sufic odes with fervour and praise perhaps with a man of his temperament it was only to be expected the wine the lamp which night and day lights us along our weary way saki thou knowest i worship wine let that delicious cup be mine wine pure and limpid as my tears book iii fruit time to chapter i the long years slide the door of life stands wide ghosts creep inside with their dead fingers hide present from past dear god be kind grant that i keep enshrined within my mind the love of human kind until the last babar sat overlooking a kabul valley a tall straight still athletic man of two and forty twelve years had passed since broken crestfallen at his failure to keep the loyalty of samarkand he had shaken the dust of his kingly hopes in transoiana from him for ever returned to kabul and set himself another emprise the conquest of india thus far he had not succeeded three or four attempts had been made in themselves satisfactory in result futile on his last expedition he had got as far as lahore but he had had to return for reinforcements to kabul leaving a doubtfully loyal governor in the punjab so he was still no more no less than king of kabul for those twelve years had brought a marked diminution in the vivid initiative of his younger years he was up at dawn as usual it is true the wine he had drunk overnight had never been allowed to cloud his days yet those twelve comparatively empty years remained and remain in mute testimony to the toxic power of the body over the mind he felt this himself vaguely for he was always sensitive to the touch of truth he had begun wine bibbing of deliberate intent he had told himself that he would only indulge for ten years until he was forty indeed wanting one year of that age he had drunk more copiously as a sort of send off to virtue but virtue had not come as he sat overlooking the valley where his twelve thousand troops were encamped the instinct to enhance his keen enjoyment of the beauty he saw found words in an order for a beaker of good shiraz wine and an intimation that the pavilion of spirits was to be prepared his friends and boon companions warned the royal cup bearer brought a golden goblet filled to the brim and he quaffed it down like mother's milk so the cup still in his hands that hung between his knees sat drinking in that intoxicating beauty of the splendid world for it was still splendid to him though for twelve years he had seldom gone to bed strictly sober his face however showed no sign of his life save in a certain premature haggardness of cheek the eyes were clear as ever and had gained in their falcon like keenness by reason of his slight stoop not from the shoulders but the neck it was sunset the crests of the surrounding hills showed softly violet against the clear primrose sky the girdle of the distant snow peaks were losing the last faint flush of day the cold icy pallor that was creeping over them matched the low level mist streaks which were beginning to stretch like a winding sheet over the darker purple shadow of the valley a shadow that looked like the sky at night all set as it was with constellations of camp fires slave another goblet of wine but even as he gave the order a twinge of conscience made him remember the arabic verse the breach of a promise avenges itself on the promise breaker but it was only a twinge after all most of the wine parties had been guileless and innocent he could scarcely recollect being miserably drunk more than once or twice and then he had always suffered horribly in the stomach for his sin and but one or two parties had been disagreeable as when one gedai being troublesome drunk had tried to recline on the royal pillow and had had to be turned out neck and crop by royalty itself such royalty having invariably a stronger head than the other carousers but even that had been rather funny though not so funny as on the day when drinking in the open they had been apprised of the enemy's approach and dost mahomed could not despite skins full of water be got on his horse so amni being solemn drunk had suggested that rather than leave him in that condition to fall into the enemy's hands it would be better at once to cut off his head and take it away to some place of safety the very remembrance brought laughter babar tossed off the second beaker of wine and stood up quoting nizami's verses oh bring the musky scented wine the key of mirth which must be mine the key which opens wide the door of rapture rich and varied store and o'er the temper casts a spell of kindness indescribable in those last words lay the secret of babar's superiority to the debasing influence of his life his kindness was simply indescribable and he stuck to his code of honour and morality with a certain fastidiousness men must carry their liquor like gentlemen no man must be pressed to drink wine no private house be unwillingly defiled with its use even if the emperor were the guest above all things wine must not interfere with duty he would follow the advice he had had cut on the side of the little red granite cistern among the judas trees in the four corner garden of kabul the little cistern that was so often filled with redder wine he would sing with the singers and lutists sweet are the smiling springs sweet what each new year brings sweet is a cup of wine sweeter is love divine oh babar seize them all they pass beyond recall he would seize all but he would remain a kindly gentleman and so if he were to send his letter to maham his dear wife his ever sweet guardian and friend that night he must finish it ere going up the pavilion of spirits they were constant correspondents those two and although they had only parted from each other at the garden of fidelity a day or two before he had plenty to say to her both as his moon the woman who was the chief influence of his life and also as the head of his family for maham's other children having died in infancy leaving none but humayon in direct descent babar by her advice had married again the youngest of three sons thus born he had made over at birth to maham who was bringing the little hindal up as her own at the tribunal of his own heart this was ever an action to be slurred over it had doubtless brought great grief to the real mother a good woman who had done her duty by him in giving him children still it had all been settled by usual custom the auguries had been consulted before the birth of the child and maham had taken the chance of its being a girl yet in good sooth that whole year with its episode of the taking of bajour touched a lower level than any other in babar's thoughts he had been six and thirty it was the first time he had used match lock men or artillery and somehow possibly because he had begun to take drugs as well as wine he had reverted to inherited instinct he had been minded to emulate his ancestor timur he had done so three thousand infidels put to the sword babar escaped from the remembrance and palliated the action by telling himself that the afghans were an impossible race strangely foolish and senseless possessed of little reflection and less foresight what trouble had not the yusufzais given him until he had attached them by marrying the daughter of their chief that anyhow had not been sordid babar recalled the whole incident with pleasure how he had gone disguised as a wandering mendicant to the chief's fort during a feast in order to spy out the land how the lady mubarika the blessed damozel had noticed the handsome beggar and sent him food from her own dish how he had thanked her found out she was not betrothed and had wrapped the food she had given him in his handkerchief hidden it in a hole in the wall and gone back to claim her as his bride i have no daughter came back the proud answer ask her concerning a wandering mendicant babar replied and if more proof be wanted find the food the gracious lady gave wrapped in my handkerchief and hidden in a breach of thy fort so let it be peace and peace it had been for the lady mubarika could he ever forget her grace and dignity as she stood before him for the first time as a bride when she had let slip her veil and laid her pale hands on her pale bosom my lord remember that the whole tribe of yusufzais sits enshrined in my heart it had been fine no even though maham had held his soul that and his passionate appreciation of it had been a gleam in a dark year and no one had ever had an unkind word for the lady mubarika childless reserved quiet she was yet a power in that household he had left behind him in kabul so he wrote to his moon thou hast good friends with thee that dearest one and the blessed damozel are as sisters to thee is ever a consolation to me also that our farewell was in that same garden where my first love died and rose again in thee in truth it was in its greatest glory the flowers yellow purple red springing everywhere all mingled together as if they had been flung and scattered abroad from the full basket of god the pomegranate trees so beautifully yellow the fruit hanging red upon the boughs the grass plots covered with the second crop of white and pink clover the orange bushes so green and cheerful laden with their golden globes in good sooth of all the gardens i have planted god knows how many this one is the crown none could view it without acknowledging its charm humayon hath come to join me as arranged though somewhat tardily for which i spoke to him with considerable severity nathless with difficulty my moon since he is thy son and the beauty and vigour and valiance of his seventeen years would disarm an ogre bid ma'asuma be a good girl till my return and tell her i will keep her husband's life safe as my own and greet little rosebody from her father lo is there aught in the wide world more captivating to a man's heart than his female children except perchance my moon his wife ten minutes after despatching this sealed and signed by special runner babar was the centre of the merriment in the palace of spirits in good sooth at that early hour it was innocent and guileless enough a party of men chosen chiefly because they were of like temperament to himself all of them distinguished by general bonhommie and not a few by wit and accomplishments all met together to enjoy themselves sometimes with the aid of aromatic confections sometimes with wine or spirits to night it was the latter so the fun waxed fast the screens of the tent had been thrown back they could see the valley beneath them studded with fire stars look most clement cried tardi beg yonder i swear is the heft aurang babar bent his keen eyes hastily on the flickering lights aye the heft aurang the seven thrones the thought took him back with a rush to baisanghar dead these twenty years from him memory fled to gharib and the crystal bowl of life he carried the copy maham had given him in his bosom always though he seldom used it it was too small for wine but some day aye some day soon he would keep his promise to himself and forswear drinking yea remarked ali jan not to be outdone and yonder to the right are the brothers and look you to the left the warrior stuttered abul majid his sword is somewhat crooked 'tis thine eyes are askew laughed shaikh zin thou never hadst a head worth a spoonful of decent shiraz so in laughter and quips and cranks the merriment waxed they could most of them string verses after a fashion and some of them began reciting their latest efforts the climax being reached when ali jan gravely gave a well known couplet as his own when lovers think their thoughts are not their own but each to each love's communings have flown hold thy peace pirate came babar's full joyous voice that is mahomed shaikh thou couldst not write such an one for thy life ali jan who was already far gone waggled his head lo he said with a hiccup i could do doz shens and i and i chorused others militantly for the spirits were rising fast so be it cried babar as ever the most sober of the party let us all try and parody it extempore now then ali jan 'tis thy turn first rise and out with it instanter ali jan rose gravely and stood swaying when he began solemnly when then he subsided gravely and solemnly the roar of consequent laughter was dominated by babar's joyous shout i have it i have it when ali drinks his legs are not his own each seeks support and neither stands alone shabash wah wah ha ha ha the uproarious mirth echoed out into the still night the emperor is merry quoth the sentries in the valley with a smile aye but he looks ill for all that said an orthodox old trooper i saw him shiver yestere'en when he swam the stream in his clothes and the water was lukewarm time was not so long ago when he would have swum an ice torrent and felt no cold now he hath taken a chill whether the man was right in the cause thereof he was correct in the illness the next morning found babar down with so severe a defluxion fever and cough that he spat blood the court physician dosed him with narcissus flowers steeped in wine and ali jan tardi beg and all the other boon companions sat with the monarch to cheer him up by laying the blame of the illness on the cold or the heat or what not but babar himself knew whence the indisposition proceeded and what conduct had led to this chastisement what business had he to laugh at folk in verse for his own amusement still less no matter how mean or contemptible the doggerel to take pride in it and write it down it was regrettable that a tongue which could repeat the sublimest productions should lend itself to unworthy rhymes it was melancholy that a heart capable of nobler conceptions should stoop to meaner and despicable verses from henceforth he would abstain religiously from vituperative poetry this excellent resolution or something else proved curative and babar was soon on the mend and was able to write the following oh what can i do with you flagrant tongue on your account i deserve to be hung how long will you utter bad parodies one half indecent the other half lies if you wish to escape being damned up rein ride off nor venture near verse again to which he appended a quatrain in his best arabic oh god creator of the world my soul i broke upon the wheel of evil sore cleanse me from sin my god and make me whole else cursed shall i be for evermore he felt better after thus committing his penitence to writing so with renewed vitality and gathering his force together as he went along he crossed the sind river to find the moment ripe for his emprise india was in a turmoil divided by two rival claimants to its throne the whole country was over run by armies more or less independent the whilom governor of lahore at the head of one numbering over forty thousand men chiefly afghans it broke up however by sheer invertebrate disintegration ere babar could reach it and he passed on unopposed by the lower kashmir hills by bhimber and jhelum till he arrived at sialkot keeping all the while close to the skirts of the mountains where retreat and safety might be found if needs be but now before him lay the wide plain of the punjab here for the first time in his life babar faced a real galloping country where horsemen could indeed charge to some purpose but with flat plain behind him it was necessary that the plain should be friendly to ensure this needed delay he had to negotiate to threaten to pacify half a dozen petty chiefs had to be brought to their senses and those senses were so dull so rude so provokingly stupid what for instance could be said to a man who actually claimed to be seated in the presence when nobles and princes of the blood royal stood by in all humility babar's language on such occasions was always frank truthful utterly unanswerable the most clement hath settled his hash remarked the prime minister with a smile when the old ex governor of lahore having been caught was brought before the emperor with the two swords which the rebel had boastfully hung round his neck as sign of unyielding opposition still dangling under his chin this by babar's own order to emphasise the trouncing which sent the old sinner away unharmed but sadder and wiser yea replied the emperor quite gravely yet i told him naught but what he deserved most truly for i had done much for him and as thou sawest he had no answer he did indeed stammer out a few words but not at all to the purpose for what reply could he make to such confounding truths of a surety none assented his hearers still with a smile folk had to smile often over babar's frank outspoken clarity so by slow degrees and not without many a drinking party sirhind was reached and here the emperor's soul was refreshed by the sight of a rivulet of running water it was almost unbelievable and no doubt he drank a libation of something stronger in its honour then but a few miles farther on he came upon an extremely beautiful and delightful place with a charming climate where perforce he had to halt a few days if only to explore the neighbouring country which promised well doubtless he was close to the southern spurs of the sewalik hills and here in one of the side valleys he found himself on the bank of one of those oleander set streams where the butterflies get mixed up with strange sweet scented flowering shrubs one of those streams which in the dry season are beds of boulders with a half hidden trickle of water amongst the stones but which in the rains swell extremely and rush down in a perfect torrent to join that strange gaggar river which rises forty feet in a night and sweeps away resistless to a still stranger fate to total disappearance in the sands of the rajputana desert a fate which must have impressed the emperor with his keen appreciation of the poetry in life and here in early march these same flowering shrubs must have been budding the butterflies must have been fluttering over the new russet shoots of the maiden hair fern and in sheltered spots babar's favourite judas trees must have been in bloom the temptation was too great he called another halt and set to work not to drink but to make a garden while not to lose time he sent out scouts and spies to bring him intelligence as to his enemy's movements doubtless as he laid out his favourite four cornered garden he drank success to it and dreamt happy if confused dreams of stone watercourses and bright fountains after the kabul pattern for he wrote and told maham all about it and he told her also that her son humayon was bearing himself like a hero and had gone out with a light force to reconnoitre and disperse some wandering bands of marauders but that he would be back again of course for his eighteenth birthday on the th when there was to be a great festival on the occasion of the first beard cutting such a festival as would have delighted the heart of the old grandmother isan daulet on whom be peace and his thoughts waxed soft and young again with the remembrance of that shaving of his own on his eighteenth birthday on the upland meadow close to the roof of the world when there was but one real tent in his encampment and his following had consisted of more than one and less than two hundred tatterdemalions times had changed and yet he was defying fate to the full as much as in those far away days for against his twelve thousand troops all told the whole strength of northern india was gathering itself upon the plain above delhi that fateful plain where hundreds of thousands of men had already given up their lives in battles which for their time had decided the fate of hindustan what would that fate be now he was not without thought but he was without fear he meant to win meanwhile till the fateful moment of fight arrived there was the garden when that was fairly started news came that the enemy had begun to advance slowly it was time therefore to be on the move but the broad calm stream of the jumna river was not to be allowed to slip past without being pressed into the service of pleasure so while the army held down the bank for two marches babar sailed down in an awning covered boat and explored many a side stream where the bottle nosed alligators lay on the sand banks like logs and great flocks of flamingoes white in the distance rose startled into flaming red clouds and in the still evenings so cool so pleasant babar who had a genius for the comfortable ordered aromatic confections to be served and the party floated down stream in dreamy content trailing their hands in the refreshing water and singing low toned songs in a whisper until suddenly the boat touched a sandbank and shah hussan went over on his back laid hold of kali gokultash who was cutting a melon and both fell into the water the latter leaving the knife he held stuck point down in the deck and what is more he refused to regain the boat but continued swimming in his best gown and dress of honour till the shore was reached but there a fine figure of a young man handsomer in face than his father ever was taller in height yet without the latter's inexpressible charm stood humayon to join in the laughter for a few moments but then to give news which ended fooling the advance party of sultan ibrahim's army was within touch babar was ready on the instant he was out of the boat before it was moored giving orders short sharp stern the time for play was over chapter ii it is the time of roses green are the young wheat fields the onward march of the foes is hid by a dark night's shield over the sand hills sun dried thirsting for blood of men an hundred thousand on one side on the other only ten what will the dawn be showing fate of the parched mouth will the cup of death be flowing with blood of north or south all that night the emperor sat in his tent working out his plan of attack even his brief connection with the red cap persian army had given him an insight into a new science of war for though it was brutal in the details of its methods these methods had been learnt from the turks who in their turn had learnt them still farther west and babar was a born general he had that firm touch on the pulse of his army by which he knew its moments of weakness and when to seize and utilise the fierce throb of fight fever that comes at times to the blood of the most peaceful so the emperor made his plan first and then being wise bowed to the wisdom of his ancestors by calling together a general council of all who had experience and knowledge but not be it noted until every part of his scheme was in order and ready not until right and left wings and centre had been apportioned not until the gun carriages seven hundred in all had been laagered together with twisted hide ropes as with chains not till the tale of hurdle breast works and sandbags was complete then he laid his plan before the council and naturally it was approved mindful also of the prejudices of the rank and file he performed the old turkhi ceremony of the vim or full dress review at which as general he had to estimate the total number of men at his command the most revered father was out by a good thousand or two to day said humayon who arrayed in gorgeous trappings looked a hero after a woman's heart he was wont to be more accurate babar smiled gaily a thousand or two to the good is better than to the bad when men's hearts fail them he replied and some see you are in great terror and alarm for sure trepidation and fear are always unbecoming since what god almighty has decreed men cannot alter still i blame them not greatly of a truth they have reason they have come a four months' journey from their own country they have to engage an enemy over an hundred thousand strong and worse than all a strange enemy understanding not even their language poor souls he was full of commiseration for all that he abated not one jot or tittle of his plan and his very firmness brought a measure of confidence even to the timid the little town of paniput reached babar took up his position there the city and suburbs protecting his right the left he entrenched leaving the centre free for his laager of guns and breastworks behind which stood the matchlock men but at every bow shot distance apart a space was left through which flanking parties of cavalry might issue forth to charge when all was ready the army began to feel more secure and more than one general ventured the opinion that with a position so well fortified the enemy would think twice about attacking but babar shook his head consider not he said of our present enemy as of our past ones judge not of ibrahim sultan as of our princes and khans in the north who knew what they were about who could discriminate when to advance when to retreat this young man has shown himself of no experience already i find him negligent in movement he marches without order he halts without plan and will doubtless engage in battle without forethought therefore we must be prepared it was an anxious time that wait of six days for assault but despite the skirmishing attempts made by small parties of cavalry to induce the enemy to engage nothing happened a night attack carried out against babar's own judgment fared no better but mercifully it ended without the loss of a single man though one bold soldier a boon companion of the emperor's was wounded that day at sunset there was a false alarm and the army was drawn up ready for action only however to be drawn off again and led back to camp again about midnight the call to arms uprose and for half an hour all was confusion and dismay many of the troops being new to the work and unaccustomed to such alarms lo it will steady their nerves said babar lightly with another gay smile and by god who made me even mine are somewhat agee this night go saddle me rakush slave i am for a ride round for an hour or so a minute or two later he was on his favourite charger pacing his way silently over what would be the battle field and as he passed on his horse's feet sinking in the thirsty sand or echoing on the hard lime stone soil his mind was busy over the chances of the future he meant to win but many a man whose bones lay buried beneath that useless waste useless for all save battle had had as high a hope as his as steady a determination how many thousands nay hundreds of thousands of hopes had not that vast sterile plain of paniput ended for ever the common folk told him that on dark nights you could hear rising from the ground the voices of the dead men below the clash of arms the noise of fight mayhap it was so mayhap all the sounds of life went on and on and on tears love peace war life death all were the same in the end all were part of that great whole which somehow always managed to escape before you could grip at it he reined up his horse to listen but only the familiar sound of the night came to his ear the distant and persistent baying of a dog the booming whirr of some night insect as it flew unseen the faint rustle of a dawn wind over the sand it was time he were going back to work back to face what the day might bring forth it brought what he awaited when the light was such that one object could just be distinguished from another patrols galloped in the enemy were advancing in order of battle there was no confusion this time use doth breed a habit in a man was wisdom known to the emperor so swiftly each fell to his proper place the flanking parties on the left ready with instructions so soon as the enemy was in touch to make a circuit and take them in the rear babar himself took his post on a slight eminence he knew that with such overwhelming odds against him all depended on the handling of his men so there must be no fine fighting for him that was not his work his keen eyes watched the oncoming line of the enemy it was bent to the right and the order came immediately reinforcements from the reserve in support had he been a modern day staff college man the martial phrase could not have come more correctly and he noticed another thing the enemy had not expected to find such strong defences they were coming along almost at the double yet the front rank hesitated almost halted this was the psychical moment intensify this hesitation and the ranks behind would be thrown into confusion right and left divisions charge and bid the flanking parties use all possible speed came the swift order in a few minutes both left and right were engaged and the wheeling horsemen could be seen coming round to the rear those overwhelming numbers told however the left too impetuous wavered visibly but babar's keen eye saw it to send support from the main body needed but a few words so attacked on right and left with the flanking parties harassing the rear the huge army was driven in on itself and huddled together fell into confusion unable either to advance or retreat then came the final order to the centre engage and the fight was virtually won after all the artillery had little to do beyond a few discharges in front of the line to good purpose the sun had mounted spear high when the onset of battle began but by midday the enemy was completely broken and routed and babar's troops victorious and exulting the arduous undertaking had been made easy and a mighty army in the space of half a day laid in the dust it seemed incredible babar remaining behind while he despatched parties of pursuit rode somewhat sad eyed over the battle field here had been a fine stand five or six thousand dead bodies piled one upon another well those had been brave men dying for some cause some point of honour it was not until late in the afternoon that the cause the point of honour was made apparent ibrahim their king's dead body was found in their midst one tahir found it cut off the head and brought it into the headquarters' tent slave why didst do that he was at least king to those poor souls take it back said babar sternly then went on with his work humayon kwajah kilan and several more of the best officers with a light body of troops were despatched in utmost haste to occupy agra ere it had time to hear of the victory and a smaller force to march without halt to delhi and seize the fort and treasuries for babar with his small army could not afford to give time for rally this done he and his staff rode through the enemy's deserted lines and visited the dead leaders' pavilions and accommodations they had best bring the dead fool's body here said babar briefly and bid the men not touch the tent stay set a watch on it till his friends come as they will likely at nightfall it was a kindly thought but in a way it was unwise for the afghans of delhi seeing their cause lost kept alive their hatred of the northern invader by raising miserable ibrahim to martyr rank and making pilgrimages to his grave but babar was never clear sighted in this world's ways he did most things by impulse and it was heaven's grace that such impulses generally led him aright three days after this zahir ud din mahomed babar was proclaimed emperor of india in the mosque of delhi but the conqueror himself did not go into the city he preferred to remain with his army encamped by the kutb minar among the relics of dead kings feasting his eyes on the strange new beauty of carven stone and straight architrave he would not have thought it possible to get so majestic a building without the use of the arch but the kutb minar babar found himself looking at it at all hours of the day and night it fascinated him that marvellous shaft of stone so deftly modulated in tint from its purplish red base through pale rose pink to vivid orange as spurning the world it shoots into the blue sky filled him with glad amaze how and why and in what quality did it surpass all other buildings he had ever seen was it because as folks said its proportions were correct or was there in it the secret of all true art babar knew his history well he knew it was but three hundred years since by order of eibuk the slave that column had been built by the hindu architects who had to work with the material of their own desecrated and destroyed temples the temptation to revenge to follow the destruction of religion by that of art must have been great but these men had been true artists to them self was nothing they chiselled they cut they planned perfection before their eyes and they had touched close upon it so their work remained almost as it had left their hands undimmed by time a record of selflessness babar could feel this vaguely could spend half the night circumambulating the tombs of the saints could climb the dizzy stair at dusk to see canopus flicker into light on the purpling heavens and bring memories of the past with it he could even come down again full of kindly thoughts for the womenkind at kabul and write long letters to his paternal aunts telling them how splendid their grand nephew looked at the head of his troops and how the army had taken to calling him babar kalendar king because he gave away all his own chances of plunder footnote kalendars are men vowed to poverty nathless he wrote i am keeping certain presents for my aunts and cousins which shall be sent when opportunity offers but almost before the ink of such effusions was dry he would be out on an awning covered boat slipping down the sliding moonlit river trailing his hand in the water while his brain grew dizzy with wine or drugs for danger was past at present he could afford to get drunk and he did the journey down to agra where humayon had done his part well and had in addition quelled a rajput rebel to the west was more like a pleasure party than a march of war babar enjoyed it immensely and his eyes were everywhere noting each strange bird and beast and flower he even began to write down his impressions concerning his new kingdom perhaps because by now the end of april the hot weather had begun to set in his verdict was distinctly unfavourable the whole country and especially the towns were in his opinion extremely ugly the latter had a uniform ugliness which was dispiriting then the gardens were poor and without wells the excessive levelness of the plain also was monotonous on the other hand the fruits were distinctly worthy of notice though how anyone could eat a jack fruit was beyond comprehension it smelt horribly it looked like a sheep's stomach stuffed and made into a haggis and its taste was sickly sweet he was disappointed also in the mango and could only damn it with faint praise by saying that such mangoes as are good are excellent the gazetteer however had to be finished another time for agra was reached bringing more urgent work his first view of the place he meant to make his capital was disappointing in the extreme it was the th of may and a dust storm was raging none who have not endured one in northern india can have any idea of the discomfort these electrical disturbances bring with them the air hot and heavy seems to parch the skin a shimmer bringing dizziness to the brain lies between the eyes and all things then suddenly a puff as of smoke drifts past the sky reddens lowers a low moaning sound as of coming wind is heard and then with a furious gust it is there for an instant or two the trees bending shivering in the storm show like spectres the next all things are blotted out by the dancing raging stinging sand atoms which leap into the air and positively fray the skin as they sweep past driven helter skelter by the gale then a drop or two of dry rain falls perhaps a little more and after half an hour or so the weary traveller who has sought shelter behind the first bush or in the first hollow can go on his way such a storm was at its height when babar entered the palace of his predecessor but he bore it with singular composure india had been to him for years a land of dreams and he meant to stay there despite dust but his nobles spat the sand out of their mouths and reviled all things indian until humayon in full durbar pulled out the great moghul diamond which had been given him voluntarily by the rajah's people of gwalior in gratitude for saving their lives and property from his soldiery for humayon so long as he served his father followed in his footsteps of humanity he laid it on a cushion of orange satin embroidered in silver and handed it to his father not so brilliant doubtless then as it is now when it shines as the koh inoor it was still a marvel and the northern nobles crowded round it in wondering delight in value it must have been equal to half the daily expense of the whole world enough therefore to pay for many discomforts and disagreeables but babar's eyes scarce brightened tis more suitable to the young than to the old sonling he said affectionately take it back humayon and give it to thy wife when thou hast one thy mother may her life be happy cares not for jewels nor in truth do i a rose is better than a ruby and that night when he had settled some affairs of state and pardoned a few hindustani nobles who had resisted his advance he set to work upon a rubai on that fancy but he was in too didactic a mood for poetry he felt that he had done everything that had been required of him so he wrote in his diary instead in consideration of my confidence in divine aid the most high did not suffer the distress and hardship of my life to be thrown away but defeated my most formidable enemy and made me conqueror of the noble country of hindustan this adjective was the result of some thought for babar was nothing if not truthful this success i do not ascribe to my own strength nor did this good fortune flow from my own efforts but from the fountain of the favour and mercy of the most high after which he took an aromatic opiate confection and went to bed chapter iii give me back one hour of kabul let me see it ere i die ah my heart is sick and heavy southern gales are not for me though the hills are white with winter place me there and set me free so in anticipation of prince charles at versailles might babar have said as he stood disconsolate on the banks of the river jumna at agra he had started at dawn full of high hope to find some place where he could lay out an elegant and well planned pleasure garden and lo the whole country side was so ugly and detestable that for the moment he felt inclined to fall in with his courtiers' advice to leave india to stew in its own juice there was no denying that as a country it had few pleasures to recommend it to begin with the people were not handsome then they had no idea of the charms of friendly society of frankly mixing together or of familiar intercourse they had little comprehension of mind no politeness of manner no fellow feeling then they had no good horses no good flesh no grapes or musk melons no ice or cold water no good food or bread in their bazaars no baths or colleges no candles not even a candlestick why even if their emperors or chief nobility had occasion for a light they had to send for dirty filthy men called lighters who held an iron tripod smelling horribly and dripping rancid oil close under their masters' noses pah it was disgusting for a wonder babar was in a real evil temper he could scarcely remember having felt so irritable before except that once when he had been trying to mount a fidgety biluch mare and had struck her in his impatience with his half closed fist and had thereby dislocated his thumb which had troubled him for months a just punishment for losing his temper with a dumb animal which knew no better besides that time he had been half drunk but now he felt inclined to cry a state of mind in which this man of the west and north has the sympathy of thousands upon thousands of others since there is scarce an anglo indian who has not felt the same on hot breathless may mornings when the dull eyes seeking for some object on which to rest find none save a wide waste of sand an indeterminate kikar tree and an aggressive crow bent on showing you that he is as black inside as he is outside the most clement will forget the unloveliness when he stands once more in the garden of fidelity remarked kwajah kilan with intent and babar actually scowled at him yet he had not the heart to say in so many words that he had no intention of returning to that garden of fidelity the very thought of its beauty made him feel sick but there was duty as well as beauty to be considered and here again he has the sympathy of how many thousand western workers in hindustan in truth babar should be the patron saint of the indian services but all things were against him that year the very heat was uncommonly oppressive men dropped down as if they had been affected by the simoon wind and died upon the spot then there was always dislike and hostility between the new comers and the people and it was difficult to find grain or provender the roads too became impassable and the villagers out of hatred and spite took to thieving and robbery yet in such a furnace how was it possible to send out proper protection to the districts still babar set his teeth and stuck to the saddle what thou also he said reproachfully to kwajah kilan when in the privacy of the small audience chamber the latter urged the wisdom of doing as all the past conquerors of india had done that is leaving so soon as the treasures had been divided and i counted thee my best friend the most clement knows i am that protested the kwajah stoutly that is why i urge immediate departure the men lose heart the badakhshanis never engage for more than three months' fighting and they have stood sixteen they were promised leave babar broke in impatiently then let them go they are but mercenaries not gentlemen of honour kwajah kilan flushed up i have ever been gallant man sire but i see no use in stopping to die of ghastly ailments there is a black death they call cholera which i like not so he went on again and again and this was but the beginning of many similar objections not only by the older begs and men of experience had that been so there would have been no harm in it but what sense or propriety was there in all the world eternally repeating the same tale in different words to one who himself saw the facts with his own eyes and had formed a cool and fixed resolution in regard to the business in which he was engaged for babar meant not only to conquer india but to be its emperor he meant with all the strength of his vivid vitality to found a dynasty he meant that his son and his son's sons should inherit what he had won for them what propriety therefore was there in the whole army down to the very dregs giving their stupid and unformed opinion on a matter which they were not capable of judging it was bad enough that men whom he had raised from low rank to the dignity of nobles in the expectation that if he had chosen to go through fire or water they would follow him backward and forward without hesitation should dare to arraign his measures and show determined opposition to his plans and opinions he did not stand their disloyalty for many days a council was called of all nobles of whatever rank and they came to it sheepishly yet stubbornly full of admiration still for their chief yet determined not to yield it was a grilling afternoon the audience hall literally throbbed with heat and more than one man loosened the collar at his throat and gasped as they waited for the emperor they had expected him to enter in state but there he was on the platform of the throne a plain man like themselves despite the heat he wore chain mail and helmet and his hand was on his sword plain soldier indeed but there was that in his face and mien which marked him out apart though as he stood he shivered visibly and as he began to speak his teeth chattered for babar was in grips with his first taste of indian fever and the ague fit was on him sharply but even as he stood there shivering and shaking it passed and with a wild rush the hot stage sent an uncanny light to his eyes and made the words leap to his blue lips gentlemen and soldiers empire cannot be achieved without the materials and means of war royalty and nobility exist by subjection and subjects by obedience after long years after great hardships measuring many a toilsome journey many a danger after exposing ourselves to battle and bloodshed our formidable enemy has been routed we have achieved the end we are masters of india and now without visible cause after having worn out our very lives in this emprise are we to abandon what we have gained a mighty enemy has been overcome a rich kingdom is at our feet are we having won the game to retreat to kabul like men who have lost and are discomfited no i say a thousand times no the fever swift to flare up had fair hold of him now and his words seemed to whip like scorpions let no man who calls himself babar's friend ever dare to moot the very idea again but if there be one amongst you who cannot summon up courage to stay let him go i want him not there was silence but no one stirred they had not the courage for that at any rate so babar went back to his bed his blood pulsing in every vein his head bursting until the hot stage passed into the sweating stage and he sat up weakly half laughing half crying lo i felt like a god he said a god with a pain everywhere did i say enough too much for me most clement quoth ali jan with a smile i stop till death and most of the hearers had come to the same decision only kwajah kilan obstinate as a mule refused to remain so as he had a fairly numerous retinue it was arranged that he should return to kabul in charge of the presents babar was sending home and this with the necessary thought it entailed lest any should be disappointed proved a welcome distraction for the emperor who in good sooth what with recurring attacks of fever and general malaise due to the climate needed something to keep up his spirits in the long weary hot days and nights during which military operations were perforce at a standstill and babar was in his element choosing this and that apportioning presents with all the fervour of a child at christmas no doubt his heart ached the while he wrote instructions for a regular gala to be held in the four corner garden and he must have felt life flat indeed when kwajah kilan had set out northwards a certain interest of anger however re awoke when a friend returning from escort duty to the party as far as delhi told him with ill concealed smiles that ere leaving the fort there kwajah kilan had scribbled on one of its walls if safe and sound i cross the sind damned if i ever wish for hind babar's cheek flushed dark red when he heard this jeu d'esprit as his emperor still remains in hindustan he said with hurt pomp there is evident impropriety first in composing and then in publishing such vituperative verse and so i will tell him which he did by sending after him post haste an urgent messenger with his reply babar thanks god who gave him sind and ind heat of the plains chill of the mountain cold yea let the scorch of india bring to his mind bitter bite of frost in ghazni of old the touch about ghazni was he thought peculiarly happy since he had appointed kwajah kilan governor of that province and ere the excitement of this passage of wits had died down to dulness another touch had come to set the wheel of life spinning once more at full speed one of maham's charming cheery letters brought most unexpected news after some years on the very verge in fact of her woman's life she was again expecting to be a mother and i pray it may be a boy she wrote for though hindal the son whom my lord gave so generously to my empty arms is very very dear to me my heart leaps at the very thought of one who shall be my lord's and mine also babar was overwhelmed with delight and anxiety even by special runner it took weeks for a letter to reach kabul so maham he knew must be near her time ere his warnings his happy hopes his loving affection could reach her but he wrote off in hot haste begging her to rely on dearest one for all things entreating her to behave in all ways as if he were at hand and thou knowest dear heart he said what i would be like were i in kabul now verily my moon who hast so often chidden me for fretting wide eyed the livelong night because humayon or gulbadan or one of the others had a stomach ache i should be past bearing but when i think of what has happened and what might happen i would mount rakush and ride kabul wards were it not for some small good sense and these pitiful folk who would deem me traitor to myself lo we will call him faruk wife since distance separates us after this he set to work upon his abandoned plan of a pleasure garden beggars he said to ali jan must not be choosers if there was no better spot than the plain over the river he must e'en make the best of it and the first thing to do was to sink a well the next to plant roses and narcissus in corresponding beds the third thing was to hold a drinking party upon the spot close to the river and make the place as pretty as it could be made with coloured lights and illuminations garlands of flowers and palms cut off wholesale and planted in the ground it seemed a pity to destroy the trees but that was hindustan fashion everything for show at the moment no thought for the future still it was well done and the indian jugglers performed some fine feats the rains had by this time set in and the air was singularly delightful though rather moist and damp it was for instance impossible to shoot with the kabul bow which is pieced with glue and everything coats of mail clothes furniture became mildewed even books and babar was avid concerning books suffered and the flat mud roofs leaked still life was more enjoyable than it had been and jolly ali jan when in his cups said gravely the chief excellency of india is that it is large and that it holds plenty of gold and silver they were a fairly merry party these northerners in the fort at agra merry good natured insouciant and they began to win golden opinions for themselves amongst the people thanks to the emperor's strict discipline here were no robbers but gallant men ready to drink or love and pay for both like honest folk and their leader was a friendly soul who sent assurances of safety and protection to all who voluntarily entered into his service then he was a fine fellow to look at with kindly eyes and a ready smile active vivacious absolutely unlike therefore the solid solemn stony eyed lazy voluptuary which for hundreds of years had been india's conception of a king here honours and rewards were for ever being bestowed and the small native princes invariably received back their lands after they had made their obeisance so whatever the northern conqueror's object might be it was clearly not gold that in itself was a relief thus the long months sped on bringing to one man at least continued effort fever had laid hold of babar without his dear women kind he felt lost and he had had to send his son and his best friend out with small forces to settle the country still he held on dutifully giving feasts to his people despite the rain which more than once drenched them through to the skin as well it might seeing that it rained thirteen times on one feast day but in early october a special messenger arrived from kabul with the joyful news of little faruk's birth and the same post brought a budget of letters written before the event by maham and by the paternal aunts and cousins to the fifth degree describing the marvellous festival which had been held according to order in the four corner garden everything had been done exactly as his majesty had directed every begum had had her own tent and screen set up with all due luxury in the garden it had been lit and beautifully illuminated at night and all the best singers and dancers of kabul had been assembled to give music never had been such a merry making never such a circle of happy faces and sparkling jewels in the sunshine for the day had been brilliantly fine then wrote maham who was out and away the best scribe we made kwajah kilan read out the instructions given him so that we might hear and rejoice in our lord's thought for us so he read in a sonorous tone not so sweet as my lord's but passable 'to each begum is to be delivered as follows one special dancing girl of the dancing girls of sultan ibrahim with one gold plate full of jewels ruby and pearl cornelian and diamonds emerald and turquoise topaz and cat's eyes besides two small mother of pearl trays full of golden coins two brazen trays shall be piled with silver coins and three with rich stuffs of sorts so that there be nine in each another dancing girl a plate of jewels and one each of gold and silver coins must be presented to each of my elder relations and have a care that each and all get the very dancing girl and the very plates of jewels that i have chosen myself for them so let jewels and gold coins and silver coins be presented to all the ladies and kinsmen and foster brethren while one silver coin is to be given as an incentive to emulation to every man woman and child in kabul to make them remember me and pray for me' and even so my lord 'twas done though it needed not money to make kabul remember its beloved king during those three happy days every soul was uplifted with pride and recited the first chapter of the blessed book for the benediction and prosperity of his majesty as they joyfully made the prostration of thanks for his victories but how can this dust like one convey her thanks for the special gifts so graciously given in private to me and others let the others speak for themselves i sit with a heart full of gratitude before that heaped up tray knowing not where to set my first stone of thanks for lo the superstructure will be so heavy that it must have good foundation lo there be two things amid the many quaint conceits of hindustan the many rare and beautiful gifts on which i will rest my load of loving gratitude first or is it second i know not the dearest little dresses fashioned after the manner of indian princelings for your son so soon to be born believe me my lord i wept happy tears over them and yet methinks the book in my lord's own hand it hath not lost its cunning giving me the verses he hath composed during the last year is sweeter more dear the father comes see you before the child hindal is beside himself with delight at the wooden toys so neat so quaint so clever truly they must be good workmen in hindustan so slight they are yet do they please the little ones more than gold and gulbadan truly she is a rosebud now hugs her doll and hath taught it already to make the respectful salutation to majesty she herself hath lately learnt so we are all smiles nay it was more than smiles when poor dear fat astonishing beauty princess sat the tears streaming down her face nodding her head over the recitations while the tassel of the head ornament my lord sent her dangled over her nose like a yak's tail on a camel and the trick on old asas came off beautifully even as my lord arranged it for when the faithful thing asked kwajah kilan 'what has my lord sent me' he replied with truth 'one gold coin' so the old man was amazed and disappointed and fretted about it and we said nothing so then at last as my lord had commanded the old man was blindfolded and he was led into our apartments to receive his gift a hole had been bored as ordered in the gold coin it weighed nigh six pounds and a string put to it so it was hung round his neck my lord should have seen him he was quite helpless with surprise at its weight and delighted and very very happy he took it in both hands and wondered over it and said 'no one shall get it no one no one' then we all laughed too and gave him more money so he was fine and pleased thus all went well save for the absence of my lord babar read so far stopping at times for a laugh for a pause of sheer delight now he let slip the letter and sat awhile staring out at the ugliness the fremdness of india what would he not have given to be there to see them all to see the blaze of july blossom to hear the water trickling through the stone runnels to watch the white flocks of clouds on the vast meadows of sapphire overhead the thought was too much for him his eyes filled with tears then he brushed them aside with the order slave a cup of wine that night over the water where strange new buildings were fast rising and where new planted flowers and shrubs were thriving so fast in the kindly rains that already the townspeople marvelling at the growing beauty called the place kabul the revels were fast and furious and babar before he got miserably drunk gained loud applause for a song he had just translated from the hindi it ran as follows oh watchman of night awake for the dawning is nigh the black bees hum as their way they take through the lightening sky oh far away in the jasmine bowers the robbers will rifle the honey flowers watchman awake awake oh watch of the night arise for the windows unclose a blue gown hung with pearl fringing lies on a bosom of rose oh close at hand in the old man's tower the lovers will wanton a happy hour watchman arise arise oh rouse thee watchman rouse lo the rain of night is past her veil is dank 'neath her level brows the heavy tears fall fast oh far away lies her lovers part and close at hand lies her broken heart oh watchman rouse thee rouse tis a rare song hiccupped jan ali but devil take me if i can tell what it means tis the tale of a wanton quoth tardi beg gravely and see you she wore a blue gown fringed with pearl babar looked at them both with irritation before the lord he said almost sharply i know not which is best understanding or the lack of it then he burst into a roar of laughter they be merry devils over in kabul quoth a surly faced cook in the royal kitchen mayhap they may laugh the wrong side of their mouths ere long chapter iv fate knocked at the door of death my soul in her hollow hand angels opened it lo god saith to whom gave he this command take him back to the gates of life and set his feet in the way so he and his children and his wife will praise my mercy alway babar the oncoming of cooler weather brought renewed activity once more so far agra was almost the southern limit of babar's empire below it and to east and west the pagans as these northern mahomedans called the hindus collectively still held undisturbed sway in truth they had never been touched by invasion from the north the marauders had generally turned tail and fled before the scorch of the hot weather ere they had time to reach and harry so far south and of all the pagans the one most to be feared was rana sanka the rajput chief of udaipur sooner or later babar knew there must be a trial of strength between them but he meant to put it off as long as he could meanwhile there were menaces to agra closer at hand notably the strong fort of biana which had lately gone over to the rajput side that was not to be endured and humayon who was an excellent second in command set out to reduce the renegades to order babar meanwhile remaining in agra and making preparations for the big fight that was bound to come one of these was the casting of a big siege cannon for the purpose of battering biana which was sure to be recalcitrant to the last the task was entrusted to master gunsmith ali kool than whom no better craftsman lived in all asia he had learnt his art away in the far west and called himself ever ali kool of turkey a small spare bit of a man with sparse whiskers and a faint pitting of small pox or gun powder over a puffy face but an excellent artificer staking his reputation on a big gun that should throw a fifty pound shot over four miles it was a big order and babar's imagination caught fire he was down at the furnaces every day watching the preparations eight furnaces in a circle centring the huge clay mould but it was at night that he loved to see the roaring flames with the naked black figures of the stokers dancing about them and the lurid glow of the half molten metal lighting up the very heavens above the heat was intense none of his courtiers could stand it for long but he his eyes keen with curiosity doffed raiment and went about naked as he was born save for a waist cloth the most clement prepares himself for paradise remarked the most caustic wit of the party and babar laughed gaily i prefer hell in time rather than in eternity friend he replied and as usual began an extempore versicle on the idea will it be at dawn to morrow master he asked of ali kool late one evening at dawn to morrow replied the master gunsmith boastfully the largest cannon in asia will be found in the armoury of babar padishah he was nearly beside himself with excitement but at dawn next day he stood pale to ashen greyness still as a stone everything was ready it only needed the word to open the sluices and let the molten metal run into the mould and that word was the name the gun was to bear in the future now most clement palpitated ali kool deg ghazi came babar's full voice the which being interpreted means holy victorious pot a yell of clamouring voices a clash of implements half drowned the christening then like streaks of light the molten metal crept with slow swiftness gathering speed as it flowed bringing with it fierce almost unbearable heat the mould filled half full three quarters and then then the metal ceased to run there was no more in the furnaces ali kool was like one demented hold the man shouted babar whose eyes were ever alert for other people as well as himself or he will do himself a mischief and indeed it was time poor ali kool was on the edge of the mould as if about to throw himself into the molten metal waving his arms about wildly and calling high heaven to witness that it ought not it could not have occurred and babar's kindly touch on his shoulder his kindly words nay master jee such things do happen at times to the best of us only brought grief and shame to strengthen anger he was disgraced he had disgraced the emperor not one whit laughed babar and as for thee here slaves bring quick a robe of honour the best and here where the misadventure they are sent by god remember o ali kool occurred will i invest thee and make thee noble it was a fine group the kingly figure so full of human sympathy the broken hearted artificer smiling perforce a watery smile the crowding workmen the insouciant courtiers both full of approval and tuning all to the perfect harmony of true life the appeal to that which lies beyond chance and misadventure lo his majesty hath the touch of consolation to perfection said tardi beg yea assented ali jan but i would he had as fine a sense of danger dost know that he hath put on four hindustani cooks to his royal kitchen because forsooth he hath never tasted the dishes of this accursed country and must needs try them aye said mahomed bakshi who was superintendent of the household and what is worse they be the royal cooks of the late king heard you ever such fool hardiness lo i have put on two new tasters but what is that these idolaters have strange ways and strange poisons and strange dishes put in tardi beg lo i eat none at the emperor's supper parties nor i chorused several gentlemen said mahomed bakshi you speak without thought for the interior of a kitchen poison may go into any pot 'twere better to eat nothing then would my labours be less thy percentages also laughed a recognised wit heed him not gentlemen 'tis but his way of keeping our stomachs empty so that more profit fills his pocket so the subject was dismissed with a joke though in truth it was far from being one for babar's somewhat reckless appointment of these four hindustani cooks had set in train one of those fine drawn female plots to poison which seem inseparable from the seclusion of women it is as if the concentrated confined vitality denied outlet in natural ways seeks expression in pure venom the late sultan ibrahim's mother lived by babar's generosity in comparative state he had assigned lands to her treated her with the utmost respect and when he addressed her did so as mother but the mere chance of having a hindustani cook in the royal kitchen was too much for gratitude the result babar wrote to maham when considerably the worse for the incident he was still living on water lily flowers brayed in milk the ill fated lady having heard of my appointment of cooks delivered no less than a quarter of an ounce of poison to a female slave and sent it to ahmed her taster wrapped up in a folded paper he seducing the man by promise of vast lands handed it to one of the cooks desiring him by some means or another to throw it into my food the man did not throw it into the pot because i had strictly enjoined my tasters ever to watch the hindustanis fortunately therefore he only threw it into the tray in this fashion when they were dishing the meat my graceless tasters must have been inattentive for he managed to throw about one half of the poison on a plate which held some thin slices of bread these he covered with meat fried in butter the better half in his haste he spilt in the fireplace it was fried hare i am very fond of hare so i ate a good deal and also fried carrot i was not however sensible of any disagreeable taste but while i was eating some smoked dried meat i felt nausea now the day before while eating this smoke dried flesh i had detected an unpleasant taste in a part of it i therefore ascribed my nausea to that incident but it was not so i was very ill now i have never been ill in that way even after drinking wine suspicion therefore crossed my mind immediately i desired the cooks to be taken into custody and directed the rest of the meat to be given to a dog and that it be shut up the dog became sick his belly swelled he could not be induced to rise until noon next day when he rose and recovered two young menials in the kitchen who had partaken of the food also suffered one indeed was extremely ill but in the end both escaped and so did i next morning i held a court and the miscreants being questioned detailed the whole circumstances of the plot in all its particulars the master taster was ordered to be cut in pieces the cook flayed alive the female slave to be shot by a matchlock the ill fated lady i condemned to be thrown into custody for life one day pursued by her guilt she will meet with due retribution in penitence since then i have lived chiefly on antidotes and lily flowers and thanks be to god there are now no remains of illness but i did not fully comprehend before how sweet a thing life is as the poet says 'he who comes to the gate of death knows the value of life' truly when this awful occurrence passes before my memory i feel myself involuntarily turn faint but having overcome my repugnance even to think of it i write so that no undue alarm or uneasiness might find its way to you god has indeed given me a new life other days await me and how can my tongue express my gratitude the ill fated lady's grandson ibrahim had previously been guarded with the greatest respect and delicacy but when an attempt of so heinous a nature was discovered to have been made by the family i do not think it prudent to have a son of the late king in this country so i am sending him to my son kamran away from hindustan i am now quite recovered this was true but the nervous shock remained babar had been close to death in its most sordid form to die like a poisoned rat was to him with his breezy open hearted love of frankness in all things a horrible fate his repugnance even to think of it was real but he hovered between two methods of forgetfulness the drowning of thought in the wine cup and the anodyne of repentance and forgiveness deep down in his heart he felt himself foresworn in not having kept to his promise of reform when he was forty but he could not make up his mind to take the plunge and give up wine it was he told himself the only comfort in that cursed country the one thing that made life possible with its help even fever and ague were bearable it was therefore in the midst of drinking bouts that news came which roused him to other activities it had never needed much to change the habitual toper into a clear sighted man of arms and never in all his life had news of such significance brought babar up with a round turn rana sanka of udaipur was on the move the quarrel could no longer be put off the fight for final supremacy was nigh at hand the news came when the christmas rain was just over and babar exhilarated as he always was by the freshened verdure of trees the sudden start into growth of the wide wheat fields was heightening his enjoyment by a feast over the river in kabul which day by day under his fostering care showed more and more likeness to the sponsor country humayon was back from a successful expedition and was of the party no kill joy his father thought fondly though he drank no wine not from scruples but from lack of liking it was of course a wonderfully innocent and guileless party no coarse jokes no scurvy tricks but the most of them were incontestably drunk and even babar's strong head was fast becoming fuddled when the special messenger arrived canopus was shining away like a moon in the south and babar looked at it gravely yet truculently gentlemen he said solemnly and it was all he could do not to hiccup draw your s s words gentlemen we have to fight a a dam ned p pagan to to morrow meanwhile i'll sing you a song account as wind or dust the world's pleasures and pain be not raised up or crushed by its good or its bane as a mere throw of dice is the life of a man fortune goes in a trice just a flash in the pan take then a cup of wine drink it down to the dregs and don't grumble or whine 'tis but the fool who begs his voice failed him when he had got so far he sat solemn drunk gazing at canopus wondering how many years ago it was since he had first seen it from the top of the pass how clear how cold the night air had been how the star had sparkled how the glad life in him had answered to the thrill of that distant heaven sent throbbing light well the night was as clear as cold now the stars how they sparkled and shone all colours like jewels yes all things were the same except himself gentlemen he said suddenly rising unsteadily to his feet i give you leave i i go to my bed but he was up before dawn next day to see ali kool put the final touches to the great gun he had been making for after all the casting had been a success needing only a little alteration to make it perfect in the afternoon it was tested and threw one thousand six hundred good paces which was not so bad and all agra was in a turmoil of preparation for the coming march but there was so much to be done that a few days passed before babar at the head of all his available troops moved out in battle array to occupy the rising ground at sikri where the huge tank promised abundance of water he had been in a fever of impatience to get there lest the pagans also seeing its many advantages as a camping ground might forestall him but the th of february found him preparing for the biggest battle of his life in the very place where his grandson akbar was in after years to build his town of victory it was just a year since babar had entered india now he was faced by the strongest man in it and the fight must be to the bitter end yet he could not resist the seduction of an aromatic comfit before he threw himself outwearied on his camp bed but he said his prayers before he took it and tried to forget that long made promise that forty should see him sober chapter v like to a thunder cloud that rears itself in towering mass across the peaceful sky equal in threat until the vivid snake of lightning shot god knows from east or west flashes fierce war between the blended foes so stood those warriors each to each a twin in honour courage indivisible the camp at sikri looked west with the ridge of red rock behind it the wide tank to the left of it nothing more could be desired in position and babar had fortified it in addition after his usual custom the swivel guns united every fifteen feet by heavy chains and backed by a deep ditch gave security to the front while tripods of wood similarly linked protected the right flank mustapha the ottoman had done signal service in disposing the remaining artillery according to the turkish fashion an exceedingly active intelligent and skilful gunner was mustapha but unfortunately master gunner ali kool and he were at deadly enmity so they had to be kept apart babar a trifle weary kept them so with consummate tact he had so to speak lived on diplomacy for the last year he had pursued his policy of magnanimity without one swerve and little by little the tide of popularity had set his way one by one insurgent chiefs had sent in their submission so that in this camp at sikri were many who but a year before had been sworn foes to the northmen so far he had succeeded alone unaided at any rate in thought he had won half hindustan not so much by the sword as by statesmanship and yet on the th february as he stood watching the khorasan pioneers and spademen throwing up further earthworks he felt for the first time in his life forlorn perhaps the darkness of the day depressed him it was late afternoon and for days rain had been brewing the heavy rain which sometimes falls in march to bring bumper crops to the wide fields purple clouds hung like a pall under the sky and brought a weird vivid glint as of steel to the stretches of green wheat far away on the south western horizon this glint shimmered into a broad band of light that told where before long the hidden sun must set there in that light the spear points of the advancing foe would glisten did they glisten now or was that only the shimmer of countless millions of wheat blades going forth to war against starvation the fanciful idea came to babar's brain as such quaint thoughts did come often while he was looking over the wide ominous plains recognising also that it was not an encouraging landscape to the ordinary eye but nothing was encouraging the long waiting had told upon the temper of his troops it had given time for desertions then a trifling defeat to a skirmishing party had intensified the growing alarm a well deserved defeat due to gross lack of judgment on the commander's part but the rank and file could not be expected to give weight to arguments a disaster spelt disaster to them nothing more nor less especially if they were afraid and they were afraid small blame to them babar himself did not view his adversary with equanimity he admitted it for rana sanka of udaipur was true man a fitting representative of rajput valour there was no need to say more aye true man though he lacked an eye lost in a broil with his brother an arm lost in pitched battle and was crippled in one leg broken by a cannonball true man undoubtedly though but a fragment of a warrior scarred by eighty lance and sword wounds babar thought of his own good luck in many a battle almost with regret aye pagan rana sanka might be it was best anyhow to call him so to the troops but he was worthy foe for all that and he could bring two hundred thousand horsemen into the field if need be two hundred thousand no wonder the troops were timorous no wonder their nerve was going fast babar tall lean with clear anxious eyes thanked god for the distraction which had come to the camp but yesterday about five hundred persons attendant on a grandson of his dead uncle of khorasan had arrived in the environs of the camp and with quick insight babar had seized the occasion to send out a numerous escort to hide the smallness of the newly arrived force which thereinafter figured in the order book as important re inforcement from kabul since by fair means or foul the men's courage must be kept up and the butler who had been sent to kabul for wine had returned too with fifteen camel loads of choice ghazni but this was no time for drunkenness though a goblet or two might be must be permissible for of one thing there was no doubt never in all his life had babar stood nearer to habitual toping he had had a hard time of it he had been cut off from the domestic life which had ever been his safeguard he had had to fight fever and poison briefly he was overwrought that was noticeable in the nervous restlessness of his hand upon his sword hilt as he strode about his camp moodily watchful for every sign of discontent or depression and there were many it seemed almost as if no one could utter a manly word or give a courageous opinion save his own son humayon his son in law mahdi husband to the little ma'asuma to whom babar had given her mother's name and one general not a soul spoke bravely as became men of honour and firmness not one going his rounds that evening a new factor for discouragement cropped up he was passing the tents of some of his best kabul troops when a voice bombastic prophetic met his ear lo the stars cannot lie it said and mars being in the ascendant to the west it follows of a certainty that any force coming from the east will suffer disastrous defeat be warned oh warriors the heavens cannot lie before the last words had well ended babar stood before the speaker literally blazing with wrath and recognising in him mahomed shereef a well known kabul astrologer he was seated before a chart of the stars and swayed backwards and forwards rhythmically whilst before him filling the close tent with scented smoke burnt a brazier its blue salt fed flame flared on the fearful faces of a dozen or more soldiers god send thee to hell burst out babar how camest thou hither infamous fool why didst not stay in kabul the man he had a pompous self satisfied face was shrewd he knew his power and held his own i came hither most clement with the wine camels being minded to give the benefit of my science to his majesty and his majesty's soldiers science echoed babar hotly thou meanest lies the stars cannot lie began the soothsayer but babar in a perfect passion of wrath had him by the throat here guards seize this rascally fellow he cried then hesitated no he went on loosing his hold and flinging the man from him in contempt let him go punishment would but invite credence but mark my words villainous soothsayer if any more be heard of this opposition of mars he paused again and this time burst into bitter laughter no let these men sup their fill of horrors if they wish it but they shall hear me first he turned to his soldiers and stretched out his right hand in appeal men i have led you all these years have i led you into more danger than brave men dare face aye once for thou o shumshir his quick eye had seized on an old veteran wert with me even then aye once at samarkand when babar got the worst beating of his life when babar fled like a rat to his hole starved for six months and escaped with bare life but but not with honour no with dishonour his voice had risen and almost broke over the last word from sheer stress of emotion and wherefore was i beaten he went on more calmly because i fought on star craft because the stars lied to me they said i would win and i was beat so set the snivelling sayings of that silly worm against the experience of babar your leader if you will but you will not you will leave jugglery and devils' craft to your foes the pagans for the trust of the true moslem is in the most high god allah hu akbar he gave the cry of faith from full lungs and it was echoed by the men for the time he had scotched fear but only for a time the astrologer was at worst a diversion in the long weariness of waiting and round the camp fires the soldiers talked of nothing else lo he is good prophet said one he told my wife's sister her son would die and he did and 'tis all well enough to call it devils' craft put in another but who made the stars save god and to what use were they made asked a third argumentatively save to guide men aright there is no other good in them this proposition was so palpably true to the knowledge of those days that even babar himself had no weapon against the argument nor could any deny that mars was in the ascendant in the west the emperor as he sat wearied out with anger and irritation could see it for himself shining red steadily placidly red oh for god's sake gentlemen he said captiously when he had exhausted every argument he could think of to allay the evident alarm even of his highest nobles let us leave it hanging in the heavens and get to paradise ourselves cup bearer the new ghazni wine that may help us to forget foolery mayhap it would have been better to have brained the knave on the spot but a man can but do his best he drained his cup to the lees held it out for more and called for a song thank god for wine he muttered under his breath as he felt the fumes rising to his brain never had merriment been more fast and furious never had babar drunk more recklessly song after song rent the night air mingled with outcries and loud laughter but there was sufficient decorum left for comparative silence when the emperor himself lifted up his voice in the buss a favourite turkhoman ditty it had rather a quaint plaintive tune and a catching refrain which was duly bellowed by the others he his moustache twirled called to her aloud 'give me a buss lass lo your lips are red' she her bright hair curled spoke him back full proud 'give me a gold piece merry sir' she said 'merry sir' she said etc 'lass i would give thee golden fee galore but my purse alas is in wallet tan of the saddle bag my swift camel bore and see you my dear that's still at karuwan still at karuwan' etc 'lad i would buss you were my lips but free only as you see they won't ope a span mother locked my teeth mother keeps the key mother like thy camel 's still at karuwan still at karuwan mother like thy camel 's still at karuwan' the endless refrain went on and on sillily mingled with the twanging of the citharas and boisterous laughter it was a roaring night and babar for once blind drunk fell asleep at last among his cushions the others had been carried back to their several tents so when he roused to the crow of a cock he was alone save for drowsy servants but half sober he sat up and listened gravely oh cock he quoted with a hiccup oh cock cock flutter not thy wings it is not nearly day why with shrill utterings drivest thou sleep away lo in the land of nod to perfect peace i'd come oh cock there is a god will surely strike thee dumb surely strike thee dumb he stood up stretched with a lurch passed unsteadily to the doorway of the tent raised the curtain and looked out far in the east a great drift of spent rose leaf clouds lay softly between the lightening sky and the lightening earth and see already their curled petals were catching the underglow of the hidden sun babar stood still and held his breath hard sobered in every fibre of his being yet elate with something new that fled to heart and brain like molten fire a new day a new day a new day the words surged not through him only they echoed to the very sky it is not given to all this sudden exaltation this sudden absorption of the self into something beyond self and babar the fumes of last night's wine still hanging between him and clear thought could only realise that something had come to him that something was irrevocably settled for ever my charger slave he said hoarsely it it is time i went my rounds it stood ready at the door he mounted and after his wont rode off alone the fresh cool air of a north indian winter dawn bit softly at his cheek and brought him knowledge of his own conversion wherefore he could not tell but he was going to drink no more he had done with wine for ever all these last four or five years since he was forty he had been cheating himself aye and his god too with lies now there was to be truth there was no special reason for this resolution it was indeed hardly a resolution of his own it had come to him with those dawn red rose leaf clouds flung from some garden of paradise wherefore it had come he could not say he had often seen dawn clouds before he had often ah how often made resolutions these were different this resolution was not his bid a general parade be commanded at the second watch he said on his return from his survey of the posts then passed into his office tents and began his daily work of supervision 'twill be to harangue us all grumbled a fine weather soldier sullenly but king or no king i fight not with one who wars against the fiat of the stars nor i answered another and though few were so outspoken a certain dour opposition sat on almost every face in the great concourse of men who in the full glare of the noonday sun massed themselves round the great audience tent in obedience to their leader's command he came out from the shadow of the tent clad in his loose white tunic jewelless swordless a simple man in the prime of life a man with a kindly human face but with a clear eye that seemed to see right to the heart of things he held a crystal cup in his right hand full to the brim with red wine noblemen gentlemen and soldiers rang out the strong mellow voice all who sit down to the feast of life must end by drinking the cup of death therefore it behooves all to be ready for that last draught by repenting him of the evil he has done lo i repent me of my sin i repent me of my broken promise now with the salvation of a righteous death before me i cast away my great temptation as he spoke the crystal cup he held flew from his hand and the red wine scattered from it as it fell shivered to atoms soaked into the dry sand leaving a stain as of blood lo i repent he repeated his face afire who follows me i do sire said one asas the heaviest drinker in the camp and babar turned on him a face radiant with friendly thanks that makes it less hard he said joyously thou hast more to renounce than i and i also most clement put in a soft grave voice i follow fair where babar goes it was tardi beg quaint frolicsome soul on whom the emperor vented much of his boyish fun and who was satisfied with one kindly glance of perfect sympathy and i and i and i came here there everywhere then followed a memorable an almost unbelievable scene from the tent behind babar came slaves bearing great trays of silver and gold goblets ewers measures strong men bearing casks and skins of wine a smith or two with his anvil break up the gold and silver and give it to the poor and pour the wine back to the storehouse of god came babar's voice where it falls shall be built a well whence travellers may quench their thirst for a minute or two the army watched the hammers falling watched the red wine sinking into the sand then it caught fire at the sight and men crowded round in hundreds to cast their wine cups on to the pile and take the oath of abstinence but the emperor himself stood silent he was thinking how glad maham would be maham who had so often striven to wean him from his sin but after the stir and excitement of the morning the evening closed in dark and gloomy a few spots of rain fell and babar made restless probably by the lack of his usual stimulant decided on moving forwards to meet the enemy anything seemed better than inaction this was done but even the bustle of marching failed to rouse the men's spirits the warnings of the old astrologer returned in greater force a general consternation and alarm prevailed amongst great and small something more must be done so once again babar called a grand parade but this time he held the holy koran in his right hand it was many days now since wine had crossed his lips he had felt no desire to drink no temptation to break his oath and yet that abstinence had told upon him physically he was more high strung than ever more exalted and so he struck even a higher note how much better is it to die with honour than to live with infamy he cried lo the most high is merciful to us if we fall we die the death of martyrs since we fight the pagan if we live we live the victorious avengers of the faith let us then swear on god's holy word that none of us will turn his face from death or victory till his soul is separated from his body 'with fame even if i die i am content fame shall be mine though my body be death's' the persian verse came to him unsought echo from his far youthful days when firdusis' shah namah had been the delight of his boyhood but it came to him godsent familiar to almost all it and this declaration of holy war stirred the whole army to its heart the effect was instantly visible far and near men plucked up courage none too soon that very evening a patrol brought in the news that the enemy was within touch all was bustle for babar was too experienced a general to engage an overwhelming foe without having some entrenched position upon which to fall back a day or two was occupied in throwing up earthworks a mile or two ahead so it was not till the th of march that the guns and the troops moved on to take up their position babar himself galloping along the line animating the various divisions giving to each special instructions how to act giving almost to every man orders how he was to behave in what manner he was to engage it was the last opportunity he was to have of bringing the personal equation to bear upon his force since ere they had settled into camp the great moment awaited for six long weeks was on them without loss of time the emperor sent every man to his post the lines of chained guns and waggons was linked up the reserves withdrawn from the front their great strength was ever a special feature of babar's generalship and there was nothing more to be done save await the onset humayon commanded the right mahdi kwaja ma'asuma's husband the left babar reserving the centre for himself once again his plan was to force in the enemy's wings and so create confusion but ere this could be done his own wings had to withstand attack at half past nine in the morning a furious charge of the flower of rajput chivalry almost shook humayon's force his father was on the watch however reserves came up speedily and mustapha's guns from the right centre were brought into action despite their deadly fire fresh and fresh bodies of the enemy poured on undauntedly and babar saw his reserves dwindling for the attack had been equally fierce on the left now therefore was the moment of effort now something must be done or nothing the battle had raged for hours now it must be decided one way or the other flanking columns right and left wheel and charge came the order guns in the centre advance cavalry charge to right and left of matchlock men wings to follow suit if they can now then master gunner ali kool let us see if thou canst whip mustapha the most clement shall see yelled the old man and uncovered by the charging cavalry the big guns with their huge stone balls began on their task the battle was now universal and the unexpected movements made all at the same moment had the desired effect upon the enemy his centre was thrown into slight confusion babar set his teeth reserves to the flanking columns and steady steady in front no rushing close in close in but this was no battle of an hour or two as at paniput step by step the gallant rajputs disputed the way of that steady boring they made repeated and desperate attacks on the emperor's centre in the hopes of recovering the day but all were received bravely steadily without one waver how could there be one with that marvellous general behind sitting his horse like an oriental napoleon cool collected unarmed ready of resource of reserve by this time one of the flanking columns had got round to the enemy's rear the rajputs were forced into their centre briefly babar had won the battle on his own settled lines by sunset the brave defeated still numerous had nothing left to them but to cut their way as best they could through those encircling suffocating arms and so effect what retreat they could but the victory was final it was complete when the moon rose that night it shone upon multitudes of gallant dead rana sanka had himself escaped though severely wounded but never again was he or any other of his family to take the field against the moghul power they had learnt to fear the northmen the enemy being thus defeated parties were sent after the fugitives to prevent their reforming babar felt vaguely that he was guilty of neglect in not going himself but he was thoroughly spent and weary of bloodshed he had gained his point he had proved himself the better man of the two and for the present that was enough for him so after riding a few miles in pursuit he turned to reach his own camp about bedtime prayers at the door of his tent a dim figure showed and profuse gratulations on victory rose out of the darkness in a well remembered and bombastic voice it was mahomed shereef the astrologer this was too much babar wearied as he was poured forth a perfect torrent of abuse no word was too bad for the miserable fool but when he had thus relieved his heart he suddenly began to laugh lo he said thou art heathenishly inclined perverse extremely self conceited and an insufferable evil speaker yet art thou also an old servant therefore see here the treasurer shall give thee a whole lakh of rupees so that thou go to the devil out of my dominions never my friend let me see thy ill omened face again all's well that ends well indeed as babar laid his head on the pillow that night as undoubted master of india his one regret was that he could not have had a personal tussle with his brave and honourable adversary he had been worth beating and he had been beaten effectually chapter vi distraught am i since that i gave up wine confused to nothing doth my soul incline regret did once my penitence beget now penitence induces worse regret babar babar wrote these verses from a full heart for he found much difficulty in reconciling himself to the desert of abstinence and it was a desert indeed after the storm of war had come peace at least comparative peace and a flat calm was never to his taste even in youth and here it was aggravated almost beyond bearing by a thousand and one minor troubles to begin with ere he had commenced the holy war against that honourable pagan rana sanka he had told his soldiers that if successful as many of them as wanted it should have leave to return home and this promise had to be fulfilled then humayon's division had consisted almost entirely of levies from badakhshan where the young prince had been governor and these were seized with a great longing for home as kabul was imperfectly defended it seemed best therefore to send both the division and its leader back indeed humayon himself needed a rest he had worked magnificently and now a young wife was awaiting his return so in god's name let him go and little ma'asuma should have her husband back also a good sort though he need not have shown his discomfort quite so openly still let him go also to return when the approaching hot weather was past as governor of etawah then tardi beg babar's heart sank as he thought of life without the man who for years and years had been more of a charge than a help in manners mundane but in all things super mundane what a joy thoughtless profuse a lover of the glass how often had he not turned a frown to a laugh a merry innocent laugh truly ever since he babar had come across him an irresponsible lovable darvish and had prevailed upon him to give up religion in favour of fighting he had been a perpetual stand by to that side of babar's nature which was not even perceived by the mass of his entourage and now to have none ready with quip and crank that held just the salt of life wherewith it must be salted yet tardi beg must go too that renunciation of his had re aroused religion in his heart and it must be allowed free course he also would see the gardens of kabul would feel its fresh breezes drink its ice cold water truly if one did not drink wine the water should at least be cold babar gulped down a tepid draught disgustedly and worked away at the verses he meant to send by his friend to those other friends who had deserted him last year they were in turkhi and ran as follows oh ye who left us alone to die 'neath the sultry heat of an indian sky who shirked the labour of life to fly back to its comfort its jollity lo you have had your recompense fair of joy and delight your proper share but we have struggled to hold our own have tilled and laboured without a moan and god's great mercy a way has shown to patient content as the seed was sown you in life's garden god's harvest missed i gather it here in hesht bishist hesht bishist or the eighth paradise being the name of his favourite garden in agra in fact verses and gardens were his greatest amusement that hot weather much of which he spent at dholpur where he was busy laying out pleasure grounds and building palaces he had disbanded most of his troops until the rainy season was over and sent his nobles to the several districts assigned to them thus he was left alone to fight out the temperance battle by himself it did not agree with him evidently for twice he nearly succumbed to sudden illness but he brought religion to bear on the question with a grave simplicity all his own and kept feasts and fasts with the strictest orthodoxy even here however he could not be quite conventional for never since he was eleven having held the festival of ramzaen two years running in the same place a fact which gives testimony to his unsettled life he could not make up his mind to break through the usage so he ordered a fine camp to be pitched at sikri and deserted his capital thus the months sped by bringing disappointments and minor pleasures the news which came to him that humayon humayon the magnificent the darling of his heart had on his way through delhi broken open the treasure houses there and marched off kabul wards with their contents hurt him extremely he had never expected such conduct from him so he wrote him a letter containing the severest reprehensions and thereinafter fell ill for seventeen days it was not so bad a fever however as that which seized on him in october after he swam the ganges at sambal in order to ride alone having separated from his people by a finesse for no reason at all to agra he lay half delirious then for nigh four weeks his brain busy all the time with versifications he only recollected one of them however when at last a mere skeleton of a man he rose from his bed he set it down however to show how bad he had been my fever grows each day my slumber fades away my pains go on increasing my patience is decreasing he laughed over the doggerel as he sat joyously eating fruit once more and reading a letter which told him that in a month's time two of his paternal aunts would actually pay him a visit they had come south with little ma'asuma whom her husband was taking to etawah he was full on the instant of preparations an architect was sent for and orders given for a special palace to be decorated for their reception he himself passing rapidly through convalescence went out to meet them in a boat above secunderabad it was a most joyful meeting and babar hugged the old ladies as they had never been hugged before it was almost unbelievable this delight of family life once more to hear their shrill voices with the beloved turkhi accent prattling away about the dear loved ones in kabul was almost too much for him but they bewailed his looks and chattered of old chagatai recipes for deer's broth and mares' milk cheeses till he shut his eyes and tried to believe they were his dearest mother and his revered grandmother at andijan and that he was still king of the valley at the extreme limit of the habitable world and not emperor of all india then he opened them and took in and loved the quaint old fashioned dresses and everything about them that was unlike the gorgeously ugly east which in his heart he loathed but it was his and it would be his son's and his son's son's so there was no more to be said nevertheless the meeting accentuated his dislike to india and he found it necessary to put something into life to make up for its lack of real interest he had taken the title of ghazi or defender of the faith after his victory over rana sanka now he felt that another holy war against the heathen might bring the lacking zest to life it might anyhow but he failed to see it clearly in the crystal bowl which maham had given him he used it chiefly as a divining cup now or rather as a sort of scrying crystal into which he would look and dream dreams but he never saw anything in it save his own thoughts he could not however after his illness summon up sufficient energy to start this holy war that winter and so another hot weather found him still at agra it was his third spent alone in a country he disliked fervently but the gardens he had planted were growing up the flowers he had gathered from far and near were blossoming kabul over the river now bore some faint resemblance to its namesake here he held a grand festival for his veteran soldiers there were not many now who had been with him since as a boy he had wandered over the upland alps at ilak and it was fitting they should be singled out for distinction it was a fine feast indeed babar sat in a small octagonal pavilion on the river bank and before the repast was served sports and games were displayed on an island just opposite here there were fights between furious camels and elephants ram fights and wrestling matches meanwhile the presents were being given vests and rich dresses of honour besides gifts of other value were bestowed while babar always at his best as bountiful entrepreneur had many a smile and jest many a kindly remembrance of past days to give with the other presents then came food hindustan jugglers and acrobats who did surprising tricks besides many dancing girls who performed outlandish dances finally towards evening prayer time a great quantity of gold and silver and copper money was scattered amongst the crowd and there was a precious hubbub and uproar altogether it was like the light hearted old kabul days and babar felt the better for it so the cool setting in once more he started on his holy war against the pagan but though he tried hard to take an interest in it somehow it fell rather flat he was more struck with the beauty of rajputana than with the virtue of exterminating the idolaters who lived there a country where there was abundance of running water small pretty lakes where little spots of rising ground afforded beautiful sites for houses and where the houses in existence were beautiful and capacious of hewn stone wrought with great skill and labour was not a country to devastate so he came back again to work on annexation with the pen instead of by the sword and to receive three more paternal aunts who came crowding to claim his boundless hospitality they however brought sad news from kabul little faruk the son he had never seen was dead there was a piteous letter from maham all blistered with tears the child had never been strong surely god's judgment must be on her that all her children died but he had gone to play with his little brothers and sisters in paradise so there was none left now but humayon whom god preserve humayon who was looking these days for a child of his own god send it were a son not that it would matter much to heartbroken maham and scribbled underneath the flourish of a signature were these words if my lord desireth another son let him take another wife i am accursed babar wept over this postscript more than over the rest of the letter he was very sorry of course but the child was but an abstraction to him while the thought of his dearest dear's grief was bitter indeed he wrote her the most loving of letters begging her not to hurt him by such words even had he not had by her forethought and kindness other sons humayon would have satisfied him humayon was a son of whom anyone might be proud so handsome so courtly so brave and by the same messenger he sent congratulations to the new made father for by this time the news of the birth of a grandson had been brought by special runner to humayon he began whom i remember with such longing to see him again health it also was the most loving of letters thanks be to god he wrote for giving to you a child to me a comfort and an object of love you have called him alaman the protected of god may god protect him and bestow on thee and on me many years made happy by the name and fame of alaman he went on to tell his son gently but firmly that indolence and ease suit but ill with royalty did not the poet say the world is his who gives himself to work inaction is no fellow to ambition in wisdom's eyes all men may find repose save only he who seeks a king's condition and then with a certain pathetic bitterness he told him that for two years he had had no direct news of his son though in the last letter the latter had complained of separation from his friends it is but ill manners in a prince he wrote to complain of this seeing that if one is fettered by situation 'tis ever most dignified to submit to circumstance truly there is no greater bondage than that in which a king is placed and it ill becomes him to grumble at inevitable separations so with perhaps a vague sense of injury he remarked that though humayon had certainly written him letters and that with his own hand he could never have read them over for had you attempted to do so he wrote and the letter is still extant you must have found it absolutely impossible i did indeed contrive to decipher your last but with great difficulty it was excessively crabbed and confused a real riddle in prose then in consequence of the far fetched words you employed the meaning is by no means very intelligible you do not excel i know in letter writing but if in future you would write unaffectedly with clearness using plain words it would cost less trouble both to the writer and the reader babar himself was at the time in a distinctly literary mood for as a demonstration of joy on the birth of humayon's child and the marriage of kamran one of babar's other sons he sent in addition to other lavish presents two copies written in his own babari hand of all the translations and original poems he had composed since coming to india and this was no small task for in his last attack of serious illness he had set himself to translating into verse a religious tract as a curative measure it had not however proved very successful though in his ardour he had composed on an average fifty two couplets a day for he still suffered continually from fever and often from dysentery in fact though he could still swim over the ganges in three and thirty strokes take breath and swim back again in like number he was beginning to realise that life was passing surely by now he had set his foot with sufficient security upon the throne of india to warrant his sending for those dear ones who were never very far from his thoughts and resuming the happy simple family life which suited him best he pondered over this question for some months it meant of course a delay in his own return to kabul but that was inevitable hindustan was not yet sufficiently settled to allow of his absence divided in his mind between intense longing to see his native country again and his ideal of kingly self denial he hesitated until news of discord in the royal clan decided him and he wrote to kwajah kilan the governor at kabul to take instant steps to start the royal family for hindustan his letter told his old friend that the affairs of the country had been reduced to a certain degree of order ere long he hoped to see them completely settled then without losing an instant of time he would set out god willing for his western dominions my solicitude to visit kabul again is boundless and great beyond expression how is it possible indeed that its delights could ever be erased from the heart how is it possible for one like me who have made a vow of abstinence from wine to forget the delicious melons and grapes of that pleasant region very recently some one brought me a single musk melon while cutting it up i felt myself affected by so strong a sense of loneliness and of exile from my beloved country that i could not help shedding tears even as i ate it so after giving minute instructions on various subjects especially as to the planting of trees at a place called the prospect and the sowing of beautiful and sweet smelling flowers and shrubs he went on to detail his own experiences in reconciling himself to the desert of penitence last year my desire and longing for wine and social parties were beyond measure excessive to such an extent indeed that i have caught myself shedding absolute tears of vexation and disappointment for god's sake do not think amiss of me for this in the present year praise be these troubles are over this i ascribe in part to the occupation of my mind in the poetical translation of a tract of which no more at present let me advise you too to adopt a life of abstinence social parties and wine are doubtless pleasant in company with our jolly friends and old boon companions but with whom can you enjoy the social cup truly if you have only shir ahmed and hindai for the companions of your gay hours and the jovial goblet you cannot find any difficulty in abstinence this babar felt was unanswerable so far as he was concerned he knew that drunkenness in the company of blockheads had been no better than sobriety and he was not born to suffer fools gladly after he had taken the irrevocable step and sent for his dearest dear he went out and looked at the stars before settling himself to sleep telling himself that he felt years younger at the very thoughts of seeing them all again after four years four long years they would not have changed of course to him at least they could never change but how about himself he had grown gaunt and grey still at heart he was young aye as young as when he had first bidden the crystal bowl bring him the whole not the half of life well he had had his share and there was canopus hanging in the south all hail soheil chapter vii good old st martini patron of the drunk lo in thy summer thou givest potent draught to warm our cockles ere the world be sunk in winding sheet of snow this is thy craft o cheerful saint to give ere the year dies a euthanasian drink of cloudless skies there was no question as to the youth of the man who on midsummer eve a d was riding post haste from kalpi to agra a distance of close on a hundred miles to meet his wife and children he sat his horses laid out along the sandy sun bitten roads as only a chagatai turkh could do and when he flung himself from his last mount at midnight in the garden of the eighth paradise he had indeed passed beyond the seventh heaven of happiness it seemed simply incredible that before many hours were over he should see maham again maham his moon his more than wife it was no joyous festival to him this eve of st john but surely in some occult fashion the youth of all christendom as it rejoiced with garlands and merry shoutings and dances must have reached him in far india perhaps since there is no limit to such unconscious influences the immemorial festival of summer that has been held since the world began added its quota of perennial life to the vitality that was still ready to leap up at any stimulus certain it is that in this the commencement of this st martin's summer of his life babar needed no pity for spent power he had been delayed by storm and wind and rain only a few days before he had had an awkward experience which might have resulted in serious injury he had been sitting writing in his tent at past midnight when the clouds of the rainy season broke and there was suddenly such a tempest and the wind rose so high that it blew down the pavilion with the screen which surrounded it on his head he had had no time even to gather up his papers and the loose sheets that were written so they all got drenched however with much trouble they were picked up here there everywhere and set to dry in a woollen cloth over which carpets were thrown but he had had to put a jesting postcript to maham's letter to say the blisters were not tears they wrote to each other constantly these two and letters from maham made ever a red letter day in the diary which babar kept but now this was over there would be no more need for writing since she was within a few miles of alighur where god willing he meant to meet her so soon as he had seen that all things were in order for her reception at agra never was there such a fussy host as he showed himself truly nephew babar snorted khadijah his chief paternal aunt when he cavilled at some domestic arrangement in maham's private apartment i am woman and i ought to know if men and especially kings were to do their own work and leave such things to those who understand 'twould be better he looked quite crestfallen so that the fair princess filled with pity nudged him to say that if he sent her the flowers she would see to their being properly placed whereat he was grateful and went off to his beloved gardens to choose what he wanted not roses or marigolds those were familiar he must show his dearest dear and little gulbadan too who was to come with this advance party the beauties of hindustan they must be shown that there were some beauties so he picked the red oleander he had found in the old gardens at gwalior and the snowy gardenia then for scent there was the sweet pandanus but his favourite of all the scarlet hibiscus could not be gathered till the very last as it withered so soon in a single hour its beauty would have gone and maham must see how cunningly the thing like a heart showed in the very middle of the broad flower she must see the marvellous colour deeper richer more beautiful than the pomegranate then there were endless orders to give about fountains and fireworks and food for everything of good in hindustan must be laid at maham's feet the moment she arrived after this there were papers to be signed and letters to be sent out to various governors for babar had been many months away from his capital on a campaign in bengal still if maham kept to her programme he would have plenty of time for the fifty odd miles to alighar if he rode fast and she could hardly be due there for another twenty four hours but he had reckoned without the loving heart on the other side maham as eager as he for the joyful meeting had pushed on and reaching alighar had left little eight year old gulbadan to follow at leisure in charge of her nurse and had come on straight post haste to agra your majesty faltered a breathless messenger rushing into the presence unceremoniously all agra was on the qui vive and this was no time for the delay of etiquette her highness is on the road four miles out i have just passed her babar stood up dazed maham to fling his pen aside and start was instant no time for a horse not even for shoes as he was bareheaded in his slipper shoon he was out in the dust under the stars he ran and with god only knows what star drift and dust atoms in his brain earth there might have been but of a surety there was heaven also canopus of victory shone to the south the warrior perchance showed to the north but he saw neither venus shone like a young moon but cast no shadow on his path and down the straight dusty road came a litter jingling as it jolted he laughed aloud in his joy as he sprinted the last few yards maham maham for the rest what does it matter let those two keep it to themselves for all time and eternity my lord let me descend and walk too faltered maham after a bit but he shook his head lightly nay my moon that would delay us and thou must get home home god what delight now then ye bearers a good foot first or the king will do gangleader and make the pace his joyous threat roused instant laugh and with a will the tired men set off at an amble chanting in time to their steps at every minute nobles apprised of the unexpected arrival came galloping up to fall into the tail of the little procession after vain efforts to make the emperor take their horses but babar would none of them he wanted to hold his wife's hand as he strode beside her and hear her sweet familiar voice saying yea and nay to the torrent of his words they crossed the river and were in hesht bishist that is all there is to say that is all we know except that ere the blessed night was over babar wrote in his diary sunday at midnight i met maham again it was an odd coincidence that she and i left to meet each other on the very same day after all there is no need for more one can imagine babar translucently boyishly content one can imagine how fear at his altered looks gripped at his more than wife's heart bringing with it a passionate determination to stand between him and needless worry there was no chance of that for the present anyhow all was pleasure and delight early in the morning little gulbadan arrived in charge of the wazir and his wife who had been sent out to meet her they came across her close to the little garden and the child being hungry they spread a carpet and gave her a hasty breakfast there are many dishes remarked the little lady superbly and afterwards described the meal as having been drawn out to fifty roast sheep bread sherbet and much fruit for the dainty child of eight had inherited much of her father's gift of words she was rather small for her age and extraordinarily self possessed with a vast discrimination in etiquette also as befitted a royal or rather imperial princess there is no need to rise for her said the wazir hastily when his wife entered and little gulbadan would have saluted her she is but your old serving woman this however did not suit the little lady who had also her father's gracious manners and all the while she was bursting with impatience to see the man who her little life long had been held up to her as a model of all that was good and kind and brave five years is a long time when one can but count eight in all and the child's recollection only carried her back vaguely to someone very tall and straight who used to hold her close so that she could feel something beating inside was it her father's heart or her own that was not likely any more for she was quite a big girl and her hair was plaited in virginal fashion besides she had all her little bowings and genuflections ready she rehearsed them gravely in the litter as she went along to pay her respectful duty to royalty but after all they did not come into the meeting she had not even time to fall at the emperor's feet for in an instant he had her in his arms and then as she told maham afterwards in the seclusion of the women's apartments this little insignificant personage felt such happiness that greater could not be imagined maham laughed truly thou art a quaint little marionette gulbadan and what dost think of thy father the little maiden pursed up her lips and sat quiet for a minute then she said firmly i think he is too beautiful to put into words her father however did not share her opinion in regard to her looks he was never weary of praising them and it was a pretty sight to see him holding her by the hand as he took her round to inspect all his new buildings and gardens and nothing would serve him but that they must go out both of them and see dholpur which in a vague way might remind them of beloved kabul and from dholpur they went to sikri where they spent a happy month rowing about in the big tank here little gulbadan used to sit for hours at her father's feet while he wrote up his memoirs in the summer house of the great garden lo little mouse he would say looking round to lay a kindly hand on her smooth head mayhap thou mayest write a book thyself some day thou hast more brains than thy brothers and he sighed for of late humayon had not been very satisfactory nor for the matter of that were kamran and askari his other two grown up sons exactly after his own heart gulbadan shook her head gravely the emperor speaks in ignorance of my brother alwar she said not without hauteur but when my mother her highness dildar begum arrives next week the emperor will admit that his son is a rarity of the world and a unique of the age her dignity was supreme and babar laughed nicer than hindal gullu he asked knowing her preference for the boy who had been brought up with her under maham's care the child flushed up visibly and tears stood in her eyes lo she said hindal is indeed my brother mayhap he is not clever but i love him i love him the emperor caught her in his arms and kissed her tears so do i sweetheart so does everybody lo i dare swear it we all love each other do we not in truth it seemed like it babar's three wives were there after a time and yet none of them quarrelled perhaps because no one in the wide world could have quarrelled with childless mubarika the blessed damozel and dildar was too much occupied with little alwar to think of anything else he was indeed a marvellous child of extraordinary beauty and brains one of those children over whom old folk shake their heads and say he is not long for this world though barely six he was as his little sister had said a unique of the age and babar who had not seen him since he was a baby in arms was almost pathetically proud of him his devotion indeed raised a suspicion of jealousy even in maham's generous heart for her own son humayon and one evening as the husband and wife were sitting together in the open balcony of the palace she hinted that humayon might have to play second fiddle in his father's graces babar came over to her and laid his head it was fast grizzling on her lap in the old affectionate turkhi fashion little mother he said and there was a break in his voice say not stupidities lo thou knowest as i do that life became doubly dear to me when thou didst lay my first born son in my arms thou knowest that i have done all these things these many things for him my heir there was a faint stir at the door and babar turned to look then with a bound he was on his feet humayon he cried joyously humayon himself look little mother thy son thy son and humayon it was unsent for unexpected but welcome as roses in may the emperor had not the heart to chide him for leaving his governorship since his presence made the loving hearts of those two open like rosebuds their eyes shine like torches never was such merry making as they had that night it was babar's rule to keep open table every day but on this occasion he gave a spread feast and heaped every kind of distinction upon his handsome son and in truth he deserved it for his manners and his conversation had an inexpressible charm he realised absolutely the ideal of perfect manhood so at least his parents agreed as after the state dinner was over they sat a family party in the gold scattering garden there was a little tank there cut out of solid red rock which in his unregenerate days babar had intended to fill with red wine it was now brimming in honour of this happy meeting of so many with lemonade and they sat and quaffed it by gobletfuls contentedly and alwar recited his set pieces and gulbadan did a stately turkhi measure and nothing would serve maham but that my lord should sing her his latest love song she had not heard him sing for years and though he had sent her and his sons plenty of didactic and pious songs of his composition and translation he had included no love songs and he had had such an excellent touch with them in the old old days whereat dildar giggled faintly till dearest one who tall pale a childless widow now had also come to see her brother said softly aye it was given him by the good god who sends love as his best gift to the world yea sing to us of love brotherling so he took the lute and sang sweetly enough though his voice had lost its youthful ring ah would i were the morning wind to braid her scented hair ah would i were the noonday sun to kiss her cheek so fair ah would i were the lamp at eve where she her court doth keep ah would i were the happy moon to watch her in her sleep my heart is like a famished wolf that licks the frozen snow the while it tracks its quarry far wherever it may go from morn till night i follow her but she no word doth deign oh ice chill maid for pity's sake give me at least disdain wind make each scented tress unbind sun set her life blood free lamp make her weary for true love moon bring her dreams of me 'tis only a translation he said thoughtfully but i like it 'tis so simple and then his mind drifted away to that spring morning among the flowers on the high alps at ilak when he had wondered at the look in dearest one's eyes and his hand went out to seek hers and found it so they sat there hand in hand like children for a space and a great weariness of the uselessness of life came to babar lo he said suddenly i will make over my kingdom to thee humayon thou art young i grow old and i am tired of ruling and reigning a garden and those i love what more can any man desire he spoke half in earnest half in jest maham turned pale dildar and the paternal aunts and khanums by this time there were ninety six in all cracked their thumbs and even dearest one shook her head and said quickly may god keep you in his peace upon the throne for many many years but the blessed damozel who always sat a little apart only smiled my lord means the garden of the eighth heaven she put in quickly yea there is peace there and rest for everybody my lady says sooth acquiesced babar and their grave eyes met but little gulbadan was agog because it was time the fireworks began or nanacha would be sending her to bed so the idea of abdication ended in babar's catching her up in his arms and carrying her off to see how the wheels turned round then alwar while dildar gave little shrieks of horror in which she was joined in louder echo by the astonishingly beautiful princess who invariably wept and laughed to order actually set fire himself to a bomb and when it exploded clapped his hands with glee when i am a big man like my father the emperor he said boastfully i will fire ten guns at a time 'tis silly to say such things retorted madam gulbadan superbly but the child's keen little face was not in the least abashed lo sister 'tis silly of thee to say no when thou canst not tell where i shall be as grown man likely in some bigger place than this and he waved his hand contemptuously towards babar's great palaces whereat they all laughed for they were a merry happy party so they feasted and enjoyed themselves as little gulbadan wrote in after years it was like the day of resurrection chapter viii death stood among my flowers his bright wings furled this bud i take with me to that still world where no wind blows where sunshine does not fade yon open rose is yours he gently said but i refused he smiled and shook his head so empty handed back to heaven sped and lo by sun scorch and the wild wind shorn ere eve my bud my blossom both were gone humayon remained with his father for a week or two handsome insouciant always agreeable and of a curious dignity of carriage he seemed cut out to be a king wherever he went no matter in what society he might be even his father's the eye rested on him with pleasure and yet babar's eyes fond as they were failed to see something he fain would have seen there seemed no sense of responsibility such as he babar had had at his years yet it was hardly fair to judge the lad by the standard of one who had perforce been thrust into power at eleven years of age and after all humayon was barely two and twenty still quite a lad there was time yet so weary as he was babar said no more about abdicating he even tried to think no more about a plan he had cherished of going back for the next hot weather to kabul and leaving humayon in charge of hindustan my kabul as he ever called it saying to his sons in jesting earnest let none of you covet it for i will not give it it is mine own my very own the only thing in god's earth i care to keep for there he gave me happiness still he was happy enough as it was in hindustan and thanks to maham's good care felt more himself but like all women she was a trifle fussy lo my lord she said one extremely hot friday when a dust storm was blowing and babar despite this was preparing for his weekly visit to his paternal aunts a duty he had never once neglected when in agra for three whole years how would it be if you did not go this one friday the begums could not be vexed seeing how good you are to them goodness she thought privately was a mild word considering that each and all of the ninety six female relations had palaces and gardens assigned to them and that the court architect had standing orders to give precedence to whatever work even if it were on a great scale the ladies desired to have done and to carry it through with all might and main but the bare suggestion hurt the emperor's affectionate heart maham he said in pained astonishment it is not like you to say such thoughtless things think a moment they are the daughters of my fathers deprived by god of their parents therefore being female they are helpless i am the head of the family if i do not cheer them who will maham could not forbear a smile no one in truth but babar beloved kindly babar would think twice about a pack of old women and she would not change him for worlds so despite her anxiety for his health she said no more all that winter they were an extraordinarily happy family party humayon had been sent as governor to an up country province and not back to badakhshan where he and his half brother kamran had almost come to blows and family quarrels were in the emperor's opinion positively indecent besides being so unnecessary since there were always plenty of outsiders with whom to have a fine fight then the news from bengal where the success of his arms was being assured was satisfactory babar did not mind beating the down country pagans it was different in rajputana where you had to kill real men but even there peace was coming fast for few brave soldiers could withstand babar's frankly outstretched hand of friendship and he asked for so little in return he took no money no land he only claimed suzerainty and it was much to have a strong man as final referee then babar's friend tardi beg came back to him not as soldier but in the darvesh's peaked cap and white blanket frock however he came he was welcome especially to mistress gulbadan who appropriated him wholesale they were a quaint pair as hand in hand they inspected the gardens and the stables and all the ins and outs of the royal household for the little lady had great ideas of management and babar would follow as often as not with alwar who was but a weakling in body perched on his broad shoulder the four children as maham would call them as they played at ball together in the marble alleys tardi beg with his cap off his shaven head glittering to match little gulbadam's tinsel and jewellery alwar a miniature of the emperor even to the tiny heron's plume in his bonnet babar his haggard face beaming the men enjoyed themselves quite as much as the children and if babar accused his friend of chucking easy ones to gulbadan tardi beg asserted that alwar never got a hard one whereat the little lad wept but his sister stamped her foot and said she wouldn't play any more unless they played fair a remark that of course brought the immediate capitulation of tardi beg and babar illustration the four children as maham would call them yes they were very happy very guileless very innocent as babar himself had written so often over less commendable amusements and then suddenly came a bolt out of the blue alwar little alwar to whom every day seemed to bring some new charm of unbelievable intellect beyond his years fell sick from the very first he lay quiet exhausted spent but smiling it was a trick he learnt of his father so after two or three days he died his hot thin little hand in that father's it was as if the sun had gone out of the sky to the whole household even the blessed damozel shed slow tears as she wreathed the dead darling in drifts of scented gardenias and put a scarlet slipper blossom with its quaint something like a heart upon the breast babar placing the light corpse in the niche cut for it in the flower filled grave felt as if it were his own heart he were burying but it was darvesh tardi beg who recited the committal prayer and that gave him comfort besides he was a man and the women had to be sustained the poor mother dildar begum was literally frantic with grief doubtless she said the child had been poisoned because its father loved it so doubtless in her mad despair she accused maham of doing the deed polygamy is a fair weather craft it is apt to fail in a storm but the poor soul was mad everyone saw that and the women took it more quietly than the man even blur eyed half silly astonishingly beautiful princess nodded her head and remarked sagely they say that sort of thing always in grief time nephew so why fuss about it she will forget it after a time and ak begum came with her bright squirrel eyes all soft with tears to babar and whispered we all know it is not true nephew our lady is god's kindness itself so why fret but it did fret the man and added a bitterness to his grief which even maham could not sweeten if my lord will listen to this slave said the blessed damozel at last it will be better to beguile the poor distraught one by change of scene lo the lotus must be out in the dholpur lakes why not go there for awhile good rain has fallen it is cooler now so they all went sailing down the river jumna in tented boats far and near the wide level plain was tinted green with fresh spring grass the parch of an indian summer was over this was the indian spring with magical marvellous quickness the flowering trees burst into blossom the persian roses budded in a single night and down amongst their grey green velvet leaves you could positively hear the calyx burst as the scented petals struggled to the sun the climbing gardenias hung like white scarves round the dark cypresses the hedges of babar's favourite slipper flower were ablaze with their great flat scarlet circles yes it was spring so as they journeyed the sad little party became more cheerful the women especially had begun to talk of their departed darling as one of god's angels even his mother had sobered down to copious tears and pathetic requests that she might be given back her other son hindal whom maham certainly had taken from her as a baby let her have the boy my lord said maham pitifully lo it is but fair she should have one son and i have humayon so babar blessed her for her kind heart and sent off a special messenger to kabul for hindal a boy of nigh ten years old who had been left behind with his tutor to complete his education the emperor felt happier when this was done perhaps because in his kind heart of hearts he had never been quite sure of the righteousness of giving hindal over to another woman it was the only action of his in regard to his womenkind which he could not have conscientiously upheld against all comers at the bar of his own judgment it was great gain therefore to find his dearest dear of a mind with himself for all that he felt as strong men so often do when limited by feminine outlook rather battered and worn in no fit state therefore for the bad news which came to him by special runner as he sat by the water lily tank at dholpur humayon wrote the court physician in delhi was very ill of fever it would be best if his mother were to come at once as the prince was much prostrated humayon first alwar his youngest then his eldest son was he to lose them both babar was in his essence very man trouble came to him overwhelmingly he might face it bravely but he always faced the worst it was humayon bested in his fight for life that he saw whereas maham with the eternal hopefulness of woman which springs from her eternal motherhood would not let herself even think of defeat upset as she was by the dreadful news she yet spoke quietly of how she would bring her invalid son back and how his father had best return to agra and have everything ready to receive their darling i would fain come too dear heart said babar pitifully but maham would not hear of it even so much would be to admit danger and there was none there could be none nathless let urgent orders be sent along the route so that there should not be an instant's delay she was quite calm and collected to him but she broke down a little to the blessed damozel who somehow or another why folk never knew was ever the recipient of confidences thou wilt look after him lady she said quite tearfully and see that he wearies himself not with over anxiety all shall be as if thou wast here sister so far as in me lies was the quiet reply and maham was satisfied what mubarika begum said she would do would be done maham knew that for she knew what babar did not that mubarika's life had been one long self denial years and years younger than her husband she had left a young lover behind her in her father's palace when she had come as a bride to make peace between her clan and the king of kabul she had chosen her part she had respected and admired in a way she had loved babar but passionate romance had never clouded her eyes yea i will guard him as thou wouldst she said again and mayhap in thy absence and with this common grief and anxiety to soften memory dildar also will learn how good how kind thou art thou star of the emperor's life but even mubarika so calm so gracious so tactful could not prevent the mental strain from telling on babar's bodily health prolonged anxiety great grief had always prostrated him for a time even as a young man and now illness and hard work had aged him before his years would to god he could but drink a bit he need not get drunk wailed tardi beg who being tainted with sufi doctrines would orate for hours concerning cups divine and ruby wines but babar had never broken a promise in his life and was not going to begin now besides maham had been right humayon was brought to agra alive that was much in the first fulness of his joy at seeing his son once more babar almost forgot anxiety he will soon be well dear heart he said cheerfully he does not look so very bad when the fever leaves him but it was maham's turn to be despondent it does not leave him she said that was true as yet the crisis had not come and it was long in coming day after day he grew weaker day after day the brain weary of fighting at long odds for life grew more and more drowsy my sisters i want to see my sisters would come the low muttering voice reft of almost all its youth its tone and those three gulchihra gulrang and gulbadan rose face rose blush rose body babar's three rose named daughters would creep in with tears and kiss him a pathetic little picture the girlish faces all blurred with tears the tinkling of bracelets jewelled earrings head ornaments what not the rustling of scent sodden silks and satins and that poor head on the pillow turning from side to side rhythmically restless even babar himself had to see after a while that the shadow of death lay on his son maham he said pitifully the boy the boy poor mother for nigh on four and twenty years she had been this man's stay and stand by he had come to her consoling arms as a child comes to its mother she had given him in passionate devotion more than he perhaps realised for they had been faithful friends always and the friendship had overlaid the love but she failed him now for she was at the end of her tether so she stood dry eyed almost cold why should my lord grieve she said because of my son there is no necessity he is king he has other sons i have but this one therefore i grieve for a second babar stood as if turned to stone then he answered almost sternly maham thou knowest that i love humayon as i love no other son of mine because he is son of the woman i love best thou knowest that i have sought and laboured for kingship for him and for him only thou knowest softness had crept back to his voice nay what need to tell thee since thou knowest that there is nothing in the wide world i would not do for humayon thou canst do nothing there is naught to be done she muttered still tearless calm and something in her pitiful despair roused instant response in his ever ready vitality and he threw back his head with a gesture of negation there is naught i would not dare anyhow he said and what is dared is often done take heart my moon all is not lost defeat comes not till death who was it said that long years ago aye defeat comes not till death and even then god knows he knows he knows chapter ix death makes no conquest of this conqueror for now he lives in fame then there is no hope to save death said babar sternly he stood his face blanched amongst a group of court physicians professional prayer makers astrologers sorcerers frail reeds at which anxiety caught distractedly in its despair and they were all silent save a priest who mumbled of god's goodness prayer remained said the unctuous voice but that strong human heart was almost past petitions it craved something more tangible is there naught to be given naught that i could do to make god listen from his high heaven naught that would mayhap soften his hard heart he asked sharply he was thinking of a ransom many a soldier had had to offer one he himself had given a dear one once some of those who heard looked at each other this death to them meant little but here was an opportunity for personal gain that could do no harm to anyone so they whispered among themselves and greed grew to some of the faces that encircled the man to whose face it had never come once in all his life for babar had been giver not taker he had lavished all things on his world he had been spendthrift even in forgiveness is there naught gentlemen he asked drearily then the chief preacher spoke it hath been written and is indeed approved that in such times of stress some supreme sacrifice to the most high may be effectual but it must be supreme put in a coarse faced reader of the stars his mind busy with money a small gift will not suffice aye added another voice look you it must be the most precious possession of a man that which he holds dearest in this case i would suggest but babar who was standing his back to the light held up his hand for silence then i give my life he said quietly but his voice rang strong and firm for he had come straight from his interview with maham and her words had roused every atom of his marvellous vitality yea i give my life for sure there is naught that a man can hold more precious absolute surprise kept his hearers silent for a moment the very suggestion in one so instinct with life made it incredible then dismay came to some faces disappointment to others your majesty began his faithful servant the wazir swiftly our emperor's life is too precious naught is too precious friend to save humayon came the equally swift reply yea the wazir is right palpitated one who saw money slipping through his fingers some lesser thing yet still supreme might be found what of the great diamond no stone can outweigh my son's life no i offer myself to god it is all i have the strong voice rang firmer than ever but the offering must be dear to both parties put in a pompous voice and since by the generosity of the emperor the diamond in question whose value represents they say one day's revenue of the habitable world was bestowed upon the prince humayon it fits in double manner the circumstances babar turned in quick reproof and scorn to the speaker knowest thou so little of love friend lo i am dearer to my son than many diamonds could he speak now babar's voice almost broke he would say 'i am not worth the price of thy life my father for it is all the world to me' but he cannot speak he is in the grip of death so i have my say and he flung out his right arm as he had been used to fling it out when leading on his soldiers to some desperate charge come gentlemen he said command in every word let us lose no more time it is precious i will give my all may god be merciful the sick room was hushed humayon lay motionless unconscious on a low bed set in the middle of the bare spacious corridor a physician sat to one side holding his patient's wrist so appraising minute by minute the fluttering battle between life and death on the other side knelt the poor mother all unveiled for they had sent for her thinking the supreme moment was at hand and she had no thought for anything save her dying son her right hand was stretched out in helpless appeal over the loved form which seemed to take up so little room amongst the quilts but her left hand was held fast consolingly under the folds of a white veil which shrouded another female figure close behind her for mubarika begum the blessed damozel was ever to the fore in sickness or in trouble but babar did not notice either of them he stepped swiftly to the head of the bed and stood looking down on the face of his dying son almost it seemed as if he were too late as if life had already unfolded her wings and fled then with eyes literally blazing with inward fire he stretched out his hands trembling with nervous strain and began his prayer of intercession o god most high if a life may be exchanged for a life and they tell me it is so then i who am babar give mine for his who is humayon let my strength bear his weakness husband no no not that moaned maham awakened to a sense of what was passing but the figure behind her bent forward and whispered in her ear let be sister canst not see that god's mist clouds his brain from this world lo maham both thy dear ones stand before the throne let god decide and with a low sob maham fell on her outstretched arms she said no more she felt nothing save that cool tightening clasp of sisterhood upon her hand the hot sunshine streamed in upon the floor the distant sounds of life outside were dulled to a low murmur as of bees and on it came softly hurried steps as babar with clasped hands circumambulated the bed solemnly that he knew was the ritual of sacrifice round and round patiently his voice rising above the low sobbing of a faithful friend or two on me kind god be all his suffering may all my strength be his i gave him life once most clement let me give it to him again let my strength be his weakness his weakness my strength over and over again over and over the fire dying out of the man's eyes with the nervous strain until his very steps hesitated on me be his suffering on me on me then suddenly through the room thrilling every soul in it a woman's sobbing ghost of a shriek he moved his hand moved i felt it babar swayed towards the voice i have prevailed he muttered i have borne it away threw up his arms blindly staggered and fell in a dead faint on to sobbing tardi beg's breast the rest crowded round awestruck curious he is dead god hath accepted the sacrifice they said the face of babar's best friend worked of that who could say but for the present it was not true not he he cried roughly give him air 'tis but the strain on him and what that has been all these years fools do not know here slaves carry him to his chamber nay madam mother there is no cause for anxiety h'st no noise you there lest you disturb the prince who in good sooth seems coming to himself and it was true the nameless change which comes to a fever face when the crisis is passing showed clear upon humayon's her royal highness had best stay with the invalid went on tardi beg i can attend the emperor in this passing indisposition but a veiled white figure rose quietly i go with his imperial majesty said mubarika begum there is no fear sister as the gentleman says it is but a fainting fit the emperor hath been over anxious so when babar came to himself which he did rapidly he found the blessed damozel bending over him my son he asked faintly the prince is better she replied the fever hath gone he will recover babar gave a sigh of relief and turned his face to the wall possibly the strain had been too much for him coming as it did after long years of steady hard work perhaps he had worn himself out with sheer restless energy doubtless those ten years of drink possibly even the four of total abstinence had something to say to this premature break down for in years he was but forty eight yet deny it as they would it was soon evident to all that he had lived through the tale of heart beats allotted to him by fate humayon with the speed of youth recovered and came to his father's bedside but babar never rose again perhaps he would not have done so if he could for he had a made a promise he had given his life to god in exchange for his son's and there was an end of it but he was quite cheerful only to two people did he speak openly of coming death one was tardi beg who stayed with him night and day to him he spoke lightly almost jestingly of his long desire to follow his example and become a darvesh for years aye three years i have desired to make over the throne to humayon and retire to the gold scattering garden what gay times we have had there friend with the flowers and the birds and the children and our own wits now shall i retire to paradise and god send it be as innocent as guileless and to mubarika he talked of his beloved kabul and his mother's grave lo thou shalt lay me there lady for the others have children and thou dost love thy kabul also then he lay and looked at her with kindly questioning eyes until he said it hath come to me at times that i did thee a wrong in taking thee a young girl from thy tribe say is it so i would have the truth then she spoke softly yea it is so zahir ud din mahomed babar emperor of india yet was the wrong righted long ago by sacrifice comes life and my people have lived in peace as we have he said half appealingly she laid the hand she held on her forehead as we have my lord but there was one other wrong about which he was not so satisfied before death came he wanted to restore hindal to his mother and hindal did not come he had started from kabul but had been delayed by marriages in his tutor's family i must see him complained his father write and bid him come at once i need him sorely it was the one bitter drop in the cup which he drank contentedly smilingly he held an audience every day laughing and joking with his old friends over past times and when evening came he would sit with some woman's hand in his and talk of little things sometimes it was his most reverend of paternal aunts sometimes it was even poor astonishingly beautiful princess and little ak begum brought him posies of violets or best of all dearest one would sit her hand in his and both would be unable to say anything because their thoughts reached so very very far back and there was always a joke when maham gave him his medicine in the crystal bowl of life it had found its proper use at last he said for this it was neither too big nor too small so the days slipped by why does not hindal come where is he he said fretfully one evening and they told him that the boy had reached delhi and would be with him in a day or two who brought the news he asked and when they said it was the tutor's son who had come on in hot haste to re assure the emperor he bid them bring the messenger up and a tall half grown lad appeared thy name asked babar faintly mir bardi replied the youth the dying man laughed his old boyish laugh master full of fun he translated a good name for the companion of my son say how tall hath hindal grown the lad hesitated lo i wear a coat the prince bestowed on his servant the most clement can judge by that i cannot see murmured the sick man impatiently come hither boy that i may feel how tall my son hath grown so with fluttering fingers the hand that had once been so strong felt the brocaded coat it is well he said at last but i would that i had seen him i wanted to give him back to his mother myself all christmas day he lay but half conscious baisanghar he said faintly when dearest one leant over to kiss him and when maham begged him with tears to drink his medicine he did so with a smile then thrust the cup into her bosom and whispered lie there friend and bring her comfort towards evening he roused and sent for his nobles and for humayon to you i leave my son he said fail not in loyalty to him and to you my son i commit my kingdom and my people and my kinsfolk fail not in loyalty to them after that he lay silent with wide open smiling eyes that was his farewell to splendid life night was passing to dawn when the end came black fell the day for children and kinsfolk and all they bewailed and they lamented voices were uplifted in weeping there was utter dejection each passed that ill fated day in a hidden corner on a hill side above the town of kabul there lies a garden planted long years ago by a man who loved his world thither a new world comes to make holiday the man himself has gone as the white marble slab that looks up into the cloudless sky says shortly heaven is the eternal home of the emperor babar but his spirit remains in the endless spring of leaf and flower in the happy vitality of the children who still lay flowers to cover the words of hope the end
