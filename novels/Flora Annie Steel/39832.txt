swimmers the fakeers drum at her beck and call music hath charms shubrat i the churchgong hung from the level branch of a spreading sirus tree whence the slight breeze of dawn rustling the dry pods of a past summer and stirring the large soft puffblossoms of the present seemed to gather up a faint whisper and a fainter perfume to be upborne into spacefurther and further and furtherby the swelling soundwaves of the gong as it vibrated to old deen mahomeds skilful stroke more like a funeral knell this calling the dead to forgetfulness than a cheerful summons of the living to give thanks for life for creation and preservation you could hear each mellow note quiver into silence beforeloud and full with a sort of hollow boomthe great disc of bronze shook once more to its own resounding noise seeming in its agitation to feel the strangeness of the task more than the striker though to say sooth few things in earth or heaven were more incongruous than this church chime and the man who rang it for deen mahomed as his name implies was of the faith of islam fiercefeatured hawkeyed with the nameless look of his race a look suiting the curved sword he wore in virtue of his office as watchman better than the brass badge slung over his shoulder proclaiming him to be a member of the indian church establishmentthat alien church in an alien land and yet the old mans figure fitted close with the building he guarded for despite the new title of st johnsinthewilderness the church remained outwardly what it had been built to bea mahomedan tomb its white dome and corner cupolas rose familiarly into the blue sky beyond the sirus trees where even at this early hour a hint of coming heat was to be seen in a certain pallidness and hardness within beneath that central dome encircled now by pious christian texts lay buried a champion of another god whose name interlaced into a thousand delicate traceries still formed the decoration of each architrave each screen lay buried let us hope beyond sight or sound of what went on above his helplessness how this change had come about is of no moment to the story such things have been nay are in india seeming in truth more fantastic when set down in pen and ink than they do when seen in the warm clasp of that indian sunlight which shines down indifferently on so many a strange anomaly of caste and creed and custom most likely when the wave of evangelical fervour reached the east to prepare the way for the great sacrifice of purification by blood and fire which came to native and alien alike in the horrors and wonders of fiftyseven some pious bureaucrat had felt a certain militant satisfaction in handing over a heathen edifice to christian uses such things have their sentimental side and this tomb had beenlike many anothercrown property and so had become ours by right of conquest no one else at any rate had laid claim to it except in some vague mysterious way old deen mahomed and he only to its guardianship as being the dust of the feet of the descendants of huzrutameerullamoomeereenullimoortaza the holy in other words an inheritor of the saints in light now this sort of title is one not likely to find favour in alien eyes despite this deen mahomed remained guardian of the church of st johnsinthewilderness thanks to that ineradicable senseone may almost say common senseof justice which dies hard in the englishman of all creeds the only difference to the old manat least so the authorities assumedbeing that he wore a sword a badge chimed the churchgong and received the munificent sum of five rupees a month for performing these trivial duties which latter fact naturally put the very idea of discontent beyond the pale of practical politics apparently deen mahomed was of this opinion also at least he never hinted at objection even now as he stood unmovable save for one slowly swinging arm there was neither dislike nor approval on the fierce yet indifferent face looking out at the white glare of the tomb beyond the sirus shade at the worshippersladen with bibles and prayerbookspassing up the steps crossing the plinth and so disappearing within and at the long line of vehiclesfrom the commissioners barouche to the clerks palkiseeking the shade to await their owners return when the service should be over not so wearisome a task as might be imagined since the big bazaar was near for refreshment or recreation so near in fact that any solemn pause was apt to give prominence to the twanging of unmentionable sutaras or bursts of unmistakable laughter for as illluck would have it not only the bazaar but the very worst quarter of it lay just behind the fringe of date palms which gave such local colour to the sketches of the church which the chaplains wife drew for their friends at home and yet in a way this close propinquity to the atrocious evils of heathendom had its charm for the little colony of the elect who lived beside the chaplain in the still evenings when the scent of the oranges which were blossoming madly in the watered gardens round the houses filled the air the inhabitants would sit out among the fastfading english flowers and shake their heads in sorrowful yet satisfied sympathy with their own position as exiles in that invisible sodom and gomorrah invisible because st johnsinthewilderness rose between them and it shutting out everything save the impartial sky whence the sunshine poured down alike on christian and heathen just and unjust thus the visible church was to them as the invisible one a veil between them and the people it was a square building recessed and buttressed to a hexagon the chaplain however preferred to call it a st andrews cross and perhaps he was right perhaps again deen mahomed and his cult had really had as little to say to its form as the chaplain such responsibility being reserved to the primeval sraddha or fourpointed deathoffering be that as it may there was a coolness between the new parson and his watchman owing to the former declaring it to be a scandal that the latter should hold such office in a christian place of worship when he was not even an inquirer certainly he was not he neither inquired of others nor tolerated inquiry from them he slept on the plinth of nights chimed the gong by day and kept the rest of his life to himself that was all not one of the congregation filing into the church that morning knew more of him than this so he stood indifferently waiting for the first note of the harmonium to tell him his task was over listening for it to pulsate out into the sunshine and blending with the last note of the gong go forth upon the endless waves of ether go forth handinhand plaintiff and defendant a quaint couple seeking extinction or perhaps the great white throne against which the ripple of life beats in vain the note came this morning as on other mornings and deen mahomed turned indifferent as ever to his house it was a mud and thatch hovel clinging to one side of a miniature tomb half in ruins which some follower of the saint had built within the shadow of his masters grave it stood just opposite the flight of steps up which a late worshipper or two was hurrying glad even at that early hour to escape from the glare of sunlight yet on the warm dust before the hovel a child of four or five sat contentedly making a garden while the coachman of a smart barouche and pair drawn up close by looked down with interest on the process twas god almighty says bacon who first planted a garden but ever since the task has had a strange charm for man and even deen mahomed paused with a smile for the little watered plots and pretended paths thou hast encroached on thy neighbours land today rahmut he said and gone into the roadway lo the sirkar will make thee pay revenue little robber trust them for that put in the coachman quickly then he chuckled but the boy grows yea he grows to take his fathers place the old man frowned yet laid his hand gently on the childs head as he said evasively have a care rahmut whilst i am gone and water thy rose or twill die in this heat he pointed to a drooping white rosebud which the little boy had stuck in his centre bed ay replied the coachman tis hot indeed for the time of year as hot a shubrat as i remember god send the night be cool and bring peace god send it may echoed the coachman piously his evillooking face showing the worse for his unction god send all get their deserts on this the great night of record he made the remark without a quiver oblivious apparently of a long series of petty thefts against his masters grain and many another peccadillo of the past year but then though every faithful mahomedan believes that on shubrat god comes to earth with all the saints in glory there in the presence of the dead to write his record for the coming year upon the foreheads of the living things had a knack of going on after this judgment much as they did before especially in regard to such trivial offences as the theft of grain from a horse god send they may reechoed the old man suddenly fiercely the words seemed to cut like a knife yet once more he laid his hand upon the childs head almost in caress have a care child for thy self and thy rose thou didst not pick it sure from the sahibs garden he added hastily rahmut threw up a handful of dry dust and spread his little skinny arms in gay denial lo nana what a thought i begged it of the padres baba he comes ever to the assemblage with flowers and the white mem his mother bade him give it to me and that tooshe brought it in her bag of books he pointed with pride to some strips of torn white paper stuck in the sand as walls to the garden then his tone changed to tears oh nana nana thou hast spoilt itthou hast spoilt it for the old man in sudden fury had swept the remains of the offending tract from their foundations crushed them to a ball and flung it across the sunshiny roadway to the plinth where it skimmed along the smooth surface to roll finally to the very door of the church no tears childno tears i say came in a fierce order if thou wouldst not have me beat thee no tears thou shalt not even play with such things thou shalt not touch them i the dust from the feet of the saints say it so leaving the child whimpering he turned to the hovel muttering to himself rujjub the coachman nodded to the next on the rank the elephant escaped through the door and his tail stuck in the keyhole he said with a sneer meean fakeerji will not have his grandson touch the ungeel evangel and chimes the churchgong himself but in truth he loves the old tombgod smite those who defile itas he loves the boy god smite those who sent the boys father over the black water to fight the infidel in china lo even jehad holy war is accursed with such leaders bah rujjub retorted his fellow cheerfully tis so sometimes without fault he climbed the camel to get out of the way and still the dog bit him say the wise the meean is halfcrazed all know that and as for thee did thy master pay as fair as mine we should have less zeal from some folk should we not brothers a fist full of rupees brings peace since there is no clapping with one palm a chuckle ran round the squatting grooms at this homethrust at rujjub the grumblerrujjub the agitator the sweet high voices of english women singing a missionary hymn came floating out through the open doors a hovering kite far in the blue swooped suddenly startling the green and gold parrotsinlaid like a mosaic pattern on the white dometo screaming flight for shelter towards the sirus trees little rahmut forgetting his tears built fresh walls of sand to his garden and watered the fading rosebud anew then a sort of murmurous silence born of the measured cadence of one voice from within and the lazy listless gossiping without settled down over the glare and the shade only from the hut came no sound at all no sound even from the little tomb where the old watchman knelt his hands on his knees in the attitude of prayer his keen eyes staring straight into the soft darknessfor the only entrance was so small that the crouching figure blocked out the day but darkness or light were alike to deen mahomed lost as he was to the present in a dull memory and hope perhaps when years before he had first begun to hold his service in defiance of that other worship he may have put up some definite petition now there was none only the cry so seldom heard by human ears yet whose echoes so often resound like thunder through the world how long o lord how long so he knelt paralysed by the very perplexity of his own prayer until a louder burst from the harmonium and a sudden hubbub among the carriages warned him that the service was over he rose indifferently and came out into the sunlight it lay now like a yellow glaze over the white stucco of st johnsinthewilderness over the gaily dressed congregation hurrying to escape from it in their cool homes over rujjub whipping his horses viciously obedient to a sharp order from the englishman who had just handed a delicate woman into the carriage over rahmuts garden with its white rosebud and then the whole thing was past in a moment a plungea swerve a little naked imp making a dive before those prancing feet with an eager childish cry then a shriek from the palefaced lady standing up in the barouche a small figure crushed and bleeding in an old mans arms and a shout seeming to fill the air rahmut ah mercy of the most high justice justice dont look my dear said an english voice please remember that youyou had better drive home it was the childs own fault doctor hadnt we better drive home yes yes drive home dear lady said another english voice in hurried approach to the scene you are not fit now then good people stand back please carmichael make those niggers stand back i must see the boy it was easy enough to ensure compliance so far as the pale faces made paler by shocked sympathy went easier still to enforce it from the darker ones accustomed to obey orders given in that foreign accent but how about the old man standing like a stag at bay clutching the child to his breast and backing towards his hut with a loud fierce cry touch him not touch him not touch him not we are only driving him crazy said the doctor aside and i doubt if it is much good i saw the wheel pass right over the chest let him be but it seems so cruel so unchristian protested the parson the doctor smiled oddly that doesnt alter the fact youre no good here no more am i here you chuprassie run like the devil to the dispensary and tell faiz khan hes wanted if he is out one of the mahomedan dressersa mahomedan mind youand he is to report to me come along parson the kindest thing we can do is to go away its humiliating but true apparently it was so for a sort of passive resignation came to the straining arms as the dark faces crowded round once more with plain unhesitating unvarnished comments lo he is dead for sure well it is the lords will and he hath found freedom see you he wanted his flower the foolish one twas the horses did it said another they are evilbegotten beasts rujjub hath said so often ai burribat all things are illbegotten to one illbegot and rujjubs beasts know he stints their stomachsfull put in a third when i drove them in tytler sahibs stable they were true born ie gentle as the sahib was himself then he took pension and went home to wilayet and i have a new master who only keeps a phitton phaeton it is undignified but there tis fate nought else but deen mahomed sitting with the dead child in his arms was not thinking of rujjub or his horses of phittons or barouches not even of chariots of firein a way not even of rahmut himselfbut simply of a tract and a childs tearsthose last tears which were to be a last memory for ever and ever yet even this thought brought no definite emotion only a dull wonder why such things should be a wonder so vague so dull that when faiz deen arrived to give the verdict of death the old man yielding readily to the inevitable echoed the truism that it was gods will what else indeed could it be to the fierce old fanatic with his creed of kismet that same evening he lingered awhile in the big bazaar on his way homewards from the sandy stretch of desert land beyond the city walls where he had left a new anthill of a grave among the cluster belonging to his people lingered not for pleasure but for business since the events of the day had made it necessary that he should spend yet a few more annas from the five rupees he gained by wearing a sword a badge and chiming the churchgong for it was shubrat the nightthe one night of all the long yearwhen the souls of the dead are permitted to visit the ancestral home therefore little rahmut so lately numbered amongst the cloud of witnesses must not be neglected he must find his portion like the othersa benjamins portion of good things such as children love it was already dark but even there in the bazaar the little lamps of the dead shone from many a house giving an unwonted radiance to the big brass platters of the sweetstuff shop where the old man paused to haggle over full weight and measure since even in feasting the dead the living must look after themselves a strange sight this the noisy bazaar more full of stir than usual since many a thrifty soul had put off marketing till the last overhead the myriadhued stars which in these foggy climes come back to memory as an integral part of the indian night and beneath them the little twinkling lamps set out in rows thousands of themso much was certain from the pale suffused light showing like a dim aurora above the piled shadow of the city on every side the same soft radiance save towards st johnsinthewilderness rising dark beyond the fringe of palm trees this feast of all souls was not for it and to the crass ignorance of those who lived in the gardencircled houses behind it the twinkling lights set for the dead were but a sign of some new wickedness in sodom and gomorrah or at best of some heathen rite over which to shake the head regretfully so in front of the cavernous shop visible by the glow the old watchman fumbled beneath his badge with reluctant hand for a few pence listening the while to rujjubs account of the mornings tragedy given in the balcony above where the latter was lounging away his leisure among heavy perfumes and tinkling jewels one of the hearers looked down over the wooden railing and nodded cheerfully at the chief mourner it is gods will father no one was to blame to blame echoed rujjub with a thick laugh for he was in the first loquacity of semiintoxication and still full of resentment the sahibs say i was to blame it is their way but they will learn better it is our blame if we do this and that my brothers blame that he would not fight over the seas and get killed like rahmuts father tis our blame for everything except for our rupees and our womenthe sahibs can stomach them some one laughed a gay laugh chiming to the tinkle of jewels wah thou mayst laugh now nargeeza continued the mans voice savagely thou knowest not what virtue means ah brother thou hast a hole in thy tail said the sieve to the needle quoted the other voice amid a louder titter and tinkle rujjub swore under his breath so be it sister but a day of reckoning will come and thou be damned for thy dalliance with the infidel yea it will come it will surely come the words echoed through deen mahomeds heart and brain as leaving the shrill squabble with its running accompaniment of titters and tinkles and broad masculine guffaws behind him he made his way back to his empty hovel yea it will come it will surely come what else was possible when god a justly offended god was above all we in the west have not a monopoly in the tower of siloam that belongs to every religion to none more rightfully than to the faith of islam which leaves all things in the hand of providence the belief brought a certain fierce patience to the old man as he finished his preparations for the ghostly guests who on that night alone could partake of the hospitality of the living the lamps mere wicks and oil in little shells of baked clay were ready luted to their places by mud outlining the interior of the tomb where deen mahomed performed all the rites of his religion outlining it so strangely that when they were lit the old man kneeling before the white cloth spread upon the floor looked as if prisoned in a cage of light there was no darkness then only that soft radiance reflected from the newly whitewashed walls upon that fair white sheet on which with calm ceremony he laid the little earthen platters of food one by one designating their owners by name this to my grandson rahmut who has found freedom that was the last dedication and the old voice trembled a little ever so little as it went on into the formula of faith in one god speaking through the mouths of his prophets not one prophet tonight but many for were they not all on earthmoses and elias jesus and mahomedtaking part in the great assize where those dead ancestors would plead for the living who had inherited their sins their failures before such a tribunal as that there must be justicejustice for all things just and unjust so halfkneeling halfsitting the old mahomedan waited for the finger of god to write his fate for the coming year upon his foreheadwaited resting against the wall for the spirits of the dead to come silently invisibly to the feast prepared for them and rahmut had a benjamins portion to console him for those tearsthose last tears ii the churchgong was chiming again and again it was shubrat not for the first time since deen mahomed had put little rahmuts platter of sweets among the feast of the dead for the years had passed since the child had sat in the sunlight planting gardens how many the old man did not consider in point of fact it did not matter to his patience in the end gods club must fall on the unjust so much was sure to the eye of faith something more also if the signs of the times spoke true when the bolt fell it would not be from the blue the mutterings of the storm were loud enough surely to be heard even by those alien ears and yet deen mahomed fanatic and churchchimer standing on that hot summer evening beneath the sirus blossoms smiting the voice from the quavering disc of metal knew no more than thisthat the time was at hand whether it was always so or whether the great revolt was always prearranged can scarcely at this distance of time be determined certain it is that many like old deen mahomed were simply waiting waiting for the sign of god to slay and spare not clang the mellow note went out into the darkening heat for the sun was almost at its setting st johnsinthewilderness showed all the whiter against the deepening shadows of the sky clang out into the stillness the silence as it had gone all these restless waiting years clang yet again how long o lord how long god and his prophet what was that a clamour and above itfamiliar beyond mistakeone word deen deen the faith the faith deen yes deen mahomeda hot breath of wind from the east rustled the dry pods and stirred the perfumed puffblossomsa scorching wind from the east whirled the clamour and the cry into the old mans earsthrough his brainthrough his heart deen deen deen the disc of metal unstruck hung quivering slower and slower fainter and fainter till like the breath of one who dies in his sleep the vibration ceased but the note went alone into eternity seeking judgment for the harmonium was mute deen deen deen the cruellest cry that men have made for themselves it had been long dark ere the old man returned to what he scarcely knew as he stumbled from sheer fatigue on the steps and sat down to rest a space he remembered nothing save that the call had come and that he had obeyed it he had smitten more than metal and had smitten remorselessly a terrible figure this his old hands trembling with their work his fierce old eyes ablaze his garments stained and bloody beyond the white pile of the tomb the red flare of burning roof trees told their tale and every now and again an uproarious outburst of horrid menace and still more horrid laughter came to hint that the work was not all complete yet overhead the stars shone peacefully as ever and above the city the pale radiance of the deathfeasts showed serene the remembrance of the festival and its duties came to the old mans mind in a great pulse of satisfied revenge the tomb was his again nay not his but the saints of whose feet he was the dust those saints who would visit the world that night he sat for an instant staring over the way towards his own hovel then rose slowly showing in every movement the fatigue of unusual exertion well he had done his part he had slain and spared not at all the others might linger for the sake of greed as for him his work was done with a fierce sigh of relief he turned and limped towards the church it was darkness itself within the deep doorway but the lamps were there and he had flint and steel so one by one the lights shone out revealing the sacrilegious accessories of that past worship and yet it was not light enough for shubrat not even when he had lit the candles on the altar still that was soon remedied a journey or two backwards and forwards to his own hovel and a ring of flickering oil cressets encircled the table where it was his turn at last to spread the feast of the dead so large a feast that there was not room enough for all and he had to set a square of lights round a white cloth laid upon the floor this to my grandson rahmut on whom be peace for ever and ever that once more was the last offering and as the old mans voice merged into the sonorous arabic formula of faith it trembled not at all but echoed up into the dome in savage almost insane triumph and satisfaction this was shubrat indeeda night of record and there was room and to spare beneath those architraves which displayed the great name again and again in every scrap of tracery for all the saints in heaven to stand and judge between him and his forefathers for the sin that had been done the blood that had been spiltthose forefathers who had ridden through the land with that cry of deen deen on their lips and had conquered as they the descendants would conquer now yea let them judge even huzrut isa himself and the blessed miriam his mother for there were times when even motherhood must be forgotten his trembling old hands strained under the task which will not bear description rested now on his bent knees his head was thrown backward against the lectern on which the bible lay open at the lesson for the day his face stern even in its satisfaction gazed at the twinkling deathlights among which little rahmuts platter of sweets showed conspicuous yea let them come and judge let them write his fate upon his forehead footnote jesus fatigue content the very religious exaltation raising him above the actual reality of what was and had been all conspired to bring about a sort of trance a paralysis not of action deferred as in the past but of deeds accomplished and so after a time with his head still against the lectern he slept the sleep of exhaustion yet even in his dreams the old familiar war cry fell more than once like a sigh from his lips deen deen a horrible scene look at it how you will but even in its horror not altogether base from without came a faint recollection of the bloodred glare of fire in the sky a faint echo of the drunken shouts and beastlike cries of those who had taken advantage of the times to return to their old evil doings within there was nothing save the pale radiance of the twinkling lamps set round the deathfeast the old man asleep against the lectern and silence until with a whispering kissing sound a childs bare feet fell upon the bare stonesa tiny child still doubtful of its balance with golden hair shining in the light a scarlet flush of sleep showed on its cheeks a stain of deeper scarlet showed on the little white nightgown it wore perhaps it had slept through the horrors of the night perhaps slept on even when snatched up by mother or nurse in the last wild flight for safety towards a sanctuary who knows who will ever know half the story of the great mutiny but there it was sleep still lingering in the wide blue eyes attracted by the flickering lights on and on unsteadily it came past the old man dreaming of jehad past the lights themselveshappily unhurtto stretch greedy little hands on rahmuts sweeties so with a crow of delight playing sucking playing in high havoc upon the fair white cloth was it the passing of the spirits coming to judgment which set the candle flames on the altar aswaying towards the cressets below them or was it only the rising breeze of midnight was it the finger of fate or only the fluttering marker hanging from the bible above which touched the old mans forehead who knows who dares to hazard yea or nay before such a scene as this surely with that bloodred flare in the sky those bloodred stains on earth the passion and the pity the strain and stress of it all need a more impartial judgment than the living can give so let the child and the old man remain among the lights flickering and flaring before the unseen wind heralding a new day or the unseen wisdom beginning a new future deen mahomed woke suddenly the beads of perspiration on his brow and looked round him fearfully as men do when roused by god knows what from a strange dream then to his bewilderment came a childs laugh saints in heaven and earth was that rahmut had he come back for his own in that guise did the padresahibs speak true when they said the angels had golden hair and pale faces he crouched forward on his hands like a wild beast about to spring his eyes fixed in a stupid stare there within the ring of holy lights on the fair white cloth was a child with outstretched hands full of rahmuts sweets and a little gurgle of delight in the cry which echoed up into the dome nanna dekho seedekho nanna it was calling to its nurse not to the old man yet though he had begun to grasp the truth his heart thrilled strangely to the once familiar sound nana and it had chosen rahmuts portion had claimed the childs placethe childs own place footnote grandfather what was that a step behind hima halfdrunken laugha dull red flash of a sabre which had already done its workrujjub with a savage yell of satisfaction steering straight as his legs would carry him to a new victim but he had reckoned without that unseen figure crouching in the shadow by the lectern reckoned without the confused clashing and clamour of emotion vibrating in the old mans bosom beneath the stroke of a strange chance reckoned it may be without the fate written upon the high narrow forehead which held its beliefs fast prisoners there was no time for aught save impulse the devilish face full of the lust of blood had passed already then came a cry echoing up into the dome deen deen allahihukk the old watchman stood still with that stupid stare gazing down at the huddled figure on its face which lay before him so close that the warm blood gurgling from it horridly already touched his bare feet what had he done why had he done it to save the child who had claimed the childs placeto be truewell it was done and those were voices outsidemen coming to pillage the church no doubtthere was silver in the chest he knewthat of course had been rujjubs errand and his comrades would not be far behindthey would find the dying man and thenyea the die was cast and after all it had been rahmuts platter with these thoughts clashing and echoing through heart and soul deen mahomed sprang forward seized the child stifling its cries with his hand and disappeared into the darkness none too soon for the yell of rage greeting the discovery of the murdered comrade reached him ere he had gained the shelter of the trees whither now not to his house for they would search there search everywhere for those survivors whose work remained as witness to the existence of some foe alone he could have faced the pillagers secure in his past but with the childthe child struggling so madly and the last time he had held one in his arms it had lain so still oh rahmut rahmut mercy of the most high rahmut rahmut the words fell from his lips in a hoarse whisper as he ran clinging to the darkest places conscious of nothing save the one fierce desire to get away to some spot where the childs cries would not be heardwhere he would have time to thinksome spot where the work had been done alreadywhere nothing remained for lustful hands the thought made him double back into the cool watered gardens about the little group of houses beyond the church the flames were almost out now and in one roof only a few sparks lingered on the remaining rafters here would be peace besides even if the cries were heard they might be set down to some wounded thing dreeing its deadly debt of suffering a minute afterwards he stood in a room unroofed and reeking yet with the smell of fire but scarcely disturbed otherwise in its peaceful orderly arrangementsa room with pictures pasted to the walls and faintly visible by the glare with toys upon the floor and a swinging cot whence a child had been snatched this child perhapswho knows anyhow it cuddled down from deen mahomeds arms into the pillows as if they were familiar nanna nanna it sobbed pitifully hilao hilao neendhi argia swing swing sleep has come so jao mera butchcha sleep my child replied the old man quietly as his bloodstained hand began its task the wonder of such task had passed utterly and had any come to interrupt it he would have given his life calmly for its fulfilment why he did not know it was fate so the old voice gasping still for breath settled into a timehonoured lullaby which has soothed the cradle of most bairns in india no matter of what race or colour oh crow go crow ripe plums are so many baby wants to sleep you know theyre two pounds for a penny so over and over in a low croon mechanically he chanted till the child losing its fear in the familiar darkness fell asleep and then in a sort of dull way the question had been in deen mahomeds mind from the beginning without an answer for he had gone so far along the road simply by following close on the finger of fate and now there was no possibility of turning back for woe or weal he had taken the childs part he had accepted the responsibility for its life even to the length of death in others not that he cared much for the consequences of the swinging blow he had dealt to rujjubhe was no true man what then there was no chance of concealing the child it slept now but ere long it would waken again and cry for nanna nanna that must be prevented for a time at any rate the chubby hands still clasped one of rahmuts sweeties and the old man stooped to break off a corner crumble it up with something he took from an inner pocket and then place it gently within the childs moist parted lips which closed upon it instinctively he gave a sigh of relief that was better that would settle the cries for some hours and before then he must have made over the child to other hands yes that was it he must somehow run the gauntlet of his comrades and reach the entrenched position which the infidelscurse themhad defended against odds such as no man had dreamed of before it was seven miles to the north that cantonment which would have been destroyed but for those renegades from the faith who had stood by their masters and that handful of british troops which had refused to accept defeat seven miles of jungle and open country alive with armed and reckless sepoys and sowars to whom a man in mufti was fair game no matter what the colour of his race lay between him and that goal and deen mahomeds grim face grew grimmer as he raised the sleeping child pillows and all wrapped them in a quilt and slung the bundle on his backslung it carefully so as to give air to the child and freedom to his arms he might need it if they tried to stop him he gave a questioning glance at the sky as he came out into the garden where the scent of the orangeblossoms drifted with the lingering spirals of smoke not more than an hour or two remained before the dawn would be upon them he must risk detection then by the short cut through the bazaar better that than the certainty of discovery later on in the daylight by those ready for renewed assault upon the entrenchment whokumdar challenged the sentry ceremoniously set as in peaceful times at the city gate allah akbar wa mahomed rusool replied the old man without a quiver that was true he was for god and his prophet when all was said and done but this was little rahmuts guestthis he passed his hand over his forehead in a dazed sort of way ari look at his loot hiccoughed one of a group in the street before god he hath more than his share in the bundle stop friend and pay toll what my sword hath won my sword keeps retorted deen mahomed fiercely better for thee in paradise allah buksh if thou hadst smitten more and drunk less let be let be interrupted another tis deen mahomed the crazy watchman ill go bail he hath no more than he deserves for this days work and he is a devil with that sword of his when he is angry lo i saw him at the corner mind you where the sahibs but deen mahomed had passed from earshot passed on and on through dark streets and light ones challenged jestingly or in earnest and through it all a growing doggedness a growing determination came to him to do this thing yet still remain as ever a guardian of the faith this for rahmuts sake the other for the sake of the tomb because he was the dust of the footsteps of the saints in light out in the open now with the paling light of dawn behind him and a drunken hindu trooper riding at him with a cry of ram ram so they dared to give an idolatrous cry those hindu dogs whose aid had been sought to throw off the yokewho would soon find it on their own shoulders a step back a mighty slash as the horse sped by maddened by bit and spur a stumble a crash and an old man with a strange bundle at his back was hacking insanely at his prostrate foe no more ram ram for him that last cry had served as the deathfarewell of his race and creed on again with a fiercer fire in the eyes through the great tufts of tigergrass isolating each poor square of gods earth from the next and making it impossible to see ones way on and on swiftly forcing a path through the swaying stems whose silvery tasselled spikes above began to glitter in the level beams of the rising sun then suddenly without a word of warning came an open sandy space a brief command halt so soon it was nearer by a mile than he had expected and there was no chance of flight not unless you made that burden on your back a target for pursuing bullets a fair mark in truth for the half dozen or more of rifles ready in the hands of the cursed infidels who goes there came the challenge in the cursed foreign tongue he gave one sharp glance towards the picket and bitter hatred flared up within him for there was not even a sahib there who might perchance understand yet there was no doubt no doubt at all even to his confused turmoil of feeling as to who came there a foe a foe to the death when this was over so with a shout came his creed allah akbar wa mahomed rusool then in a sort of gurgle as he fell forward on his face it finished in deen deen deen nicked im by gum nicked the ole beast neat as a ninepin said one of the picket wonder wot he come on for like that said another by ole ghazi thats wot he was put in a third they gets the drink aboard an dont care for nothing but religionrummy start aint it hello wots thata babby by the lord for the shock of deen mahomeds fall had awakened the child as they drew it from the blanket the sun tipped over the tigergrass and fell on its golden curls shubrat was over i wonder wot e were agoin to do with it remarked the inquirer turning the dead body over with his foot and looking thoughtfully at the face fierce even in death but no one hazarded a theory and the finger of fate had left no mark on the high narrow forehead but the night of record was over for it also in the permanent way i heard this story in a railtrolly on the pinddadur line so i always think of it with a running accompaniment a rhythmic whir of wheels in which despite its steadiness you feel the propelling impulse of the unseen coolies behind then the swift skimming as they set their feet on the trolly for the brief rest which merges at the first hint of lessened speed into the old racing measure whir and slide racing and restingwhile the wheels spin like bobbins and the brick rubble in the permanent way slips under your feet giddily until you could almost fancy yourself sitting on a stationary engine engaged in winding up an endless red ribbon a ribbon edged as if with tinsel by steel rails stretching away in ever narrowing lines to the level horizon stretching straight as a die across a sandy desert rippled and waved by wrinkled sand hills into the semblance of a sandy sea and that from its size must be a seventh wave i was just thinking this when the buzz of the brake jarred me through to the marrow of my bones whats up a train i asked of my companion who was giving me a lift across his section of the desert no he replied laconically now then hurry up men nothing in the wide world comes to pieces in the hand like a trolly it was dismembered and off the line in a moment only however much to my surprise to be replaced upon the rails some half a dozen yards further along them i was opening my lips for one question when something i saw at my feet among the brick rubble made me change it for another hullo what the dickens is that to the carnal eye it was two small squares of smooth stucco the one with an oval black stone set in it perpendicularly the other with a round purplish onecuriously ringed with darker circlesset in it horizontally on the stucco of one were a few dried tulsi leaves and grains of rice on the other suspiciouslooking splashes of dark red footnote marjoram whats what echoed my friend climbing up to his seat again why man that thingthat thing in the permanent way i replied nettled at his manner he gave an odd little laugh just audible above the first whir of the wheels as we started again thats about it in the permanent wayconsiderably he paused and i thought he was going to relapse into the silence for which he was famous but he suddenly seemed to change his mind look here he said its a fifteen mile run to the first curve and no trains due so if you like ill tell you why we left the track and he did when they were aligning this section i was put on to itpreliminary survey work under an re man who wore boiled shirts in the wilderness and was great on departmental discipline he is in simla now of course well we were driving a straight line through the whole solar system and planting it out with little red flags when one afternoon just behind that big wave of a sand hill we came upon something in the way it was a man for further description i should say it was a thin man there is nothing more to be said he may have been old he may have been young he may have been tall he may have been short he may have been halt and maimed he may have been blind deaf or dumb or any or all of these the only thing i know for certain is that he was thin the kalassies said he was some kind of a hindu saint and they fell at his feet promptly i shall never forget the res face as he stood trying to classify the creature according to wilsons hindu sects or his indignation at the kalassies ignorant worship of a man who for all they knew might be a follower of shiva while they were bound to vishnu or vice versa he was very learned over the vaishnavas and the saivas and all the time that bronze image with its hands on its knees squatted in the sand staring into space perfectly unmoved perhaps the man saw us perhaps he didnt i dont know as i said before he was thin footnote tent pitchers men employed in measuring land so after a time we stuck a little red flag in the ground close to the small of his back and went on our way rejoicing until we came to our camp a mile further on it doesnt look like it but there is a brackish well and a sort of a village away there to the right and of course we always took advantage of water when we could it must have been a week later just as we came to the edge of the sand hills and could see a landmark or two that i noticed the re come up from his prismatic compass looking rather pale then he fussed over to me at the plane table were out he said there is a want of departmental discipline in this party and we are out i forget how many fractions he said but some infinitesimal curve would have been required to bring us plumb on the next station and as that would have ruined the res professional reputation we harked back to rectify the error we found the bronze image still sitting on the sand with its hands on its knees but apparently it had shifted its position some three feet or so to the right for the flag was fully that distance to the left of it that night the re came to my tent with his hands full of maps and his mind of suspicions it seems incredible he said but i am almost convinced that byragi or jogi or gosain or sunyasi whichever he may be has had the unparalleled effrontery to move my flag i cant be sure but if i were i would have him arrested on the spot i suggested he was that already but it is sometimes difficult to make an re see a coopers hill joke especially when he is your superior officer so we did that bit over again as it happened my chief was laid up with sun fever when we came to the bronze image and i had charge of the party i dont know why exactly but it seemed to me rough on the thin man to stick a red flag at the small of his back as a threat that we meant to annex the only atom of things earthly to which he still clung time enough for that when the line was actually under construction so i told the kalassies to let him do duty as a survey mark for from what i had heard i knew that once a man of that sort fixes on a place in which to gain immortality by penance he sticks to it till the mortality at any rate comes to an end and this one i found out from the villagers had been there for ten years of course they said he never ate or drank or moved but that equally of course was absurd a year after this i came along again in charge of a construction party with an overseer called craddock a big yellowheaded saxon who couldnt keep off the drink and who had in consequence been going down steadily in one department or another for years as good a fellow as ever stepped when he was sober well we came right on the thin one again plump in the very middle of the permanent way we dug round him and levelled up to him for some time and then one day craddock gave a nod at me and walked over to where that image squatted staring into space i can see the two now craddock in his navvys dress his blue eyes keen yet kind in the red face shaded by the dirty pith hat and the thin man without a rag of any sort to hide his bronze anatomy look here sonny said craddock stooping over the other youre in the wayin the permanent way then he just lifted him right up gently as if he had been a child and set him down about four feet to the left it was to be a metre gauge so that was enough for safety there he sat after we had propped him up again with his byraga or cleft stick under the left arm as if he were quite satisfied with the change but next day he was in the old place it was no use arguing with him the only thing to be done was to move him out of the way when we wanted it of course when the earthwork was finished there was the platelaying and ballasting and what not to be done so it came to be part of the big saxons regular business to say in his oxfordshire drawl sonny yore in the waiyin the permanent waiy craddock it must be mentioned was in a peculiarly sober virtuous mood owing no doubt to the desolation of the desert in which by the way i found him quite a godsend as a companion for when he was on the talk the quaintness of his ideas was infinitely amusing and his knowledge of the natives picked up as a loafer in many a bazaar and serai was surprisingly wide if appallingly inaccurate there is something savin yor presence sir blamed wrong in the whole blamed business he said to me with a mild remonstrance in his blue eyes one evening after he had removed the obstruction to progress that pore fellar sir es a meditatin on the word homhommipuddenhome it is sir ive bin toldan doin is little level to make the spiritooal man subdoo is fleshly hinstinckts and i nathaniel james craddock so called in holy baptism i do assure you aeatin and adrinkin earty catches im right up like a babby and sets im on one side as if i was born to it and so i willan willin tooso as to keep im from arms way for eathin or christian sir es an eggsample to the spiritooal part of me which savin your presence sir is most ways drink footnote om mi pudmi houm the buddhist invocation poor craddock he went on the spree hopelessly the day after we returned to civilisation and it was with the greatest difficulty that i succeeded in getting him a trial as driver to the material train which commenced running up and down the section the first time i went with it on business i had an inspection carriage tacked on behind the truck loads of coolies and ballast so that i could not make out why on earth we let loose a danger whistle and slowed down to full stop in the very middle of the desert until i jumped down and ran forward even then i was only in time to see craddock coming back to his engine with a redder face than ever its only old meditations sir he said apologetically as i climbed in beside him it dont take a minute no longer nor a cow and thems in the reglations you see sir i wouldnt ave arm come to the pore soul afore is spiritooal nater ad the straight tip hoaem neither would none of us sir coolie nor driver sir on the section we all likes old hommipuddenhome e sticks to it so stiddy thats where it is do you mean to say that you always have to get out and lift him off the line i asked wondering rather at the patience required for the task thats so sir he replied slowly in the same apologetic tones it dont take no time you see sir thats where it is praps you may ave thought like as i did first time that ed save is bacon when the engine come along lordy the cold sweat broke out on me that time i brought er up sir with the buffers at the back of is ed like them things the photographers jiminy you straight with but e aint that sort aint meditations here craddock asked leave to light his pipe and in the interval i looked ahead along the narrowing red ribbon with its tinsel edge thinking how odd it must have been to see it barred by that bronze image no that aint his sort continued craddock meditatively though wot is sort may be sir is not my part to say ive arst and arst and arst them pundits but there aint one of them can really tell sir cos he aint got any marks about him you see sir its by their marks like cattle as you tell em some says he worships bloody shiversim oos wife you know sir they calls martha davya christian sort o name aint it sir for a eathin idoland some says e worships wishnyou lucksmi an that lot an holy too though savin your presence sir it aint much holiness i see at them times but mostly drink it makes me feel quite omesick i do assure you sir more as if they was humans like me likewise footnote shiva footnote mata devi footnote vishnu lukshmi footnote holi the indian saturnalia and which belief do you incline to i asked for the sake of prolonging the conversation he drew his rough hand over his corncoloured beard and quite a grave look came to the blue eyes i inclines to shiver he said decisively and ill tell you why sir shivers bloody but es dead on death they calls im the destroyer e dont care a damn for the body es all for the spiritooal nater like old meditations there now wishnyou lucksmi an that lot is the preservers they eats an drinks earty like me so it stands to reason sir dont it that es a shiver and im a wishnyou lucksmi he stood up under pretence of giving a wipe round a valve with the oily rag he held and looked out to the horizon where the sun was setting like a huge red signal right on the narrowing line so he went on after a pause thats why i wouldnt ave arm come to old meditations es a shiver im a wishnyou lucksmi thats what i am his meaning was quite clear and i am not ashamed to say that it touched me look here i said take care you dont run over that old chap some day when you are drunk thats all he bent over another valve burnishing it i hope to god i dont he said in a low voice thatd about finish me altogether i expect we returned the next morning before daybreak but i went on the engine being determined to see how that bronze image looked on the permanent way when you were steaming up to it you ketch sight of im clear this side said craddock a good two mile or more ef you had a telescope ten for that matter it aint so easy tother side with the sun ashining bang inter the eyes and there aint no big wave as a signal over there but lordy there aint no fear of my missin old meditations certainly none that morning he showed clear first against the rosy flush of dawn afterwards like a dark stain on the red ribbon ill run up close to him today sir said craddock so as you shall see wot es made of the whistle rang shrill over the desert of sand which lay empty of all save that streak of red with the dark stain upon it but the stain never moved never stirred though the snorting demon from the west came racing up to it full speed have a care man have a care i shouted but my words were almost lost in the jar of the brake put on to the utmost even then i could only crane round the cab with my eyes fixed on that bronze image straight ahead of us could we stop in timewould it move yes no yes slower and slowerhow many turns of the flywheel to so many yardsi felt as if i were working the sum frantically in my head when with a little backward shiver the great circle of steel stopped dead and craddocks voice came in cheerful triumph there didnt i tell you sir aint e stiddy aint e asubdooin of mortality beautiful the next instant he was out and as he stooped to his task he flung me back a look now sonny youll ave to move youre in the waythe permanent way my dear that was the last i saw of him for some time for i fell sick and went home when i returned to work i found much to my surprise that craddock was in the same appointment in fact he had been promoted to drive the solitary passenger train which now ran daily across the desert he had not been on the spree once i was told indeed the re who was of the methodist division of that gallant regiment took great pride in a reformation which he informed me was largely due to his religious teaching combined with departmental discipline and how is meditations i asked when the great rough hand had shaken mine vehemently craddocks face seemed to me to grow redder than ever es very well sir thanking you kindly theres a native driver on the goods now es a shivermartha davy lot so i pays im five rupee a month to nip out sharp with the stoker an shovel is old saint to one side im gettin good pay now you know sir i told him there was no reason to apologise for the fact and that i hoped it might long continue whereat he gave a sheepish kind of laugh and said he hoped so too christmas came and went uneventfully without an outbreak and i could not refrain from congratulating craddock on one temptation safely over he smiled broadly lor bless you sir he said you didnt never think did you that nathaniel james craddock which his name was given to im in holy baptism i do assure you was going to knuckle down that way to old hommipuddenhome twouldnt be fair on christmas noways sir and though i dont set the store e does on is spiritooal nater i was born and bred in a christyan country i do assure you i congratulated him warmly on his sentiments and hoped again that they would last to which he replied as before that he hoped so too and then holi time came round and as luck would have it the place was full of riffraff low whites going on to look for work in a further section i had to drive through the bazaar on my way to the railway station and it beat anything i had ever seen in various vice east and west were outbidding each other in iniquity and to make matters worse an electrical duststorm was blowing hard you never saw such a scene it was pandemonium background and all i thought i caught a glimpse of a corncoloured beard and a pair of blue eyes in a wooden balcony among tinkling sutaras and jasmine chaplets but i wasnt sure however as i was stepping into the inspection carriage which as usual was the last in the train i saw craddock crossing the platform to his engine his white coat was all splashed with the red dye they had been throwing at each other holi fashion in the bazaar his walk to my eyes had a lilt in it and finally the neck of a black bottle showed from one pocket obedient to one of those sudden impulses which come heaven knows why i took my foot off the step and followed him to the engine comin aboard sir he said quite collectedly youd be better beind tonight for its blowin grit fit to make me a walkin sandpaper inside and out and before i could stop him the black bottle was at his mouth this decided me perhaps my face showed my thoughts for as i climbed into the cab he gave an uneasy laugh dont be afraid sir its black as pitch but i knows where old meditation comes by instinck i do assure you one hour an seventeen minutes from the distance signal with pressure as it oughter be hillo theres the whistle and the baboo awaving off we goes as we flashed past a red light i looked at my watch dont you be afraid sir he said again looking at his its ten to ten now and in one hour an seventeen minutes on goes the brake thats the ticket for shivers and martha davy though i am a wishnyou lucksmi he paused a moment and as he stood put his hand on a stanchion to steady himself very much of a wishnyou lucksmi he went on with a shake of the head ive ad a drop too much and i know it but it aint fair on a fellar like me aving so many names to them when theyre all the samea eatin an drinkin lot like me theres christenyoud ave thought hed ave been a decent chap by is name but e went on orful with them gopisthats hindu for milkmaids sir and harrywell he wasnt no better than some other harrys ive heard on and canyer i expect he could just about to say nothin of gopinaughty and naughty he were as no doubt youve heard tell sir theres too many on them for a pore fellar who dont set store by is spiritooal nater especially when they mixes themselves up with angcore whisky an ginger ale footnote kristna footnote hari footnote kaniya footnote gopinath these are all names of vishnu in his various avatars footnote encore his blue eyes had a faraway look in them and his words were fast losing independence but i understood what he meant perfectly in that brief glimpse of the big bazaar i had seen the rows of western bottles standing cheek by jowl with the bowls of dolee dye the sour curds and sweetmeats of holitide you had better sit down craddock i said severely for i saw that the fresh air was having its usual effect perhaps if you sleep a bit youll be more fit for work ill look out and wake you when youre wanted he gave a silly laugh let go the stanchion and drew out his watch dont you be afraid sir one hour and seventeen minutes from the distance signal ill keep im out o arms way an willing to the end of the chapter he gave a lurch forward to the seat stumbled and the watch dropped from his hand for a moment i thought he might go overboard and i clutched at him frantically but with another lurch and an indistinct admonition to me not to be afraid he sank into the corner of the bench and was asleep in a second then i stooped to pick up the watch and rather to my surprise found it uninjured and still going craddocks words ten minutes to ten recurred to me then it would be twentyseven minutes past eleven before he was wanted i sat down to wait bidding the native stoker keep up the fire as usual the wind was simply shrieking round us and the sand drifted thick on craddocks still upturned face more than once i wiped it off feeling he might suffocate it was the noisiest and at the same time the most silent journey i ever undertook pandemonium with seventy times seven of its devils let loose outside the cab inside craddock asleep or deadhe might have been the latter from his stillness it became oppressive after a time as i remembered that other still figure miles down the track which was so strangely bound to this one beside me the minutes seemed hours and i felt a distinct relief when the watch which i had held in my hand most of the time told me it was seventeen minutes past eleven only ten minutes before the brake should be put on and craddock would require all that time to get his senses about him i might as well have tried to awaken a corpse and it was three minutes to the twentyseven when i gave up the idea as hopeless not that it mattered since i could drive an engine as well as he still the sense of responsibility weighed heavily upon me my hand on the brake valve trembled visibly as i stood watching the minute hand of the watch thirty seconds before the time i put the brake on hard determining to be on the safe side and then when i had taken this precaution a perfectly unreasoning anxiety seized on me i stepped on to the footboard and craned forward into the darkness which even without the wind and the driving dust was blinding the lights in front shot slantways showing an angle of red ballast barred by gleaming steel beyond that a formless void of sand but the centre of the permanent way where that figure would be sitting was dark as death itself what a fool i was when the great circle of the flywheel was slackening slackening every second and yet the fear grew lest i should have been too late lest i should have made some mistake to appease my own folly i drew out my watch in confirmation of the time great god a difference of two minutestwo whole minutesyet the watches had been the same at the distance signalthe fall of course the fall i seemed unable to do anything but watch that slackening wheel even though i became conscious of a hand on my shoulder of some one standing beside me on the footboard no not standing swaying lurching dont i cried dont its madness but that some one was out in the darkness then i saw a big white figure dash across the angle of light with outspread arms now then sonny yore in the waythe permanent way the inspector paused and i seemed to come back to the sliding whir of the trolly wheels in the distance a semaphore was dropping its red arm and a pointsman like a speck on the ribbon was at work shunting us into a siding well i asked there isnt anything more when a whole train goes over two men who are locked in each others arms it is hardhard to tellwell which is shivers martha davy and which is wishnyou lucksmi it was right out in the desert in the hot weather no parsons or people to object so i buried them there in the permanent way and those are tombstones i suppose he laughed no altars the native employes put them up to their saint the oval black upright stone is shiva the destroyers lingam those splashes are blood the flat one decorated with flowers is the salagrama sacred to vishnu the preserver you see nobody really knew whether old meditations was a saiva or a vaishnava so i suggested this arrangement as the men were making a sectarian quarrel out of the question he paused again and added footnote a fossil ammonite you see it does for both of them the jar of the points prevented me from replying on the second story it was a threestoried house in reality though time had given it the semblance of a fourth in the mud platform which led up to its only entrance for the passing feet of generations had worn down the levels of the alley outside and the toiling hands of generations had added to the level of the rooms within until those who wished to pass from one to the other had to climb the connecting steps ere they could reach the door the door itself was broad as it was high and had a strangely deformed look since nearly half of its two carven stone jambs were of necessity hidden behind the platform these stone jambs squarehewn roughlycarven were the only sign of antiquity visible in the house from the alley the rest being the usual straightupanddown almost windowless wall built of small purplish bricks set in a mortar of mud it stood however a little further back in the alley than its neighbours so giving room for the mud platform but that was its only distinction the alley in its turn differed in no way from the generality of such alleys in the walled towns where the houseslike trees in a crowded plantationshoot up shoulder to shoulder as if trying to escape skywards from the yearly increasing pressure of humanity it was briefly a deep dark irregular drain of a place shadowful utterly save for the one brief half hour or so during which the sun showed in the notched ribbon of the sky which was visible between the uneven turretings of the roof yet the very sunlessness and airlessness had its advantages in hot weather it brought relief from the scorching glare and in the cold such air as there was remained warm even beneath a frosty sky so that the mud platform with its possibilities of unhustled rest was a favourite gossiping place of the neighbourhood all the more so because between it and the next house diving down through the debris of countless generations and green with the slime of countless ages lay one of those wells to which the natives cling so fondly in defiance of modern sanitation and waterworks but there was a third reason why the platform was so much frequented on the second story of the house to which it belonged stood the oldest hindu shrine in the city how it came to be there no one could say clearly the brahmins who tended it from the lower story told tales of a plinthed temple built in the heroic age of prithi raj but only this much was certain that it was very old and that the steep stone ladder of a stair which led up to the arched alcoves of the anteshrine was of very different date to the ordinary brick one which led thence to the third story where among other lodgers ramanund ba lived with his widowed mother he was a mathematical master in a mission school and twice a day on his way to and from the exact sciences he had to pass up and down the brick ladder and the stone stair and sometimes he had to stand aside on the threecornered landing where the brick and stone met in order that the women coming to worship might pass with their platters of curds their trays of cressets and chaplets of flowers into the dim anteshrine where the light from a stone lattice glistened faintly on the damp oilsmeared pavement but that being necessarily when he was on his way downstairs and deep in preparation for the days work he did not mind a minute or so of delay for further study and he would go on with his elementary treatise on logarithms until the tinkle of the anklets merged into the giggle which generally followed when in the comparative seclusion of the anteshrine the veils could be lifted for a peep at the handsome young man but ramanund albeit a lineal descendant of the original brahmin priests of the temple had read herbert spencer and john stuart mill so he would go on his way careless alike of the unseen women and the unseen shrineof the mysteries of sex and religion as presented in his natural environment there are dozens of young men in india nowadays in this position who stand figuratively as he did actually giving the goby to onehalf of life alternately and letting the cressets and the chaplets and the unseen women pass unchallenged into the alcove where the speckled light of the lattice bejewelled their gay garments and a blue cloud of incense floated sideways among the dim arches and ramanund was as good a specimen of this new india as could be found north or south not of robust physiquethat was scarcely to be expected after generations of in and in breedingbut of most acute intelligence and by virtue of inherited spiritual distinction singularly free from the sensual passive acquiescence in the limitations of life which brings content to the most of humanity he was by birth as it were a specialised speculative machine working at full pressure with a pure virtue escapement as president of a debating club affiliated with the society for the general improvement of the people of india he was perhaps needlessly lavish of vague expressions such as the individual rights of man but then he in common with his kind have only lately become acquainted with the ideas such phrases are supposed to express and have not as yet learnt their exact usethat being an art which history tells needs centuries of national and individual struggle for its attainment be that as it may even in the strict atmosphere of the mission school ramanunds only fault was that he had assimilated its morality and rejected its dogma in the orthodox hindu household upstairs over which his widowed mother ruled severely his only crime was that he refused to replace a wife deceased of the measles at the age of six for another of the good ladys choosing for that other matter of slighting the shrine downstairs is too common nowadays in india to excite any recrimination its only effect being to make the women regard the rule which forbids their eating with the men folks as a patent of purity instead of a sign of inferiority since it is a safeguard against contamination from those who when beyond the watch of secluded eyes may have defiled themselves in a thousand western ways regarding the wife however ramanund was firm despite the prayers that his mother offered before the goddess downstairs for his deliverance from obstinacy he used to accompany her sometimes on this errand so far as the threecornered landing and then with a smile proceed on his way to the exact sciences even the clang of the great bell which hung in front of the idol within tiptoe touch of the worshipper as it used to come pealing after him down the stairs proclaiming that the goddess attention had been called to a new petitioner did not bring a comprehension of facts to his singularly clear brain those facts being that rightly or wrongly the flamboyant image of kali deviwhich his ancestors had tended faithfullywas being besieged by as fervent a motherprayer as had been laid before any divinityor devinity as the word really stands footnote goddess in truth ramanund had no special desire to marry at all or even to fall in love he was too busy with the exact sciences to experimentalise on the suspension of the critical faculty in man besides he had definitely made up his mind to marry a widow when he did marry for he was as great on the widow question as he was on all others which appealed to his kindly moral nature he and his friends of the same stamppleaders clerks and suchlike living in the alleyused to sit on the mud steps after working hours and discuss such topics before adjourning to the debating club but they always left one of the flights of steps free this was for the worshippers to pass upwards to the shrine as soon as the blare of the conches the beatings of drums and the ringing of bells should announce that the dread goddess having been washed and put to bed like a good little girl her bath water was available to those who wished to drink it as a charm against the powers of darkness that was with the waning light but as it was a charm also against the dangers of day the dawn in its turn would be disturbed by clashings and brayings to tell of kali devis uprisal then in the growing light the housemothers fresh from their grindstones would come shuffling through the alleys with a pinch or two of newground flour and the neighbouring brahminshurriedly devotional after the manner of priesthoodswould speed up the stair muttering prayers as they sped to join for half a minute in the sevenfold circling of the sacred lamps while divided between sleep and greed the fat traders on their way to their shops would begin business by a bid for divine favour and yawn petitions as they waddled that the supply of holy water would hold out till they arrived at the shrine but at this time in the morning ramanund would be sleeping the sleep of the just upstairs after sitting up past midnight over his pupils exercises for one of the first effects of civilisation is to make men prefer a kerosene lamp to the sun now one september when the rains coming late and ceasing early had turned the pestilential drain in the city into a patent germ propagator the worshippers at kali devis shrine were more numerous than ever indeed one or two halfhearted freethinker hangerson to the fringe of progress and debating clubs began to hedge cautiously by allowing their women folk to make offerings in their names since when cholera is choosing its victims haphazard up and down the alleys it is as well to ensure your life in every office that will accept you as a client ramanund of course and his immediate friends were above such mean trucklings they exerted themselves to keep the alley clean they actually subscribed to pay an extra sweeper they distributed cholera pills and the very soundest advice to their neighbours especially to those who persisted in using the old well ramanund indeed went so far as to circulate a pamphlet imploring those who from mistaken religious scruples would not drink from the hydrants to filter their water in support of which thesis he quoted learned sanskrit texts jai kali ma said the populace to each other when they read it such talk is pure blasphemy if she wishes blood shall she not drink it our fathers messed not with filters such things bring her wrath on the righteous even as now in this sickness footnote victory to mother kali yet they spoke calmly acquiescing in the inevitable from their side of the question just as ramanund and his like did from theirs for this passivity is characteristic of the racewhich yet needs only a casual match to make it flare into fanaticism so time passed until one day the moon being at the full and the alley lying mysterious utterly by reason of the white shining of its turreted roofs set as it were upon the solid darkness of the narrow lane below a new voice broke in on the reading of a paper regarding the sanitation of the vedic ages which ramanund was declaiming to some chosen friends jai kali ma said this voice also but the tone was different and the words rang fiercely is her arm shortened that it cannot save is it straightened that it cannot slay wait ye fools till the dark moon brings her night and ye shall see it came from a man with an evil hempsodden face and a body naked save for a saffroncoloured rag who smeared from head to foot with cowdung ashes was squatting on the threshold daubing it with cowdung and water for the evening worshippers had passed and he was at work betimes purifying the sacred spot against the morrows festival the listeners turned with a start to look at the strange yet familiar figure and ramanund cut short in his eloquence frowned but he resumed his paper which was in english without a pause being quick to do battle in words after the manner of new india these men base pretenders to the holiness of the sunnyasi are the curse of the country mean tricksters and rogues wandering like locusts through the land to prey on the timid fears of our modest countrywomen men who outrage the common sense in a thousand methods who the man behind him laughed shortly curse on master jee he saidfor curses they are by the sound though i know not the tongue for sure yea curse if thou likest and praise the new wisdom yet thouramanund brahmin son of those who tend herhast not forgotten the old forget it how can a man forget what he learnt in his mothers womb what he hath learnt in his second birth long years after prayer has passed from a mans life the sound of the our father may bring him back in thought to his mothers knee so it was with ramanund as in the silence which followed he watched by the flickering light of the cresset set on the ground between them his adversarys lips moving in the secret verse which none but the twiceborn may repeat it brought back to him as if it had been yesterday the time when halffrightened halfimportant he had heard it whispered in his ear for the first time when for the first time also he had felt the encircling thread of the twiceborn castes on his soft young body that thread which girdled him from the common herd which happed and wrapped him round with a righteousness not his own but imputed to him by divine law despite logarithms despite pure morality something thrilled in him half in exultation half in fear it was unforgetable and yet in a way he had forgottenforgotten what the question was troublesome so he gave it the goby quickly i have not forgotten the old wisdom jogi jee he said i hold more of it than thou with all thy trickery but remember this we of the sacred land will not stand downcountry cheating and if thou art caught at it here tis the lockup footnote the first aryan settlements were in the punjab if i am caught echoed the man as he drew a small earthen pot closer to him and began to stir its contents with his hand every now and again testing their consistency by letting a few drops fall from his lifted fingers back into the pot they were thick and red showing in the dim light like blood it is not we servants of dread kali who are caught tis ye faithless ones who have wandered from her ye who pretend to know a scoundrel when we see one broke in the schoolmaster his high thin tones rising and i do know one at least what is more i will have thee watched by the police dont put in one of the others in english what use to rouse anger needlessly such men are dangerous dangerous echoed ramanund their day is past the people believe in them still persisted another looking uneasily at the jogis scowl which in truth was not pleasant and such language is in my poor opinion descriptive of that calculated to cause a breach of peace remarked a rotund little pleader thus contrary to mores public in moderation lies safety and cowardice retorted ramanund returning purposely to hindustani and keeping his eager face full on the jogi it is because the people illiterate and ignorant believe in them that i advocate resistance let us purge the old pure faith of our fathers from the defilements which have crept in let us by the light of new wisdom revealing the old sweep from our land the nameless horrors which deface it let us teach our illiterate brothers and sisters to treat these priests of kali as they deserve and to cease worshipping that outrage on the very name of womanhood upstairsthat devil drunk with blood unsexed obscene he was proceeding after his wont stringing adjectives on a single thread of meaning when a triumphant yell startled him into a pause jai kali ma jai kali ma it seemed to fill the alley with harsh echoes blending into a guttural cruel laugh so be it brother let it be kali the eternal woman against thee ramanund the scholar i tell thee she will stretch out her left hand so here his own left hand reddened with the pigment he had been preparing for the purpose printed itself upon one lintel of the door and her right hand so here his right did the same for the other lintel and he paused obviously to give effect to the situation indeed his manner throughout had been intensely theatrical and this deft blending of the ordinary process of marking the threshold with a mysterious threat suitable to the occasion betrayed the habitual trafficker in superstitious fear and then jogi jee sneered ramanund imperturbably and then master jee cried his adversary his anger growing at his own impotence to impress as he clenched his reddened hands and stooped forward to bring his scowl closer to the calm contempt why then she will draw fools to her bosom bloody though they deem it and if they will not be drawn the words scarcely disturbed the stillness of the alley which was deserted save for that strange group outlined by the flicker of the cresset on the one side backed by the cavernous darkness of the low wide door was the naked savagelooking figure with its hands dripping still in heavy red drops stretched out in menace over the lamp on the other was ramanund backed by his friends decent civilised in their westerncut white clothing damn youyouyou brute the schoolmaster seldom swore when he did he used english oaths possibly because they seemed more alien to his own virtue on this occasion several came fluently as he fumbled for his pocket handkerchief for the jogi in answer to his taunt had reached out one of his red hands and drawn three curving fingers down the centre of ramanunds immaculate forehead the emblem of his discarded faith the bloody trident of siva showed there distinctly ere the modern hemstitched handkerchief wiped it away petulantly it was gone in a second yet ramanund even as he assured himself of the fact by persistent rubbing felt that it had somehow sunk more than skin deep the knowledge made him swear the harder and struggle vehemently against his comrades restraining hands it is a case for police and binding over to keep peace protested the pleader soothingly i will conduct same even on appeals to highest court without further charge in addition it is infra dig to disciples of the law and order thus to behave as the illiterate put in another while a third with less theory and more practice remarked that to use violence to a priest of kali on the threshold of her temple during her sacred month was as much as their lives were worth since god only knew how many a silent believer within earshot needed but one cry to come to the rescue of her servant especially now when the sickness was making men sensitive to her honour so in the end outraged civilisation contented itself by laying a formal charge of assault in the neighbouring police station against a certain religious mendicant name unknown supposed to have come from benares who in the public thoroughfare had infringed the liberty of one of her imperial majestys liege subjects by imprinting the symbol of a decadent faith on his forehead and thereinafter it repaired to the debating club where ramanund recovered his selfrespect in a more than usually perfervid outburst of eloquence so fervid indeed that one of the most forward lights in the province who happened to look in swore eternal friendship on the spot the result being that the two young men discussed every burning question under the sun as with arms interclasped ramanund saw his new acquaintance home to his lodgings thus it was past midnight ere he returned to his own and then he was so excited so intoxicated as it were by his own strong words that he strode down the narrow alley as if he were marching to victory and yet the alley itself was peace personified it was dark no longer for the great silver shield of the moon hung on the notched ribbon of pale sky between the roofs and its lightwith the nameless message of peace which seems inherent in itlay thick and white down to the very pavement there was scarcely a shadow anywhere save the odd foreshortened image of himself which kept pace behind ramanunds swift steps like a demon driving him to his doom the low wide door however showed like a cavern and the narrow stone stair struck chill after the heat outside perhaps that was why the young man shivered as he groped his way upwards amid the lingering scent of past incense the perfume of fallen flowers and the faint odour suggestive of the gay garments which had fluttered past not so long before or perhaps the twin passions of love and worship which even logarithms cannot destroy were roused in him by the memory of these things whatever it was something made him pause to hold his breath and listen on that threecornered landing where the brick and the stone met a speckled bar of moonlight glistened on the damp floor of the anteshrine and showed a dim arch or twothen darkness and all around him was that penetrating odour telling of things unseen almost unknown and yet strangely familiar to his inherited body and soul there was not a sound that was as it should be when gods slept like men when gods slept there was a sound nowthe sound of his own contemptuous laugh as he remembered his defiance of such divinitiesthe sound of his own steps as he passed suddenly impulsively into the anteshrine feeling it was time for such as he to worship while she slept helpless as humanity itself it was almost dark in the lowarched corridors with their massive pillars surrounding the central chamber on all sides but there in the holy of holies two smoking swinging lamps threw a yellow glare on the carved stone canopy which reached up into the shadows of the vaulted roof and by their light the hideous figure of the idol could be halfseen halfimagined through the fretted panels of the iron doors fastlocked on her sleep fretted panels giving glimpses no more of flamboyant arms crimson as blood and hung with faded flowers blood and flowers blood and flowers blending strangely with that lingering perfume of womanhood and worship with which the air was heavy hark what was that a step impossible surely at that hour of the night when even gods sleep and yet he drew back hastily into the further shadows forgetful of everything save sheer annoyance at the chance of being discovered in kalis shrine he of all men in the city yes it was a step in the anteshrine a light step and there emerging from the darkness of the corridors was a figure a womans figureor was it a childsdraped from head to foot in white ramanund felt a throb of philanthropic pity thrill through heart and brain even in his relief for this was some poor widow no doubt come on the sly to offer her illomened prayers and though he might rely on her rapt devotion allowing him to steal round the corridors unobserved the thought of the reason why she had come alone filled him with compassion partly because he was in truth a kindly soul partly because he was as it were pledged to such compassion footnote a widow brings illluck with her a widow certainly and yet surely little more than a child so slender so small was she that even on tiptoe her outstretched hand could not reach the clapper of the big bell which hung above her head once twice thrice she tried standing full in the flare of the lamp her veil falling back from the dark head closecropped like a boys and roughened almost into curls something in the sight made ramanund hold his breath again as he watched the disappointment grow to the small passionate face she will not listenshe will not hear no one ever listensno one it was not a cry it was only a girls whisper with a note of girlish fear rising above its pain but it echoed like a reveille to something which had till then been asleep in ramanund not listen was he not there in the dark listening was he not ready to helpgod how young and slender she was down there on her knees thrusting the chaplets she had brought through the fretwork fiercely mai kali mai listen listen the clear sharp voice rang passionately now echoing through the arches what have i done mother to be accursed why didst thou take him from memy beautiful young husbandfor they tell me he was young and beautiful and now they say that thou sendest the other for my loverthy priest but i will not mother if they kill me for it thou wouldst not give thyself to such as he kali ugly as thou artand i am pretty far prettier than the other girls who have husbands mai kali listen this oncethis once only kill me now when thou art killing so many and give me a husband in the next life or let me golet me be freefree to choose my own waymy own lover mother mother if thou wouldst only wakeif thou wouldst only listenif thou wouldst only look and see how pretty i am her voice died away amid that mingled perfume of love and worship of sex and religion which seemed to lie heavy on the breath making it come short truly the gods might sleep but man waked there in the shadow a man looked and listened till pity and passion set his brain and heart on fire the girl had risen to her feet again in her last hopeless appeal and now stood once more looking upwards at the silent bell her hands empty of their chaplets clenched in angry despair and a world of baffled life and youth in her childish face she will not listen she will not wake the whisper with its note of fear in it ended in a booming clang which forced a vibrating response from the dim arches as ramanunds nervous hand smote the big bell full and fair she turned with a low cry then stood silent till a slow smile came to her face mai kali had wakened indeed she had listened also and the lover had come ii the moonlit nights which had so often shown two ghostlike figures amid the shadows of kalis shrine had given place to dark ones and now save for a whisper there was no sign of life beneath the dim arches since as a rule those tworamanund and the woman fate had sent himshunned the smoky flare of the lamps and the halfseen watchfulness of that hideous figure within the closed fretwork doors yet sometimes little anunda would insist on their sitting right in the very threshold of the mother who she said would be angry if they distrusted her but at other times she would meet her lover finger to lip and lead him hastily to the darkest corner lest he should wake the goddess to direful anger at this desecration of her holy place then again she would laugh recklessly hang the chaplets she had brought with her round his neck cense him with sweet matches and tell him truthfully that he was the only god she feared altogether as he sat with his arm round her ramanund used often to wonder helplessly if it were not all a dream if so it was not the calm controlled dream he had cherished as the love story suitable to a professor of mathematics the heroine of that was to have been wise perhaps a little sad and anunda waswell it was difficult to say what she was save absolutely entrancing in her every mood she was like a firefly on a dark night flashing here and there brilliantly lucidly yet giving no clue to her own self except thisthat she did not match with the exact sciences nor for the matter of that with the situation for there were grave dangers in these nightly assignations in addition their surroundings were anything but cheerful anything but suitable to dreams cholera had the whole city in its grip now and as those two had whispered of love and life many a soul within earshot of a mans raised voice had passed out of both into the grave but anunda never seemed to think of these things she was the bravest and yet the timidest child alive at least so ramanund used to tell her fondly when she laughed at discovery and yet trembled at the very idea of marriage honestly she would have been quite satisfied to have him as her lover only but for the impossibility of keeping him on those terms an impossibility becauseas she told him with tearsshe was only on a visit to the brahmins downstairs and would have to return homewards when the dark month of kaliworship was over and here followed one of those talesscarcely credible to english earsof the coldblooded profligacy to which widows have to yield as the only means of making their lives bearable whereat ramanund set his teeth and swore he would have revenge some day meanwhile it made him all the more determined to save her and at the same time realise his cherished dream of defying his world by marrying a widow yet his boldness only had the effect of making little anunda more timid and cautious what need for names my lord she would say evasively when he pressed her for particulars of her past is it not enough that i am of pure brahmin race before kali my lord need have no fears for that and i have found favour in my lords eyes what then are the others to my lord let the wicked ones go but if people do such things they should be punished by the law fumed ramanund who even with her arms round him and a chaplet of chumpak blossom encircling his neck could not quite forget that he was a schoolmaster you forget that we live in a new age or perhaps you do not know it that is one of the things i must teach you sweetheart when we are married the slender bit of a hand which lay in his gave a queer little clasp of denial and the closecropped head on his shoulder stirred in a shake of incredulity we cannot marry i am a widow it would be betterso and the so was made doubly eloquent by the quiver of content with which yielding to the pressure of his arm she nestled closer to him ramanunds brain whirled as she had a knack of making it whirl but he stuck to his point manfully silly child of course we can marry the law does not forbid it and that is all we have to think of it is legal and no one has a right to interfere besides as i told you it is quite easy tomorrow the darkest night of kalis month is our opportunity every one will be wearied out by excitementhere his face hardened and his voice rose excitement i tell you it is disgraceful that these sacrifices should be permitted i admit they are nothing here to what they are down country but we of the sacred land should set an example the law should interfere to stop such demoralising brutalising scenes if we the educated were only allowed a voice in such matters if we were not gagged and blindfolded from engaging in the amelioration of our native land he paused and pulled himself up by bending down to kiss her in western fashion whereat she hid her face in quick shame for modesty is as much a matter of custom as anything else but i will teach you all this when we are married tomorrow then in the hour before dawn when the worshippers will be drunk with wine and blood you will meet me on the landingnot here child this will be no sight for you or me then ah it is horrible even to think of it the blood the needless reckless again he pulled himself up and went on i shall have a hired carriage at the end of the alley in which we will drive to the railway station and then anunda it will only be two ticketstwo railway tickets two railway tickets echoed anunda in muffled tones from his shoulder i came up in the railway from she paused then added quickly they put me in a cage and i cried you will not be put in a cage this time replied ramanund with a superior smile you will come with me and we will go to benares her face came up to his this time anxiously benares why benares because good and evil come alike from benares he answered exultantly mayhap you have been there anunda and seen the evil the superstition but it is in benares also that the true faith lives still my friend has written to his friends there and they will receive us with open arms virtuous women will shelter you till the marriage arrangements are complete she shook her head faintly we cannot be marriedi am a widow she repeated obstinately but i will go with you all the same then seeing a certain reproach in his face she frowned dost think i am wicked my lord i am not wicked at all but mai kali gave me a lover not a husband here the frown relaxed into a brilliant smile my husband is dead and i do not care for dead men i care for you my lord my god ramanunds brain whirled again but he clung to the first part of her speech as a safeguard you are foolish to say we cannot be married if you read the newspapers you would see that widowschildwidows such as you are heartsdelightare married regularly married by priests of our religion those old days of persecution are over anunda the law has legalised such unions and no one dare say a word a comical look came to her brilliant little face and my lords motherwill she say nothing the question pierced even ramanunds coat of culture he fully intended telling his revered parent of his approaching marriage and the thought of doing so even in the general way which he proposed to himself was fraught with sheer terror what then would it be when he had to present her with this daughterinlaw in the concrete he took refuge from realities by giving a lecture on the individual rights of man while anunda played like a child with the chumpak garland with which she had adorned him and so with a grey glimmer the rapid dawn began to dispute possession of those dim arches with the smoky flare of the lamps making those two rise reluctantly and steal with echoing footsteps past the malignant halfseen figure behind the closed fretwork doors the bloodred glint of those outstretched arms with their suggestion of clasping and closing on all within their reach must have roused a reminiscence of that past defiance in the young schoolmasters brain for he paused before the shrine his arms still round anunda to say triumphantly goodbye kali mai goodbye for ever the girl clinging to him fearfully looked round into the shadows on either side hush my lord who knows whether she really sleeps and she is in dangerous mood they say so her light foot marked her meaning by a tap on the echomy floor what reckless one said her lover in fond jest hast grown so full of courage that thou wouldst signal them to come art not afraid what they might do the panic on her face startled him ramu she whispered for my sake say it oncejai kali ma say it it will not hurt nothing will hurt anunda he answered sharply nothing can hurt can it not sometimes i have fancied downstairs that they suspect ramuif if they do what then tomorrow will see us far away i tell you the times are changed why there is a police station within hail almost nay sweetheart i will not say it come the dawn breaks for my sake ramu for my sake she pleaded even as he drew her with him reluctant yet willing and now on the landing where the brick and the stone met he paused again his pulses throbbing with passion to think that this was their last parting take heart beloved he whispered sure i am ram and thou art anunda who can hinder gods happiness when he gives it footnote ram anund ram god anund happiness the conceit upon the meaning of their names brought a faint smile to her face and yet once more she whispered doubtfully but this is happiness ah ramu it would be betterso it will be better he corrected it is quite easy hearts beloved a hired carriage and two railway tickets that is all as for mai kalii defy her suddenly through the darkness which seemed to hold them closer to each other came a sound making them start asunder it was the clang of the bell which hung before the shrine kali ma kali ma anundas pitiful little sobbing cry blent with the clang as she fled downstairs and the mingled sound sent a strange thrill of fear to ramanunds heart kali herself could not have heard but if there had been others beside themselves amid the shadows he climbed to his lodging on the roof full of vague anxiety and honest relief that the strain and the stress and the passion of the last fortnight was so nearly at an end it was lucky he told himself that it had happened during holiday time or the exact sciences must have sufferedfor of course the idea of anundas yielding to them was preposterous anunda who had made him forget everything save that he was her lover he fell asleep thinking of her and slept even through the wailing which arose ere long in the next lodging the wailing of a household over an only son reft from it by kali ma the wrath of the gods is on the house said ramanunds widowed mother when he came down late next morning and i wonder not when children disobey their parents but i will hear thy excuses no longer ramo god knows but my slackness hitherto hath been the cause of that poor boys death the holy man downstairs holds that she is angry for our want of faith and many folks believe him and vow some sacrifice of purification so shall i ramanund this very day i will speak to my cousin gungo of her daughter thou wilt do nothing of the kind mother replied ramanund quietly i have made my own arrangements i am going to marry a widow a young and virtuous widow he felt dimly surprised at his own courage perhaps a little elated seeing how severe the qualms of anticipation had been so he looked his mother in the face fairly as startled out of all senses save sight she stared at him as if he had been a ghost then suddenly she threw her arms above her head and beat her palms together fiercely mai kali mai kali justly art thou incensed ai kirpo ai bishun listen hear this is the cause my son the light of mine eyes the son of my prayers has done this thing he is the cursed one he would bring a widow to a brahmin hearth jai kali ma jai kali ma mother mother for gods sake pleaded ramanund aghast at the prospect of having the secret of his heart made bazaar property think give me time time she echoed wildly what time is there when folks die every minute for thy sin oh raino son of my prayer repentdo atonement lo come with me even now and humble thyself before her feet i will ask no more but that todayno more she thrust her hands feverishly into his as if to drag him to the shrine for my sake ramo for the sake of many a poor mother remember whose son thou art and forsake not thy fathers utterly mother he faltered mother and then silence fell between them for what words could bridge the gulf which the rapid flood of another nations learning had torn between these two a gulf not worn away by generations of culture but reft recklessly through solid earth simply there was nothing he felt to be said as with a heart aching at the utter impossibility of their ever understanding each other he did his best to sooth her superstitious fears but here he was met by a conviction an obstinacy which surprised him for he had been too much occupied during the last fortnight to observe the signs of the times around him and knew nothing of the religious terror which carefully fomented by the priests as a means of extortion had seized upon the neighbourhood when however it did dawn upon him that the general consensus of opinion lay towards a signal expression of the goddess anger which needed signal propitiation by more numerous sacrifices his indignation knew no bounds and carried him beyond the personal question into general condemnation so that ere many minutes were over she was attempting to sooth him in her turn that god was above all was however their one bond of unity in that they both agreed the truth would be made manifest by the sickness being stayed or increased by the sacrifices meanwhile the very thought of these latter while it roused his anger horrified his refinement into a certain silence and kept him prisoner to the roof all day for fear of meeting some struggling victim on its way upstairs to the second story this did not matter so much however since all his arrangements were made and he had even taken the precaution to secure his railway tickets through a branch of cooks agency which had been lately opened in the city he took them out of his pocket sometimes and looked at them feeling a vague comfort in their smug civilised appearance fate must needs be commonplace and secure surely with such vouchers for safe conduct as these so the long hot day dragged its slow length along every now and again the deathwail near or distant would rise in even discordant rhythm on the hot air and as the sun set it began loudly imperative under his very roof the only son was being carried out to the burning ghat and the cries and sobs utterly overwhelmed the shouts and shufflings of feet the moans and murmur of voices which all day long had come from the second story it was a relief that it should be so that the ear might no longer be all unwillingly on the strain to catch some sound that would tell of a deathstruggle in the slaughterhouse downstairs and yet the scene being enacted perchance on that threecornered landing which for once visualised itself to ramanunds clear brain was not one in which to find much consolation the crowds of mourners edging the bier down the narrow stairs the crowd of worshippers dragging the victims up he wondered which stood aside to give place to the otherthe living or the dead the flowerdecked corpse or the flowerdecked victim flowers and blood blood and flowers for a demon of death who was satisfied with neither ramanund excited overstrained wearied by many a sleepless night of happiness covered his face with his hands to shut out the sight even of the book which he tried to read so as the sun sunk red in the western haze leaving the roof cooler he fell asleep and slept soundly when he woke it was dark and yet as he stood up stretching himself a faint paling of the horizon warned him that there was light beneath itlight that was coming to the world the moon confused as he was by sleep the thought came to him only to be set aside by memory there was no moon for this was the dark night of kali the dark night then that must be the dawn when he had promised to meet anunda on the threshold was it possible that he had slept so long yet not too long since the dawn had not yet come and he was ready hurriedly feeling for the safety of those precious tickets and taking up a gladstone bag which he had already packed he stole down from the roof cautiously and from thence to the landing there was a new odour now blending with the perfumes of the flowers and the incense and the women an odour which sickened him as he stood waiting and watching in the now deserted threshold it was the odour of the shambles an odour which seemed also to lie heavy on the breath and shorten it so by quick strides the grey glimmer through the stone lattice grew and grew to whiteness yet no one came and there was no light step on the staircase below to tell of a latecomer anunda anunda he whispered more than once even his low tones seeming to stir the heavy atmosphere into waves of sweet sickening perfume was it possible that she was waiting for him withinin the old place that must be it surely or else something had happened what with a beating heart he moved on into the anteshrine picking his steps in an almost morbid terror of what he might be treading upon anunda anunda there was no answer save heavier than before that sort of scented wave coming back from his own words she was not there and something must have happened not there impossible with those tickets in his pocket that hired carriage waiting at the end of the alley that police station round the corner he strode forward with renewed courage heedless of the damp clamminess at his feet strode recklessly right into the yellow flare of the lamps save for that ghastly crimson upon the floor the walls the canopy the place lay unchanged and quiet as the grave no there was a change the iron doors were open and there upon the low stoneslab before those clutching arms lay something god in heaven what was it a heada small dark ramanunds scream caught in the big bell which hung above him and the last thing he heard as he fell forward on that crimson floor was its faint booming echo of his own cry when he came to himself again six weeks had passed by the heat was over the cholera had gone and he lay in one of the new wards of a new hospital whither his anxious friends had had him conveyed when they found how ill he was the very strangeness of his environment held him silent for the first few moments of consciousness then with a rush it all came back upon him and weak as he was he sat up in bed wildly anunda anunda my god the shrinethe blood it is a bad sign remarked the doctor to one of his friends significantly when they had persuaded him to lie down again quietly more from inability to sit up than from obedience it is a bad sign when the delusions remain after the fever has left the brain however it is early days yet and we must hope for the best you should rid your mind of such things said the pleader a week or two afterwards when despite ramanunds growing strength of body he still reverted again and again to that terrible dark night of kali imploring them to search out the criminals and have them brought to justice there is pardon me not a tittle of evidence for truth of your story but circumstantial proof to contrary as i will state categorically first known dislike to and hatred for kali and such like leading to language in my hearing calculated to break the peace second known excitement consequent perhaps on general sickness stress of examinations before holiday times and such like leading to general look of fatigue and absentmindedness noticeable to friends as myself third known physical horror of blood leading to much recrimination of sacrifices and such like even to extent of shutting yourself up all day as per mothers evidence from fear of disagreeables finally profound feverish sleep watched by same mother with dubiosity several times ending in sleepwalk to the reeking shrine where you are found by brahmins after dawn unconscious what can be closer chain of convincing proof we have made every inquiry said his other friends soothingly short of informing the police and we can find no trace of what you assert human sacrifices in times of great sickness may sometimes doubtless be on the tapis but this one we believe is but figment of a still clouded brain you must have patience all will come clear in time and when he asked for his new friend the friend in whom he had partly confided his love story they shook their heads sadly he was almost last victim to cholera they said the cause has lost a shining light all the more need ramanund why thou shouldst shake off these idle fancies and be our leader to perfect freedom of thought and action perfect freedom of thought and action ramanund as he lay slowly recovering of his brain fever wondered if he would ever have the heart to believe in such a thing again wondered if he would ever again dare to call himself a representative of indiathat india which had killed anunda for that the horrible sight he had seen on the slab of stone beneath kalis clutching arms was no dream or delusion but a reality he never for an instant doubted why they had done her to death was the only uncertainty which tortured him as he lay hopelessly silent silent because there was no use in words when none believed them had it been simply a religious sacrifice to stay the plaguea sacrifice known to thousands who would guard the secret as a divine obligation the choice falling naturally enough on one who was a stranger and utterly helpless in the hands of her priestly relations or was it merely the jogis revenge for his challenge or was it jealousy had they discovered the intrigue and was the man who had drawn the trident of siva on his forehead also the man of whom poor little anunda had spoken with such terror yet what did it matter since she was dead what did anything matter beside the memory of that piteous whisper oh ramu it would be betterso ah why had he tried to interfere with the old wayswhy had he sought for morewhy had he not let her be happy while she could in her own way when he left the hospital he found his mother installed in a new lodging it would not be good for him his friends had said to return to the old environment while his mind was still clouded by delusions so she had performed the utmost act of selfdenial of which an hindu woman is capable and removed herself and her belongings from the house where she had lived her life but she would have done anything for ramanund at any time how much more so now when the goddess had shown that she still held him as her faithful servant by signs and wonders had she not drawn him in his sleep to her very feet on her dark nighthe who would never cross her threshold and had he not been found there prostrate amid the blood of sacrifices with one of her garlands round his neckhe who would never wear a flower a garland faltered ramanund when she told him this exultantly ay a garland which she would cherish as her dearest possession since the goddess herself must have thrown it around hima garland which she should show himifif he ever again talked foolishness as he had talked that day when he had frightened her so not knowing that he was already in a fever show it me now mother he said quietly so she showed it to him the chumpak blossoms were but yellow shreds upon a string scentless unrecognisable here and there clogged black with the blood of sacrifice which had stained them as he fell take it away he cried fiercely thrusting it from him take it away oh curses on the crueltycurses on the jai kali ma interrupted his mother as she laid the relic back in the little casket whence she had taken it jai kali ma for she stayed the sickness ramanund looked at her in dull dazed wonder but it was true what she said the cholera had slackened from that very time when he had been found lying at the goddess feet gloryofwoman this is the story of a backwater one of those still nooks sheltered by sedges whither the sere and yellow leaves drift and rest while the current beyond slips by swift as ever why this particular backwater should have called itself a technical school of artneedlework has nothing to do with the story briefly it was a sort of almshouse where twelve old mohammedan ladies drew a poor monthly pittance of some few rupees and sat contentedly enough year after year twining gold thread on to fine net what became of the work when it was done has also nothing to do with the story perhaps it was sold to eke out the funds of a charity which did its fair share of solacing sorrow in keeping twelve pairs of small soft highbred hands from the quernhandle that last resource of the poor in india now as it was when the great mogul refused to allow the importation of western machinery on the ground that gods best gift to the poor was the millstone about their necks it was in this odd little courtyard packed away decorously in the very heart of the looseliving gambling goldworkers quarter that gloryofwoman found shelter after many years of patient peaceful privation for fakrunnissa that was how her name ran in the soft courtly tongue of the most brutal of cities was a syyedani in other words of the poorest and proudest too poor to bring a dowry to a husband of her own rank too generous to take one without it too proud to stoop to a partner beneath heror rather too gentle too conservative there are hundreds such women in delhi and fakrunnissa had been more fortunate than most seeing that being learned in the koran she had kept body and soul together by recitations at fast and festival in the zenanas and so been spared hard labour perhaps it was this which made her look younger than her fifty and odd years at all events there was scarcely a wrinkle on her small oval face and her tall slender figure showed no sign of age she was the youngest of the scholars and every evening when the gold thread and the filmy net had been locked away in a queer little carven coffer she was the last to slip her small feet into one of those twelve pairs of curly shoes which all day long had been ranged against the slip of wall doing duty as a screen at the door and the last to use the rickety dhooli which the charity provided for the modest conveyance of the fair ones to their homes it provided a chaperone too in the shape of a big lump of a girl about twenty who sat on the steps all day chattering to the passersby giggling at their jokes and chewing pan it was a queer arrangement seeing that khadjiya khanum the eldest of the scholars was past eighty but then age had nothing to do with the fact that she was a syyedani and juntu only a gadabout there was another pair of shoes however placed in a corner apart from the rest for it had come to be a recognised custom in the backwater that there should always be a thirteenth pair of feet ready to slip into any vacancy made by the sure decay which comes alike to rest as to unrest and so five years before when fakrunnissa had stepped into the last pair of shoes left by a deserted wife who had gone down into the grave leaving one forlorn daughter behind her the old ladies had cast about to choose a suitable aspirant not that they really had the right to appoint any one but because experience showed them that the claims of a gratuitous worker were seldom overlooked when opportunity came for urging them this time the choice fell naturally enough on the daughter of the dead scholar just in her teens she was hopelessly alone in the world for her mother after estranging her own people by a marriage with a mohammedan rajpoot had quarrelled with her husbands family but not before little yasmin had been married and had according to the ranghar custom become a widow for life by the death of her childish bridegroom for race is stronger than religion and the old rajpoot ideas have survived conversion so yasmin in her turn waited for a vacancy in the shoes or rather noorbanu waited since the old ladies would have nothing to do with the flowery halfheathen name and set themselves diligently to transform her into a ladyoflight it was not altogether a successful attempt for the girls wild rajpoot blood waxed rebellious sometimes but as a rule fakrunnissas soft voice with its polished periods and careful intonation would bring her back to obedience lo thou shouldst mind me hearts delight gloryofwoman would say with a smile do i not stand in thy mothers shoes thou art young now yasmina so was i once yet thou wilt be as i am some day and yasmina would make a face well that is better than being like khadjiya khanum or maimana begum with her little eyes so the years passed bringing no blank to the roll of highsounding names no break in the row of shoes no vacant place in the semicircle of old women which chased the sunshine round the court during the cold months and the shade during the hot ones for they felt the stress of the seasons in their old bones otherwise winter and summer were alike to them as was the green leaf and the sere since they had never seen either but yasmin felt the springtime in her blood and began to weary of being at every ones beck and call she is a ranghar bury a dogs tail for twelve years and it will still be crooked said maimana begum she was full to the brim of proverbial wisdom and had a little clique of her own in that semicircle of flimsy net glittering gold thread and withered hands mumtaza mahuls head and those of half a dozen lights or desires or ornaments of the palace the world or of woman wagged in assent to her words it was easy to change a name but not a nature and had every one heard that some one had seen noorbanu talking to a woman with whom she ought not to have been talking gloryofwomans thin face grew eager tis a cousin mai khadjiya the girl told me of it and i have inquired a cousin of the fathers marriedyea married indeed to a trooper like he is serving the sirkar somewhere such folks lose hold on old ways yet mean no harm we must not judge them as ourselves wah fakrunnissa wouldst say the devil meant no harm next thy heart spoils thy faith i marvel at thee thou who dost fast and pray more than is needful the ring of bitterness in old khadjiyas tones was explained by the fact that it was nigh the end of the first ten days fast of mohurrumtide and she had not chosen that any despite her age should exceed her in the observance thereof and fakrunnissas zeal had raised the price of selfcomplacency beyond reason more than is needful echoed maimana begum with a like tartness art not rash to say so mai khadjiya sure the virtue of some folk is situate as the tongue among thirtytwo teeth it needs care to preserve itself the white shrouded figures chuckled they were not really illhumoured or evilly disposed towards gloryofwoman it was simply that her excellent example had made all their old bodies rather fretful and as for the girl continued the acrid voice she is a cat on the wall god only knows on which side she will jump down fakrunnissas eyes flashed and her fingers entangled themselves in the gold thread then for sure it is our part to make the right side more pleasant than the wrong not to be always finding fault because she is young yea tis so for look you it seems ever to me that we are to blamethat we are in her place five long years is it since she hath waited khadjiya khanums hands dropped from her work and flew out in vehement crackings of every joint against illluck tobah tobah for shame for shame mistress fakrunnissa die if thou wilt to make room for the hussy as for me i wait on the will of the lord a murmur of assent ran through the semicircle once more nay nay i meant not so protested fakrunnissa hastily lo death comes to all and goeth not by age i meant but thissure tis hard to put it to wordsthat the old should make room for the young or make the waiting bearable tchu if the heart be set on a frog what doth it care for a fairy insisted the hoarder of other folks wisdom dost mean to hint that in this place the girl hath not had virtue set constantly before her ay and preached too it seems to me that we have it almost to satiety is it not so sisters once more the chuckle ran round the circle and gloryofwoman sat still more upright amongst thy other proverbs canst not recollect the one which says between the two priests the fowl killed for dinner became unlawful to eat then the temper died from her face and she went on in a softer tone i find no harm in the girl and what wrong hath she done this day more than another no more for sure put in mumtaza mahul since she is late at work every day that is no new thing is it sisters yet she finishes her task as quick as anyas i anyhow persisted yasminas advocate who having come to the gold thread late in life found it apt to knot wahillah what a fuss about a wilful girl put in a new voice she is no worse than others and needs restraint no more she hath grown saucy since we gave her money instead of broken victuals put her back to the old footing say i when she had nought of her own khadjiya khanums veiled head nodded sagely thou hast it hamedabanu lo i for one know not why the girl was ever given such freedom save indeed that it tallies with fakrunnissas indecent hastening of providence i am for the old plan and iand iand iassented a chorus of set certain voices gloryofwomans fingers flew faster then will ye drive the girl from us altogether i know it i feel it yea i fakrunnissa singer of the koran till my tone failed me remember itthose days when some other song seemed better and one must needs sing it think sisters remember the eyes of the body are two the eye of the soul is one the work had dropped from her hands which were stretched out in eager entreaty tis but patience for a year or two then since there is no harm in her she will settle down asas ias i did tis but the youth in her veins and god knows that is soon past for a woman yet ones glory remains her voice regaining some of its past strength recollecting all its old skill under the stimulus of both memory and hope filled the little courtyardand availed nothing half an hour afterwards struck dumb as sensitive natures are by the stress of passion around her she was watching with stupid inaction yasmins final vengeance on that decorous row of curly shoes behind the screening wall to right and left to this corner and that they sped before the reckless young feet while the reckless young voice rose in mockery lo i wait no longer for old womens shoes i will have new ones of my own khujju and mujju and the rest of ye can sort them for yourselves or go down to the grave one foot at a time as seemeth to ye best i care not i wait no longer one pair flew full in maimana begums face and then came a pause before the last pair an odd sound between a laugh and a sob a sudden sweep of the net veil over the shoulder and a halfdefiant nod to the old white fingers these shall stay because they were my mothers and because the next moment she was gone leaving the twelve old women sitting in the sunshine breathless silenced by her youth her unreason her fire even fakrunnissa had no word of defence but after a time when juntu full of smiles and winks came from the steps to aid the cackle which arose as the silencing effect of the shock wore away gloryofwoman began to feel the old pain at her heart once more because they were my mothers and because she could fill up the pause in two ways because they are yours and you have been kinder than the others because they should by rights be mine both answers were disturbing she leaned back against the wall pressing her thin hands to the thin breast which had known so little of a womans life save only that craving for another song towards the bazaar sayest thou came khadjiyas wrathfully satisfied voice to the bazaar and in mohurrumtide too that means the worst and we were none too soon in getting rid of her heaven be praised the cousin lives close to the chowk put in fakrunnissa faintly mayhap the girl goes there juntu laughed the cousin is a bad one no better whereat maimana begum remarked sagely that whether the knife fell on the melon or the melon on the knife was all one the melon suffered yasmins reputation was hopelessly hurt by that going bazaarwards for a syyedani perchance retorted juntu with some acerbity yet this i say there is no harm in the girl though she be younger than some folk who need dhoolis to their virtue she hated the proverbmonger who never from years end to years end gave her a cowrie or so much even as a word of thanks and then being mohurrumtide when in all pious houses the assemblage of mourning must be held the work was folded away in the old carved coffer the desecrated shoes sorted into pairs and one by one the old ladies were smuggled into the curtained dhooli and trotted away to their homes with buxom juntu chattering and laughing alongside dost recite the mursiah at the nawabs this year fakrunnissa asked humedabanu wrapping herself carefully in a thick white veil footnote the dirge in honour of the martyred hussan and hussain gloryofwoman shook her head they have a new one last mohurrum i grew hoarse perhaps twas the fever it had held me for days fever echoed the other say rather the fasting thou hast a dead look in the face even now and as for me god knows whether i feel hungry or sick thou shouldst remember that thou art growing old i do remember it said fakrunnissa half to herself in truth she did as she sate awaiting her turn for the curtained dhooli she felt very cold very helpless yasmin whom she had loved had broken loose from all tradition and gone bazaarwards the very idea was terrifying the brain behind that high narrow forehead of fakrunnissas could barely grasp the situation for fifty years it had circled round the one central duty of pious seclusion and yasmins choice seemed almost incredible for there was no harm in the girl she had always been responsive to kind words if she fakrunnissa could only have had speech with her alone the thought made her restless and sent her to the door to peep closely veiled round the screen and watch the dhooli containing humedabanu disappear from the steps yet she had done her best giving the girl in secret what she could spare of the pittance and this year there would be no recitationfees to eke out the remainder perhaps the others were right and this generosity of hers had fostered the girls independence khadjiya and maimana would say so for sure if they knew then was she to blameshe who loved the girl who had taken the mothers shoes the mere possibility was a terror to the conscience where the womanhood that was in her had found its only chance of blossoming it is the same east and west gloryofwoman as she stood tall and thin leaning against the dull brick screen had as much claim to saintship as any in the canonised calendar and wherefore not had not she spent nearly fifty years in learning the lives of the saints by heart and chanting the dirge of martyred virtue it came back to her dimly as she stood there the sombre dresses of the mourning assemblage the glittering imambarah dressed with such care by reverent hands and then her own voice above the answering chorus of moaning and sobbing she had power then she was helpless now helpless and old yet not old enough apparently to die though when all was said and done it was not her turn but khadjiya khanums yet she had taken the mothers shoes and had sat there silent when perhaps a word from her might have saved that awful journey to the bazaar then the thought came to her that the saints were never helplessnot even the blessed fatima herselfgloryofwoman had fasted and prayed for long days and nights she felt miserably ill in soul and body in the very mood therefore to slip her feet into the pair of shoes yasmins recklessness had spared and almost as recklessly pass without a pause to the doorstep the next instant she was back again in shelter breathless palpitating yet might it not be the voice of god and no one would know she might be back ere juntu returned and even if she were not the gadabout had a kind heart besides another rupee from the pittance would silence her in any case footnote a model of the martyrs shrine a permanent erection whereas the tazzias used for the procession are afterwards burned there is a celebrated imambarah at lucknow imported from england east and west nothing is impossible to such religious exaltation as changed the slow current in fakrunnissas veins to a stream of fire scorching and shrivelling every thought save the onethat she stood in the mothers shoes yet had said no word she wrapped her thick shroud of a veil tighter round her and stepped deliberately into the alley the glory of woman its motherhood was hers indeed in that instant though she did not realise it though the thin breast heaving with her quickened breath had never felt the lipclasp of a child it was a long low room opening by arches to a wooden balcony without into which halffainting with pure physical fatigue she stumbled after heaven knows what trivialyet to her sheer ignorance almost awfuldifficulties by the way yet she was not afraid indeed as she had passed through the crowded streets it had been wonder which had come to her that this should be a time of fasting and mourning and yet none seem to care had the world no time to bewail dead virtue had it forgotten the faith and this too was no mourning assemblage though in some of the faces of the lounging men she recognised the features of her own race the race of the prophet himself had they forgotten also she shrank back an instant untilbeside a flaunting woman whose profession was writ large enough for even fifty years of pious seclusion to decipher it instinctivelyshe saw a slender figure crouching halfsullen halfdefiant the face was still veiled but she knew it yasmin she cried breathlessly come back come back to us the girl sprang to her feet with a fierce cry and was beside the tall white form in an instant screening it with swift arms that strove to force it back go i say go why art thou here thou shouldst not have come hither go see i will come also if thou wilt not go without me not so fast my pigeon tittered the flaunting woman answering the halfsurprised looks of the men with nods and winks thou art in my charge now since thou hast left the saints who is this woman let her speak her claim yasmins hand flew to fakrunnissas mouth not a word amma not a word see i will go quick let us go footnote a pet name for mother or nurse the surprise had lessened and a mans voice rose with a laugh what let thee go for nothing with an unknown nay mistress chambele that were unwise she is thy cousin the claims of kinship must be considered the claims of numbers too put in another let the veiled one unveil since she has come among us nay brothers interrupted a third hastily in a lower voice mayhap she is one of the saintly women and a laugh checked the speech so much the better what doth a saint here some one had barred the doorway with thrustout arm and half a dozen others with jeering faces lounged against the wall crying languidly unveil unveil but yasmins arms clasped close i will go she panted i will go with her sheshe is my mother chambeles titter rang high and shrill wah that is a tale see you friends her mother hath been dead five years enough of this little fool thou hast made thy choice already there is no place for thee yonder with the saints she hath her mothers cried fakrunnissa freeing herself from yasmins hold with new strength born of the girls words lo she speaks truth my sister i stand in her mothers shoes let her go in peace and she shall have them surely something in the urbane polish of her speech awoke memory in the men and one older than the rest said with a frown yea tis enough chambele let the woman go and the child also if she wish it she will come back another day if she be of this sort if not there are others but not without a ransom interrupted one with an evil face and evil eyes which had seen enough of yasmins figure beneath the veil to think her presence gave unwonted piquancy to the business yea a ransom a ransom for coming here and spoiling pleasure let the saint pay the price of the sinner unveil unveil cried half a dozen jeering voices the sunshine without streamed through the arches in broad bands upon the floor but fakrunnissas tall muffled figure stood in shadow by the door a fighting quail was calling boastfully from a shrouded cage over the way the cries of the noisy bazaar floated up to the balcony a harmonious background to chambeles noisier laugh then suddenly came a step forward into the sunlight and the heavy white veil fell in billowy curves like a cloud about fakrunnissas feet for the first time in her life gloryofwoman stood unsheltered from the gaze of mens eyes and those eyes saw something worth seeing despite her fifty and odd years a woman beautiful in her age graceful as ever in the sweeping white draperies of the graceful delhi dress but a woman forgetful utterly of the womanhood even of the motherhood in her as with one swift outspreading of the arms she broke into the opening lines of the mursiah that dirge of martyred virtue which is as closely interwoven with all that is best in the life of a mussulman as hark the herald angels sing is with the christians tender memories of home a dirge sacred to the day and the hour a dirge forgotten by this new world fakrunnissa remembered nothing else many and many a time listless indifferent hearts had responded to the fervour of her declamation womens hearts it is true and that was a womans derisive laugh but above it rose a mans swift curse commanding silence for all save that skilful voice and not silence onlyfor that was a sigh so the cadences rang truer and stronger out into the sunlight making the passersby pause to listen an assemblage at chambeles house sneered some one that is a sinners ransom indeed but gloryofwoman heard nothing save those responsive sighs saw nothing but the orthodox beatings of the breast with which one or two of the elder men gave in to custom the last ameen left her still blind still deaf then came a laugh with half her years id take the saint before the sinner said the man with the evil face gloryofwoman stood for a second as if turned to stone then she threw up her hands with a cry and sank in a huddled heap upon the white curves of her fallen veil god smite your soul to eternal damnation cried a mans voice but gloryofwoman was to hear no mans voice again she had kept her promise and the last pair of curly shoes behind the screen was vacant in due time noorbanu slipped into them for the eleven old ladies and juntu made peace with her for the sake of fakrunnissa lo the ways of providence are not our ways said khadjiya khanum piously over her horn spectacles and she was ever in a hurry for my part i wait on the will of the lord maimana begum cackled under her breath hairoil is wasted on a bald head she said in a whisper to humedabanu her time is near hurry or no hurry who comes must go at the great durbar he sat cuddled up in a creamcoloured cotton blanket edged with crimson shooing away the brown rats from the curved cobs of indian corn the soft mists of a northern november hung over the landscape in varying density heavy over the dank sugarcane patch by the well lighter on the green fodder crop dewy among the moistureloving leaves of the sprouting vetches and here in the field of ripening maize scarcely visible between the sparse stems he was an old man with a thin white beard tucked away behind his ears and a kindly look on his highfeatured face every now and then he took up a little clod of earth from the dry crumbling ridge of soil which divided the field he was watching from the surrounding ones and threw it carefully among the maize saying in a gentle grumbling voice ari brothers does no shame come to you it had no perceptible effect on the rats who owing to the extreme sparsity of the crop could be seen every here and there deliberately climbing up a swaying stem to seat themselves on a cob and begin breakfast systematically in the calm windless silence you could almost hear the rustle and rasp of their sharp white teeth but nanuk singhas might have been predicted from his seventy and odd years of life in the fieldswas somewhat hard of hearing somewhat near of vision also for when so many years have been spent watching the present furrow cling to the curves of the past one in sure and certain hope of similar furrows in the future or in listening to the endless lamentations of a waterwheel ceasing not by day or night to proclaim an eternity of toil and harvest both eyes and ears are apt to grow dull towards new sights and sounds nanuks had at any rate even though the old familiar ones no longer occupied them fate having decreed that in his old age the peasant farmer should have neither furrows nor waterwheel of his own how this had come about needs a whole statute book of western laws to understand nanuk himself never attempted the task to him it was briefly the will of god his districtofficer however when the case fell under his notice by reason of the transfer of the land thought differently and having a few minutes leisure from office drudgery to spare for really important work made yet one more representation regarding the scandalous rates of interest the cruelty of timeforeclosures and the general injustice of applying the maxim caveat emptor to transactions in which one party is practically a child and the other a jew a futile representation of course since the government so experts affirm is not strong enough to attack the frankenstein monster of law which it has created in a measure nevertheless old nanuk was right in attributing his ruin to fate since it had followed naturally from the death of his three sons one the eldest dying of malarial fever in the prime of life leaving alas a young family of girls another the youngest swept off by cholera just as his hand began to close firmly round his dead brothers ploughhandle the third when on the eve of getting his discharge from a frontier regiment in order to take his brothers places by his fathers side being struck down ingloriously in one of the petty border raids of which our punjab peasant soldiers have always to bear the brunt and this loss of able hands led inevitably to the loss of illkept oxen while from the lack of wellcattle came that gradual shrinkage of the irrigated area where some crop is certainrain or no rainwhich means a less gradual sinking further and further into debt until as had been the case with nanuk the owner loses all right in the land save the doubtful one of toil even this had passed from the old mans slackening hold after his wife died and the daughtersinlaw with starvation staring them in the face had drifted away back to their own homes leaving him to live as best he could on the acre or so of unirrigated land lent to him out of sheer charity for public opinion still has some power over the usurer in a village of strong men and all his fellows respected old nanuk who stood six feet two barefoot and had tales to tell of the gentle art of singlestick as applied to the equitable settling of accounts in the old days before western laws had taken the job out of the creditors hands strangely enough however nanuk as he sat coping inadequately with the brown rats felt less resentment against the usurer who had robbed him or the law which permitted the robbery than he did against the weather the former had made no pretence of favouring him the latter year after year had tempted his farmers soul to lavish sowings by copious rain at seed time and thereinafter withheld the moisture necessary for a bare return of measure for measure briefly he had gambled in grain and he had lost lost hopelessly in this last harvest of maize since when the sound cobs should be separated from those which the wanton teeth had spoilt they would not yield the amount of government revenue which the old man had to pay certainly would not do so if the cobs became scarcer day by day and the rats more throng in fact the necessity for action ere matters grew worse appeared to strike nanuk making him after a time draw out a small sickle and begin to harvest the remaining stalks one by one bullah neighbour nanuk cried the new man who better equipped for the tasks with sons and cattle was driving the wheel and curving the furrows for the usurer i would for thy sake the task was harder and as if the crop were not poor enough the dissolute rats must needs play the wanton with the half of it but tis the same all over the land and between them and the revenue we poor folk of the plough will have no share nanuk stood looking meditatively at a very fine cob out of which a pair of sharp white teeth were taking a last nibble while a pair of wicked black eyes watched him fearlessly they are gods creatures also and have a right to live on the soil as we others he said slowly then they should pay the revenue grumbled dittu why should you who have no crop whereon to pay ai teri he added sharply to one of the oxen he was driving to their work sleepest thou and the well silent dost want to bring me to nanuks plight so with a prod of the goad he passed on leaving old nanuk still looking at the brown rat on the corncob why indeed should he have to pay for gods other creatures in the old days justice would have been meted out to such as he the crop would have been divided into heaps so many for the owner of the soil so many for the tiller so many for the state then if purameshwar sent rats instead of rain the heaps were smaller that was all and if the equity of this had been patent to those older rulers who had scarcely given a thought in other ways to the good of their subjects why should it not be patent to those new ones who god keep them gave justice without respect of persons so far as in them lay there must be a mistake somewhere the facts could not have been properly placed before the latsahibthat viceregent of god upon earth this conviction came home slowly to the old man as he finished his harvesting slowly but surely so that when he had spread the cobs out to dry on his cotton blanket he walked over to the well and between the whiffs of the general pipe hinted that he thought of laying the matter before the authorities i will take the produce of my field he said in my handit will not be more than five seers when the good is sifted from the badand i will say to the latsahib this is because purameshwar sent rats instead of rain take your share and ask no more footnote the great god dittu the new man laughed scornfully better take a rat also since all parties to the case must be present by the law he intended it as a joke but nanuk took it quite seriously that is true he assented i will take a rat also then there can be no mistake that evening when he sat with his cronies on the mud dais beneath the peepul tree where he was welcome to a pull out of anybodys pipe he spoke again of his intention the younger folk laughed but the seniors thought that it could at least do no harm nanuks case was a hard one it was quite clear he could not pay the revenue and it was better to go to the fountainhead in such matters since underlings could do nothing but take fees so while the stars came out in the evening sky they sat and told tales of nausherwan and many another worthy whose memory lingers in native minds by reason of perfectly irrational acts of despotic clemency such as even socialists do not dream of nowadays the corncobs then being harvested dried and shelled he set to work with the utmost solemnity on rattraps but here at once he realised his mistake by harvesting his own crop he had driven the little raiders further afield and though he could easily have caught one in his neighbours patch a desire to deal perfectly fair with those who in his experience dealt perfectly fairly with facts made him stipulate for a rat out of his own this necessitated the baiting of his property with some of the corn in order to attract the wanton creatures again and even then though he sat for hours holding the cord by which an earthen dish was to be made to fall upon the unsuspecting intruder he was unsuccessful trra not catch rats cried a most venerable old pantaloon to whom he applied for advice remembering him in his boyhood as one almost godlike in his supreme knowledge of such things wait awhile tis a tricka mere trickbut when you once know it you cannot forget it all that day the old men sat together in the sunshine profoundly busy and towards evening they went forth together to the field chattering and laughing like a couple of schoolboys it was long after dusk ere they returned full of mutual recrimination the one had coughed too much the other had wheezed perpetually there was no catching of rats possible under such circumstances then the old pantaloon went ahunting by himself full of confidence only to return dejected then nanuk full of determination sat up all one moonlight night in the field wherenow that he had no crop to benefit by itthe nightdew gathered heavily on every leaf and blade on nanuk too as he sat crouched up in his cotton blanket thinking of what he should say to the latsahib when the rat was caught which it was not finally with angry misgivings as to the capabilities of the present generation of boys the old pantaloon suggested the offering of one whole anna for the first rat captured in nanuks maizefield before the day was over a score or two of the village lads longlimbed brighteyed were vociferously maintaining the prior claims of as many brown rats safely confined in little earthen pipkins with a rag tied round the top they stood in a row like an offering of sweets to some deity round nanuks bed foras was not to be wondered at after his nightwatchhe was down with an attack of the chills that was nothing new he had had them every autumn since he was born but he was not accustomed to be surrounded on such occasions by brown rats appealing to him for justice it ended in his with feverish hands giving one anna to each of the boys and reserving his selection until he was in a more judicial frame of mind still it would not do to starve gods creatures so every morning while the fever lingeredfor it had got a grip on him somehowhe went round the pipkins and fed the rats with some of the maize and every morning rather to his relief there were fewer of them to feed since they nibbled their way out once they discovered that the top of their prison was but cloth so as he lay sometimes hot sometimes cold the idea came to him foolishly enough that this was a process of divine selection and that if he only waited the day when but one rat should remain his mission would bear the seal of success an idea like this only needs presentation to a mind or lack of mind like old nanuks so what with the harvesting and the ratcatching and the fever and the omenawaiting it was close on the new year when with a brown rat now quite tame tied up in a pipkin some five seers of good grain tied up in the corner of his cotton blanket and heaven knows what a curious conglomeration of thought bound up in his still feverish brain the old man set out from his village to find the latsahib such things are still done in india such figures are still to be seen making some civilised people stand out of the road bareheaded as they do to a man on his way to the gravea man who has lived his life whose day is past owing also to the fever and the paying for rats etc old nanuks pockets were illprovided for the journey but that mattered little in a country where a pilgrimage on foot is in itself presumptive evidence of saintship besides the brown ratto which nanuk had attached a string lest one of the parties to the suit might escape him on the roadwas a perpetual joy to the village children who scarcely knew if it were greater fun to peep at it in its pipkin or see it peeping out of the old mans cotton blanket when in the evenings it nibbled away at its share of nanuks dinner they used to ask endless questions as to why he carried it about and what he was going to do with it until half in jest half in earnest he told them he was the mudaee plaintiff and the rat the mudeeala defendant in a case they were going to lay before the latsahib an explanation perfectly intelligible to even the babes and sucklings who in a punjabi village nowadays lisp in numbers of petitions and pleaders so the mudaee and mudeeala trampled along together amicably sometimes by curving wheeltracks among the furrowsancient rightsofway over the wide fields as transient yet immutable as the furrows themselves and there with the farmers eyeheritage of generations he noted each change of tint in the growing wheat from the faintest yellowing to the solid dark green with its promise of a full ear to come sometimes by broad lanes telling yet once more the strange old indian tale of transience and permanence of death and renewed birth in the deep grassset ruts through which the traffic of centuries had passed rarely yet inevitably and here with the same knowledgeable eye he would mark the homing herds of village cattle and infer from their condition what the unseen harvest had been which gave them their fodder finally out upon the hard white highroad so different from the others in its selfsufficient straightness its squared heaps of nodular limestone ready for repairs its elaborate arrangements for growing trees where they never grew before and where even western orders will not make them grow and here nanuks eyes still found something familiar in the great wains creaking along in files to add their quota of corn sacks to the mountain of wheat cumbering the railway platforms all along the line yet even this was in its essence new provoking the wonder in his slow brain how it could be that the increased demand for wheat and its enhanced price should have gone handinhand with the financial ruin of the grower to say sooth however such problems as these flitted but vaguely through the old mans thought and even his own spoliation was half forgotten in the one great object of that long journey which despite his cheerful patience had sapped his strength sadly to find the latsahib to make his salaam and bid the mudeealajee do so likewise to lay the produce of the field at the sahibs feet and say that purameshwar had sent rats instead of rainthat in itself was sufficient for the old man as he trudged along doggedly his eyes becoming more and more dazed by unfamiliar sights as he neared the big city bullah said the woman of whom he begged a nights lodging if we were to house and feed the wanderers on this road we should have to starve ourselves and thou art a sikh go to thine own people tis each for each in this world that was a new world to nanuk doth thy rat do tricks asked the children critically what none trra we can see rats of that mettle any day in the drains and there was a man here yesterday whose rat cooked bread and drew water ay and his goat played the drum that was a show worth seeing so nanuk trudged on see the latsahib sneered the yellowlegged police constable when after much wandering through bewildering crowds the old sikh found himself at a meeting of roads each one of which was barred by a baton which latsahibthe big one or the little the big one replied nanuk stoutly there was no good in underlings that he knew police constable number seventyfive called over to his crony number ninetysix on the next road ari brother here is another durbari canst let him in on thy beat i have no room on mine and then they both laughed whereat old nanuk taking courage moved on a step only to be caught and dragged back hustled and abused what was the great durbar for the like of himthe great durbar on which lakhs and crores had been spentthe great durbar all india had been thinking of for months wah whence had he come if he had not heard of the great durbar and what had he thought was the meaning of the venetian masts and triumphal arches the flags and the watered roads did he think such things were always ari if it came to such ignorance as that mayhap he would not know what this was coming along the road it was a disciplined tramp of feet an even glitter of bayonets a straight line of brown faces a swing and a sweep as a company of the guides came past in their kakhi and crimson uniform old nanuk looked at it wistfully nay brother he said i know that twas my sons regiment god rest him thou shouldst sit down old man said a bystander kindly of a truth thou canst go no further till the show is over hark there are the guns again twill be bairanpore likely since hurriana has gone past wah it is a showa rare show so down the watered road planted out in miserable attempts at decoration with barbers poles unworthy of a slum in the east end came a bevy of australian horses wedged at a trot between huge kettledrums which were being whacked barbarically by men who rose in their stirrups with the conscientious precision of a newly imported competitionwallah then more australian horses again in an orfeverie barouche lined with silver where despite the glow of colour the blinding flash of diamonds in an indian sun despite even the dull wheatgreen glitter of the huge emerald tiara about the turban the eye forgot these things to fix itself upon the face which owned them all a face haggard sodden superlatively handsome even in its soddenness indifferent but with an odd consciousness of the english boy whodressed as for a flower showsat silently beside his charge behind them with a clatter and flutter of pennons came a great trail of wild horsemen showing as they swept past dark lowering faces among the sharp spear points and the guns beat on their appointed tale till with the last a certain satisfaction came to that sodden face since there were none short in the saluteas yet the measure of his misdoings was not full as yet footnote a reduction in the number of guns is the first punishment for bad administration the crowd ebbed and flowed irregularly to border the straight white roads where at intervals the great tributary chiefs went backwards and forwards to pay their state visits but nanuk and his ratthe plaintiff and the defendantwaited persistently for their turn to pass on it was long in coming for even when the last flash and dash of barbaric splendour had disappeared the roar of cannon began louder nearer regular to a second in its even beat that is the latsalute said one man to another in the crowd let us wait and see the lat brother ere we go nanuk overheard the words and looked along the road anxiously then stood feeling more puzzled than ever for there was nothing to see here but a plain closed carriage with a thin red and gold trail of the bodyguard behind it and before the sun was near to its setting and sent a red angry flare upon a bank of clouds which had risen in the east and the dust of many feet swept past in whirls before a rising wind it will rain ere nightfall declared the crowd contentedly as it melted away citywards and the crops will be good praise to god once more nanuk overheard and this time a glad recognition seemed to rouse him from a dream yes the crops would be good down by the well on the land he and his had ploughed for so many years the wheat would be greengreen as those emeralds above that sodden face the lat has gone out joked constable seventyfive as he went off duty but there are plenty of other things worth seeing to such an ignoramus as thou true only by this time nanuk was almost past seeing aught save that all things were unfamiliar in those miles and miles of regiments and rajahs electric lights and newly macadamised roads tents and makebelieve gardens all pivoted as it were round the royal standard of england which was planted out in the centre of the viceroys camp as he wandered aimlessly about the vast canvas city hustled here sent back there the galloping orderlies the shuffling elephants the carriages full of english ladies the subalterns cracking their tandem whips and the native outriders had but one word for him hut hut stand backstand back a heavy drop of rain came as a welcome excuse to his dogged perseverance for sheltering awhile under a thorn bush he was more tired than hungry though he had not tasted food that day and it needed a sharp nip from the defendants teeth as it sought for something eatable in the folds of his blanket to remind him that others of gods creatures had a better appetite than he but what was he to give there was the five seers of grain still of course but who was to apportion the shares who was to say this much for the plaintiff this much for the defendant this much for the state the familiar idea seemed to give him support in the bewildering inrush of new impressions and he held to it as a drowning man in a waste of unknown waters clutches at a straw nevertheless the parties to the suit must not be allowed to starve meanwhile and if they took equal shares surely that would be just the rain now fell in torrents and the kikarbush scarcely gave him any shelter as with a faint smile he sat watching the brown rat at work upon the corn and counting the number of grains the wanton teeth appropriated as their portion for so much and no more would be his also it was not a sumptuous repast but uncooked maize requires mastication and that took up time so that it was dark ere he stood up soaked through to the skin and looked perplexedly at the long lines of twinkling lights which had sprung up around him and hark what was that it was the dinner bugle at a mess close by followed as by an echo by another and another and anotherquite a chorus of cheerful invitations to dinner but nanuk knew nothing of such feasts as were spread there in the wilderness he had lived all his life on wheat and lentils though being a sikh he would eat wild boar or deer if it could be got or take a tot of country spirits on occasion to make life seem less dreary he stood listening shivering a little with the cold and then went on his way since the latsahib must be found the case decided before this numbing forgetfulness crept over everything sometimes he inquired of those he met more often he did not but wandered on aimlessly through the maze of light driven and hustled as he had been by day and as he wandered the bands of the various camps were playing say the march in tannhaeuser or linger longer loo but sooner or later they all paused to break suddenly into a stave or two of another tune as the colonel gave the queen to his officers of all this again nanuk knew nothing even at the best of times he had been ignorant as a babe unborn of anything beyond his fields and now he remembered nothing save that he and the brown rat were suitors in a case against purameshwar and the state so the night passed it was well on into the chilliest time before the dawn when the slumber which comes to all the world for that last dead hour of darkness having rid him of all barriers he found himself beneath what had been the goal of his hopes ever since he had first seen its strange white rays piercing the nightthe great ball of electric light which crowned the flagstaff whereon the standard of england hung dank and heavy for the wind had dropped the rain had ceased and a thick white mist clung close even to the round bole of the mast which was set in the centre of a stand of chrysanthemums the colours of the blossoms were faintly visible in the downward gleam of the light spreading in a small circle through the mist so far good this was the standard of sovereignty no doubtthe lamp of safetythe guide by day and night to faithful subjects seeking justice before the king this nanuk understood this he had heard of in those tales of nausherwan and his like told beneath the village peepul tree here then he would stayhe and the defendanttill the dawn brought a hearing he sat down his back to the flowers his head buried in his knees and as he sat immovable the mist gathered upon him as it had gathered in the field but he was not thinking now what he should say to the latsahib he was past that he did not hear the jingle and clash of arms which after a time came through the fog or the voice which said cheerfully appy noo year to you mate same to you tommy and many of em but its rather you nor i for its chillin to the vitals they were changing guards on this new years morning and private smith as he took his first turn under the long strip of canvas stretched as a sunshelter between the two sentryboxes acknowledged the truth of his comrades remark by beating his arms upon his breast like any cabman yet he was hot enough in his head for he had been singing auld lang syne and drinking rum for the greater part of the night and though sufficiently sober to pass muster on new years eve was drunk enough to be intensely patriotic so as he walked up and down there was a little lilt in his step which attempted to keep time to the stave of god save our gracious queen which he was whistling horribly out of tune on the morrowor rather today since the dawn was at handthere was to be the biggest review in which he had ever taken part six and twenty thousand troops marching up to the royal standard and saluting they had been practising it for weeks and the thrill of it the pride and power of it had somehow got into private smiths headwith the rum it made him take a turn beyond that strip of canvas round the flagstaff he was supposed to guard alt oo goes there the challenge rang loudly rousing nanuk from a dream which was scarcely less unreal than the past twelve hours of waking had been to his ignorance he stumbled up stifflya head taller than the sentryand essayed a salaam ullo what the devil are you doin here hut you nigger goramighty wots that it was the defendant which nanuk had brought out to salaam also and which alarmed at the sudden introduction began darting about wildly at the end of its string private smith fell back a step and then pulled himself together with a violent effort uncertain if the rat were real but the cold night air was against him washermeanwasher doinerewashergot he asked conglomerately and nanuk understanding nothing went down on his knees the better to untie the knot in the corner of his blanket poggle commented private smith recovering himself as he looked down at the heap of maize the defendant and the old man talking about purameshvar then being in a benevolent mood he wagged his head sympathetically pore old johnny wots e want with is rat and is popcorn fine lookin old chap thoughbut we licked them sickies and by gum well lick em again if need be footnote pagul mad the thought made him begin to whistle once more as he bent unsteadily to look at something which glittered faintly as the old man laid it on the top of the pile of corn it was his sons only medal hillo said private smith bringing himself up with a lurch so that is it eh mate gorsaveaqueen now wots up sonny orse guards been adoing wot they didnt ought to ave done well that aint no noos is it comrade but well drink the old ladys elth all the same lordy if youve bin doin extra dooty on the rag all night you wont mind a lick o the lapeh lor bless youi don want it ive had as mush as me and leemitford can carry ome without takin a daytour by orderly roomwoy you wont wont yer come now johnny dont be a foolits rum i tell yer and you sickies aint afraid o rum wot you wont drink er elth you mutineering nigger then ill make yer feel thatnow then eres a elth untow her majesty perhaps it was the unmistakable prick of a bayonet in his stomach perhaps it was the equally unmistakable smell of the liquor arousing a craving for comfort in the old man but he suddenly seized the flask which private smith had dragged from his pocket and throwing his head back poured the contents down his throat the actiondue to his desire not to touch the bottle with his lipsgiving him an almost ludicrous air of eagerness private smith burst into a roar of laughter gorsavethequeen and as he spoke the first gun of the hundred and one which are fired at daybreak on the anniversary of her most gracious majestys assumption of the title kaiserihind boomed out sullenly through the fog but nanuk did not hear it he had stumbled to his feet and fallen sidewise to the ground i gather then remarked the surgeoncaptain precisely that before gunfire this morning you found the old man in a state of collapse below the flagstaffis this so private smith sober to smartness and smart to stiffness saluted but there was an odd trepidation on his face yes siri done my best for im sir i put im in the box sir and give im my greatcoat and i rub is ands and feet sir i done my level best for im not being able you see sir to go off guard i couldnt do no more you did very well my man but if you had happened to have some stimulantany alcohol for instance private smiths very smartness seemed to leave him in a sudden slackness of relief which it were a tot of rum sir as i appened to ave in my greatcoat pocket it done im no arm sir did it the surgeoncaptain smiled furtively it saved his life probably but you might have mentioned it before how much did he take about arf a pint sirmore nor less private smith spoke under his breath with an attempt at regret then he became loquacious beggin your pardon sir but i was a bit on myself and e just poured it down like as it was milk and then e tumbled over and i thought e was dead and it sobered me like so i done my level best for im all through perhaps he had for old nanuk singh found a comfortable spot in which to spend his remaining days when the regimental doolie carried him that new years morning from the flagstaff to the hospital he lay ill of rheumatic fever for weeks and when he recovered it was to find himself and his rat quite an institution among the gaunt listless convalescents waiting for strength in their long dressinggowns the story of how the old sikh had drunk the queens health has assumed gigantic proportions under private smiths care and something in the humour and the pathos of it tickled the fancy of his hearers who when the unfailing phrase an so i done my level best for him i did came to close the recital would turn to the old man and say pore old johnnyan gord knows what e wanted with is rat and is popcorn that was true since nauuk singh did not remember even the name of his own village and though he still talked about the plaintiff and the defendant purameshwar and the state he was apparently content to await his chance of a hearing at another and greater durbar the bluethroated god we sat after lunch in the stern of the steam launch watching the bridge grow from the semblance of a caterpillar hung across the horizon between clusters of temples and topes to that of some monstrous skeleton whose vaulting ribs rose high overhead into the pale sky bannerman and i had come out from england together and come upcountry together i to take up work at the bridge he on a sporting tour with letters of introduction to the chief engineer we had been doing the sights of the native city and now in company with several officials of sorts were on our way home to the reaches above and as we surged through the yellowbrown flood we talked vaguely and airily of old gods and new of sivas religion of stern reality and krishnas pleasureloving cult you should read prem sagar sir said mr chuckerbutty the native assistantengineer aside to bannerman who had given his vote for the latter it is of much merit containing the loves of krishna and other cognate matter its a mere question of temperament went on bannerman unheeding the interruption some people are born to one thing some to another i was born to enjoy myselfhullo whats that that was a low note like a birds a flash in the sunlight beyond the huge pier along which we were edging our way up the current and then a cloop like a cork sambo said some one his name is rudra sir replied mr chuckerbutty nilkunta huzoor suggested the captain of the launch i looked from one to the other interrogatively footnote bluethroated the name of the kingfisher the bridgediver said the first speaker sees after the foundations and that sort of thingknows the bottom of the river as well as most of us know the top a queer sort of animalthere he is to your right out of the yellowbrown flood a grave yellowbrown face crowned by a curious brass pot not unlike a tiara then two yellowbrown arms reminding me unpleasantly of snakes curved up in the overhead stroke as the swimmer slipped down to where a rope hung from one of the huge ribs he swarmed up it like a monkey to sit still as a carven image on the outermost buttress of the pier his legs crossed under him his hands resting on his knees his eyes fixed on the swirling water below so that the full eyelids drooping over them gave them an empty sightless look by george said bannerman carelessly he reminds me of the big idol over at the temple whats its name chuckerbutty youre posted in such things im not the assistantengineer mindful of the ba degree superadded to his ancestral beliefs became evasive well it doesnt matter i mean the brute like a land crab with a superfluity of arms the brute we were talking of just now who crowds life and all its joys into one eternal and infernal birth and deaththe most uninteresting events of life to my mind bannerman was right that figure on the buttress could not fail to remind one of siva or mahadeothe creator and the destroyerbarring of course the arms and as i looked the two which the figure possessed rose slowly from its knees and hovered up in the oddest fashion above its head then sank again as slowly leaving one with the impression of any number of circumambient members does it when he dives said a boy who was watching also must have thought he saw something in the stream he brings up all sorts of things the notion was absorbing until chuckerbuttys idiomatic english in reply to a query of bannermans roused me sambo is nickname but indubitably verbal corruption of the sanskrit sambhu lord or master rudra real name has equivalent synonymous meaning the most ancient god mentioned in rig veda symbolised in eight attributes sun moon water earth air fire ether and soul of man in other words the visible and invisible universeas siva the creator the preserver the destroyer chuckerbutty puffed at his cigar in quite a european fashion what rot murmured bannerman under his breath and as for nilkunta put in the boy that is simple it means bluethroated and sambo is tattooed all round yet is that also name of siva interposed chuckerbutty with importance as per mahabharata to soften human ills dread siva drank the poisonous flood which stained his azure neck nilkunt is also sometimes applied to the bird kingfisher by europeans but this is erroneous it belongs properly i heard no more my thoughts being with that odd figure again it was certainly a most extraordinary resemblance well if you really are going to fish for mahseer at hurdwar mr bannerman you should take advantage of that mans knowledge said the chief pompously he goes on leave next weekhis home is somewhere in the hillsand he knows everything that is to be known about fishing bannerman laughed back myself against him any day even on the ganges i expect ive as much general good luckin everywayas any one in this world he gave you that impression in addition he was eminently handsomeif a trifle dark for a country where people fight shy of any admixture of blood extraordinarily graceful and supple too doing everything with extraordinary grace and skill beyond that rich for the rest cosmopolitan in mind and manners as for morals that does not enter into the equation of a pleasant chance acquaintance and the only blemish i could lay finger on was an excess of jewellery but that was a hobby of his he was for ever waylaying the passersby and wanting to make a deal for their ornaments regardless of injured feelings it was a mere question of money like everything else he asserted and he generally succeeded in getting what he fancied apparently he fancied sambo or rudra or nilkuntawhichever you choose to call himfor a day or two afterwards the man came to me clothed in the loose garments and aggressive turban usually worn by mohammedans he looked less startling but the type of face was utterly new to me i am a hunter huzoor he said gravely indeed i think his face was the gravest i ever saw i kill to live i live to kill that is all i come from the mountains and i know the river wherefore not since it is my birthplace none know it as i others may claim it but it is mine and the fish also it is all one to nilkunt the diver huzoor eshspoon bait feather fly or poachnet i kill to live i live to kill that is the old way the best way and if the huzoor comes with buniahman sahib he will catch big fish and the sahib also i hope the sahib thinks he knows but he is a stranger to the river and the old ways he must learn them a week after this bannerman and i were encamped on the south side of the gorge through which the sacred river debouches on the plains with sambo who was on leave as our boatman and curiously out of place he looked in the englishbuilt wherry which my host had insisted on bringing up by rail he had never he said been able to stand the discomforts of a noahs ark and he did not intend to begin selfdenial even though he was in the birthplace of the most ascetic cult the world had ever known if indeed the worshippers of siva had right on their side in claiming hurdwar as haradwarathe gate of siva for his part he inclined to the vaishnava view haridwara gate of vishnu was just as likely a derivation it was only the change of a letter and yet that made all the difference between believing in pleasure or penance he talked away in his reckless fashion about this as we fished fruitlessly the first evening fruitlessly for i was crippled with a slight sprain of the wrist and bannerman caught nothing and sambo sat gravely sculling with a perfectly immovable face until bannerman who was changing his fly for the fiftieth time at least leant forward suddenly and laid his hand on the others wrist thats a fine catseye he said looking at a ring on the supple brown finger how much will you take for it i do not sell replied sambo still without a quiver of expression the water dropped from the upheld oar like molten gold i could hear it fall in the silence as those two sat looking at each other but my eyes were on those hands clasped upon each other they were extraordinarily alike in contour and not far apart in colour ten rupees twenty forty he went on what you wont here let me see it closer i dont believe it is worth moreeven to meunless im mistaken hand it over man bannerman turned the ring over curiously and a sudden interest came to his face it isnt worth five but ive taken a fancy to it fifty a hundred a thousand i do not sell repeated sambo indifferently not sell then youre a fool here catch he spun the ring like a coin high into the air perhaps he had meant it to fall into the boat but it did not and as i leant over in dismay i could see it sinking in shimmering circles through the sunlit water sambo did not even seem surprised but crossing the oars leisurely proceeded to strip it does not matter he said briefly mai gunga is kind to me and i know my way to her bosom footnote the ganges a minute or so afterwards he came up from the depths with the ring fast held in his teeth the fish are lying between the shallow and the deep he remarked as if nothing had happened if the huzoor will believe me he will catch them apparently the faith was wanting for we did not see a fin till i commenced fishing and even then the luck was all with me bannerman began to grow restive suggesting that in a boat one mans sport was another mans spoil so we moved across the range of the siwaliks to higher ground we pitched our tents between the river and a backwater where the boatwhich despite my advice bannerman insisted on bringing round by roadlay moored beneath a big cotton tree a desirable restingplace certainly cool and shadowy and haunted by many a kingfisher busy among the shoals of silvery fishlets in the still water across the river just above its great race to the gorge below stood a group of hindu temples backed by sunsteeped slopes ablaze with flowering scented shrubs further up however the hills sank almost to the level leaving a wedge of sky clear before rising again in swift gradations of blue cleft by a purple chasm marking the further course of the river towards the snows of kedarnath you live yonder do you not i asked of sambo pointing to the peaks as i stood settling my tackle for the first time a slow smile showed on the mans fine delicate face no huzoor i live everywhere wherever there are things to kill and that is in most places but not here sahib he continued hastily turning to bannerman who was about to launch his minnow into a likely spot this pool is sacred to the god yonder and sure enough close to the waters edge beneath the shade of a banyan tree stood a crowned image of mahadeo with his eight arms his necklace of snakes and chaplet of skulls dash it all muttered bannerman impatiently as if the world were not full enough of limitations as it is ill have it out with that old land crab some day his irritation grew as the days passed bringing continued illluck but what wonder he said when the fish were fed and pampered by the priests morning and evening that they would not take his lure for his part he did not believe there was a fin in any other pool in the riverat least when he fished it the huzoor can see if he chooses said sambo gravely i suppose i canas well as you anyhow retorted bannerman then let him look as he spoke sambo swung himself into the branch of a cotton tree which swaying with his weight scattered its huge scarlet flowers on the water perhaps it was this engendering a hope of food perhaps it was the curious low whistle he made but instantly the calm surface of the pool wavered shifted and broke into ripples sambo stretched himself full length on the branch and craned forward with his long blue neck plenty of them huzoor beauties that one with the scar is full twenty sirs weight see i will catch it he slid from the branch like an otter to reappear a second afterwards with the fish bent round his neck like a yoke of silver it is bad luck he continued and the huzoor must do puja to the great god that is the only way footnote worship bannermans face was a study and to soothe him i remarked that i had been lucky enough without any ones help how does the huzoor know asked sambo boldly if he had been up by dawn he might have thought otherwise since the blood of the cock i sacrificed in his name still reddens the feet of ishwara the devil you did i exclaimed laughing then sacrifice two for bannerman sahib tomorrow the latter however turned on him fiercely if you dare he began then pulled himself together muttered something about its being dd rot and went off declaring he would fish no more till dusk drove the glare from the water i found him hours after lolling on his bed and reading a translation of the prem sagar it was as amusing and true to life as a modern french novel he was pleased to remark and krishna with his milkmaids the wisest of gods in fact after dinner as we sat smoking outside he recurred to the subject denouncing the folly of all ascetic cults from baal downwards you are awfully well up in it all i said surprised at his knowledge seems to come to me tonight somehow he replied gaily things do you knowprevious state of existence and all that rot besides its needed when a fellow calmly suggests my making a blood offering to a brute of a land crab tooa miserable fetish evolved from the fears of a semiapea creature incapable of rising above the limitations of his own discomfort counting this lovely life as mere birth and death and ignoring the joys betweenthe only realities in the world he went on in this fashion till declaring that he meant to be up by dawn both to catch a fish and prevent the blood sacrifice he turned in i could hear him humming the refrain of a french song as i sat on the scented flood of moonlight it was not a night surely to waste in sleep the very flowers kept the memory of their colours and every now and again i could hear the silvery splash of a fish rising on the level reaches beyond but from below came a vibration in the air like the first breathing of an organ note that was the river racing to the gorge scarcely knowing what i did i strolled over to the backwater which circled round the oasis of the valley a fringe of trees marked its course and behind them the hill sloped up in a tangle of jasmine and pomegranate while on the river side grew shingle and grass tufted with oleanders in the distance faint yet clear came a snatch or two of bannermans findesiecle song and then suddenly round a bend rose the low note of a kingfisher could it be a kingfisher at that hour of the night by all the gods old and new what was this sambo could that be sambo kneedeep in the water sambo with a golden tiara on his head and girt about the waist with a regal robe purple and redat least you guessed the colour just as you guessed that the shadowy pillar of that long neck was blue were those his arms curved above him or were they snakes swaying swaying in the moonlight with hooded heads and open jaws and was that cry sambos or the kingfishers then and not till then i saw the bird perched on a branch above the strange figure and even as i looked it swooped straight into those swaying snakelike arms bearing something in its mouth i suppose in my surprise i made some exclamation for the figure turned quickly then for the first time i felt sure it was only the diver in his diving dress the next instant he was beside me on the bank holding out a small land crab for my inspection it is the best bait huzoor better than phantom or eshspoon i felt utterly bewildered and not a little aggrieved at his everyday appearance but but i began how the mischief did you make the bird his hand went up to his throat as if in explanation tis the trick of their cry huzoor besides birds are afraid of the holy snake and even the huzoor doubted his own eyes it is good bait if buniahman sahib will consent to use it he will have luck of course he will use it i replied angrily and then a sudden doubt seized me i dont know though i dont seem to understand i cant see the huzoor has two eyes he interrupted with another of his slow smiles does he want a third like mine a third then i noticed a central spot on his forehead set in an oval of white in good sooth it was not unlike a third eye placed upright between the others i had seen similar ones painted on the images of siva tis but a caste sign huzoor he explained i wear it sometimes he stooped as he spoke gathered some dust in his fingers and rubbed out the mark lo it grows late midnight is past if the huzoor rises with the sun tis time he slept true enough but as i strolled homewards to the tent my eyes fell by chance on the shade beneath the great banyan tree where the idol stood the plinth was empty it lay reflected in the water vacant bare scarcely knowing what i did or why i did it i ran back to where i had left sambo calling him by all his names in turn but there was no answer and when in hopeless bewilderment i retraced my steps it was only to find myself mistaken the eightarmed image stood in its accustomed place reflected in the still water i was glad when the dawn came one of those lemoncoloured dawns when the sky grows light at once had the jolliest dreams said bannerman coming out of his tent dreamt i was krishna among the milkmaids wish i could find one in this fishforsaken place id hullo what the mischief is that on my line it was sambos land crab neatly impaled on a stuart tackle i began an explanation only to stop short at theto meabsolutely incomprehensible intensity of both the faces before me dimly i seemed to recognise the situation and then it escaped me again tomfoolery one might as well fish with that ridiculous fetish at once came bannermans jeering voice what was it chuckerbutty drivelled about eight attributestall order for any god well here they go no sambo you may keep onethe soul of a man if there be such a thing he had torn off five of the crabs legs leaving three two of them the nipping claws which with gaping jaws swayed about seeking reprisals there take your offering siva snakes and souls and all he flung the maimed creature full in the idols face as we sculled past it i shall never forget sambos look you shouldnt do that sort of thing i remonstrated in a low voice if the priests saw itthen this man bah nilkunta wont mind and rupees will settle anything i tried to make him understand they would not in these fastnesses of the hindu faith but almost immediately afterwards his attention wandered to a womans figure which as we rowed up the river was outlined equally against earth and sky while figure earth and sky shared equally the perfect reflection in the water by george a milkmaid he cried she was not unlike one in dress certainly but her face marked with the crescent of siva on the forehead was of a different type beautiful too and bannerman simply couldnt take his eyes off her who is she who can she be sambo rudra nilkunta whichever you aredo you know who she can be he queried in hot excitement she is somebodys house huzoor the voice was cold as an icicle somebodys house what a way to mention a woman beautifulbeautiful asbut its the old puritanical game a housea hearth motherthe british matron in eastern disguisemrs grundy in a sari i say nilkunt whose house do you think she is i should like to buy the freehold she is your slaves house replied the man without a wink the dickens she is blurted out my companion somewhat abashed for the time perhaps that was sambos intention at any rate i have no means of knowing if he spoke the truth or not indeed looking back on it all i scarcely seem to know what really happened and what must have been sheer fancy only this remains clear a growing antagonism between these two a growing disinclination on bannermans part to do anything but lounge away his days cant help it my dear fellow he would say its the air or something if i had a shepherds pipe id play it and as for flowers do you know some one puts a bunch of them on my pillow every night i believe its the milkmaid there were flowers too garlanded round his door while just over the way those ominous splashes of red on ishwaras feet seemed to grow deeper and deeper at last i put the case baldly and crudely before him something was going on which i didnt understand which might get him into mischief at any moment and i appealed to his good sense to put the siwaliks between him and a temptation which seemed to have fascinated him he laughed admitted the fact and yielded the more readily because our time was almost up for the first two days he was rewarded by success in the lower reaches possiblysince fish shy at noveltybecause we used a native noahs ark our own boat remaining in the backwater till we could send coolies to fetch it on the third he left the river early on plea of a headache as he had been in wild spirits all day quoting the prem sagar and singing french songs i half thought he was going in for fever the day being exceptionally hot but on my return at dusk the servants asked if i would wait dinner for the sahib or not beset by immediate misgivings i rushed into his tent where i found a slip of paper impaled like a bait on some tackle lying on the table off to the divine milkmaid dont wait vogue la galere how far i asked sambo breathlessly twenty kos by the roadthe sahib borrowed the police inspectors marenot half that over the hills but the moon is late and the snakes love the dark if it had been the darkness of egypt i had no choice but to follow and half an hour afterwards i was stumbling along after sambo even by daylight the hills heatcracked rainseared strewn with sharp rocks were bad walking on a dark hot night with the snakes eyes gleaming from the stones they were horriblemost horrible the straight fingers of the stiff candelabra bushes pointing up and up the gnarled stunted trees growing into strange shapes reminding one involuntarily of those antediluvian animals whose bones lie buried all along the siwaliks a cold sweat of suspense lay upon my forehead despite the scorching blast tearing down the ravines scorching yet laden with the scent of earth as from a newmade grave there has been rain in the hills beyond said sambos voice out of the dark i lost sight of him constantly and at the best of times he was little more than another weird shape among the shadows holy mahadeo have a care huzoor let the snake pass in peace as he spoke something curved over my instep such things take the nerve out of a european but i stumbled on peering into the darkness trying to think of bannermans danger and not of that next step and what it might bring but it came at lastjust as we dipped into a cooler moister glen where i could hear the flying foxes hovering from tree to treea slither of the foot and then a spiral coil up my leg gripping the muscles tight my shriek echoed from the heathardened resounding rocks until the whole hillside seemed peopled by my fear and even when sambo stooping down uncoiled the snake and threw it into the darkness i could scarcely realise that i was none the worse for having put my heel on a vipers head my nerve seemed gone i could not move except at a snails pace time speeds came sambos voice again the moon rises but the clouds gather if the huzoor would only not mind id mind nothing if i could seesee as you seem to do i muttered ashamed yet aggrieved that is it he replied the huzoor cannot see and the holy snakes do not know him as they know me if the sahib will let me put the caste mark on his forehead as it is on mine he need not fear it can do no harm huzoor true besides the very idea by suggesting confidence might restore it lest the dust should fall into the huzoors eyes said the voice softly and i felt long thin fingers on my eyelids then something on my forehead cold and hard cold and hard like a ring the effect of such pressure when the eyes are closed is always confusing and i felt as if i was dozing off when the same soft voice roused me the huzoor can see now i opened my eyes with a start as if from sleep had the moon risen or whence came that pale light by which i sawwhat did i not see everything surely that had been created since the world began the tiny watersprites in the halfstagnant pools the flying motes in the dim air or did i dream it did i only feel and know that they were there part of those endless endless aeons of life and death in which i was a unit sambo i gasped feebly but there was no answer where was i by degrees memory returned this must be the gayatri glen for there at the further end stood the great image of the dread mahadeo where the pilgrims worshipped and surely the odd light came from that gleaming catseye on its forehead surely too the snakes curled and swayed the outstretched hands opened and shut my own went up to my forehead in my bewilderment when suddenly the light seemed to fade till i could just see nilkuntas blue throat as he stood beside me the huzoor has scratched his forehead the blood trickles from it see i have brought a tulsi leaf there that is better i felt the coolness between my eyes and something of my bewilderment seemed to pass away it is the gayatri huzoor and yonder is mahadeo he is but halfway so we must press on the sahib can see now there is no fear none yet did i see them or was i only conscious of that teeming life in the jungles of the tiger crouching by our path the snakes slipping from it the deer standing to watch us and strangest of all those shapes hiding in the dim shadowsundreamtof monsters neither fish flesh nor fowl was it a dream orthe idea brought a faint hysterical laughwas it the zoological gardens and the british museum rolled into one we must cross the river huzoor said the dim form flitting before me buniahman sahib will have taken the boat i suppose it was the usual rope bridge swung across the narrowing chasm of the river but it seemed to me that night as if i walked on air below me not ten feet from the lowest curve of the loop was the ganges wrinkled and seamed slipping giddily eastwards overhead a stream of clouds speeding eastwards also she rises fast muttered sambo mai gunga is in a hurry tonight the whole world was in a hurry i seemed to hear flying feet keeping time with our own not an instants pause was there even for breath until we reached the last declivity above the little oasis of the valley the moon had risen but the clouds hurrying across her face gave greater uncertainty to the scene still i could see a womans figure standing with widespread arms by the edge of the rising river i could see a man sending a boat across the shallows with mighty strokes and above the growing rush of the water i could hear two murmuring voices which seemed to fill the world with soft antagonism ooma ooma from the hills radha radha from the valley these were calling to the woman and as in a dream i seemed to remember and understand radha the queen of pleasure ooma the mother of the universe krishnas mistress and sivas wife i looked round for sambo he was gone so i ran on alone feeling there was no time to be lost my foot slipped and i fell heavily but i was up again in a second unhurt save perhaps for that scratch on my forehead whence i could feel the blood flowing as i dashed into the shadow of the banyan tree merciful heaven what was this a glare as of noonday and two radiant forms with a cowering woman between them between the chaplets of skulls and the chaplets of flowers and behind them was an empty plinth before i had time to realise what i saw came shouts and cries a melee and a scuffle armed men ran out of the shadows and then sambos voice was insistent run sahib run tis your only chance the boatthe boat then some one hit me over the head from behind and when i came to myself i was lying in the bottom of the boat bannerman was standing beside me shaking his fist impotently at the twinkling lights on the bank and sambo sat aft steering as best he could for the oars had gone and we were racing with the flood towards the rapids they had bound up my head with something but i still felt stunned and the rush of the rising river surged in my ears through the thin planks as i lay so perhaps it was only my fancy that those two sat talking talking arguing arguing about the old old problems till suddenly i sat up to the clear sound of sambos voice it is not to be done huzoor we are in the hands of fate if death comes it will come but it will end in birth the answer was that halfjeering laugh i knew so well ill chance it nilkunt i dont believe you bannerman had stripped to the skin and stood forward looking at the narrowing rush of the river i could see the great logs of wood swept from the hillforests above dancing along beside us on the curved surface of the streamso curved by the very force of the current that as our boat steered by sambos skill kept the centre the dim banks slid past below us across them just ahead a curved thread not four feet now the flood had risen above the water the rope bridge then i understood dont i cried feebly no mancanwithstand the forceof the stream he crooked his knees beneath the thwarts and held up his arms dont i cried again the boat slackened for an instant for an instant only then it shot on leaving bannerman clinging to the ropeshot on round the bend leaving him hanging there between birth and death but sambo never took his watchful eyes off those merry dancing logs which meant destruction the horror of it all was too much i fainted when consciousness returned sambo grave and composed was bending over me we were drifting fast into the backwater before my own bungalow and behind us looking spectral in the first glint of dawn lay the great bridge the flare of the watchfires on its piers telling of the severity of the flood the huzoor is at home said the man quietly if buniahman sahib had taken my advice he would have been at home also we had been a whole day and night on the river but he seemed no more fatigued than i who had escaped all the suspense for the rest no trace remained of the adventure save an oval scratch on my forehead surrounding the faint vestiges of something like an eye it is the mark of siva said my servant piouslyhe had come down with haste by rail to bring the news of my deathdoubtless he took the huzoor under his protection for which i will offer a blood oblation without delay bannermans body was never found but some months after when i was inspecting foundations i heard the kingfishers cry and the familiar cloop of a dive at the further side of the pier then sambo rudra nilkuntawhatever you please to call himshowed his yellowbrown face above the yellowbrown flood bearing a ring in his mouth a palais royal affairtwo diamond hearts transfixed by a ruby arrow i had seen bannerman wear it a hundred times but i had never seen the inscription engraved inside thy lips oh beloved life are nectar it was a quotation from the krishna or prem sagar a tourist ticket footnote copyright by macmillan co dost forget brother that it is the fast said raheem as with gentle determined hand he pushed the leafcup of sweets further from the board on which his tools lay there were not many of them though the inlaid work upon the sandalwood comb he was making showed delicate as lace it suited the delicate hands employed upon it in a way also it suited the delicate brain behind the high narrow forehead which had a look of illhealth about the temples where the thick coarse black hair was also delicately streaked with silver sure sign in a land where grayness is long deferred of a troubled body or mind raheem had barely touched middle age in his case the trouble seemed to be in both body and mind to judge by his hollow eyes and the expression in them as they rested on a younger man who sat as a visitor on the plinth of the combmakers shop his feet were in the gutter and his handsome head was nodding gaily to various acquaintances in the steady stream of passersby for the odd little shop was wedged into the outer angle of a sharp bend in the narrow bazaar so that as raheem sat working at his scented combs he could see both wayscould see all the world coming and going from dawn till dark hoshyar laughed nodding his handsome head once more yea i forgot that thou dost fast for both of us and pray for both of us mayhap in the end brother thou mayest have to go to paradise for both of us despite all thy pains the busy hand ceased to work in a gesture of negation say not such things hoshyar we go together or go not at all thou knowest that was my promise to the dead hoshyar ate another comfit before replying with a shrug of the shoulders twas not on stamped paper though and promises are naught nowadays without it tis bad policy to be overpious brother as all know the saints beard goes in relics and to tell truth i would be better pleased to leave paradise to those who wish for it the world suits me i was not born to be religious as thou wert the combmaker looked at him with a sort of perplexed patience god knows his own work he said in a low voice the potter makes the world fills i remember when thou first wentest to school hoshyar how thou didst weep because it prevented thee from prayertime and at the festivalsdost remember brother thou hadst a little coat of brocade mother cut it from our fathers old one she cherished so old tales old tales interrupted hoshyar rising with another shrug of his shoulders if thou hadst wished me to continue in them why didst send me to school to learn new ones why didst not make me a combcarver instead of a clerk then might i have saved money as thou hast gone on the great pilgrimage as thou hast and worn a green turban like thine to show it as thou dost a sharp spasm of pain swept over the older mans face but there was anger also in his voice as thou wouldst have done also clerk though thou art if yea i know i know interrupted hoshyar impatiently if i had not emptied the bag so often but tis a pity to let money lie idle and that time when thou hadst the sum needed for the journey i would have gone i meant to have gonei swear it but the leave failed and thou wouldst not surely have had me give up my post then ere the leave came the money had gone instead i can never keep it lying idle and so raheems anger faded leaving nothing but the pain what use was there in finishing the sentence in reproaching the sinner with having done far worse than let good money lie idle the fact only made the pilgrimage a greater necessity than ever if nakir and munkir the recording angels were to be bribed to leniency thou shalt have the green turban yet he said quietly if thou wilt have patience but my combs are not like peeras over the way he makes a dozen to my one ay and sells them too for folk buy ever the cheapest thing nowadays even for an eedoffering footnote equivalent to our easter there was almost an incredulous wonder in his voice as he went on working while hoshyar stood kicking one patentleather shoe viciously against a loose brick in the pavement and in the meantime the future pilgrim must live he remarked jestingly as if even to his effrontery it was easier to treat what he had to say thus than in earnest so if thou couldst spare a rupee or two from the bag raheem his brothers eyes looked up full of reproach i know what thou wouldst say he went on pettishly i have had more than my share this month but i need it sorely the skinflints at the office have cut my pay for being lateas if i could help the tram car passing full five minutes before its timeso i had to walk and then the mixed train which is ever an hour late chose to be punctual so there was none to receive the waybills he paused and seeing the doubt on raheems face continued as for the combs if thou hast difficulty in selling i might try that one thou madest last with jasmine flowers in ivorytis a deft piece of work and i know one who might buy it not yasmeena asked raheem his face hardening despite the girllike flush which came to it hoshyar laughed uneasily thou hast yasmeena on thy brain brother she is no worse than others of her trade and that will last till all men are of thy way of thinking yasmeena nay thou knowest she hath not the money to pay for such costly gewgaws for she is not as the others now she is not to be bought or sold herself a man more of the world than raheem noting the change of tone in the last words would have augured much of yasmeenas power over the speaker but the combmaker was too simple for such wisdom if she buys it not well and good he replied relaxing his frown but i will lend myself to no truck between thee and her and as for the rupees he sighed yet there was no hesitation in the hands which began to unlock a brassbound box lying beside his board thou wouldst rise earlier brother he continued almost tenderly as he counted three rupees from a little bag into the outstretched palm awaiting the gift if thou wouldst sleep a little earlier also lo i sleep and wake with the birds since my work must be of the light it streamed full upon him and his tools as he spoke a pale gold flame of sunshine searching for each flaw each failure couldst not make it five raheem came the sordid voice that is bare bread the flame of the sunshine had found a restingplace in raheems eyes as he looked at the beggar from head to foot and this is salvation he replied dropping the bag back into the box with a chink and turning the key upon it salvation yes that is what it really meant to raheem it meant salvation for one soul but for which after his brother had gone he asked himself this question for the hundredth time asked it almost feverishly ought he to trust to the chance was it likely that he would have time ere his life endedthat life which had always been so uncertainto make provision for both himself and hoshyar in death it would not do to trust hoshyar with the money he raheem must make the pilgrimage for him and was it likely when the rupees came so slowly and went so fast that the hoard in the bag would be complete for years ought he not then to make overas according to the canon he could do if he chosethe virtue of that past pilgrimage to his brother and take the risk of the coming one upon himself hoshyar needed virtue sorely and yet the very thought of going forth to the judgmentseat without the panoply in which for long years he had found peace and shelter was a terror to raheem could he do it nay it was too much and yetif that promise to the dead were broken wilfullywhat good would imputed righteousness be before the throne and meanwhile hoshyar his brother a clerk in the railway sat smoking a vile cigar at the feet of yasmeena who lounging on a string bed was drawing the scented sandalwood comb inlaid with the flowers whose name she bore through her sleek hair give it me beloved she said scornfully then thy promise to the saint will be secure i must have it tis the prettiest in the bazaar even gulanari with all her airs has not its marrow see i will sell it to her when i tire of it and then thou canst give back his three rupees to the miser three rupees i shall spend that in a day and monday is the eed i must have a new gown for it or she did not finish her sentence but her look was eloquent and hoshyar as he lay awake that night her meaning driven home by hints of coming coldness racked his brains for some means of procuring the dress raheem meanwhile lay awake also thinking of a very different costume of a robe of righteousness a weddinggarment those three rupees given to hoshyar had been meant for an eedoffering the eed which drew so near there was no time to earn more should he go emptyhanded to give thanks for the added virtue of having been granted life to keep the great fast or should he offer up his pilgrimage by making it over once and for all to his brother hoshyar had been asleep for hours and the sparrows were astir ere raheem found any answer he would wait another day he told himself before deciding so he sat in the sunlight seeking perfection in his delicate curves and lines while the pale gold rays peeped and pryed for flaws and failures have you a comb like that finished asked a foreign voice making him raise his head and salaam hopefully none so good huzoor but i have others he took them from the brassbound box and waited then noting the englishmans look said wistfully i had one yesterday but itit is gone i could finish this one quickly for the huzoor ifif he pleased there was a catch in his breath if he could sell something surely he might keep salvation a little longer can you finish it by monday evening it would mean working extra hours mean working through the festival when all the world rested but what was that in comparison with the reward ten minutes afterwards raheem was putting three rupees into the bag he had sold out his stock and still more wonderful had a promise of twenty rupees more on account for future work if he brought the comb punctually on the monday evening he had not done such a business for years the eedoffering was secure and the chances of his hoard reaching the necessary amount for a speedy pilgrimage doubled the sun shone brighter and purer than ever on the crowds assembled in the eedgaha huge enclosure set with trees and with a mere facade of a mosque upon its western front which lay beyond the city walls it shone on no more brilliant figure than yasmeenas who in the gayest of new dresses was saying her prayers effusively for if the daily life be doubtful there is all the more need to have the full advantage of festivals a theory which obtains all over the world but raheem despite his green turban of the passed pilgrim despite the three rupees given scrupulously in charity to his neighbour felt glad to escape when prayers were over to his work and yet the sight was one to stir most hearts the long lines of men women and childrenthousands and thousands and thousands of themhalfseen amid the shading trees the boom of the fireworksignal from the eastern gate echoing like a cannon from the wide walls and ending in a silence like the grave fifty thousand living breathing beings shoulder to shoulder and not a sound not a quiver only the swish of a birds wings only the hush of a breeze among the leaves then suddenly came a great shout as from one throat and the long lines bent like a field of corn before a mighty wind god is great there is no god but god and afterwards he had been used wifeless childless himself to wander with kindly eyes among the merry family parties picnicking beneath the trees watching the little ones delight over their new toys the old mens delight over their grandchildren then often he would hear folk say in a whisper look at his turban he is a hajji he has been to mecca look children he has found salvation god grant you to follow in his steps but on this eed he took off the sign of saintship ere he began work yet as he worked he shivered as if he were cold without it the weight of the twenty rupees however which when the comb was finished and taken to the sahib at the hotel were duly paid into his hand seemed to make his heart feel lighter it meant two months work and that meant two months food then hoshyar must have at least five rupees still enough would remain to bring the hoard in the brassbound box within measurable distance of salvation to make it possible perhaps for him to wear his green turban without a heartache his present lack of the distinguishing mark seemed to strike even the englishmans eye making him say kindly i thought you wore the green and you look the sort certainly if not i have something which may interest you here baboo one of those leaflets please if you want to hear more go to the address of the agency im off tonight raheem with a salaam tucked the little printed page into his commonplace white headgear and trudged homewards tired and dispirited it was too dark to begin work again as a distraction and he had not had the heart somehow to prepare himself a feast as on other eeds so bethinking him of the leaflet in his turban he took it out and began to read it was in the arabic lettering of the holy book he knew so well and his eyes were keen still the wording puzzled him a pilgrimage to meccaexceptional opportunityspecially chartered vesselfirmanabsolute orthodoxy guaranteedto start in a months timea limited number of tickets available at moulvie futtehdeens near the mosque imambarah bazaar briefly it was the prospectus of a pilgrimage which was being organised as a speculation by a wellknown firm whose travelling agent combined the business with a private venture of his own in all the artistic productions he could pick up by the way whence came the purchase of raheems combs thou hast the waybill i see hajji came a cracked wistful voice as an old man who was passing paused at the plinth an older man even than his looks for the sparse beard was palpably dyed and his dress still had a youthful jauntiness about it his face however betrayed him by its wrinkles he carried a huge dhol a kind of drum slung by a cord about his neck and as he spoke his lissom fingers slid and curved over the stretched goatskin making a muffled trembling boom not that it means aught to thee he went on in a grumble to match thou hast the ticket to paradise already would i had it also i go no nearer it yet than damning myself by playing to profligates and so putting by a nestegg against my desire how else since drumbanging is my trade and drums ever keep bad company but i grow old i grow old thus the sin is greater to a soul which should have learned wisdom but the pay is less by reason of fingers growing stiff so i am wicked both ways and ere next years pilgrimage this empty maw of a thing may have swallowed me up body and soul he gave a more vicious knuckling to the drum which hummed and boomed in response next years echoed raheem ay it comes every year they say there was a man at gulanarisgod knows neighbour i must burn if i die in such company and i so old tis the drum drags me to itseest thou it will play naught but dancetunes though i swear i am weary of them as a lame squirrel with her nest in the sky i would play hymns but that i am hindered and a mans belly hajji raheem will not stay empty as a drum and not shrink so about the pilgrimage suggested raheem knowing the drumplayers talk of old ay ay for sure the mana saint for all his companythere seest thou is the pull of it had i but the green turban this devil of a drum might take me where it would but as i was saying this man said it was true every word he had been and returned comfortably for the money for so little murmured raheem looking once more at the price named it was far less than what his previous experience told him would be required little echoed the drumbanger reproachfully that comes of making decent combs didst thou try to wheedle salvation from a thing that hath neither heart nor bowels of compassion that is naught but a devil of a noise that grows worse instead of better when tis whacked thou wouldst tell a different tale well the cat says the proverb killed seventy rats and went on a pilgrimage so i must wait my turn though if i have not more than seventy sins may i never play a measure again i swarm with them neighbour as flies on sugar he tucked the tempter further under his arm and moved on muttering to himself and i have but half the money saved so i am lost if i get not virtue on a reduction raheem sat looking at the paper stupidly as the mingled growl of the drum and its beater died away then suddenly those delicate hands of his reached out swiftly to the brassbound box surely he had so much or would have so much when those twenty rupees were earned so it came to pass in the following days that every minute of the light found him at work on the scented combs and whenever he finished one he spent some of his scanty rest in toiling over to the imambarah bazaar and paying over its fairly earned price to swell the deposit which secured to him one of the limited supply of tickets finally on one night the very night before the day of starting he packed up the combs complete took the price of the last one over to the moulvie and received in return a neat little booklet full of incomprehensible printed papers he felt almost afraid of his new possession with its gay tie to keep everything in its place within the cover supposing he lost something and found himself stranded he broke out at the thought into a cold sweat and hunted hurriedly for the extra ticket which the moulvie had told him was to be used to the junction since the railway which passed through the town was not on the direct line he found it an ordinary thirdclass ticket tucked away safely but the fright made him resolve on keeping it separate and hanging the precious remainder in a bag round his neck the empty moneybag would do or better still there were some bits left yet of hoshyars little coat of brocade and the ticket deserved a fine holder as he sat stitching away at the familiar fragments however by the flicker of the cresset a certain remorse assailed him at having seen so little of his brother during the past month true hoshyar for various reasons preferred coming to see him but ever since the eed raheem had been dimly conscious that something seemed to have come between him and the soul he meant to save was it that he knew in his heart it ought to be already saved there was no longer any need however for such questions so soon as the bag was finished he would go over and find hoshyar would find and tell him the great secret the secret which even raheems small store of worldly wisdom had kept jealously a sound at the plinth made him look up and there was hoshyar himself something in his face made the sewer say quickly i set aside the money for thee hoshyar though thou camest not it is here five rupees hoshyar looked at the little pile with a queer expression and leaving the plinth came within the reach of a whisper that will not serve me tonight he said quietly i must have thirty thirty echoed raheem i have it not thou hast it in the box see here brother thou hast told me always that the money was minefor my salvation well i need it i must have it he spoke almost carelessly as one who has a certainty of succeeding and in truth he thought so once before raheem had almost emptied the bag to save him from ruin and he had calculated deliberately on its being emptied again when he had bought yasmeena her new dress out of officefunds which would have to be replaced at the end of the month raheem would not have given a pice for such a purpose of course but with detection and disgrace staring his brother in the face it would be different besides the money was his for his salvation listen raheem he went on summoning up a penitential tone but his brother interrupted him swiftly a sort of dread in his dark hollow eyes there is naught in the box now brother he said with a catch of fear in his voice i have naught but this he laid his hand lightly upon the booklet and its very touch seemed to bring comfort for he smiled tis my salvation hoshyar for i have given thee my pilgrimage see i am making a holder for it dost recognise the stuff tis a bit of the little brocade coat brother hoshyar had caught up the booklet glanced at it and now flung it down with a passionate oath salvationfool tis perdition then he laughed suddenly a loud bitter laugh that is an end he said rising to go i only waste time here goodbye raheem tis well thou hast a keepsake of me thou art not likely to see much of me these seven years to come what dost mean brother began the combmaker fearfully but hoshyar without another word turned back to the bazaar tis thou that art the fool said yasmeena with a yawn after hoshyar had raged for a quarter of an hour of his illluck of his brothers foolery of her extravagance why didst not take the ticket it must be worth something surely then a sudden interest came to her languid eyes where vice itself seemed weary seest thou beloved i have an idea old deena the drumplayer is for ever talking of secondhand salvation he hath forty rupees saved for it that would leave me ten as commission he need not know i can say i got it we of the bazaar get most things at times in our profession and the money was thinefor thy salvation remember hoshyar looked at her as a man looks at a venomous snake he has no power to kill lo babooji said a trollop of a girl lounging in with a giggle thy brother raheem asks for thee below tis the first time methinks he hath entered such a house for he stands like a child clasping a brocaded bag as if there were pests about and it held camphor yasmeena sat up among her quilts and looked at hoshyar bid the good creature to the courtyard at the back she said in a level voice thou wilt like to see him alone doubtless hoshyar and merun bid some man take him a sherbet he would be affrighted of a houri make it of sandalessence girl and bring it to me to see that it is rightly flavoured thou likest not sandalessence hoshyar tis true but tis most refreshing to those who have walked and thou needst not touch it hoshyars look changed it was the look now which a bird gives to the snake raheem was at the station next day in plenty of time though rather to his surprise he had slept later than usual that morning and slept heavily also perhaps because he seemed not to have a care left in the world after hoshyar had retracted all his reproaches and bidden him go in peace peacewhat else could remain in a mans heart after that renunciation in the dark deserted mosque upon the homeward way which had left raheems conscience clear at last left him without a weddinggarment and yet content and now with his ticket to the junction duly snipped his bundle in one hand and the other assuring itself of the booklets safety in the brocade bag he passed down the platform in the rear of the rush from the waitingshed looking diffidently for a seat in the closepacked carriages which with their iron bars and struggling occupants looked like cages of wild beasts here neighbour hajji here cried a cracked familiar voice full of elation full of importance now that demon of a drum hath gone there is room for a saint or two he is hajji already my masters and will be a good companion but tis done cheaper nowadays and i i swear have it cheaper than ye all how much is a secret but the lord kept his eye on old deena so he went on boastfully till even his voice was drowned in the great shout which went up as the train moved on he was back on his own good fortune however when the hundred and fifty and odd passengers in their carriage separated into scores by iron bars had subsided into a mere babel of speaking voices no cover say you he replied resentfully to a captious criticism on his ticket what good is a cover dew is pretty but it dont quench thirst so i being a pilgrim drink plain water my ticket will take me as far as thine raheem crouched up between the drumplayer and a fat butcher heard vaguely and fingered the outline of his treasure in its bag of brocade feeling glad he had so honoured it for it took him further than mecca further than this world the gates of pearl were set ajar for him and he could see through them to the glory and glitter of paradise and so after a rush through a long stretch of desert sand the train slackened rousing him from a dream this must be the junction and he must take out the other ticket but not while a score of folk were struggling over him in their rush to be out first he was out last of course and had barely time to snatch the booklet from its bag ere an official warned him to hurry up so panting confused his bundle in one hand his treasure in the other he sped over the bridge to the next platform tickets tickets all tickets came another alien voice and he paused to obey setting his bundle on the ground in order to have both hands for his task but the opening of the cover was to him as the closing of the book of life for it was empty pass on pass on came the not unkindly voice of command once more out of the way you there and dont stand like a fool youve dropped it likely run back and see theres time yet so over the bridge again went raheem in frantic hope back on his steps again in frantic despair i had it huzoor indeed i had it here is the cover the ticketcollector shook his head and raheem with a dazed look turned away quietly trra came the voice of the drumplayer sententiously and safely from the window of a carriage he hath lost the inside that comes of a cover well well prayers are over up with the carpet but he is hajji already my masters so tis not as though it were one of us sinners keep thy sins to thyself chatterer retorted his next neighbour tartly as the train moved on we be virtuous men enough if you havent money to go on you must go back the bookingoffice is over there and the upmail will be in in a few hours this official view of the question given by the authorities as they gathered round the disappointed pilgrim was simplicity itself even to raheem he never thought of connecting his ticketless cover with deenas coverless ticket the fact that his chance was gone absorbed him utterly he had lost salvation for the very thought of taking back his gift to hoshyar was impossible to him that was the outcome of it all so he sat patiently waiting for his train to come in sat patiently after he had found a place in it waiting for it to go on so absolutely absorbed in his loss that he did not even hear his neighbours comments on the delay line clear at last said the guard joyfully to the driver as he came out of the telegraphoffice where but one instant before the welcome signal had echoed steam away all you know sonny and make up lost time i promised my girl to be punctual theres a hop on at her house so with a shriek they were off for a twentymile scamper across the desert out with a bump over the points out with a whistle past the last signal out with a flash by the telegraphposts but something else was flashing by the posts also for a message came clicking into the station they had left not a minute ago mistakeline blockeddownmail my god said the stationmaster in a thick voice standing up blindly he was an old mutiny man but he was white as a sheet it isnt our fault father began his son a slim young fellow showing mixed blood dn it all sir shouted the other furiously what does it matter whose fault it is whats to be done nothing could be done save to telegraph back quick as kind nature could carry it line blockedupmail also fateful words the line blocked both ways and not a signal for twenty miles half an hour of warning at the least and nothing to be done nothing save to accept the disaster bring up the reliefengine sharp smith said the traffic superintendent at the terminus when ere a minute was past the hopeless news reached him graham run over for dr westlake for harrison too if hes there splints bandages dressers and all that davies wire back to the other end to send what they can from their reserve and so swiftly as hands and brains could compass it two more engines fled shrieking into the growing dusk of evening behind those two the downmail and the upmail coming nearer and nearer to each other on the single line twenty minutes since they started about said one man who was standing with a watch in his hand in curiously quiet tones it must be soon now and there is a curve about the middle i hope to god there is no friend of mine in either roystons in the down replied another studiously even voice he was going to see his wife but the firsts are well back its the thirds poor devils he paused and the others nodded the thirds doubtless and in one of them far forward crouched raheem staring out into the calm dusk absorbed in the horror of going back going back to die before he had saved his own soul so suddenly through and above the rush and the roar and the rattle that he scarcely heard came a new sound forcing him to listen it was a quivering clamorous insistent whistle it brought no recognition to his ignorance or to the ignorance of those around him but far back in the firstclass carriages white faces peered out into the gloom and foreign voices called to each other danger whistlewhats up still it was a strange disturbing sound with a strange echo and was that an echo of the rush and the roar and the rattle raheem sat up quickly was it the end of all things why had they struck himwhohoshyar then thought ended in a scream of pain there is a man caught by the feet under that wheel said dr westlake not many minutes after as he came out of the hideous pile of wreckage all grimed and smirched he is breathing yet so have him out sharp we may save him but these others he passed on to seek work significantly and so raheem stunned and with both feet crushed to a jelly was dug out the only man left alive in the forward thirdclass carriage of the upmail he was still unconscious when it came to be his turn for the doctors in the crowded hospital badly nourished said dr westlake but it is his only chance harrison the eucalyptus sawdust please it is a good case for it and we shall be short of dressings so two days afterwards raheem recovering from a slight concussion of the brain found himself in a strangely comfortable bed with a curious hump of a thing over his feet under the coverlet he did not know that there were no feet there that they had both been amputated at the ankle and that he was a cripple for life and there was no reason why he should find it out since the sawdust did its work without more ado much to the doctors delight who as he took raheems temperature talked of first intents and septic dressings to his assistant in fact they were both so pleased that it came upon them by surprise one day when raheem with clasped hands asked when he was to die die rubbish said dr westlake cheerfully not from this at any rate and we will do what we can for the lungs afterwards raheems face did not lose its anxiety and when if the huzoor will say shall i be able to walk again as he lay in the comfortable bed he had been making up his mind to sacrifice all comfort to leave life behind him and start on foot for death with his face towards mecca walk echoed the doctor with a significant look at his assistant then he sat down on the edge of the cot and told the truth raheem heard it looking incredulously at the cradle and then suddenly he interrupted a platitude about its being better to be a cripple than to die with an eager question then the huzoor means that i shall never be able to walk again the doctor nodded may god reward the huzoor for ever and ever said raheem in a whisper raising both hands in a salute and his face was one radiant smile dr westlake looked at his assistant as they passed on to the next cot they are an incomprehensible people he said in rather an injured tone i never expected to hear a man thank me rapturously for cutting off both his feet he did not know that cripples are especially exempted from the duty of pilgrimage and that the patient was repeating his version of the text it is better to enter halt into life than having two feet to be cast into hell the kings well this is one of poor craddocks many stories which he told me when we were in the wilderness together engagedlike another moses and aaronin preparing a way for a western people across the desert and dividing its sand waves by a pathway of redbrick ballast edged with steel in other words in making the railway on which he afterwards met his death in trying to prevent a survival of past ages from being in the permanent way of civilisation we used to sit at the door of my little tenttwo englishmen adrift on a sand seaand i used to listen while he talked for the life he had led made him the best of company and his combined ignorance and knowledge of the east was a perpetual surprise some of his stories were grossly frankly impossible but this one despite its strangeness i believed unhesitatingly as any one would have done who had seen as i saw the indescribable worldtarnish which long years of loose living brings to the kindliest face leave it clear bright and eager to a rejuvenescence of love and pity and pain the sun had dipped below the rising rim of the great sandcircle whose centre we were but the sky was still a cloudless expanse of yellow radiance dazzling to the eyes from sheer excess of light there was nothing far or near to differentiate one part of earth or heaven from another save the thin red line of ridiculous little flags we had been planting out during the day and i remember thinking that i could not for the life of me tell the exact spot where five minutes before i had seen the last curved glint of the sun disappearfor one bit of horizon seemed to the full as bright as another looks like the yaller bottle in the chemists shop dont it sir remarked craddock cheerfullyleastways as i used to think when i was a boy lordy lordy boys isis boys i do assure you old pargiters shop to our village was over against the public sir next the church an comin ome o evenins from the catechism sir it seemed jerewsalem the golden expect it was the anathysts an sapphiras an rubies an them sort o stones did it for boysis boys you see sir he gave an apologetic smear to his corncoloured moustache as if to wipe away the flavour of his own sentimentthe wristsmear of those whose hands are habitually soiled it is like a topaz seen against the light i replied accepting both confidence and excuse with the calm indifference which always encouraged craddock to further indulgence i dont think i ever saw it quite so dazzlingly clear did you he paused awhile and the blue eyes bloodshot by exposure to unspeakable lights and unspeakable darknesses of all sorts and kinds grew a trifle absent i dunno but what i ave sir leastways it looks more lightlike from the bottom o a well as savin your presence sir is only natral from the bottom of a well i echoed when was that craddock you never told me that yarn he paused again no sir it aint a pleasing interlood for twas in the mutiny time sir wen we was all mad devils black an whitewhite an black and then suddenly as i have said some past pity and passion and pain seemed to come back upon him with a rush so that he sat staring into that cloudless sky as if he saw a vision and his voice came at last half to himself by the lord as made me i dunno which was worse black nor white white nor black yet it was white as did for me nathaniel james craddock at the bottom o the kings well then he was silent again and i sat silent too for there never was any use in pumping craddock his fund of experiences was too vast for you to be sure of bringing what you wanted to the surface so after a time he began again deviously not as wot it was so to speak a well at all but what they calls in the lingo a bawlya thing you know sir with flights o steps aleadin down to the bowels of the yerthright down to the water as maybe a hundred or a hundred and fifty feet below the surface as the sayin is sir it was just a large round black spot o ink that was wot the water was an standin on the stone edge you could see right up the stairs to a round yaller spot of jerewsalem the golden two spots there were sir owin to there being two flights o steps an many a time as i lay like a rabbit in is burrow down by the water id tell myself luck was in there bein twotwo whites to one black yet after all it was white as did the business for me sir at the bottom o the kings bawly you must have been very young in mutiny time i remarked in casual aid to his lagging confidence one and twenty sirmore by token i come to mans estate as the sayin is at the bottom o that there well lordy i can see it now a sort o mist o light from jerewsalem above afadin away half down the stairs and leavin the rest to get darker an darker to the black spot o water but it had a glint o light on it too that come god knows how when the sun was low as he spoke i had noticed a curious change in his voice a sort of refining process as if he were going back to a self that was less rough less common and the change was still more marked when after a pause he began again it was an awful hot year sir just a white flame of heata burning fiery furnace but there wasnt none of us come through it praisin an magnifyinleastways i didnt but then i was a wild lot run away from home sir that is how i came to be in the country knowing a good bit of the lingo for a youngster served my way out before the mast and then backed my luck and won it too for a rajah fellow paid me to wrestle with his men and play monkey tricks lordy i remember the first time i got in grips with the champion and he stood head down expectin me to go on buttin like a goat there wasnt one of them could touch me sir but that wasnt no protection when the time came its an odd sort of thing i do assure you for a man who knows he could lick every one he sees to be runnin like a hare for dear life hidin by day an circumventin the villages by night but that was how it was for three weeks before i come plumbas the sayin ison the kings well it was right in the worst country and i was footsore and stumblin like as if i were in liquor with the fever a queer sort o place it was as i saw it first in the dawn which comeas the dawns had a trick o doin in those timesa deal too soon for nathaniel james it was right in the open in the middle o a lot o broken bricks and little mounds o mudmiles and miles of them it had seemed to me footsore an stumblin for the place had been a big city so im told sir in the old times and now it was nothin but a plain o broken brick an graves except for a cluster of tall old houses with the usual mudhuts acrowdin up round them and i knew from what id heard that the biggest murdering villains o the lot lived in them houses poor budmarsh mohammedans proud as lucifer ascrewing the tails o the ryots for a livinthough why ryots sir is hard to say for a more peaceable lot o ablebodied men and women never was well there i was in the worst place i could have chosen and the dawn comin sudden all in a blaze then right at my feet i sees the bawly just a hole o broken masonry an the steps leading down like a rabbit burrow they didnt seem to be much used that side furthest from the village among the graves for the drifted sand was alying thick on the topmost steps and i didnt see no footmarks to speak of only a queer sort o track that might ave bin a mans and mightnt anyhow i thought id risk it seeing as if any one come down the one stair i could hoof it up the other an theres generally a lot o little arched recesses at the bottom o bawlies where i could lie low so i chanced it an lordy wasnt it cool as i hobbled down them vaulted steps twas a fine place sir when all was said an done halfadozen steps or so and then a landin as the sayin is with a sort o travellers rest on either side but i went right down to the bottom so as to see what sort o trap id got into an i found it none so bad for there wasnt no passage round as there is in most bawlies but only a arched room on either side my stairs ending sheer in the drop o ink which filled up a round sort o well that was vaulted over up in the dark somewhere so there wasnt no way of getting from one stair to the other but by a leap such as there wasnt one but nathaniel james in the country side as could leap it an that would give me time still i do assure you sir it takes the spunk out of a fellow to go skulkin round for three weeks with your life in your hand in baggy silk trousers an a dressin gownfor id put on what they calls a killit as the rajah give me for smashing up another rajahs championthats a dress o state sir an killit or not it nigh killed me for it was chock full o embroidery an that hot but beggars mustnt be choosers and that night i run off from the palace it was all i could lay hands on an did its work toojust to give what them surveyor chaps calls the proper contour as the sayin is anyhow what with the stain a deal more knowledge of the lingo than i have now sir an through my being considerable stronger than the only two fellars as caught me napping here i was in the kings bawly watching them two round spots o jerewsalem like a man in his grave awaitin the last trump an the first pair o feet i saw on the stairs opposite set me atremblin like a ferreted rabbit even though i knew that wot with the stairs an the drop o ink id ave a good five minutes start but then i heard the jingles on them sir and knew it was only a woman from the village comin down to fill her waterpot there was a lot o them come chatterin and laughin during the day but always down the further stair and lordy it was cool after the fiery furnace i had a mouthful or two o corn id looted so when dusk came it seemed to me as if i couldnt move onsmall blame to me sir seein how cool an quiet it was and i so close on done but just as i was acallin myself names for bein lazy come a footfall on my stair now you know sir them bawlies bein arched an all that is awful echoey places an i do assure you i made up my mind a man was coming down slow and deliberatelike i looked out an couldnt see nothing but there was the footfall just like a procession an then somethin let loose a bellow and i felt inclined to cut but then i thought id wait a bit seein i was stronger nor most an the drop o ink was handy for a corpse so i waited until the bellow come again an this timebein close as it were an out o the echoi knew my friend for i do assure you sir it was nothin but the biggest bull toad you ever see coming flop flop down the stair for his evenin drink a great green thing with a yaller waistcoat as sat up on the last step looked at me quite proudlike lordy how i laughed it was the first laugh id laughed for three week an it done me good that an seeing the bull toad go douse into the water like a man for it set me alongin for a swim too an when i come out o that drop o cold ink i was a new man slept like a babby in its cradle and woke to see through the maze o arches a woman on the tother side arinsin out her brass pot quite calmlike she was atakin his breakfast to her man in the fields i expect for there was a pile o them flapjacks on a platter beside her i dunno sir if it was the sleep or the sight o food and me ravenin wolves or just sheer devilryfor i was a wild lotbut i out o my rabbit utch an let loose a yell you may well call em bawlies sir for i do assure you i felt kind o queer myself havin made all that noise she gave no look but let loose another yell of her own as she turned tail and ran up them stairs like a lamplighter it seemed to me as if she was callin on the kingthe king but i didnt stop to think now was my time i was over the drop o ink clear on to the second step in my hurry before she was halfway up to jerewsalem an i was back again to the utch with the flapjacks making ready to run if need be for dear life when i heard the silver tinkle again an womens voices every word sir i could hear through its bein a bawly an i heard herhe paused sharply waited a second and began againthere was two on them now disputin an halflaughin halfcryin one was pullin the other an tellin her she was a fool there wasnt no king mores the pity and if there was she wasnt afraid seein he was her bapdadathats ancestors sirbut the tother wouldnt hear of it an kept sayin twas well enough for some folk as pretended wisdom but every one knew the kings footmark on the stair an had heard his voice after dusk my friend the bull toad thinks i feelin considerable easier in my mind for i knew enough o their ways you see sir to know as there wasnt much chance o any one else comin down my stairs if a ghost lived there so i listened to the argufying quite interestedlike but it wasnt no goodthe halflaughin voice hadnt a chance even when it grew sober and cried shame on bein frightened at the spirit of the good king who every day come down to his bawly all alone so that any pore soul as wanted justice might go down the other stair and tell him what was amiss across the black water with no fear if he was only there now instead o bein where saints are i heard her say id go down this instant an tell him to stop it allbut theres no one to listen nowadaysno one an with that she come tinkling down the steps alonea tall girl sirbut theretaint no good describin her for i never see her but in halflight till well she just rinsed out her pot like the rest o them and filled it but afore she went she stood so with it on her head on the tother side o the black water for a moment an said quite loud an boldlike salaam mahardj footnote bad living footnote greeting or peace to the king i was that wild sort as i might have given a bellow just to frighten her for the fun o the thing but i kept somehow athinkin o what she had said of the old king atrailin down them steps in his royal robes and listenin in that bawly to all the pore folks troubles an apromisin never to forsake them but to bring justice with him down the stairs to the end o all things not that he was an old king sir as i found out afterwards but a young sort o saint as got killed afore his time you see i heard a lot o talk from the women as came down in companies skeery and just in a mortal hurry to fill their jars and git home because of the girl as said she had heard the king in the daytime so that it came to me sir that i couldnt do better nor lie hidden a day or two and get strong where i was for there wasnt no manner o hurry like as not id get killed somehow before i got to the river and i couldnt help anyways seein as i couldnt look to get into any o the places where we was holdin out against the black devils an that evenin when the old bull toad come down for his swim i just laughed again quite lighthearted and says as she said salaam maharaj well she was the only one as come alone after that but come she did an every time she come she would stand an say loudlike but a bit wistful salaam maharaj she was a tall girl but thereit aint no use describing her so what with the women coming all together i didnt have much chance o flapjacks and what with the village bein walled in an full of them murderin nobility i wasnt so to say successful in thievin an at last i see it was time to move on a bad time too for i heard from the womens talk as there was crowds o sepoys about ascrewin the pore folks tails an i heard her say to em once as it were their fault if they wasnt so frightened o the king said she maybe hed come back and give em justice an that evenin when she come down she stood so with her arms spread out lookin up the stair and said again bowing down after their fashion salaam maharaj your slave waits there was a pile o flapjacks on the platter beside her waterpot an maybe it was the sight o them and knowin they would be worth gold to me or maybe because it was my last time o askin or maybe the devil that was in me but i just out o my rabbit utch in my baggy silk trousers and dressinggownin the whole blessed killit sirand stood quite still on the steps it was most dark you see sir an the contours was correc so twas no wonder she give a little cry halfglad halfafraid as she come up from her salaam i guessed shed run and leave me the flapjacks but she wasnt that sort a tall girlbut there it aint no use describin well afore i could think what to do she was at it such a tale o wrong sir not about herself though she was one of those pore souls as is born widows but about lord knows what of the people an i listened did you ever listen sir to a womans voice just chock full o confidence in your bein a good sort well i did an i dunno how twas sir but the confidence was catchin i was a reckless bold chap you see an i knew she had grit so the next moment i was over that circle o black water and beside her she give another little cry but my lord she had grit for she drew back quick against the wall and thrust out her hands to keep me off the king the king she said i thought you was the king an with that i caught her by the hands im not the king says i but dont you be afraid im only a pore man as wont hurt you im not afraid she says tryin to make believe you come down the kings stairs o justice she said an thats enough then somehow i dunno how it was sir but all in a moment it come home to me that id go my whole pile on her an i drop her hands an i says yes i come down the kings stairs and ill be a king to you for justice if youll be a queen to me and by god sir she was so there we were lookin into each others eyes and sayin nothin till she gave a queer little laugh why she says youre a white man and with that she lay her finger quick and confident on my wrist an sure enough what with the swim and the dark it were white indeedwhite an shivery too with the touch somehow so that i couldnt but keep her hand so and say yes my dear im white and youre black im a man and youre a woman but it shant make no odds im king and youre queen in this here bawly and there shant be nothing but justice atween us so help me god an there wasnt sir no though we went our whole pile on each other i do assure you sir the assurance was needless one look at his face was enoughthat worldworn face with its bloodshot eyes fixed on the dazzling glory of the sky as if they saw a vision i used to see her first against jerewsalem he went on in a lower tone then i could hear her come down the stairs ever so soft to stand close to the waters edge and cry salaam maharajfor she called me that just for fun you see sir an there werent much wistfulness in her voice sir mostly laughter an somethin better nor laughter when i come leapin across that drop o ink to stand beside her for a little an tell herwhat folks say to each other when theyve set their whole pile on each other you know sir for she wouldnt never come down the kings stairs sayin it was unlucky an what not excuses sir but i understood em and i didnt want her for you see it was justice between us id sworn and i was a wild lot she had told her fathera blind old brahman sir awful holy and nigh bedridden tooand he sent word to say stop where i was the villagers wouldnt venture down the stairs either and if they did wouldnt harm me being as i say sir as peaceable a lot o ablebodied men as ever was but the maraudin murderin crew in the big hawelisthats houses sirwas harbouring those mutinous devils of jack pandies and playin high old tommy for miles round so id better lie low till justice came as itd sure to do at last seein that the lord was king they talks a sight sir about the heathen and their ignorance but i do assure you she knew a deal more nor me what with being of a kings family an havin a bedridden saint of a brahman for a father an they maynt know much booklearnin praps but some of em knows how to make a man put his whole pile on them and she had grit my lord she had grit yet there was a catch in her breath that evenin when i was nigh mad with fear lest she had come to harm because it was so late and hearing her footfall on the stair i leapt over and nearly fell back into the inkpot through seein her in a mans dress id rather you didnt come if theres danger said i quite sharplike when she told me the sepoys was setting watch because folk said the white soldiers were acoming dont i cant stand it here in the dark idle thinkin o you god knows how ill fend for myself quite well an with that she laughed low with the little catch in her breath still and come a bit closer so as i could slip my arm round her a little an by that i knew twas more danger than she let onfor she was not that sort now dont you come says i as i might be the king himself givin orders i wont have it if the soldiers is comin theyll bring justice an if not a little starvin wont hurt me for im gettin quite strong again an so i was sir what with the rest and the food an the happiness for i do assure you sir on my solemn oath that i was happy at the bottom o that kings bawly happy by the lord sir twas enough to make a man happy to see the look she gave me as much as to say i was strong enough and everything enough for her for though it was nigh dark i could see her face from its bein so close to mineshe bein a tall girlbut there it aint no use describin there dont seem much to say sir when it comes to lookin at each other that way an so we stood silent a bit till sudden i hear the old bull toad at his jinks again and partly to ease off the sort o burstin feelin at my heart i cries with a laugh theres the king but she just lays her head down pugree an all on my shoulder and says with a sob no heres the king the king as i come to for justice he paused for so long that something of the excitement which had been thrilling in his tones seemed to pass into my mind and i felt almost a shock when he went on quite calmly well it was arranged that she wasnt to come back for three days onless somethin turned up i would have it so an she give in at last it was mortal dull without her and i made up my mind when i see her again to tell her id back my luck once more and fight my way safe somehow then when it was over id come back for her for it didnt seem it could go against me as i sat down by the drop o ink alookin up to jerewsalem over the way and awonderin when i should see her on the top step acomin for justice to her king well she come at last it were the second day i think sir and it took me all of a sudden for owin to its bein a bawly in the bowels in the yerth you couldnt hear nothin of what was goin on up top i was sittin lookin over the way when i hear a noise behind an a voice maharaj maharaj it was she sir down the kings steps in the mans dress an behind her my god not black devils but white ones with red coats an set bayonetsmaharaj maharaj justice justice i was out sir tearing up to meet her in a second shoutin in english to hold hardthat she was a woman but them cursed bawly echoes mixed it all up an the cursed baggy trousers and things didnt give me no chance of ahearin through its bein halfdark maharaj maharaj i heard it plain enough god knows i hear it now sometimes sir an i see her face as i saw it for the only time in the light afore i fell over her dead body alying on the steps halfway down the stairs o justice they told me after as i had finished the cry for her many and many a time whilst i lay in orspitalfor theyd struck me playfullike before they found out i was white an i took mortal bad but there wasnt much use in justice then for none o us an i never could tell quite how it happened for when i went back the village was just bricks and the corpses lyin about thick unburied they had had a hard fight as they told me had the tommies an bein fresh from cawnpore was keenas was natralan she was in mans clothes you see when she come flyin down the steps o justice calling for the king he sat silent looking out to the now darkening sky where the light had faded save in the widening rays spreading out from the grave of the sun and down one of them as down a golden staircase i seemed to see a flying figure with outstretched arms pass to jerusalem the golden with the cry maharaj maharaj but craddock was already clearing his throat suggestively for the usual glass of whisky and water yet ere he drank it his eyes wandered absently helplessly to the horizon and i heard him mutter to himself an so twas white not black as did for nathaniel james craddock at the bottom o the kings well and as i looked at him drinksodden and reckless i understood that when the time came he too would have the right to pass down the kings stair seeking justiceand finding it uma himavutee i umadevi was sitting on a heap of yellow wheat which showed golden against the silvery surface of her husbands threshingfloor she was a tall woman of about five and twenty with a fair finecut face set in a perfect oval above the massive column of her throat she was a brahmani of the suruswutee tribein other words a member of perhaps the most ancient aryan colony in india which long ages back settled down to cultivate the hurreana or green country so called no doubt before its sacred river the suruswutee lost itself in the dry deserts west of delhi a member therefore of a community older than brahmanism itself and which clings oddly to older faiths older ways and older gods so umadevi who was on the rack of that jealousy which comes to most women whether they be ignorant or cultured had the advantage over most of the latter she could look back through the ages to a more inspiring and stimulating progenitrix than mother eve for despite the pharisaical little hymn of western infancy bidding us thank goodness for our birth and inheritance of knowledge one can scarcely be grateful for a typical woman simpering over an apple or subsequently sighing over the difficulties of dress the fact being that our story of creation only begins when humanity fairly started on the rakes progress felt the necessity for bolstering up its selfrespect by the theory of original sin but this woman could dimly through the numb pain of her heart feel the influence of a nobler earthmother in uma himavuteeuma her namesakeuma of the himalayas birthplace of all sacred thingsuma of the sunny yet snowy peaks emblem at once of perfect wifehood motherhood and that mystical virginity which in everidden faiths finds its worship in mariolatry that she could even dimly recognise the beauty of this conception came partly from the simple yet ascetic teachings of her race partly because there are some natures east and west which turn instinctively to uma himavutee and this woman among yellow corn was of that goodly company yet a sharp throb of sheer animal jealousythe jealousy which in most civilised communities is considered a virtue when sanctified by the bonds of matrimonyseemed to tear her heart as her hands paused in her patient darning of goldcoloured silk on dull madderred stuff and her eyes sought the figure of a man outlined against the dull red horizon it was shivdeo her husband returning from his work in the fields she folded up her work methodically leaving the needle with its pennant of floss still twined deftly in and out of the threads as a mark to show where to take up the appointed pattern once more for umadevis work was quaintly illustrative of her life being done from the back of the stuff and going on laboriously conscientiously trustfully without reference to the unseen golden diaper slowly growing to beauty on the other side of the cloth that remained as a reward to tired eyes and fingers when the toil was over and the time came to piece the whole web into a garmenta wedding veil perchance for her daughter had she had one but uma was childless yet there was no reproach no discontent in her

with her cowardly hintsto say to her that the time had come when the few ought to be made more ah if shivdeos younger brother had not died before his childwife was of age to be brought home this need not have been though even then a virtuous woman for her husbands sake ought umadevi down by the wateredge as if to escape from her own thoughts turned hastily to spread the corner of her veil over the wide mouth of the brazen pot and with a smaller cup began to ladle the muddy water on to the strainer but the thought was passionate insistent ought what was the use of prating about ought she could not she would not let shivo take another woman by the hand how could they ask her still young still beautiful still beloved to give him another bride why it would be her part to lift the veil from the new beauty as she lifted it from the now brimming waterpotso uma himavutee what did she see her own face reflected in the brassringed water as in a mirror set in a golden frame clear as in any mirror her own beautythe lips shivo had kissedthe eyes which held him so dear all all unchanged ah but it was impossible that was what the pious old folk preachedwhat the pious young folk pretended she poised the brazen vessel on her head telling herself passionately it was impossible yet the sight of the wide courtyard empty save for babajee creeping about to feed the milch kine and do what he could of womans work revived that refrain of selfreproach there are too few of us shivo himself had said itfor the first time it is true but would it be the last wherefore since it was true she set down the waterpot and began to rekindle the ashes on the hearth thinking stupidly of that reflection of her own face but water was like a mans heart it could hold more faces than one ari hai sister called mai radha pausing at the open doorway to look in and see the housemistress clapping unleavened bread between her palms with the hot haste of one hard pressed for time thou hast no rest but one woman is lost in these courts i mind when thy motherinlaw lived and there were young things growing up in each corner that is as it should be a slow flush darkened umas face young things come quick enough when folks will she retorted passionately give me but a years grace gossip and i umadevi will fill the yard tooif i wish it filled ay and without asking thy help either it was intolerable that this woman with her yearly endless babies should come and crow over the childless hearth yet she was right and again the old sickening sense of failure replaced the flash of indignant forgetfulness heed not my food daughter came the cheerful contented old voice i can cook mine own and shivo must need his after the days toil if thou take it to him at the threshingfloor twill save time when hands are few the minutes are as jewels and it grows dark already thou wilt need a cresset for safety from the snakes once more the woman winced that was true also yet had she been doing her duty and bringing sons to the hearth it would not have been so for the glory of coming motherhood would have driven the serpents from her path footnote a common belief in india she paused at the doorstep to give a backward glance to see the old man already at his womans work and her heart smote her again was it seemly work for the most learned man in the village who had taught his son to be so good so kind yet shivo of himself would never say the word neither would the old man that was the worst of it for it would have been easier to have kicked against the pricks she passed swiftly to the fields the brass platterglittering under the flicker of the cresset and piled with dough cakes and a green leaf of curdspoised gracefully on her right palm the brass lotah of drinking water hanging from her left hand the heavy folds of her gold and madder draperies swaying as she walked it was not yet quite dark a streak of red light lingered in the horizon though overhead the stars began to twinkle matched in the dim stretch of shadowy plain by the twinkling lights showing one by one from the threshingfloors but shivdeos was still dark because there had been no one to bring him a lamp she gave an angry laugh set her teeth and stepped quicker if it came to that she had better speak at once speak nowtonightbefore mai radha or some one else had a chancespeak out in the open where there were no spies to seeto hear it was a clear night she thought for sure and despite the red warning giving promise of a clear dawn one of those dawns maybe when like a pearledged cloud the far distant himalayas would hang on the northern horizon during the brief twilight and vanish before the glare of day ai mai uma must be cold up there in the snows and shivo must be hungry by this time watching perhaps the twinkling light she carried come nearer and nearer the thought pleased her soothing her simple heart and the placid routine of her life came to aid her as she set the platter before her husband reverently with the signs of worship she would have yielded a god were they not she and shivo indissolubly joined together for this world and the next was not a good woman redemptions source to her husband babajee had read that many times from his old books so she felt no degradation as she set the water silently by shivos right hand scooped a hollow in the yellow wheat for the flickering cresset and then drew apart into the shadows leaving the man alone to perform the ritual in that little circle of light he was her husband that was enough with her chin upon both her hands she crouched on another pile of corn and watched him with sad eyes far and near all was soft silent darkness save for those twinkling stars shining in heaven and matched on earth far and near familiar peace familiar certainty even that pain at her heart had not others felt it and set it aside the calm endurance of her world its disregard of pain seemed to change her own smart to a dull ache as her eyes followed every movement of the man who loved her thou art silent wife he said kind wonder in his tone when the need for silence being over she still sat without a word that roused her silent yea silent for too long she rose suddenly and stood before him tall and straight in the circle of light then her voice came clear without a tremble there are too few of us in the house husband we must have more we must have young hands when ours are old he stood up in his turn stretching his hands towards her uma say not so he faltered i want no more she shook her head the fields want them and even thou then her calm broke dissolved disappeared like a childs sand barrier before the tide she flung her arms skyward and her voice came like a cry ask herask thy sisterlet her do all i cannot and sheshe must come from afar shivo from far not from herelest mai radha she broke off turned and flung herself face down in the corn silently clutching at it with her hand shivdeo stood looking out over the shadowy fields they need them surely he said softly after a time and my father has a right he paused stooped and laid a timid touch on the womans shoulder yea she shall come from far wife from far then there was silence far and near ii there was no lack of life now in the wide courtyards though the year claimed by umas pride had scarcely gone by and there was more to come ere the sunset if the gossips said sooth as they passed in and out setting the iron knife suspended on a string above the inner door aswinging as they elbowed it aside from within came a babel of voices striving to speak softly and so sinking into a sort of sibilant hiss broken by one querulous cry of intermittent complaint without in the bigger courtyard was a cackle and clamour joyfully excited round a platter of sugardrops set for due refreshment of the neighbours it would be a boy for sure they said the omens being all propitious and purmeshwar well aware of the worthiness of the household but good lack what ways foreign women had there was the girls mother disregarding this old custom performing that new mummery as if there were no canon of right and wrong yet they werethose town womenof the race doubtless of the same race it was passing strange nevertheless uma herself did bravely having always been of the wise sort she had given the word back keenly but now to mai radha who as usual had her pestle in the mortar and must needs join in the strange womans hints that the first wife was better away from the sufferers sight puramesh what an idea she had spoken sharp and fair as was right seeing that it was hard above the common on umaso young so handsome so wellbeloved many a pious one in her place with no motherinlaw to deal withonly two softhearted softtongued menwould have closed the door on another wedding yet awhile and bided on providence longer small blame either it was not ten years since those two had come together while as for affection footnote the universal god the rush of words slackened as the object of it set the swinging knife aside and came forward to see that naught was lacking to the hospitality of the house with those strange women within lording it over all by virtue of their relationship to the expectant mother it behoved her honour to see that there was no possible ground for complaint it was a year since uma had flung herself face down upon the wheat and now the yellow corn once more lay in heaps upon the white threshingfloor another harvest had been sown and watered and reaped but uma was waiting for hers and her mind was in a tumult of jealous fear shivo with all his goodness his kindness to her could scarcely help loving the mother of his child better than the woman who had failed to bring him one how could she take that other womans son in her arms and hold it up for the fathers first look yet that would be her part the strain of the thought showed in her face as she moved about seeing to this and that speaking to those other women serenely cheerfully her pride ensured so much within the coming grandmother heaved a very purposeful sigh of relief at her absence the patient would be better now that those glowering eyes were away whereat mai radha the timeserver nodded her head sagely but the girlish voice from the bed set round with lamps and flowers rose in fretful denial hold thy peace mother thou canst not understand being of the town it is different here in the village the mother giggled nudging her neighbour nine to credit ten to debit thats true of a first wife town and country but think as thou wilt honey trust me to see she throws no evil eye on thee or the child she shall not even see it till the fateful days be over the village midwife an old crone sitting smoking a pipe at the foot of the bed laughed thou art out there mother tis her part her right to show the babe to its father that is old fashion and we hold to it show it to its father good lack heard one ever the like shrilled the indignant grandmother to be why with us he must not see it for days is it not so friends the townbred contingent clamoured shocked assent the midwife and her cronies stood firm uma appealed to by a deputation met the quarrel coldly i care not she said settle it as you please i am ready to hold the child or not so a compromise was effected between the disputants within before the beating of brass trays announced the happy birth of a son and they came trooping into the outer court full of words and explanations but uma heard nothing and saw nothing except the crying froglike morsel of humanity they thrust into her unwilling arms so that was shivos child how ugly and what an illtempered little thing suddenly the gurgling cry ceased as instinctively she folded her veil about the struggling naked limbs so so cried the gossips pushing and pulling joyfully excitedly yonder is the master all is ready she set her teeth for the ordeal and let herself be thrust towards shivo who was seated by the door his back towards her she had not seen him since the advent of the gossips at dawn had driven the menkind from the homestead and now the sun was setting redly as on that evening a year ago when she had told him they were too few for the house well there were more now and this was the worst now she was to see love grow to his face for the child which was not hers knowing that love for its mother must grow also unseen in his heart so so cried the busy unsympathetic voices intent on their own plans hold the child so sister above his shoulders and bid him take his first look at a son the old dogged determination to leave nothing undone which should be done strengthened her to raise the baby as she was bid stoop with it over shivos shoulder and say almost coldly i bring thee thy son husband look on it and take its image to thine heart then she gave a quick incredulous cry for as she stooped she saw her own face reflected in the brassringed mirror formed by the wide mouth of the brimming waterpot which was set on the floor before shivdeo higher sister higher cried the groups let him see the babe in the water for lucks sake so ari father is not that a son indeed wah the sweetest doll sweet enough in truth looked the reflection of that tiny face where her own had been she let it stay there for a second or two then a sudden curiosity came to her and she drew aside almost roughly still keeping her eyes on the watermirror ah there was her husbands face now with a look in it that she had never seen beforethe look of fatherhood without a word she thrust her burden back into other arms asking impatiently if that were all or if they needed more of her services more indeed muttered the grandmother tartly as she disappeared again intent on sugar and spices behind the swinging knife sure some folk had small labour or pains over this days good work lucky for the master that there be other women in the world uma looked after her silently beset by a great impatience of the noise and the congratulations she wanted to get away from it all from those whispers and giggles heard from within and interrupted every now and then by that new gurgling cry the excitement was over the gossips were departing one by one shivo and his father were being dragged off to the village square for a pipe of peace and thanksgiving no one wanted her now her part in the house was done and out yonder in the gathering twilight the heaps of corn were alone as she was she could at least see to their safety for a while and have time to remember those faces hers and the childs and shivos well it was all over now no wonder they did not need her any more since she had done allyea she had done her duty to the uttermost a sort of passionate resentment at her own virtue filled her mind as wearied out with the physical strain she lay down to rest upon the yielding yellow wheat how soft it was how cool she nestled into it head hands feet gaining a certain consolation from the mere comfort to her tired body and as she looked out over her husbands fields the very knowledge that the harvest had been reaped and gathered soothed her besides in the years to come there would be other hands for other harvests that was also as it should be and yet she turned her face down into the wheat shivo shivo she sobbed into the fruits of the harvest which she had helped to sow and gather shivo shivo but to her creed marriage had for its object the preservation of the hearth fire not the fire of passion and the jealousy which is a virtue to the civilised was a crime to this barbarian so as she lay halfhidden in the harvested corn the thought of the babys face and hers and shivosall all in the watermirror brought her in a confused halfcomprehending way a certain comfort from their very companionship so by degrees the strain passed from mind and body leaving her asleep with slackened curves upon the heap of corn asleep peacefully until a hand touched her shoulder gently and in the soft grey dawn she saw her husband standing beside her she rose slowly drawing her veil closer with a shiver for the air was chill i have been seeking thee since nightfall wife he said in gentle reproach with a ring of relief in his voice i fearedi know not whatthat thou hadst thought me churlish perhaps because i did not thank thee forfor thy son his hand sought hers and found it as they stood side by side looking out over the fields with the eyes of those whose lives are spent in sowing and reaping looking out over the wide sweep of bare earth and beyond it on the northern horizon the dim dawnlit peaks of the himalayas he favours her in the face husband she said quietly but he hath thy form that is as it should be for thou art strong and she is fair so as they went homeward through the lightening fieldsshe a dutiful step behind the manthe printing presses over at the other side of the world were busy amid flaring gasjets and the clamour of marvellous machinery in discussing in a thousand ways the dreary old problems of whether marriage is a failure or not it was not so to umadevi young lochinvar young lochinvar in the original story came out of the west in this tale he came out of the east and the most matchmaking mamma might be disposed to forgive him partly on account of his youth partly because he really was not a free agent they were cousins of course in the finest race of the panjabpossibly of the worldcousins have a right to cousins provided the relationship lie through the mothers brother or the fathers sister the converse for some mysterious reason being anathema maranatha but nanuks mother wife of big suchet singh head man of aluwallah village was sister to dhyan singh the armourer who plied his trade in the little courtyard hidden right in the heart of the big city a big man too highfeatured and handsome hightempered also as the steel which he inlaid so craftily with gold for all that round podgy mai gunga his wife ruled him by virtue of a smartness unknown to his slower gentler nature not so gentle however but that he mourned the degeneracy of these latter piping days of peace they and the arms act had driven him from the manufacture of sword hilts and helmets shields and corselets to that of plaques and inkstands candlesticks and ashtrays from the means of resistance to the decoration of victorious drawingrooms not that he nourished illfeeling against those victors they were a brave lot and since then his people had helped them bravely to keep their winnings only it was dull work so every now and again dhyan singh revenged himself by making a paper knife in the form of some bloodthirsty lethal weapon and put his best work on it just to keep his hand in little pertabi his daughter used to sit and watch her father at the tiny forge set in the central sunshine of the yard it was funny to see the shaving of sheer steel curl up from the graver guided in its flowing curves by nothing but that skilled eye and hand funnier still to watch the gold wire nestle down so obediently into the groove funniest of all to blow the bellows when the time came to put that iridescent blue temper to the finished work then naked to the waist the soft brown hair on her forehead plaited in tiniest plaits into a looped fringe a little gold filigree cup poised on the top of her head a long betasselled pigtail hanging down behind pertabi would set her short redtrousered legs very far apart and puff and blow and laugh and then blow again to her own and her fathers intense delight for dhyan having a couple of strapping sons to satisfy mai gungas heart felt himself free to adore this child of his later years but even when there was blowing to be done pertabi did not find life in the city half as amusing as life out in the village at her aunts with cousin nanuk as a playfellow nanuk to whom she was to be married by and by that had been settled when she was a baby in arms for in those and for many years after suchet singhs wife and mai gunga had been as friendly as sistersinlaw can well be that is to say there were visits to the village for change of air especially at sugarbaking time while those who wished for shopping or society came as a matter of course to the armourers house the world wags in the same fashion east and west especially among the women folk they will make a fine pair god keep them to the auspicious day the deepchested countrywomen would say piously then mai gunga would giggle a bit and remark that if nanuk grew so fast she would have to leave pertabi at home next time whereupon the boys mother would flare up and sniff as country folk do at town ideas in her family such talk had never been necessary the lads and lasses grew up together and mothers were in no hurry to bring age and thought upon them perhaps that was the reason why men and women alike were of goodly stature and strength for even mai gunga must admit that dhyan was at least a fine figure of a man so there would be words to while away the hours before the men returned from the fields and outside under the bushy mulberry trees pertabi and nanuk would be fighting and making it up again in the cosmopolitan fashion of healthy children of the two pertabi perhaps hit the hardest she certainly howled the loudest being a wilful young person nanuk used to implore her not to tease the sacred peacocks when they came sedately by companies to drink at the village tank as the sun set red over the limitless plane of young green corn and she would squat down suddenly on her redtrousered heels with her hands tight clasped behind her back and promise to be as still as a grey crane if she might only look then some vainglorious cock was sure to show off his tail every tail was to pertabis eager eyes the most beautiful one in the world and she must needs have a featherjust one little feather from it as a keepsakejust a little keepsake now what pertabi desired she got at any rate if nanuk had aught to say towards the possibility so the little tyrant would play with the feather for five minutes then fling it away but nanuk serious conscientious nanuk would set aside half his supper of curds on the sly and sneak out with it after sundown as an oblation to the mysterious village god who lived in a red splashed stone under the peepul tree else the peacocks being angry might not cry for rain and then what would become of the green corn nanuk was a born cultivator true in most things above all to mother earth despite the peacocks feathers however not without a will of his own for when on one of his visits to the city pertabi insisted on handling the little squirrel he brought with him housed in his high turban and it bit her he laughed saying he had told her so nay more when she chased the frightened little creature savagely howling for vengeance he fell upon her and boxed her ears soundly much to mai gungas displeasure a rough village lout and her darling the daintiest little morsel of flesh i dont care sobbed pertabi ill bite him hard next timeyes i will nano youll see if i dont mai gunga however was right in one thing pertabi was an extremely pretty child the gossips coming in of an afternoon to discuss births marriages and deaths took to shaking their heads and saying that she might have made a better match than nanuk who every one thought would limp for life in consequence of that fall from the topmost branch of the shisham tree where the squirrels built their nests not much of a limp perhaps but who did not know that under the bonesetters care a broken leg often came out a bit shorter than the other even if it was as strong as ever mai gungas plump pert face hardened but she said nothing not even when a new acquaintance the wife of a rich contractor on the lookout for a bride of good family openly bewailed the prior claim on pertabi nevertheless the next time that the sisterinlaw came to town and on leaving it laden with endless bundles wrapped in manchester handkerchiefs spoke confidently of the meeting at sugartime mai gunga threw difficulties in the way she was too busy to come herself nanuk still a semiinvalid must be quite sufficient charge for her sisterinlaw besides seeing that pertabi touched the eights she thought it time for village customs to give way to greater decorum briefly despite the peculiar virtue of some peoples families she did not choose that her daughter should be out of her sight the two women as might be supposed parted with ceremony and effusion but suchet singhs wife had barely arrived in the wide village courtyards ere she burst forth mark my words she said even as she disposed her bundles about her that townbred woman means mischief i was a fool to give in to you and dhyan instead of having the barber as to a stranger not that i want the little hussy above other brides but i would not have nanuk slighted suchet singh laughed twenty mile of an ekka hath shook thy brains out wife what talk is this they are two halves of one pea as friend elahi buksh saith do dil razi to kia kare kazi when two are heart to heart wheres the parsons part tra thats neither in three nor thirteen retorted his wife give me the barber for certainty footnote the barber is always employed in regular betrothals meanwhile pertabi was howling in the little courtyard much to big softhearted dhyans distress let her go but this once he pleaded aside truly thou art over anxious and she but seven for all her spirit seventy or seven god knows thee for a baby snapped mai gunga would i had never listened to thee and thy sister though for sure the children were pretty as marionettes it was a play to think of it but a mother knows her daughter better than the father though it seems thou wilt be ordering the weddinggarments next so be it but till then pertab goes not to nanuk tis not seemly ii dont want nanuk howled pertabi ii want the fresh molassesi doi do want however was her master since her own obstinacy was but inherited from her mother so she sat sulkily in the sunshine refusing the armourers big caresses or the charms of bellowsblowing while she pictured to herself with all the vividness of rage nanuk going downgoing down aloneto watch the great shallow pans of foamy frothy fragrant juice shrink and shrink in the dark low hut where one could scarcely see save for the flame of the furnaces what joy to feed those flames with the dry crushed refuse of the cane and leaves what bliss to thrust a tentative twig on the sly into the seething darkening molasses and then escape deftly to that shadowy hidingplace by the well and gravely consider the question as to whether it was nearly boiled enough toffeemaking all over the world has a mysterious fascination for children and this was toffeemaking on a gigantic scale the legitimate bairns part of scraping from each brew never tasted half so sweet as those stolen morsels if only because when you threw away the sucked twigs the squirrels would come shyly from the peepul tree where the green pigeons cooed all day long and fight for your leavings pertabi could see the whole scene when she closed her eyes the level plain the shadow of the trees blotting out the sunshine the trickle of running water from the well the creaking of the presses the babel of busy voices and over all through all that lovely lovely smell of toffee yes sugarbaking time in the village was heavenly and nanuk was greedygreedy as a grey crow to keep it all to himself when spring brought big suchet to pay the village revenue into the office he and the armourer met as ever on the best of terms nevertheless their subsequent interviews with their womankind were less satisfactory thou art worse than a peacock which cries even after rain has fallen finished the big villager testily what is it to me if women come or go dhyan is a man of mettle and word yet in his heart he knew well that the armourer had no more to say to such matters in the narrow city court than he had in the wide village yard where the kine stood in rows and nanuks tumbler pigeons never lacked a grain of corn at which to peck as for mai gunga her wrath became finally voluble at the hint thrown out by big dhyan that if she went no more to the village folk might talk of pertab being slighted slighted indeed with half the eligible mothers agog with envy slighted when but for this crippleyea dhyan need not make four eyes at hershe said cripple and meant it he had a broken leg and that to a man of sense was sufficient excuse for breach of betrothals if indeed there ever had been such a thing as a betrothal which for her part she denied dhyan singh swore many big oaths vowed many mighty vows that he would have naught to do with such womans work not even if it became clear that as his wife hinted his little pertab would not be welcome in his sisters house yet he scowled over the idea twisted his beard tighter over his ears as became a man and looked very fierce and when a month or two later suchet singhs wife met his halting apology for mai gungas absence with a distinct sniff and a cool remark that she really did not carenanuk could no doubt do better in brideshe came home in a towering passion to his anvil and made a paper knife fit for a brigand to have such a thing said to him even in jest when he for his sisters sake had been willing to waive the fact of nanuk being a cripple cripple indeed shrieked the boys mother when suchet came back from the city one day with dhyans remark enlarged and illustrated by friendly gossip lo husband that is an end whose fault if he limpsonly in running mind not in walking whose indeed whose but that immodest wicked illbroughtup hussys was it not to get her another squirrel because she cried so for his that he climbed let her have her girl we will have damages so when sugarbaking time came round again suchet and dhyan rather to their own surprise found themselves claimant and defendant in a breach of betrothal case for the recovery of fifteen hundred rupees spent in preliminary expenses yet despite their surprise they were both beside themselves with rage dhyan because of the unscrupulous claim when not one penny had been spent suchet because of the slur cast on his boys straight limbs by the secondary plea in defence that even if there had been a betrothal and not a family understanding the crippled condition of the bridegroom was sufficient excuse for the breach of contract the actual point of the betrothal being so effectually overlaid by these lies as to be obscured even from the litigants own eyes it was one gorgeous blue day in december that suchet rode in to the city on his pinknosed mare with nanuk on the crupper to bear witness in court to his own perfections a handsome softeyed lad of ten glad enough of the ride sorry for the separation even for one day from the village toffeemaking but with a great lump of raw sugar stowed away in his turban as partial consolation for the rest he had a childish and yet grave acquiescence pertabi apparently had been a naughty girl and mammi gunga had never been nice yet the jejsahib might say they were married since after all he nanuk could run as fast as ever tchu he would like to show pertabi that it was so footnote judge the courthouse compound was full of suitors and flies the case of suchet versus dhyan singh late in the list so the former bade his son tie the mare in the furthest corner behind the wall in the shade of a spreading tree and keep watch while he went about from group to group in order to discuss his wrongs with various old friendsthat being half the joy of going to law grave groups of reverend bearded faces round a central pipe grave slow voices rising in wise saws from the closeset circles of huge turbans and massive blue and white draperies meanwhile nanuk ate sugar till it began to taste sickly and then he sat looking at the remaining lump and thinking not without a certain malice how pertabi would have enjoyed it then suddenly from behind a small brown hand reached out and snatched it one two thats for you two three thats for me three four sugar galore the rajah begs with a broken leg the singing voice paused the little figure munching as it sang with vindictive eyes upon the boy paused too in its tantalising dance did it hurt much nano im so sorry and mother wouldnt let me keep the squirrel nano but i howled i howled likelike a bhut devil the abstract truth of the description seemed to bring back the past and nanuks face relaxed fathers at court and mothers gone to see the woman who wants me to marry her son explained pertabi between the munchings but i wont i wont marry anybody but you nano i like you nano nanos face relaxed still more you have got sugarpresses nano and the other boy has none he lives in the city and i hate the city is there much sugar this year nano more than last replied the boy proudly we have the best fields in then give me another bit interrupted pertabi that is all i brought there was a trace of anxiety in nanuks voice and he looked deprecatingly at the little figure now cuddled up beside him oh you silly but it doesnt matter we can go and fetch some more thats why i ran away i knew uncle would bring you so we can go to the village early come nano go to the village pertab oh what a tale it is easy to be virtuously indignant at the first proposition of evil but what is to be done when you are at the mercy of a small person who hesitates at nothing wheedlings pinchings kissings tears and promises were all one to pertabi at least a ride on the pinknosed mare for the sake of old times they could slip away easily without being seen yonder lay the road villagewardsthere would be plenty of time to go a mile perhaps twain and get back before chachchaji could possibly finish with his friends she could get off at the corner and then even if chachchaji had discovered their absence nano could say he had taken the mare for water or that the flies were troublesome excuses were so easy ten minutes after his feet barely reaching the big shovel stirrups young lochinvar ambled out of the courthouse compound with his bride behind him we must come back at the turn pertab he said to bolster up his own resolution of course we must come back replied pertabi digging her small heels into the old grey mare cant you make the stupid go faster nano we may as well have all the fun we can so the old mare went faster down the higharched avenue of flickering light and shade and pertabis little red legs flounced about in a way suggestive of falling off but she shrieked with laughter and held tight to her cavalier dont let us go back yet nano she pleaded the old thing is all out of breath and chachchaji will find out youve been galloping her and beat you i shouldnt like you to be beaten nano dear and it is so lovely it was lovely they were in the open now among the level stretches of young green corn and there were the fallen battalions of red and gold canes and from that clump of trees came the familiar creak of the press nay more wafted on the soft breeze the delicious the irresistible smell of sugarboiling other peoples sugarboiling its time we were going back remarked nanuk boldly tchu cried pertabi from behind we are not going back any more see ive tied your shawl to my veil when i do that to my dolls then they are married so that settles it go on nano its all right besides it is no use going back now they would only beat us for getting married go on nanoor ill pinch perhaps it really was fear of the pinching perhaps it was the conviction that they had gone too far to recede which finally induced young lochinvar to give the old mare her head towards home but even then he showed none of the alacrity displayed beneath him and behind him by the female aiders and abettors his face grew graver and graver longer and longer we cant be married until weve taken the seven steps he said at length look they have been burning weeds in the field lets get down and do it or the gods will be angry pertabi clapped her hands it will be fun anyhow so come along nano they tied the old mare to a tree while hand tight clasped in hand just as they had seen it done a hundred times they circumambulated the sacred fire thats better sighed nano now i believe we really are married tchu cried pertabi in superior wisdom i can tell you heaps and heaps of things our dolls do them when weve time we are always marrying our dolls in the city but we can ride a bit further first and when we get tired of pinkynose we can just get down and be married another way thatll rest us so through the lengthening shadows they rode on and got married rode on and got married until pertabis braided head began to nod against nanuks back and she said sleepily well keep the gurror sugarthrowing till tomorrow nano thatll be fun but when in the deep dusk the pinknosed mare drew up of her own accord at the gate of the wide village yard and drowsy nanuk just remembered enough of past events to lift his bride across the threshold and murmur with an awful qualm this is my wife pertabi woke up suddenly to plant her little redtrousered legs firmly on the ground and say with a nod yes and weve been married every way we could think of havent we nano except the sugarthrowing because we

vindictively oh yes you would nano replied his wife with the utmost confidence you would if i asked you besides you really wanted to be married you know you did and then there was the fresh molasses a bit of land he stood in the hot yellow sunshine his air of modest importance forming a halo round his old rickety figure as with one hand he clung to a planetable old and rickety as himself and with the other to one of those largeeyed keenfaced indian boys who seem to have been sent into the world in order to take scholarships the old man on the contrary was of the monkey type of his race small bandylegged and inconceivably wrinkled with a three days growth of grey beard frosting his brown cheeks only the wideset brown eyes had a certain wistful beauty in them in front of those appealing eyes sat a ruddyfaced englishman backed by the white wings of an office tent and deep in the calfbound books and redtaped files on the table before him on either side discreetly drawn apart so as to allow the central group its full picturesque value were tall figures massive in beards and wide turbans in falling folds of dingy white and indigo blue massive also in broad capable features made broader still by capable approving smiles over the old man the boy and the planetable so standing they were a typical group of jat peasantry appealing with confidence to english justice for the observance of indian custom then the headmen are satisfied with this adinterim arrangement asked the palpably foreign voice the semicircle of writers and subordinate officials on the striped carpet beyond the table moved their heads like clockwork figures to the circle of peasants as if giving it permission to speak and a chorus of guttural voices rose in assent then after village fashion one voice prolonged itself in representative explanation it will be but for three years or so and the shelteroftheworld is aware that the fields cannot run away and old tulsi knows how to make the threeleggedone work thus there is no fear the speaker thrust a declamatory hand in the direction of the planetable and the chorus of assent rose once more so the matter was settled the matter being briefly the appointment of a new putwari in other words the official who measures the fields and prepares the yearly harvestmap showing the area under cultivation on which the land revenue has to be paid in other words again the man who stands between india and bankruptcy in this particular case the recently defunct incumbent had left a son who was as yet over young for the hereditary office and the headmen had proposed putting in the boys maternal grandfather as a substitute until the former could pass through the necessary modern training in the accountants college at headquarters the proposition was fair enough seeing that gurditta was sure to pass as he was already head of the queer little village school which the elders viewed with incredulous tolerance and to tell the truth their doubts were not without some reason for on that very day when the englishman was inspecting the first class had bungled over a simple revenue sum which any one could do in his head with the aid of course of the ten godgiven fingers without which the usurer would indeed be king the master had explained the mistake by saying that it was no fault of the rules and only arose because the boys had forgotten which was the bigger of two numbers but that in itself was something over which to chuckle under their breaths and nudge each other on the sly ari hai the lads would be forgetting next which end of the plough to hold the share or the handle but purumeshwar be praised only upon their slates could they forget it since a trueborn jats hand could never lose such knowledge footnote the universal god footnote the monkeygod so underlying the manifest convenience of not allowing a strangers finger in their pie the elders of the village had a secondary consideration in pleading for old tulsi rams appointment a desire namely to show the world at large and the presence in particular that there had been putwaries before he came to cast his mantle of protection over the poor besides old tulsi though he looked like a monkey might be sri hunuman himself in the wisdom necessary for settling the thousand petty disputes without which the village would be so dull then he was a real saint to boot all the more saintly because he was willing to forego his preparation for another world in order to keep a place warm for his grandson in this and after all it was only for three years they and tulsi and the threeleggedone could surely manage the maps for so long if not well it was no great matter since the fields could not possibly run away so they went off contentedly in procession tulsi ram clinging ostentatiously to the planetable which by reason of its straighter longer legs looked for all the world as if it were taking charge of him and not he of it it looked still more in possession as it stood decently draped beside the old man as he worked away at the long columns of figures for the mapping season was over and nothing remained but addition subtraction and division at all of which old tulsi was an adept had he not indeed dipped far into euclidus in his saladdays when he was the favourite disciple of the renowned anchorite at janakpur gurditta by this time was away at college and kishnu his widowed mother as she cooked the milletcakes in the other corner of the courtyard wept salt tears at the thought of the unknown dangers he was running deadly dangers they were for had not his father been quite healthy until the government had insisted on his using the threeleggedone and then had he not gone down and wrestled with it on the low misty levels of newly reclaimed land by the riverside and caught the chills of which he had eventually died thus when the rainy season came on and the planetable still decently draped was set aside for shelter in the darkest corner of the hovel it looked to poor kishnu like some malevolent demon ready to spring out upon the little household and so naturally enough when tulsi went to fetch it out for his first fieldmeasurements he found it garlanded with yellow marigolds and set out with little platters of curds and butter kishnu had been propitiating it with offerings the old man looked at her in mild superior reproof thou art an ignorant woman daughter he said this is no devil but a device of the learned of much use to such as i who make maps thou shouldest have known that the true gods are angered by false worship therefore i counsel thee to remember great mahadeo this day lest evil befall so he passed out into the sunlight bearing the planetable in debonair fashion leaving the abashed kishnu to gather up the marigolds babaji she told herself was brave but he had not to bustle about the house all day with that shrouded thing glowering from the corner however since for gurdits sake it was wise to propitiate everything she took the platters of curds and butter over to mahadeos red stone under the big banyan tree nevertheless she felt triumphant that evening when old tulsi came in from the fields dispirited and professing no appetite for his supper he had in fact discovered that studying textbooks and making practical fieldmeasurements were very different things especially in a treeless formless plain where the only landmarks are the mud boundarycones you are set to verify and which therefore cannot or ought not to be considered fixed points however he managed at last to draw two imaginary lines through the village thanks to purumeshwar and the big green dome of mahadeos banyan tree swelling up into the blue horizon indeed he felt so grateful to the latter for showing clear even over a planetable that he sneaked out when kishnus back was turned with a platter of curds of his own for the great manyarmed trunk but this of course was very different from making oblation to a trivial planetable and that evening he spent all the lingering light in decorating the borders of the map which was yet to come with the finest flourishes just as he told kishnu to show the protectorofthepoor that he had not committed the putwariship to unworthy hands yet two days afterwards he replied captiously to his daughters anxious inquiries as to what was the matter there was naught wrong only one of the three legs had no sense of duty and he must get the carpenter to put a nail to it despite the nail however the anxiety grew on his face and when nobody was looking he took to tramping over the ploughs surreptitiously dragging the primeval chainmeasure after him in which occupation he looked like a monkey who had escaped from its owner the planetable which with the old mans mantle draped over it and his pugree placed on the top had a very dignified appearance in the corner of the field for it was hot work dragging the heavy chain about and old tulsi who was too proud to ask for aid and so disclose the fact that he had had to fall back on ancient methods discarded all the clothing he could and after all he had to give in gurdits father did it field by field said the headmen carelessly when he sought their advice fret not thyself babaji twill come right thou art a better scholar than ever he was field by field echoed tulsi aghast but the book prohibits it seeing that there is not verification since none can know if the boundaries be right a broad chuckle ran round the circle of elders is that all sri tulsi cried the headman that is soon settled a jat knows his own land i warrant and each man of us will verify his fields seeing that never before have we had such a settlingday as thine not an error not an injustice purumeshwar send gurditta to be as good a putwari when he comes nay tis gurdit who is putwari already replied tulsi uneasily and therefore must there be no mistake so i will do field by field peradventure when they are drawn on paper it may seem more like the book where things do not move then i can begin again by rule there was quite a pleasurable excitement over the attested measurement of the fields and old munnia the parcher of corn said it was almost as good as a fair to her trade each man clanked the chain round his own boundary while his neighbours stood in the now sprouting wheat to see fair play and talk over the past history of the claim tulsi ram meanwhile squatting on the ground and drawing away as for dear life even the children went forth to see the show munching popped corn and sidling gingerly past the threeleggedone which to say sooth looked gigantic with half the spare clothes of the community piled on to it indeed the village women peeping from afar declared kishnu to have been quite right and urged a further secret oblation as prudent if not absolutely necessary so she took to hanging the marigolds again taking care to remove them ere the old man rose in the morning and the result was eminently satisfactory for as he put one fieldplan after another away in the portfolio tulsi rams face cleared they were so beautifully green far greener than those in the book so surely there could be no mistake but alas when he came to try and fit them together as they should be on the map they resolutely refused to do anything of the kind it was a judgment he felt for having disobeyed the textbook and so the next morning he rose at the peep of day determined to have it out legitimately with the threeleggedone and lo it was garlanded with marigolds and set out once more with platters of curds and butter thou hast undone me ignorant woman he said with a mixture of anger and relief now is it clear the true gods in despite of thy false worship have sent a devil into this thing to destroy me so despite kishnus terror and tears he threw the offerings into the fire and dragged the planetable out into the fields with ignominy but even this protestation failed and poor old tulsi one vast wrinkle of perplexity was obliged once more to refer to the circle of headmen gurdits father managed and thou hast twice his mettle they replied vaguely interested sure the devil must indeed be in it seeing that the land cannot run away of itself it hath not run away said tulsi dejectedly there is not too little but too much of it too much land the idea was at first bewildering to these jat peasants and then sent them into open laughter here was a mistake indeed and yet the lust of land so typical of their race showed in their eyes as they crowded round the map which tulsi ram spread on the ground it was a model of neatness the fields were greener than the greenest wheat but right in the middle of them was a white patch of nomansland trra rolled the broadest of the party after an instants stupefaction that settles it tis a mistake for look you tis next my fields and if twere there my plough would have been in it long ago a sigh of conviction and relief passed through the circle for the mere suggestion had been disturbing nevertheless since gurdits fathers map had never indulged in white spots tulsis must be purged from them also look you said one of the youngest tis as when the children make a puzzle of torn leaves he has fitted them askew so let each cut his own field out of the paper and set it aright then ensued an hour of sheer puzzledom since if the white spot were driven from one place it reappeared differently shaped in another the devil was in it they said at last somewhat alarmed since he who brought land might be reasonably suspected of the power of taking it away they would offer a scapegoat and meanwhile old tulsi need not talk of calling in the aid of the new putwari in the next village for he was one of the newfangled sort an empty drum making a big noise and as likely as not would make them pay double if there really was extra land because it had not come into the schedule before no they would ask the schoolmaster first since he had experience in finding excuse for mistakes nor was their trust unfounded for the master not only had an excuse in something he called a reasonable margin of error but also a remedy which he declared the late putwari had always adopted briefly a snip here a bulge there and a general fudging with the old settlementmaps the elders clapped old tulsi on the back with fresh laughter bidding him not try to be cleverer than others and so sent him back to his drawingboard but long after the dusk had fallen that evening the old man sat staring stupidly at the great sheet of blank paper on which he had not drawn a line it was no business of his what gurdits father had done seeing that he too was of the old school inwardly if not outwardly but gurdit himself when he returned would allow of no such dishonesties and he tulsi was in the boys place there was time yet a month at least before inspection in which to have it out with the planetable so when the wild geese from the mudbanks came with the first streak of dawn to feed on the wheat they found old tulsi and his attendant demon there already at work on the dewy fields and when sunset warned the grey crane that it was time to wing their flight riverwards they left tulsi and the threeleggedone still struggling with the margin of error then he would sit up of nights plotting and planning till a dim dazed look came into his bright old eyes and he had to borrow a pair of horn spectacles from the widow of a dead friend he was getting old he told kishnu who was in despair as men must get old no matter how many marigolds ignorant women wasted on false gods for she had taken boldly and unchecked to the oblations again but in the end inspectionday found that white bit of land white as ever nay whiter against the dark finger which pointed at it accusingly since as illluck would have it what only the natives themselves may call a black judge was the inspecting officer a most admirable young bachelor of arts from the calcutta university full to the brim of solid virtue and utterly devoid of any sneaking sentimental sympathy with the quips and cranks of poor humanity those lichens of life which make its rough rocks and waterworn boulders so beautiful to the seeing eye this must not occur he said speaking after the manner of the alien in english to his clerk in order to enhance his dignity it is gross negligence of common orders write as warning that if better map be not forthcoming locum tenens loses appointment with adverse influence on hereditary claims adverse influence on hereditary claims the words translated brutally as only clerks can translate sent poor old tulsi into an agony of remorse and resolve a month afterwards kishnu spoke to the headmen the threeleggedone hath driven the putwari crazy she said remove it from him or he will die justice justice so it was removed and hidden away with obloquy in an outhouse whereupon he sat and cried that he had ruined gurditgurdit the light of his eyes heed not the bengali they said at last in sheer despair he is a fool thou shalt come with us to the big sahib he will understand seeing that he is more our race than the other that is how it came to pass that tulsi ram sat on the stucco steps of an englishmans house pointing with a trembling but truthful finger at a white spot among the green while a circle of bearded jats informed the presence that sri hunuman himself was not wiser nor better than their putwari and how do you account for it i mean what do you think it is asked the foreign voice curiously the wrinkles on tulsis forehead grew deeper his bright yet dim eyes looked wistfully at the master of his fate tis an overlarge margin of error huzoor owing to lack of control over the planetable that is what the book says that is what gurdit will say but what do you say how do you think that bit of land came into your village tulsi hesitated gained confidence somehow from the blue eyes unless purumeshwar sent a bit of another world he suggested meekly the englishman stood for a moment looking down on the wizened monkeylike face the truthful finger the accusing white spot i think he has he said at last go home tulsi and colour it blue ill pass it as a bit of paradise so that year there was a blue patch like a tank where no tank should be upon the village map and the old putwaris conscience found peace in the correct total of the columns of figures which he added together while the threeleggedone released from durance vile at his special request stood in the corner garlanded with the marigolds of thanksgiving perhaps that was the reason why next mapping season the patch of paradise had shrunk to half its original size or perhaps it was that he really had more control over the planetable at any rate he treated it more as a friend by spreading its legs very wide apart covering it with his white cotton shawl and so using it as a tent when the sun was over hot and yet when on gurdits return from college with a firstclass surveyors certificate paradise became absorbed in a legitimate margin of error there was a certain wistful regret in old tulsis pride and he said that being an ignorant old man it was time he returned to find paradise in another way but thou shalt not leave us for the wilderness as before swore the jats in council lo gurdit is young and hasty and thou wilt be needed to settle the disputes so we will give thee a saintly sitting of thy very own in our village but tulsi objected the fields were the fields he said and the houses were the houses it only led to difficulties to put odd bits of land into a map and he would be quite satisfied to sit anywhere in the end however he had to give in for when he died after many years spent in settling disputes some one suggested that he really had been sri hunuman himself at any rate he was a saint so the white spot marking a shrine reappeared in the map to show whence the old man had passed to the better land the sorrowful hour it was one of those blue days which come to the plains of upper india when the rains of early september have ceased leaving the heatweary dustsoiled world regenerate by baptism a light breeze sent westering ripples along the pools of water filling each shallow depression and stirred the fine fretwork of an acacia set thick with little odorous puffs sweet as a violet despite the ruddy glow of the sinking sun the shadows far and near still kept their marvellous bluea clear porcelain blue showing the purity of the rainwashed air a painter need have used but three colours in reproducing the scenered and blue and yellow in the sky russet and blue and gold in the tall battalions of maize and millet halfconquered by the sickle which stood in shadowed squares or lay in sunlit reaches right away to the level horizon russet and blue and gold also in the dress of a woman who was crouching against the palisade of plaited tigergrass which formed two sides of the wellhomestead seen upon this dull gold diaper her madderred veil and blue petticoat with their corncoloured embroideries seemed to blend and be lost in the harvest scene beyond even the pools of water finding counterpart in the bits of lookingglass gleaming here and there among her ample drapery she was a woman who in other countries would have been accounted in the prime of life in india past it yet as she crouchedher whole body tense in the effort of listeningevery line of her strong face and form showed that she was not past the prime of passion ari hearts delight see o father yon is his fifth step and still he totters not what wouldst crawl again oh fie upon such laziness the high girlish voice from within the palisade paused in a gurgle of girlish laughter say o father looks he not thus poised hands and feet for all the world like the monkey people in gopals shop when they would be at the sweets ai my brother what hast found in the dust cry not hearts life mother will give it back to chujju again so that is good holy ganeshji naught but a grain of corn art so hungry as all that my little pecking pigeon my little bird from heaven little glutton thou meanest chuckled a base voice still of a truth o maya the boy grows grows i tell thee he hath grown see you not this twoyearold hath turned farmer already he comes to bargain with thee having his corn in his hand give him a good price to handsel his luck o gurditta lumberdar footnote headman of village i will pay thee for him o wife sure hast thou not given me the boy and shall i not pay my debt nay i am not foolish as thou sayest what wouldst have me kiss thee also little rogue so yet do i love mother bestbest of all the woman behind the palisade stood up suddenly tall as she was the feathery tops of the tigergrass rose taller so she could stand even as she had crouched unseen unseeing also other women might have lent eyes to aid their ears but saraswati was no spyno eavesdropper by intent either the lacquered spinningwheel the wheatstraw basket piled with downy cotton cards which lay on the ground beside her testified to what her occupation had been till somethingheaven knows what for she heard such lighthearted babble every dayin those careless voices roused her pentup jealousy beyond the dead level of patience she was not jealous of the child ah no not of the child was it not for the sake of such a one that three years before she had given maya his mother a dignified welcome to the childless home but maya ah well was she called mayathe woman prolific of deceit and illusion of whom the pundits spoke woman not content with being the childbringer but seeking saraswatis large capable hands closed in upon themselves tightly she did not need to peer through the plaited chinks to know the scene within she saw it burnt in upon her slow constant brain the tall bearded man of her own ageher own typeher kinsmanthe patient kindly husband of her youth the childhis naked brown limbs dimpled still more by silver circlets on wrists and ankles those curving dimpling limbs which somehow made her heart glad and between them degrading them both maya with her petty pretty face her petty pretty ways suddenly as it had come the passion passedpassed into that curious resignation that impassive acquiescence which does more to separate east from west than all the seas which lie between england and india old dhunnu said sooth she muttered stooping to gather up her wheel and bobbins methodically tis the child which makes him love her and i have been a fool to doubt it i will delay no longer behind the low mud houses angled so as to form two sides of the square four or five jujube trees clustered thickly and beneath them the dark green whips of the jasmine bushes curved to the ground like a fountain set with blossoms hence and from the straggling rose hard by the women in the early dawn gathered flowers for the chaplets used in the worship of the gods there were so many occasions requiring such offerings sorrowful hours and joyful hours whether they were of birth or marriage or death who could say till the end came whether they were one or the other only this was certain flowers were needed for them all towards this thicket saraswati still with the same impassive face made her way pausing an instant before the long low mud manger where her favourite milch cow stood tethered to stroke its soft muzzle and give it a few tall stalks of millet from a sheaf resting against the wellwheel and once more the scene was red and blue and gold as the broad yellow leaves and bloodstreaked stems blent with her dress there was not a change in her face as parting the branches she disappeared into the thicket scattering the loose blossoms as she went not a change when after a minute or two she reappeared carrying a little basket with a domed cover securely fastened by many strands of raw cotton thread such as she had been spinninga basket of wheaten straw festooned with cowries and tufted with particoloured tassels such as the jatni women make for the safe keeping of feminine triflesan innocentlooking basket suggestive of beads and trinkets she paused a moment holding it to her ear and then for the first time a faint smile flickered about her mouth as she caught a curious rasping noise halfpurr halfrustle death hath a long life she murmured as she hid the basket in the voluminous folds of her veil and walked over to the homestead as she entered by a wide gap in the plaited palisade the scene within was even as she had imagined it but the barb had struck home before and the actual sight did not enhance her resentment it grows late o maya she said coldly leave playing with the child and see to the fire for the cooking of our lords food thou hast scarce left an ember aglow beneath the lentils while i was yonder spinning the reproof was no more than what might come with dignity from an elder wife but gurditta lounging his long length in wellearned rest on a string bed rose murmuring something of seeing to the plough oxen ere supper time the big man was dimly dissatisfied with affairs he felt a vague desire to behave better towards the woman who had been his faithful companion for so many years but for her he knew well things would go but ill in the little homestead by the well yet maya was so pretty what man still undulled by age would not do as he did for all that the little capricious thing might be more friendly with saraswati there was no need for her to snatch chujju in her arms whenever the latter looked at the child but then womenand maya was a thorough womanwere always so fearful of the evil eye fancy her calling that straightlimbed utterly desirable son chujju as if any one would cast such a gift away in the sweepers pan as if the gods themselves far off as they were could be deceived by such a palpable fraud or even by that ridiculous smudge of charcoal on the boys face which only enhanced instead of detracting from its beauty gurditta laughed a deep broad laugh as he strewed the long manger with corn cobs and green stuff cut from the fodder field by the well footnote from chujj a sweepers basket one of the many opprobrious names given to avert the envious and therefore evil eye meanwhile within the house yard maya was sullenly blowing away at the embers held in the semicircular mud fireplaces ranged along one of the walls a grass thatch supported by two forked sticks protected this the kitchen of the house from possible rain and certain sun while on the other wall a similar screen did like duty to a triple row of niches or pigeonholes wherein the household stores in immediate use were kept out of harms way for the rest was a cleanswept expanse of beaten earth set round after the fashion in a farmers house with implements and hivelike stores of grain between the one thatch and the other saraswati moved restlessly bringing pickles and spices as they were wanted and still the basket lay tucked away in the folds of her veil the raw sugar is nigh done she said stooping with her back towards maya to reach the lowest row of niches we must use the candy tonight till i can open the big store luckily i bought some when we took the diwali sweets from gopal then ere she replaced the cloth in which the sweetmeats were tied she held out a sugar horse to the child who was playing by his mother here chujju wilt have one footnote for the most part sugar animals such as are sold at english fairs maya was on her feet at once indignant vehement thou shouldst not offer him such things he shall not take them from thee i will not have it nay nay my birdmy hearts delight mother will give thee sweets enough kick not so life of my life ganesh how he cries he will burst and tis thy fault hush hush see here is mothers milk ai wicked one would bite ye gods but tis a veritable toork for temper hushing the child in her arms she walked up and down followed by saraswatis calm big black eyes thou art a fool maya she said slowly putting down the sugar horse gopals sweets would not have hurt the child so much as thy spitefulness then she turned to her work again among the niches when she rose the basket was in her hand the threads were broken and the cover tilted as if something slender and supple had been allowed to slip out perhaps it had for behind the sugar horse standing in the lowermost niche two specks of fire gleamed from the shadow it was growing dark now but the harvest moon riding high in the heavens and the now flaming fire aided the dying daylight and a curious radiance backed by velvety shadows lay on everything i must sweep out the niches thoroughly tomorrow she said indifferently methought just now i heard the rustle as of a jelabi they love to hide in such places and therefore i bid thee but yesterday see to their cleansing but sure what work is done in this house mine must be the hand to do it see to your lentils sister methinks they burn at the bottom footnote echis carinata the indian viper it lies coiled in a truelovers knot rustling its scales one against the other it is the most vicious and irritable of all indian snakes maya with a petulant shrug of her shoulders set down the child such work spoils my hands andandfolk like them pretty even she town born and town bred did not dare before this graveeyed peasant woman to name her husbands name in such a connection but saraswati understood the allusion and the simple straightforward naturalism drawn from ages of rural life which was her heritage rose up in arms against such depravity but even as she lashed herself to revenge by the thought everything that was stable seemed to shift all that moved to stand still her heart ceased beating the walls span round the moon quivered the flames grew rigid ah no one thing that moved would not pause chujju had caught sight of the sugar horse and was creeping towards it now on his little fat hands now tottering on his little fat feet his glistening eyes fixed on the niche which held those gleaming specks of fire footnote a husbands name should never be mentioned by a wife especially in matters referring to herself no nothing was too bad for maya and dhunnu the wise woman had been right when she said that the charm lay in the child it must be soand death was naught there he was close now one little hand stretched out the dimples showingthe ah a cry fierce almost imperative and saraswati had him in her arms while something slim and grey fell from the niche in its spring and wriggled behind a pile of brushwood i saw its eyes she gasped still straining the child to her ample bosom when gurditta brought thither by mayas screams of snake snake stood beside her his breath coming fast his manliness stirred to its depths maya saw the danger swiftly give him to me she clamoured o husband make her give him to me she would kill him if she could she put it therei saw her put it therei swear it saraswati turned on her in calm contempt thou liest o maya since time began spirit of deceit and mother of illusion thou didst not see me put it there then with the same dignity she turned to the man master take the child he is safe this much is true i saved him that night when the moon still shone in the cloudless sky saraswati her veil wrapped closely round her stole softly from the homestead past the resting oxen out among the serried battalions of maize and millet where the tall sheaves lying prone on the ground looked like the bodies of those who had fallen in the days fight down on the suncracked borders of the tank whence the water was sinking swiftly now the rain had ceased by the ghostly peepul trees shorn of their branches which the camels love and looking weird and human with great arms stretched skywards so on to the burning ghat beyond with its little cones of mud marking the spot of each funeral pyre and the twinkling lights set here and there by pious survivors saraswati drew her veil tighter and sped faster as she passed through the more recent ashes as yet uncovered but swept into little heaps and therehorrible sightstill scattered with the uncalcined bones gleaming in the moonlight and a faint line of smoke still circling upwards lay the most recent of all that must be old anant ram the khuttri merchant who had died that morning an evil man come to his end she was trembling ere she reached the hut where dhun devi the wise woman kept watch and ward over the ashes it was a miserable shanty where she found the old woman asleep before a large iron pot supported on a trivet beneath it some cowdung cakes smouldered slowly yet not so slowly but that every now and again a bloodred bubble showed on the contents of the pot a flaring oillamp filched doubtless from those outside stood in a smokeblackened niche and by its light you could see festoons of dank bloodred drapery clinging to a rope while with a drip drip drip something fell upon the floorsomething which ran in rills right out to the moonlight and sinking into the sand stained it bloodred a ghastly setting to the wise womans crouching figure even though saraswati knew that mai dhunnu was engaged in no more nefarious occupation than dyeing the webs of her ignorant neighbours with madder the old crone stood up hastily then sank to her low stool again when she had peered into her visitors face thou wilt not tell she whispered in a hoarse croak which coming in reality from a throat affection vastly enhanced her claims to wisdom in the eyes of the villagers thou art of the old style not like these apes of today with their dogeared books and their dyes which fade before a january sun the chuckle she gave suited her surroundings well so did the clawlike hand she laid suddenly on saraswatis firm arm well daughter hast plucked up courage hast learnt to trust the wisdom of old dhun devi saraswati shook her head thou must find other wisdom for me mother she said briefly such is not for me obstinate i tell thee tis the glamour of the child tis not the child though the gods know the poison hath bit deeper somehow since he came lo i have tried it and tis not my way nor would i kill her that were too trivial seeing she is not worth life i want but my share it is empty here emptier than ever somehow since the boy was born she clasped her strong hands above her heart the glow of the fire spreading as the old woman fanned it with the tremulous breath of age lit up the big black brows knit above the puzzled black eyes dhun devi straightened her bent back and looked at her companion critically life is more than the shadow of a passing bird to such as thou o saraswati tis not wise for death is naught and life is naught the soul of man circles ever like the potters wheel upon its pivot have i not seen it have i not known it did i not go through the night of a thousand dangers myself and bring five stalwart sons into the day where are they have they not passed into the dark again have not my hands piloted many through the sorrowful hour and sent many from it lo the snake would not have harmed the child i care not if thou speakest truth or not o mother though thou art learned above women in such thoughts i know muttered saraswati sullenly with drooping head only this i know that way is not mine there must be others see i have brought thee my golden armlet dhun was ever as a signpost to dhun devi ist not so footnote worldlywealth the old dames fingers closed greedily on the bribe careless of the open sneer which accompanied it ways she echoed of a surety there are ways but none so simple as death ay said saraswati quietly i have thought of that the well is deep and the little feathery ferns in the crannies look kind but they would say saraswati the jatni had been ousted from her own wellland by a stranger and that is not so i heed not the girl deceit is her portion tis something here again she laid her hand on her heart with a puzzled look nor do i want him only couldst thou not turn the childs mind to me so that seeing his love gurditta would hold me dearer also dhun devi shook her head but her keen bright old eyes were on the others face there is a way she whispered after a pause but death lurks in it often with such as thou whose death thine own do not all women know how the sorrowful hour saraswati caught the withered wrist in a fierce clasp mai she panted mai dhunnu dost speak of the sorrowful hour to meto meafter all these years is there hopehope even yet if thou art not afraid afraid it was sunrise in the homestead and a new harvest was waiting in battalions for the sickle the jasmine fountain showered its green stems to the ground but it was bare of blossoms they hung in chaplets from the thatch screen beneath which on that stifling august night a woman had been passing through her sorrowful hour in the dim dawn the little oillamps set about the bed flickered uncertainly in the breeze which heralds the day and glinted now and again on the lucky knife suspended by the twist of lucky threads above the pillow in a brazier hard by some pungent spices scattered upon charcoal sent up a clear blue line like the last faint smoke from a funeral pyre all that wisdom could do dhun devi had done but a dead girlbaby lay between saraswati and the harvest visible through the gap in the plaited palisade the midwife shook her head as she peered into the unconscious face on the pillow only a girl after all the fuss came mayas high clear voice as she sat cuddling chujju in her soft round armschujju whom the gods had spared to die for a girlfor a dead girl toowhat foolishness but twas her own fault tis bad enough for us young ones and dear payment after all for the fun and she had escaped all these years dhun devis clawlike fingers stopped the liquid flow of words go infamous she whispered fiercely such as thou are not mothers thou art maya the desire of the flesh go lest i curse the child for thy sake with a little shriek of dismay halfreal halfpretended the girl gathered the sleeping child in her arms and disappeared into the huts the wheel slackens on its pivot muttered the old woman stooping again over the still form on the bed i must get her to mother earth as a seed to the soil ere it stops she stood at the gap and called the fine fretwork of the acacia branches showed against the growing blue of the sky the little golden puffs sent their violet perfume into the air a bird sat among them chirruping to its mate come she said and the tall bearded man followed her meekly togetherhe at the head she at the feetthey laid saraswati on the ground with the dead child halfhidden in her veil still between her and the great stretch of harvest beyond suddenly roused by the movement she stirred slightly and the big black eyes opened dhun devi gripped the mans hand as if to detain him the childis it well with the child came in a faint voice dhun devis clasp gripped firmer a look recalling long past years came to her face yea mother it is well thy son sleeps in thine arms then craning up from her crooked old age to reach his ear she whispered swiftly say tis so if thou art a man and bid her godspeed on her journey so with her husbands hand in hers a child in her arms and a smile on her face came the end of saraswatis sorrowful hour a danger signal they were an odd couple the very trains as they sped past level crossing number gave a low whistle as if the oddities struck them afresh each time and craddock always went to the side of the cab whence he could see those two motionless figures on either side of the regulation barrier which stood so causelessly in the middle of the sandy waste there must have been a road somewhere of course else there would have been no level crossing but it was not visible to the passing eye perhaps the drifting sand had covered it up perhaps no traffic ever did come that way and there really was no need for old dhunnu and his granddaughter to stand like illmatched heraldic supporters displaying a safety signal but they did they had done so ever since dhunnifor the name had descended to her in the feminine genderwas steady enough on her feet to stand alone and before that even she had given line clear from her grandfathers arms for it was always line clear no train ever stopped at level crossing number of the desert section why should they there was nothing to be seen far or near save sand and the little square concreteroofed redhot furnace of a place suggestive of a crematorium which happened on that particular railway to be the approved pattern for a gatekeepers shelter it was very hot in summer very cold in winter and that was perhaps the reason why old dhunnu suffered so much from malarial fever in the autumn months those months which might otherwise have been so pleasant in the returning cool of their nights and their promise of another harvest the old man used to resent this fever in a dull sort of way because it was so unnecessary in that rainless tract to quiver and shake in a quartian ague when the battalions of maize are pluming themselves on their own growth and the milletseeds tired of cuddling close to each other are beginning to start on lengthening stemlets to see the world was legitimate but it was quite another thing to find a difficulty in keeping a signal steady when there was not a drop of moisture for miles and miles save in the little round well which had been dug for the gatekeepers use dhunnu however had served the sirkar for long years in the malarial tracts under the hills before he came as a pensioner to level crossing and when once the marshmonarch lays firm hold of a man he claims him as a subject for all time it was this difficulty no doubt in keeping a signal steady which joined to the intense pleasure it gave to the child had first led to little dhunni holding the green flag while dhunnu on the other side of the gate kept the furled red one in his shaking hand ready for emergencies then the train would sweep past like a great caterpillar with red and green eyes and red and green lights in its tail and craddock would look out of the cab and say to himself that time must be passing since the child was shooting up into a girl and still it was always the green flag always line clear it became monotonous even to dhunni who had been brought up to it and while her chubby hand clutched the baton firmly she would look resentfully across at the furled red flag in her grandfathers shaking hand lo nanna she said spitefully some day it will shake so that the cloth will shake itself out and then he interrupted her with dignity but in the tone in which a titmouse might reproach a tigercat for dhunni as he knew to his cost had a temper by gods blessing oh dhun devi that will never be since east and west is there no cause sufficient to check progress and as that is by order the green flag so the green flag it will be dhunni made no reply in words she simply flung the safety signal in the dust and danced on it with a certain pompous vigour which made the whitybrown rag of a petticoat she wore as sole garment cease even its pretensions to be called a covering for they were very poor these two that was evident from the lack of colour in their clothing which made them mere dusty brown shadows on the background of brownish dust it shall be the red one some day nanna yea some day it shall be the red flag and then the train will stop and thenand then she gave one vindictive stamp to clinch the matter and walked off with her head in the air the old man watched her retreating figure with shocked admiration then picked up the dishonoured flag dusted it and rolled it up laboriously lo he muttered as a halfgratified smile claimed his haggard face she is of the very worst sort of woman that the lord makes a virtuous man need be prepared for such as she so tis well she is betrothed to a decent house meanwhile in the wilderness she can come to no harm so far as the displaying of danger signals went dhunni herself was forced to admit the truth of this proposition for even when the old man lay quivering and quaking he kept the key of the box in which the red flag was locked safely stowed away in his waistcloth once she tried to steal it and when discovered in the act took advantage of his prostration to argue the matter out at lengthher position being that the train itself must be as tired of going on as she was of watching it whereupon he explained to her with feverish vividness the terrible consequences which followed on the unrighteous stopping of trains to all of which she acquiesced with the greatest zest even suggesting additional horrors until it became a sort of game of brag between them as whose imagination would go the furthest finally as she brought him a cup of water from the well she consoled both herself and him with the reflection that some day he must die of the fever and then of course it would not matter to him if the train stopped or not while she could satisfy herself as to whether those funny white people who looked out of the windows were real or only stuffed dolls arin budzart he whimpered as he lay prostrate and perspiring have i not told thee dozens of times they are sahib logues have i not seen them have i trra replied dhunni derisively that may be i have not but i mean to some day then the old man adding tears of weakness to the general dissolution begged her if a train must be stopped to stop a goods or even a mixed she argued this point also at length till the fever fiend leaving him dhunnu resumed his authority and threatened to whack her whereupon she ran away like a wild thing into the desert it was a certain method of escape from the slow retribution of the old man but as often as not she would return ere his anger had evaporated sooner than miss any one of the four caterpillars with the red and green eyes and the green and red lights in their tails they had a fascination for her which she could not resist so she would take her whacking and then stand bruised and sore but brimful of curiosity to give line clear as it were to a whole world of which she knew nothing even that was better than having nothing to do with it at all and then as her grandfather grew older and feebler and required a longer time to fetch the weeks supply from the distant hamlet far over the edge of the sandy horizon there came at last a day when she stood all alone in the very centre of the closed gate holding out the green flag and salaaming obsequiously for that was what grandfather had done on one or two occasions when owing to inconceivable wickedness she had been made to watch the passing of civilisation while tied to a distant bed leg craddock from his cab noticed the grave mimicry and smiled whereupon dhunni smiled back brilliantly and then something happened which curiously enough changed her whole estimate of civilisation and left her with such an expression on her face that when her grandfather returned half an hour afterwards his first thought was for the red flag the key was safe in his waistcloth yet still he began hurriedly thou didst not nay she burst out in fury i did naught but theynanna i hate them i hate them then it turned out that the white dolls had flung a stone at hera hard stoneyes the pink and white childdolls had flung a stone at her just because she had smiled so with hands trembling with rage she produced in evidence a large chunk of chocolate dhunnu looked at it in superior wisdom for there had been white children sometimes in that surveying camp below the hills tis no stone he said tis a foreign sweetmeat they meant well being ignorant that we eat not such things when they first come across the black water they will even fling bread as he spoke he threw the offending morsel into the desert and spat piously dhunni looked after it with doubt and regret in her eyes i deemed it a stone she said at last think you it would have been sweet like our sweetmeats ari budzart cried the old man again lakshmi be praised thou didst take bread for a stone else wouldst thou have eaten it and have been a lost soul i would have tried if i liked it anyhow said dhunni shamelessly and that night while her grandfather slept in the redhot furnace to avoid the dullness of dawn the moon found something else on the wide waste of sand beside the crematorium and the regulation barrier to yield her the tribute of a shadow it was dhunni on all fours seeking high and low for the chunk of chocolate and when she found it she sat up with it in her little brown paws and nibbled away at it for all the world like a squirrel the result of which experiment being that she smiled brilliantly at every train from that time forth perhaps in hopes of more chocolate perhaps from gratitude for past chocolate perhaps because she really was beginning to be more sensible it is being born to her in lavish manner said old dhunnu boastfully to an emissary of the future motherinlaw who came as far as the village to inquire of the future brides growth and health go tell them she gives line clear as well as i do but that she is not yet of an age for the married state in his heart of hearts however he knew very well that the time could not be far distant when he could no longer delay parting with the girl who was fast shooting up into a tall slip of a thing and then what should he do for the fever fiend had a fast grip on him nowa firmer hold than he had upon life sometimes for days and days he could scarcely creep to the gate when the mail train passed while as for the goods and mixed these lowcaste trains he left entirely to dhunnis mercy and safely since the desire for the danger signal seemed to have passed with the possession of responsibilityand chocolate thus dhunni far from the eyes of the world which would have sent her remorselessly into the slavery of motherinlaw grew tall and slender and even in her old dustcoloured skirt and bodice caused craddock the enginedriver as he sped by an occasional pang of regret as he remembered another tall girl with velvety eyes so time passed until as luck would have it a weddingparty from the village where the future motherinlaw resided chose to try a short cut over the desert and actually crossed the line at level crossing number the result being that dhunnis readiness for the married state became known and a fortnight or so afterwards she sat looking at the new suit of clothes and some jewels which had been sent to her with an intimation that the bridal procession would come for her in a weeks time the presents were poor enough in themselves but then dhunni had never seen anything so bright before except of course the red flag and though the little round mirror set in the bridal thumbring does not allow of much being seen at a time dhunni saw enough to make her eyes still more velvety her smile still more bewitching favour is deceitful and beauty is vain grumbled her grandfather in equivalent hindu but it had no effect on the girl all that day she went about with an odd halfdazed look on her face and when the women who had brought the presents left in the afternoon she went and sat down by the gate feeling vaguely that it was some one else and not the old dhunnu who was sitting there the mail train had passed an hour before and the goods was not due till midnight so there was no chance of anything to interrupt the level monotony she knew so well and yet as she sat leaning against the gatepost with the green flag beside her she was waiting for something for what she did not know but the certainty that life held something new was thrilling to her very finger tips it was a yellow sunset full of light and peace then out of it came suddenly a faint roll as of distant thunder she was on her feet in an instant listening waiting ah this was new certainly this she had never seen before an engine with a single carriage coming full speed out of the golden west was she to give line clear to this or the sound of a girls laugh rang out into the light and a scarlet veil deftly twisted round a baton hung clear into the line what in the worlds the matter asked an english boy as craddock and the westinghouse brake combined brought the final quiver to the great shining flywheel he was a tall boy fairhaired blueeyed imperious the girl had given a little gasp at the look on his face as he had leapt from the still moving train to come towards her though she now stood looking at him boldly the improvised signal still in her hand what is it craddock ask her you understand their lingo i dont craddock leaning over the side of the cab surveyed the picture with a magisterial air sorry i brought er up sir tho seein a red rag its kind o second natur when your ands within reach o a brake sir and then she never done it beforenot all these years but what is it i dont understand saving your presence sir replied craddock cheerfully there aint no reason you shouldnt for it dont take any knowledge o the lingo sir no more o any kind o knowledge but what youre up to sir being as the sayin is born o adamo adam an eve its mischief sir thats what it ismischief and there aint much difference in the colour o that so far as i see sir the boys face showed nothing but angry almost incredulous surprise for an instant then something else crept into it softening it by george craddock he said argumentatively id no notion they could lookerlike that she is really quite a pretty girl he could not help a smile somehow whereat to his surprise she smiled back at him the deliberately bewitching smile born of that chunk of chocolate it recalled him to a sense of injured importance this is most annoying and when so much depends on my catching up the mail he continued she will be stopping the next train too i suppose but it cant be allowed and she ought to be punished ill take her along and leave her at the first station for inquiry they can easily send another signaller by the down train tell her craddock better pukro er ath sir remarked the latter sagely as he prepared to descend else she might oof it into the wilderness like one of them ravine deer just you pukro er ath sir while i samjhao her footnote take her hand footnote explain dhunni however did not attempt to run she only shrank a little when the boys white hand closed on hers after that she stood listening to craddocks violent recriminations quite calmly in truth she expected them for in those old games of brag with nanna they had gone further than words up to hanging in fact yet still not so far as this queer tremor of halffearful halfjoyful expectation that was new but pleasant and filled her eyes with such light that craddock stroked his corncoloured beard and shook his head mournfully shes a deal arder than i took er for seein her always as it were sir from a different speer a deal worse if id a pair o bracelets ready they might give er a turn but ive told er shell go to ell in every lingo i know for fear she mightnt understand and im blest if she care a hang the boy gave a resentful laugh ill make her care before ive done with her there you therewhats your namestick her with you into the cook room no shove her into my carriage and ill do chowkidar till i can hand her over now craddock on with the steam or i shall miss my connection confound the girl footnote watchman it was easy to confound her in the abstract easy also to glower at the offender crouched in the off corner before you threw yourself into the armchair in the other and began to read the last number of a magazine by the waning light but what was to be done when it was gradually being borne in on you that a pair of velvety eyes wild as a young deers were watching you fearlessly she was a good plucked one at any rate craddock had said she was as hard as nails and a bad lot well he ought to know but she did not look bad not at all the eyes were good eyes full of straightforward curiosity nothing more there she was bending down to try the texture of the carpet with her finger as if nothing had occurredthe little monkeyand what white teeth she had when she met his involuntary smile with another after that under cover of his book he watched her furtively it was what is called an inspection carriage a regular room on wheels and the boy new to the honour and glory of such a thing had hung pictures on its walls curtains to its windows there was even a vase of flowers beside the newly lit lamp on the centre table the lamp had a pink shade too which threw a rosy light on everything above all on that slender figure crouching in the far corner and outside the golden sunset was fast fading into cold greys you want to know what that is he said suddenly in english laying down his book and pointing in the direction where her eyes had been fixed an expectant look came to them and he stood for a moment irresolute then he rose with an impatient shrug of his shoulders crossed to the small harmonium which lay open set his foot to the pedal and struck a single note she drew back from the sound just he thought as she had drawn back from his hand and then looked at him as she had looked at him then by jove she had eyes still looking at her he sat down to the instrument and played a chord or two out of sheer curiosity her finger went up to her lip she leaned forward a picture of glad surprise and then a sudden fancy seized him he had a tenor voice and there was a song upon the desk singing in a train even in a single carriage on a smooth line was a poor performance but it would be fun to try the devout lover of all songs in the world the humour the bitter irony of it struck him keenly and decided him and as he sang he felt with a certain anger that he had never sung it bettermight never sing it so well again when he turned to her again it struck him that she recognised this also for she was leaning forward half on her knees her hands stretched out over the seat no one could have listened more eagerly in sudden petulance he rose and went to the window there was only a bar of gold now on the horizon and thank heaven they had come faster than he thoughtor he wasted more time in tomfooleryfor they were already entering the broken ground that must be the first ravine dark as a ditch so ere long he would be able to get rid of those curious eyes powers above was fate against him was he never to arrive at his destination and what did craddock mean by putting the brake hard on again when they were miles away even from a level crossing he was out on the footboard as they slackened shouting angry inquiries long before craddocks voice could possibly come back to him through the lessening rattle danger signal comin down the line on a trolly i think sir somethins wrong apparently there was and yet the english voice which sang out of the darkness had a joyful ring of triumph in it and the friendly hand which followed the voice after a minute or two shook the boys hand amid warm congratulations on the narrowest escape for no one had thought it could possibly be done or that warning could possibly be given in time it was the veriest piece of luck briefly just after the mail had passed a big culvert had given not two miles further down the line they had telegraphed the information both ways of course though as no train was due for hours there was plenty of time for repairs then had come the return wire telling of the boys start to overtake the mail on urgent business every one had said it was too late and after all it had been a matter of five minutes or less the veriest luck indeed if they had been five minutes earlier the boy looked solemnly at craddock and the light of the red lamp dim as it was showed a certain emotion in both faces thats about it sir said craddock a trifle huskily an i tellin her shed go to ell lordy aint it like a woman to have the last word he said no more then but when it had been decided to return the way they had come and take a branch line farther down and when the trolly with its red signal had slipped back silently into the night he came and stood at the carriage door for a moment and as he looked at the figure crouching contentedly in the corner he stroked his beard thoughtfully again and went on as if no interval had come between his last words and his present ones but she saved our lives sir by stoppin us thats what she done sure as my names nathaniel james and when a girl done that a mans got nothin left but as the sayin is to act fair an square by herfair an square just so craddock replied the boy with a queer stiffness in his voice well drop her at the gate again andand it shall be justjust as if itas if it hadnt happened then he added in a lower voice spin along as fast as you can man and lets have done with it i wont leave her a hounce for a whistle sir said craddock laconically so the carriage with the rosy light streaming through the windows shot forth into the darkness in front and the sparks from the engine drifted into the darkness behind and the roar and the rush drowned all other sounds perhaps craddock whistled in the cab to make up for not being able to whistle on his engine perhaps the boy sang songs again in the carriage because he could not speak to the girl anyhow they were both silent when the flywheel quivered into rest once more beside level crossing number stop a bit said a rather unsteady voice as a girls figure paused against the rosy light of the open door its too long a step ill lift you down craddock looking over the side turned away and gave a sympathising little cough as if to cover some slighter sound perhaps he knew what would have happened if he had been in the boys place the next instant some one sprang into the cab and turned the steam hard on some one with a halfpained halfglad look on his face now then craddock right we are and craddock as he bent to look at the indicator answered right it is sir fair and square full pressure and no mischief come of it i hope not said the boy softly but it is a bit hard to knowto know what is fair and squarewithwith some people perhaps he was right for dhunni stood gazing after the red and green lights with a dazed look on her face the danger signal had come into her lifethe train had stopped and thenand amor vincit omnia this story began and ended in a public library an odd forlorn little offshoot of progress dibbled out beyond the walls of a faraway indian city which drowsed through the sunny today as it had drowsed through many a century of sunny yesterdays true it is that in a certain mimetic and superficial manner pooranabad had changed with the changing years it had evolved a municipal committee and this in its turn had given birth to various simulacra of civilisation but in effect the former was but the old council of elders in modern guise and the latter but jonahs gourd springing up in a day or a night at the bidding of some minor prophet from over the seas they came and went these minor prophets each with his theory his hobby and even when pooranabad knew them no more it could remember its rulers by the libraries and bandstands the public gardens the schools and the museums they had left behind them the library itself stood in the midst of a newly laidout public garden which but two summers before had been a most evilsmelling tankat least for nine months of the year the remaining three found it a shining lake flushed with fresh rain and carpeted with pink lotus blossom but culture of all sorts had stepped in with drainpipes bricks mortar flowers and books and the result was a maze of winding walks stubbly grass and stunted bushes gathered round a square stuccoed building of one room encircled by an arched verandah to east and south the deceptive walls and flat mud roofs of the native city looked like towers against the sky to west and north stood avenues of shishum trees with here and there a peep of the white bungalows wherein the minor prophets dwelt and grew gourds within under the one roof hung with two punkahs stood two tables the one littered with english magazines and illustrated papers the other bare save for a few leaflets of the native press with highsounding names and full of still more lofty sentiments the two bookcases one at each end of the room showed the same wellintentioned but unsuccessful impartiality for the eastern one was nearly empty while the western overflowed chiefly with novels a dozen shelves of them to one of miscellaneous literature made up for the most part of works on the central asian question and missionary reports the novels however had a solid appearance since most of them had been rebound by the districtoffice bookbinder in the legal calf and boards which he used also for the circulars and acts by which india is governed before this bookcase stood the only occupant of the room a tall weedy boy of about fifteen a boy with remarkably thin legs somewhat of a stoop in his narrow shoulders and a supple brown finger travelling slowly along the illspelt titles of the book ill spelt because the government bookbinder could hardly be expected to grapple successfully with the title of a modern novel the hesitations of this brown finger might have served as an index to the owners taste and showed a distinct leaning towards sentiment it lingered over several suggestive titles until it finally settled on something writ large in three volumes after which the boy crossing to a double desk midway between the tables wrote in the english register in a fine bold hand any clerk might have envied amor vincit omnia govind sahai kyasth so with two volumes under his arm and one held close to his soft shortsighted black eyes govind sahai of the tribe of kyasths or scribes made his way citywards down one of the winding paths thus strolling along he was typical of the great multitude of indian boys of his age boys who readgreat heavens what do they not read with their pale intelligent faces close to the lettering and their thoughtsthat is a mystery govind sahais face was no exception to the rule it was young yet old highfeatured yet gentle the ascetic hollows in the temples belied by the long sweeping curves in the mouth and both these features neutralised by the feminine oval of the cheek he was the only son of a widow who thanks to his existence led a busy and contented life in her fatherinlaws otherwise childless house for the honours of motherhood in india are great yet she was poor beyond belief to western ears across the black water in a christian country such poverty would have meant misery but in the old simplicity of pooranabad the little household managed to be happy above all in its hopes for the future when govinds education should be over and he be free to follow his hereditary trade as a writer his father had found his ancestral level oddly enough in compiling sanitary statistics in an english office until the cholera added one to the mortality returns by carrying him off as a victim after which all the interest of life to the inhabitants of the little courtyard and slip of roof which govind called home centred in the clever boy who could only follow his fathers trade if he succeeded in gaining the necessary pass for education has undermined heredity so govind worked hard for the scholarship which would enable him to go to college day after day he absorbed an amount of information which was perfectly prodigious month after month found him further and further adrift on the sea of knowledge even in playtime he gorged himself on new ideas as might be seen by the library register it was not only amor vincit omnia which showed on its pages but many another similar work lost for love govind sahai kyasth love the master my sweetheart one life one love and so on down one column and up another for the boy read fast on this particular hot dusty may morning he became so interested in his last book that he sat down on the parapet of the citys central sewer and twining one thin leg round the other plunged headlong into a sentimental scene between two lovers heedless of his unsavoury environments the interweaving of intellectual emotion and material sensation pictured on the page seemed to this boy just verging upon manhood to be an inspiration lifting the whole subject into a new world of pure passion it appealed as a matter of fact though he knew it not both to his inherited instincts and his acquired ideas thus satisfying both my darling said victor raising her sweet face to his and pressing a kiss on those pure pale lips love such as ours is eternal earth has no poweret caetera et caetera et caetera the tears positively came into his eyes he seemed to feel the touch of those lips on his making him shiver the little soft tendrils of her hair stirred with his breath as una shrinking to his side whispered i am not afraid when i am with you my king i feel so strong so strong to maintain the right strong to maintain our love before all the world for love is of heaven is it not dear heart our love is murmured victor once more raising her pure pale et caetera et caetera et caetera yes it was very beautiful very exalting also very disturbing to this inheritor of a nature built on simpler more direct lines that ancestral past of his seemed brutally bald beside this highly decorated castle of chivalry aha good evening pupil govind broke in the accurate voice of narayan chand head master of the district school you have i am glad to see availed yourself of advantages of public library with what mental pabulum have you provided yourself this summers eve as he spoke he seated himself likewise on the parapet of the sewer and read over the boys shoulder amor vincit omnia then his spectacled glance travelled down the page returning for comfort to the title that at least smacked of learning ah aha i see light literature good for colloquial and of paramount use in vivas so far well for superiority of diction nevertheless and valuability to grammar studies give me tatler spectator and such classics govind closed his book in most unusual irritation even in english literature masterji new things may be better than old of that there is no possible doubt quoted masterji with cheerful gravity he was a most diligent reader of the english papers and used to sit at the library table for hours of an evening devouring the critiques on gilberts or tennysons last with undiscriminating absorption in the formation and style of the sentence his quotations were in consequence more various than select of that there can be no possible probable manner of doubt as a modern poet puts it tersely he repeated tilting his embroidered smokingcap farther from his forehead and drawing the black alpaca tails of his coat round his legs yet still for all that it is held thatto speak colloquiallyfor taking the cake of scholarship the classics govind sahai put his feet to the ground and the first volume under his arm masterji when one labours long days at cube roots then classics in the evening become excessive life is not all learning life is love also he was quoting from the book he had been reading sits the wind in that quarter began narayan sagely then he looked at the boy reflectively and changed manner and language that brings to memory my son he said in hindustani when comes thy wedding procession i must speak to the virtuous widow that it come in vacation time so as not to interfere with study a sullen indifference was on govinds face you need not fear masterji i mean to have the scholarship the wedding will make no difference narayan chand smiled a superior smile nay my son it mustit shouldfor a time so is the vacation convenient thou canst return to school when the festal season is over come i will speak to thy relations even now the widow was sifting wheat a pleasantfaced little dump of a woman with dimples on her bare brown arms mother said govind calmly is grandfather in the masterji hath come about my wedding what have men to say to such things she answered with a shrill laugh go tell masterji heart of mine eyes that it is settled for the first week of vacation her people were here but now hurri hai but i shall laugh and cry to see thee there shall be nothing wanting at all flowers and sweets and merriment thy granny and i have toiled and spun for it and the bride sweeter than honey fie govind be not shy with thy mother think of the bride she gives thee and tell her thou art happy she flung her arms round her tall son kissing him and plying him with questions till he smirked sillily happy enough mother he admitted then felt amor vincit omnia under his arm and sighed i would much rather not be married at least i think not oh mother i would she had fair hair and blue eyes lakshmi hear him wouldst marry a fright govind wait the auspicious moment wait till i lift the veil oh the beauty fresh from the court of indra wheatcoloured and languishing with jewels and love govind shook his head profane not the great name of love he quoted to himself being forced to this secrecy by the fact that the only language his mother understood has no word for loveas he meant it so he added mournfully i am ready for my duty whenever you wish it mother that is enough nevertheless he dreamt dreams that night as he lay curled up on his short string bed with the second volume of amor vincit omnia under the quilt so as to be ready for the early summer dawn out under the stars in the bare mudwalled courtyard destitute to western eyes of all comfort he dreamt the dreams of his raceof a gorgeously attired bride shy yet alluring looking at him for the first time thou hast a nightmare said his mother crossly when just before daybreak he woke them all by sitting up in his bed and declaiming amor vincit omnia in a loud voice tis that book under thy head put it aside and lie as thy forefathers lay they dreamt not of pillows so shalt thou sleep sound and let others sleep also she went yawning back to bed and lay awake till dawn brought work counting over the savings she had made and calculating how much she could spare for flowers and sweets and spiced dishes for all the hitherto unknown luxuries which according to custom were to make the boys life a dream of pleasure for a time only for a time since the scholarship had to be gained a month afterwards a redcurtained bridal palanquin containing a mysterious bride was carried over the threshold of the little mud courtyard and govind sahai with a silver triptych on his forehead his ears tasselled with evilsmelling marigolds his scented tinsel coat hung with jasmine chaplets dismounted from a pinknosed pony amidst an admiring crowd that was an end of the spectacle as far as the outside world was concerned within it was only beginning for those two fond women who had spun and scraped and saved for this great occasion ever since the bridegroom was five years old much had to be done ere they would sit down in proud peace knowing that no possible enhancement of delight had been omitted the boy himself went through the countless ceremonies all tending towards an apotheosis of the senses with a certain shy dignity perhaps the sight of masterji doing wedding guest in a coppercoloured alpaca coat gave him confidence by reminding him that even the learned stoop to folly he was pale partly from the turmeric baths which are supposed to produce a complexion favourable to feminine eyes partly because he really felt sick after the unusual sloth and sweets of the last few days so much for his physical state of his mental condition this much may be presaged that if either his inherited instincts or his acquired convictions had any reality whatever it must have been chaos more chaotic than ever when far into the night after endless tests and trials nihali the mysterious bride proved beautiful asas well the fact was sure only the comparison remained doubtful the inherited instincts said a peri the acquired convictions an angel both it will be observed denizens of another world but then there are more other worlds than one master narayan chand hath sent to remind us that school reopens next week said govinds mother when nigh two months had passed two months during which the path of life had been smoothed scented and decorated for the special use of a boy and a girl govind sahai looked up from his work which was briefly holding nihalis slim ringbedecked fingers the fact that he did so on pretence of teaching her to write is of secondary importance she was undoubtedly a very pretty girl and her delicate refined face was at that moment full of adoring tenderness for the lad beside her not thirteen at the most she was taller than english girls of that age but far more slender with a figure still following the straight lines of childhood graceful for all that since her small head poised well over a round throat and the want of contour was dexterously hidden by masses of jewellery gleaming through the tinselshot veil even from wrist to elbow the thinness of the arm was concealed by the bridal bracelets of white ivory lined with red whilst the slender ankles beneath the scarlet goldbordered petticoat were hung with silvergilt jingles a typical bride briefly arrayed in all attractions save for the big nosering with its dangling golden spoon hiding the lip govind objected to its presence his mother to its absenceboth curiously enough for the same reasonbecause it served as a check to indiscriminate kissing of the bride the pious widow used to blush over her sons habit of saying goodbye to his wife when he had to leave her for an hour or two it might be english fashion warranted by all the loveliterature in creation it was not decent neither did she approve of seeing them as now seated together over that ridiculous farce of pothooks marriage was one thing lovemaking was another so she spoke sharply well answered the boy utterly unabashed dost think i have forgotten amma jan mother dear nay nihali hath been hearing my holiday task half the morning hast noto nihali his arm under cover of the veil stole round the girls waist and remained therea flagrant breach of decorum which fortunately for the female accomplice remained unnoticed by motherinlaw who was busy over a knot in a thread she was skeining from her unending pirn yet nihali despite this awful lapse looked sweet and good enough to fill the heroines part in any novel and her looks did not belie her the past two months had been a fever of delight to govind with the curious apathetic resignation to the limitations of custom so noticeable in clever indian lads whose brains are full of theories he had accepted marriage in the spirit of his forebears only to find that love with a big l such as he had read of in books was actually within his reach to be sure in books the object was chosen by the lover but what did that matter in the end so he used up all the stockintrade of the sentimental novelist for little nihalis benefit and she listened to his rhapsodies on perfect marriage and twin souls her eyes set wide with wonder admiration and belief no first lady in white satin could have played her part more prettily than this indian child of thirteen who from her cradle had been taught to venerate her husband as a god and who now in a sort of rapture found herself the object of a sentimental passion absolutely novel and bewildering she nestled her sleek head on his shoulder telling him that she believed every word he said and so she did had he told her the world was flat instead of explaining to her with great pomp and precision that she was living on an orange depressed at the poles it would have been the same to her the world she lived in was of his creating like most hindu girls of the higher classes she had a marvellous memory and govind had hardly known whether to be pleased or pained at the discovery that after hearing him read it over a few times she knew his repetition better than he did himself yet shy of her own exploit she only replied to his laughing reference to the holiday task by a timid squeeze of the hand still holding hers motherinlaw broke the knot with a snap a habit with the determined little woman who thereinafter would twirl the ends together as if nothing had happened one twist of the thumb and all was as it had been i know not what holiday tasks may mean she said scornfully in my time work was work and play play so must it be now nihalis people have sent to ask when she returns to them after established custom i have answered when school begins they had been so supremely so innocently happy over their pothooks and now the consternation on their two young faces was quite piteous motherinlaw however found it scandalous did not all decent girls cry to go home long before the honeymoon was over had not she herself wept bitterly in her time and there was nihali actually snivelling at the idea of leaving before her husband too and govind was no better it is so soon pleaded the boy too much taken aback for instant revolt besides the situation had never come into any of the novels he had read so he really felt unable to cope with it his remark only increased the pitch of his mothers voice soon was it had he not had two months of billing and cooing to gain which she and grannie had spun their fingers to the bone soon whose fault was it if time had been wasted over alphabets and pothooks her shrill tones brought grannie from her labours below and before these two eminently respectable matrons the guilty pair could only hold each others hands like the babes in the wood feeling lost and miserable that afternoon he went over to the public library for the first time since his marriage and spent hours hunting up precedents on the subject only to return discomfited and hopeless nihali would revolt of course if he bade her follow his lead but how could he bear to have the finger of scorn pointed at her by those unacquainted with the theory of perfect marriage and twin souls that night when the rest of the little household retired from the roof leaving the luxury of fresh air to the younger people he and nihali sat down under the stars on the still flowerstrewn bed and cried like the children they were so with awful swiftness the dawn came when govind had to put on the palepink turban proclaiming him a firstclass middle student and set off to school with his books under his arm books on the whole less disturbing than amor vincit omnia and its congeners nothing further had been said about nihalis approaching departure it was inevitable of course meanwhile they must make the most of the time left to them so govind looked haggard and feverish as he took his accustomed place nevertheless being student by nature the work beguiled him by evening he was lighthearted enough to run home and race up the crumbling stairs leading to the roof full of anecdotes and news for nihali there was no one to receive them the roof itself had resumed its normal workaday appearance and in the very place where the little bride had sat on her lacquered bridal stool squatted his mother piecing two broken strands of her skein together as if nothing had happened and nothing out of the common had happened whose fault was it if govind flung himself on his face and wept like a baby for what was beyond his reach his mother had expected so much when she planned her coup detat but he continued to crywhich she did not expect for something more complex than simple passion had been aroused in the boy of that he might have been ashamed in this he gloried was it not in short a legitimate subject for selfglorification so he wept himself sick in a subdued docile sort of way finally masterji called one day in consternation to say that though painstaking as ever poor govind could not remember the simplest problem while as for riders he just sat and looked at them the scholarship was thus in danger she tried scolding the boy in good set terms but he met her reproaches with an invulnerable superiority before which she stood aghast what was to be done perhaps this spiriting away of the bride in order to avoid a scene had been an error but was that any reason why she should be requested to return to begin with it would be an appalling breach of etiquette and then there was the risk of consequences much to be deprecated between such very young people the whole household including masterji puzzled over the difficulty which seemed all the more puzzling because it was so uncalled for boys having been married at fifteen and sent to school again afterwards since time began without any fuss but then those boys had not read amor vincit omnia and learnt to mix sentiment with passion while matters were at this deadlock nihalis mother arrived on the scene unexpectedly and en petit comite with the womenfolk gave a new turn to affairs the possibility suggested was in a measure disconcerting but on the other hand afforded govinds mother an opportunity of retreating with dignity since the girl must not be allowed to fret as she had been fretting the result being that a week afterwards govind sahai did a difficult rider in a way which made narayan chand dream dreams of a future when folk would say this eminent man received primary and secondary education at the hands of our most successful teacher of youth pundit narayan chand it was a dream he frequently indulged in about his pupils the little strip of roof was once more frequented by pigeons and the snappings and joinings of threads relegated for the most part to the court below yet the boys appetite did not return and as winter came on he developed a teasing cough in that narrow chest of his the fact was that he burnt the candle of life at both ends in more ways than one perhaps if his soul could have been left in peace he might have passed through the ordeal safely as many a boy manages to do in india but it was not poor govind had no rest he strung himself up to the highest pitch in obedience to the mixed result of his birth and education then on this quivering instrument he proceeded to play scales it was tausigs exercises on a zither he had to teach himself teach nihali think of the coming baby and go through the whole gamut of intellectual and physical emotion of which he had read the first string gave way when his mother laughing crying and blessing him all in a breath put a boy baby into his arms on his return from school one day he sat down stupidly on the lowest step of the mud stairs gazing at what he held in a sort of bewildered amaze at finding himself thus till his mother angrily snatched the child from him saying he should be ashamed of shedding tears on a newborn babys face it was very like nihali he thought only years older with all those wrinkles then he thought helplessly how he had decided with nihalis consent of course on a thousand contraventions of old customs at this time yet there was she upstairs in the hands of the wise women and the baby ready to be doctored by its grandmother what could a boy of sixteen do against such odds so the little proselytising pamphlet he had read was put away with a sigh and after all nihali did very well under the old regime he found her when the wise women permitted him in the seventh heaven over the baby was there ever such a doll with its little sharp nose and pinchedup lips and would he believe itthe tiny creature was so lazy that grandmother had to tickle it soon the mouthbefore it would take any interest in the sugar and spices by and by when she could nurse it herself it would be different she lay smiling at the idea while downstairs as they left the house the gossips were shaking their heads and saying calmly it is an unnecessary baby but a forerunner others will come there is plenty of time even when nihali could not nurse the child and they had recourse to a maws feeder which govind with many blushes bought at the same shop which supplied him with slate pencils those two young things feared nothing he used to bring his books to the roof where she lay with the little quiet mouse of a thing tucked away in her veil then while the sun set red over the dusty city he worked away at all the ologiesworked somewhat feverishly since more depended now on his success sometimes nihalis smile gurgled over in laughter and govind looking up would find babys fingers being clasped round his pen look you she would whisper as if in presence of some great potentate i asked my lord if he wished to be a writer too and see how fast he holds there was one thing however to which the baby did not hold fast and that was life but not till the very day before the eventful examination which meant so much to govind did those two children read fear in each others faces about that other child oh govind what shall we do what shall we do wailed nihali when the grandmother seeing them wild with anxiety told them the truth while the greatgrandmother stood by wagging her head and mumbling of others by and by what was that to them now how he got through the next day he never knew he took the papers and went with them to his desk nay more he did his level best with them nerving himself to the effort chiefly by thoughts of masterjis disappointment if he failed but his personal interest in the matter seemed gone that was centred on a roof in the dusty city where one child sat crying over another what were plus or minus to him save a world with or without an unnecessary infant all that night was passed beside nihali waiting for his mothers voice to say the end had come but the morning found the little sleeper still in the young mothers arms perhaps there was still hope he hastily swallowed some breakfast and delayed by this hint of respite found himself five minutes late in the examinationroom the first papers had already been given out and to avoid possibility of fraud none save those present at the issue were allowed to compete so govind had to sit idle for a while knowing he had lost a definite number of chances nor was this the worst the pause gave him time for thought hitherto once within the familiar walls old habits of attention and forgetfulness had possessed him now with nothing to do he remembered and yet forgot so when the order to go up for the second paper came he rose with his brain in a whirl a wild desire to cry let me alone my baby is dying seeming to blot out everything else in the world perhaps had he done so he might have had a chance in the examiners human pity as it was he pulled himself together and failed hopelessly in the pause before the viva voce he sat looking straight before him dully conscious that he had done badly govind has never been the same since he married whispered one boy and the other giggled silence cried narayan chand fussily govind sahai your name is first for viva come up govind sahai kyasth then as the dull yet anxious face passed him he whispered now for value of light literature you are best at colloquial my pupil so courage and remember amor vincit omnia and such like things amor vincit omnia the boys last chance fled before those words when the ordeal was over he turned back to his place mechanically as he passed the masterji once more he read his fate in the disappointed face raised to his then in the confident smile of the boy succeeding him finally in the surprised nudging of the whole class something seemed to snap in his brain he paused and facing the examiners raised his hand the rush of thought was too much for him at first then he broke silence in a gentle deprecating voice if you will be kind enough to excuse me sirs i will beg leave to retire the exigencies of the case forbid explanation but this much is admittedthat amor vincit omnia that boy speaks better english than i thought for said one examiner to the other when the leave had been granted give him five marks more hes failed of course but its as well to be just when govind reached home nihalis arms were empty there is no need to say more it was an unnecessary infant to all save those two you have failed failed badly my poor pupil owing doubtless to domestic bereavement said the masterji when he called a week or two later full of vexed sympathy such circumstances point to special privilege of entering again next year for which we will apply and then govind there must be no killing of birds with one stone there must be no complicated states of mind confusing idiom but govind sahai kyasth did not avail himself of the permission duly given as the punditji put it in consideration of the strictly nonregulation death of his infant at a premature age the old grandfather whose small lifepension had been the prop of the household died of autumnal fever and during the ensuing winter the result of his failure to win the scholarship came home to govind with depressing force since even from that poor ten rupees a month something might have been spared to stand between those three fond women and the grindstone that last resort of poverty then nihalis mother coming over unexpectedly and finding her daughter at the mill carried her off in a huff this time govind said nothing the spirit had gone out of him and for the girls own sake he gave in to custom he worked very hard but as the winter advanced his shoulders seemed to grow narrower and narrower and the teasing cough became louder good food care and rest might have done something perhaps only perhaps for there is not much to be done when the candle of life is alight at both ends except to put it out that is what happened one april morning when the bougainvillea round the arched verandah of the library looked like a crimson drapery he used to go there every morning before school hours for the memory of his failure in viva voce rankled keenly and he was possessed by a curious determination to prove master narayan chand wrong in attributing it to govinds unwise selection of books so secure at those hours from interruption he used to sit and study the idiom of light literature thou art not fit to go said his mother tearfully one morning after the boy had been kept awake all night by cough and fever reading will not hurt me amma jan he replied and the examination is next month they found him two hours afterwards seated at the desk before the ledger his head resting on a novel he had just been entering in the register a horrible stain of blood from the bloodvessel he had ruptured blotted the page but through it you could still see in his bold handwriting amor vincit omnia govind sahai kyasth the wings of a dove i a tall lanky boy of about seventeen sat halfway down the great flight of steps at the eastern entrance of the jumma mosque at delhi looking anxiously at a cage full of avitovats twinkling little brown birds with a suspicion of red amid their brown flitting slender silent little birds never still for a second he looked at them halfsatisfied halfdoubtful and as he looked he turned a fouranna bit over and over in his brown fingers for though he was dressed as a european his complexion was as dark as that of most highcaste natives and darker by a good bit than that of a girl some one or two years his junior who sat fondling a pigeon on a higher step and looking askance also at the avitovats footnote copyright by macmillan co the huzoor can have them for five annas if he chooses said the evillooking birdcatcher who was squatting among his wares though he used the honorific title his manner was absolutely devoid of courtesy and he turned without the least change in it to address a friend in the parrot line who sat with his cages on the step above for this particular flight of steps is set apart to the selling of birds especially after prayertime on fridays when the pigeonracers and quailfighters buy and bet in the wide portico of rosy stone and pale marble the avitovatshaving no value to the sportsmancommanded but a slack sale so the boy had plenty of time in which to make up his mind to judge by appearances a difficult task for his face was undeniably weak though handsome kindly and soft he wore a white drill suit clean but sadly frayed and his grey wideawake was many sizes too large for his small head perhaps it was the knowledge of this combined with a vague suspicion that the hat knew quite as much about birdfancying as the head within it which made him in his perplexity take it off place it on his slack knees and drop the fouranna piece into it as if it had better decide the question sitting so with bare head he looked handsomer than ever for its shape was that of a young adonis it was in fact the only thing about him or his life which corresponded with his name agamemnon menelaus the surname gibbs used after those eight resounding syllables to come as a shock to the various chaplains who at various times had undertaken to look after young gibbs spiritual welfare some of them the more experienced ones acquiesced in that and many another anomaly after their first glance at his soft gentle face for it was typical of that class of eurasian which makes the soul of a chaplain sink within him others reached the same conclusion after a reference to the mother mrs gibbs she was a very dark pious woman tearfully uncertain of all things save that she being a widow must be supported by charity by the offertory for preference she however made the problem of his name less intrusive by calling him aggie as if he had been a girl they are young birds as the huzoor could see for himself if he had eyes went on the birdcatcher with a yawn next moulting they will be as red as a rutti seed but it is five annas not four aggie had no lack of eyes outwardly they were large and soft as velvet and as they looked down at the avitovats showed a thick fringe of curling lashes but there was an almost pathetic guilelessness in them and one brown hand hesitated about his breastpocket he had another anna there part of a monthly stipend of one rupee for attending the choir which he had intended to spend on sweetspreserved pumpkins for choice but the avitovats with their promise of scarlet plumage cozened his indolent colourloving eyes almost as much as the thought of the sweets did his palate should he should he not the mere sight of the birds was a strong point in their favour and his hand had sought the inside of his pocket when a whisper met his ear hens it was unmistakable and he turned to look at the girl behind him she was sitting on her heels crunched up chin and knees holding her pigeon close to her face as if to hide it and as he turned she sidled further away along the step with the curious gliding shuffle peculiar to native girls and pigeons kabootri kabootri kabootri gurgled the pigeon as if pleased at the motion it was a bluerock showing a purple and green iridescence on the breast and the girls dress matched its colourings exactly for her ragged cotton skirt had washed and worn to a dark neutral tint and the shotsilk bodice tattered and torn with tarnished gold embroidery on its front took gleams of a past glory from the sunlight her veil had faded in its folds to a sort of cinnamon brown touched with blue and both it and the bodice were many sizes too large for her slight childish figure if the huzoor is not to buy let him give place to those who will suggested the birdcatcher cavalierly he had been too far to catch the whisper and thought to clinch the bargain by a threat agamemnon menelaus looked at him nervously are you sure they are young birds he suggested timidly they mightthey might be hens you know there was a halfperceptible quiver of his handsome head as if to watch the girl the birdcatcher broke out into violent asseverations and aggies hand out of sheer trepidation went into his pocket again hens this time there was a ring almost of command in the tone and agamemnon obeyed it instinctively by rising to go kabootri kabootri came the gurgle of the pigeon or was it partly a chuckle from the girl as she sidled still further along the step so that is good riddance said the birdcatcher to the parrotseller angrily god made the rainbow but the devil made the dyepot yet i thought i had sold them at last he looked not so sharp as that the parrotseller yawned twas kabootri did it he remarked with bland indifference she said hens the birdcatcher stared at him incredulously then passed the look on to the girl who still sat with the crooning pigeon held close to her face kabootri he echoed with an uneasy laugh nay neighbour twas she who told me but an hour ago that if i sold not something this friday she would kill herself tis a trick of words she hath learned of her trade he went on with a curious mixture of anger and approbation but it means something to a man who hath cursed luck and a daughter who has a rare knack of getting her own way the parrotseller gave a pull at a bulbulsellers pipe as if it were his own thou wilt be disgraced if thou give it her much longer friend he said calmly tis time she were limed and netted and with no mother either to whack her the uneasy laugh came again if the nawabs pigeon wins we may see to a soninlaw but she is a child still neighbour and a good daughter too helping her father more than he helps her there was a touch of real pride in his tone she said hens retorted the parrotseller ask her if she did not kabootri kabootri the call was a trifle tremulous but the girl rose with alacrity throwing the pigeon into the air with the deft hand of a practised racer as she did so the bird was practised also and without a flutter flew off into the blue like an arrow from a bow then as if confused by finding itself without a rival wheeled circling round the rosered pile till it settled on one of the marble cupolas what ist father she asked standing on the upper steps and looking down on the two men she was wonderfully fair with a little pointed chin and a wide firm mouth curiously at variance with it as were the big broad black eyebrows with the liquid softness of her eyes why didst say hens kabootri replied her father assuming the fact as the best way of discovering the truth since her anger at unjust suspicion was always prompt why she echoed absently why then suddenly she smiled i dont know father but i did the birdcatcher broke out into useless oaths his daughter had the doves name but was no better than a peacock a peacock in a thiefs house she had lost him five annas for nothing kabootris eyebrows looked ominous five annas fret not for five annas she echoed scornfully turning on her heels towards the gateway and flinging out her arms she began the pigeons notethe pigeons name and her ownkabootri kabootri kabootri it was as if a bird were calling to its mate and the answer came quickly in the soft whir of many wings as the bluerocks which live among the rosered battlements and marble cupolas wheeled down in lessening circles lo there is kabootri calling the pigeons remarked an old gentleman who was crossing citywards from the fort a stoutish gentleman clothed immaculately in filmy white muslin with a pale pink inner turban folded across his forehead and showing triangularly beneath the white outer one he was one of the richest bankers in delhi by religion a jain the sect to whom the destruction of life is the one unpardonable sin and he gave a nervous glance at the distant figure on the steps nay partner she was in our street last week put in his companion who was dressed in similar fashion and kabootri is not as the boys who are ever at one with sparrows for a pice or two she hath business in her and a right feeling she takes once and hath done with it till the value is paid the gift of the old bodice and shawl which my house gave her kept us free for six months still if thou art afraid we can go round a bit kabootri from her coign of vantage saw them sneaking off the main road and smiled at their caution contemptuously but what they had said was true she had business in her and right feeling it was not their turn to pay so cuddling a captured pigeon to her breast she set off in an opposite direction threading the bazaars and alleys unerringly and every now and again crooning her own name softly to the bird which without a struggle watched her with its onyx eyes and called to her again there is kabootri with a pigeon remarked the drugseller at the corner to his clients the leisurely folk with ailments who sit and suggest sherbets to each other and go away finally to consult a soothsayer for a suitable day on which to take their little screw or phial of medicine she will be going to sri parasnaths it is a while since she was there and kabootri is just for a birdslayer apparently he was right as to her purpose for at the turn leading to sri parasnaths place of business she sat down on a step and after a preliminary caress fastened a string deftly to one of the pigeons feet then she caressed it again stroking its head and crooning to it finally with a bound she started to her feet flung it from her to flutter forlornly in the air her level black eyebrows bent themselves downwards into a portentous frown and her young voice rang out shrilly almost savagely yahee chooriyahmar aihee chooriyahmar hillo the birdslayer hullo the birdslayer look out brother said a fat old merchant in spectacles who was poring over a ledger in the wooden balcony of an old house look out and see who tis if tis kabootri thou canst take eight annas from the box she will not loose the bird for less but if tis a boy with sparrows wait and bargain it was kabootri no doubt who else but she came like a young tigercat down the lane startling the shadowy silence with strange savage threats who but she came like a young bacchante dancing with fury showing her small white teeth and apparently dragging her poor victim by one leg or whirling it cruelly round her on a string so that its fluttering wings seemed like her fluttering veil give ai followers of rishaba give or i kill ai jain people give or i take life sri parasnath put his turbanless bald head with its odd little tuft of a pigtail over the balcony and concealing his certainty under a very creditable show of dismay called down curses solemnly on her head he would send for the police he would have her locked up and fined she might take the bird and kill it before his very eyes if she chose but he would not pay a pice for its freedom to all of which kabootri replied with a fresh method of doing the victim to death she played her part with infinite spirit but her antagonist was in a hurry to get some orders for manchester goods off in time for the english mail so his performance was but halfhearted and ere she had well begun her list of horrors the eightanna bit came clinking down on the brick pavement and she as in duty bound had to squat beside it and loosen the string from the pigeons leg as usual she had to drive it from settling on her head or shoulders by wild antics until it fluttered to a neighbouring roof where it sidled along the copings with bright eyes watching her and soft cooings of kabootri kabootri once beyond jain eyes she always gave back the call so as to assure herself that no harm had been done this time by some mischance there happened to be a broken feather in the wing and her lips set themselves over the task of pulling it out that being a necessity to even flight after which came renewed caresses with a passion in them beyond the occasion for indeed the passion in kabootri was altogether beyond the necessities of her lifeas yet true it was not always such plain sailing as it had been with sri parasnath newcomers there were even old customers striving in modern fashion to shake themselves free from such deliberate blackmailing who needed to be reminded of her methods methods ending in passionate tears over her own cruelty in the first quiet spot she could reach but of late years she had grown cunning in the avoidance of irretrievable injury a dexterous slipping of the cord would leave her captive free and she herself at liberty to go round to some poultryseller and borrow a poor fowl under sentence of death with which she would return to unflinching execution these things had to be and her young face would be like a medeas as she did the deed but even this was of the past since folk had begun to recognise the uselessness of driving the girl to extremities thus her threat i will kill i will kill brought at most but a broken feather in a doves wing and a passionate cuddling of the victim to her breast this one was interrupted brusquely by a question why did you say hens it was aggie he happened to live close by in a tumbledown tenement with two square yards of verandah which were the mainstay of mrs gibbs position they and the necessity for blacking agamemnon menelaus boots when he went to the choir separated her effectually and irrevocably from her native neighbours he did not sing nowhis voice had begun to crackbut he looked well in a surplice and the chaplain knew he would have to pay the monthly stipend in any case so this being friday aggie was on his way to evensong polished boots and all they were really the strongest barrier between him and the tall girl with her pretty bare feet who stood up to face him with a soft perplexed look in the eyes which were so like his in all but expression and even that merged into his in its softness and perplexity becausebecause they were hens she said with an odd little tremble in her voice so the two young things stood looking at each other while the pigeon gurgled and cooed kabootri kabootri kabootri ii so seest thou kabootri thou wilt turn christian and then i will marry thee aggies outlook on the future went so far and left the rest to providence the girls went further trra she commented that is fools talk i am a birdslayer how could we live without the pigeons and the mosque thou hast no money they were sitting on the flight of steps once more with a cage full of scarlet avitovats between them so that the passersby could not see the hands that were locked in each other behind the cage then i will marry thee and become a heathen amended agamemnon giving a squeeze to what he held she smiled and the soft curves of her chin seemed to melt into those of her long throat as she hung her head and looked at him as if he were the most beautiful thing in her world that is wiser she said and if thou dost not marry me i will kill myself so that is settled he gave another squeeze to her hand and she smiled again then they sat gazing at each other across the avitovats hand in hand like a couple of children for there was guilelessness in his eyes and innocence in hers lo she said suddenly i know not now why i said hens she paused failing to find her own meaning and so came back to more practical matters thou hadst best be buying the birds agameean for so to suit her estimate of him she had chosen to amend his name or folk will wonder and if thou wilt leave them in the old place in the queens gardens i will fetch them away and thou canst buy them of me again next friday footnote aga noble meean prince there was no cunning in her manner only a solid grasp on the exigencies of the position had he not a mother living in a house with a verandah and was not her father a birdseller was he not at that moment betting on the nawabs coming pigeonrace on the platform above them despite these exigencies however the past three weeks had been pleasant if aggie was still rather hazy as to the difference between young cocks and old hens it was from no lack of experience in the buying of avitovats kabootri used to give him the money wherewith to buy them and leave it again in the hidingplace where she found the birds so it was not an expensive amusement to either of them and if agamemnon menelaus had not grasped the determination which underlay the girls threats of taking life it was from no lack of hearing them ay and of shivering at them the savage reckless young figure startling the sunshine and shadow of the narrow lanes with its shrill cry i will kill i will kill yea i will take life had filled him with a sort of proud bewilderment a sacred admiration and other things had brought the same dizzy content with them that same figure sidling along the rosered copings like any pigeon to gain the marble cupolas where the young birds were to be foundthose young birds which must be taught betimes to play her game of life and death as all her world must be taught to play itwas fascinating it was disturbing when it sat close to him in the queens gardens eating rose comfits bought out of the bloodmoney and cooing to him like any dove while the pigeons in the trees above it called kabootri kabootri as if they were jealous the outcome of it all however was as yet no more than the discarding of boots in favour of native shoes and the supplanting of the grey wideawake by a white and gold saucercap which only cost four annas and lay on the dark waves of the lads small head as if it had been made for it kabootri clasped her hands tight in sheer admiration as she watched him go down the steps with the cage of scarlet avitovats but mrs gibbs while admitting the superlative beauty of the combination burst into floods of lamentation at the sight for it was a symptom she had seen often in lads of aggies age his elder brother had begun that way that elder brother who was now a thorn in the side of every chaplain from peshawur to calcutta by reason of his disconcerting desire to live as a heathen and be saved as a christian so when aggie with a spark of unusual spirit had refused to put on the boots which she had made the servant for of course there had to be a servant in a house with a verandah black with the greatest care in other words when he had refused to go to church since native shoes and a delhi cap are manifestly incompatible with a surplice she went over to a bosom friend and wept again but mrs rosario was of a different type altogether she seldom wept taking life with a pure philosophy and making her living out of her handsome daughters by marrying them off to the first comer on the chance of his doing well there is noneedto cry she said comfortably in the curious halfstaccato halflegato intonation of her race your boy isnoworse than all boys if they do not getona place or get married they fallinto mischief god made themso and we must bow tohis will as we are christians and not heathen and girls arelikethat too if theydonotgetmarried they will give trouble so if you ask myadvice i say that ifyoucannotget your poor boy onaplace you had better gethimawife or the bad black woman in the bazaar willleadhimto bad ways for he is a handsome boy almost as handsome as my lily he is too young perhaps and sheistooyoungtoo but if you like he can beau my lily you can ask someoneforclothes and then he can beau lily to the choir and give a little hop in your place mrs gibbs when my girls try me i give hops it makes them allright and your boywillbeallrighttoo you live too quiet mrs gibbs for young folk they will have some pleasure so get your son nice new clothes and iwillgiveahop at my place and send my cook to help yours this solid sense caused mrs gibbs to lie in wait for the chaplain in his verandah armed with a coarse cotton handkerchief soaked in patchouli and an assertion that aggies absence from the choir was due to unsuitable clothes and both tears and scent being unbearable she went back with quite a large bundle of garments which had belonged to a merry english boy who had come out to join his parents only to die of enteric fever give them away in charity my dear the father had said in a hard voice the boy would have liked it so best himself so the mother with hopeless tears over the scarceworn things had sent them over to the chaplain for his poor thus it happened that before kabootri had recovered from her intense delight at the cap mrs gibbs was laying out a beautiful suit cut to the latest fashion to await aggies return from one of those absences which had become so alarmingly frequent there was a brandnew red tie also a pair of lavender gloves striped socks and patentleather pumps to crown all there was a note on highly scented paper with an l on it in lilies of the valley in which mrs rosario and her daughters requested the pleasure of mr agamemnon menelaus gibbs company at a hop that evening what more could a young man like aggie want for his regeneration nothing apparently it was impossible for instance to think of sitting on the steps with kabootri in a suit made by an english tailor a tall hat and a pair of lavender kid gloves yet the fine feathers had to be worn when in obedience to the rsvp in the corner of the scented note he had to take over a reply in which mr agamemnon menelaus gibbs accepted with pleasure etc etc oh mamma said miss lily who received the note in person with a giggle of admiration i do like him he is quite the gentleman the remark being made before its object had left the tiny courtyard which the rosarios dignified by the name of compound was quite audible and a shy smile of conscious vanity overspread the lads handsome face about the same time that is to say when the sinking sun still gloriously bright had hidden itself behind the vast pile of the mosque so that it stood out in pale purple shadow against a background of sheer sunlight kabootri was curled up on a cornice with her back to one of the carven pilasters of a cupola dreaming idly of agameean in his white and gold cap he had not been to the steps that day so from her airy perch she was keeping a watch for him and as she watched her clasp on the pigeon she was caressing tightened unconsciously till with a croon and a flutter it struggled for freedom the sound brought other wings to wheel round the girl expectantly for it was near the time for the birds evening meal sharafatnissa the old canoness who lived on the roof below the marble cupolas had charge of the store of grain set apart for the purpose by the guardians of the mosque but as a rule kabootri fed the pigeons she did many such an odd job for the queer little cripple half pensioner half saint who kept a koran class for poor girls and combined it with a sort of matrimonial agency for the due providing of suitable husbands to girls who have no relations to see after such things is a meritorious act of piety a lucrative one also when as in sharafatnissas case you belong to a good family and have a large connection in houses where a goodlooking maiden is always in request as an extra wife so as she taught the holy book her keen little eyes were always on the alert for a possible bride they had been on kabootri for a long time hitherto however that idle disreputable father downstairs had managed to evade the old canoness but now that the great pigeonrace of the year was being decided on the grassy plain between the mosque and the fort his last excuse would be gone for he had all but promised that if he lost sharafatnissa should arrange the sale of the girl into some rich house while if he won he had promised himself to give kabootri who in his way he really liked a strapping young husband fit to please any girl one who being of her own caste would allow her the freedom which she loved even as the birds loved it she however knew nothing of this compact so when the great shout telling of victory went up from the packed multitude on the plain she only wondered with a smile if her father would be swaggering about with money to jingle in his pocket or if she would have to cry i will kill i will kill a little oftener than usual sharafatnissa heard the shout also and as she rocked backwards and forwards over her evening chant of the holy book gave a covetous upward glance at the slender figure she could just see among the wings of the doves downstairs among the packed multitudes the shout which told him of defeat made the birdcatcher also reprobate as he was look up swiftly to the great gateway which was fast deepening to purple as the sun behind it dipped closer to the horizon for one could always tell where kabootri was by the wheeling wings have a care he said fiercely to the discreetlyveiled figure that evening as it sat behind the narrow slit of a door blocking the narrow stair which kabootri trod so often on her way to and from the roof have a care sister she is not easily limed or netted a sort of giggle came from the veil yea brother girls are all so but if the cage is gilt it was just a week after this and the sunlight behind the shadow of the mosque was revelling in sheeny iridescence of her tattered silk bodice that kabootris figure showed clear and defiant against the sky as she stood on the uppermost outermost coping of the gateway there was a sheer fall beneath her to the platform below she had just escaped from the room where she had been caged like any bird for three whole days and the canoness on the roof below was looking up at her prisoner helplessly listen my pigeon my beloved she wheedled breathlessly come down and let us talk it over together open the door i say came the shrill young voice open or i kill myself open or i kill hearts blood listen he shall be a young man a handsome man handsome young was not agameean young was he not handsome the thought made her voice shriller clearer open the door or i kill open or i take life the words were the words of the young tigercat that had been wont to startle the sunshine and the shadow making sri parasnath seek his cashbox incontinently but there was a new note of appeal in their determination for if it was but three days since she had been caged it was six since she had seen agameean what had become of him had he sought and missed her had he not listen my bird came the wheedling voice come down and listen kabootri i swear that if thou likest not this one i will let thee go and seek another i swear it child the sidling feet edged nearer along the coping for this respite would at least give time swear it on the holy book soin thy right hand and in thy left let me see it she stretched her own hands out over the depths and at the sight the expectant pigeons came wheeling round her i swear by god and his prophet began the old canoness gabbling as fast as she could over the oath but above her breathless mumble came a little shriek a little giggle and a girls voice from below ah mr gibbs you are so naughty so very naughty kabootri could not understand the words but the giggle belongs to all tongues and it jarred upon her passion her despair she looked down and saw a wellknown figure changed utterly by a familiar yet unfamiliar dress she saw two girls about her own age with tiny waists huge sleeves and hats it was agameean escorting the two miss rosarios who had expressed a desire to see the mosque and she saw something else she saw the look which the prettiest of the two girls gave to agameean she saw the look he gave in return her sidling feet paused she swayed giddily kabootri kabootri called the woman on the roof eagerly anxiously i have sworn it come down my pigeon come down my dove it makes me dizzy so that was agameean the mistress said sooth the wings made one dizzy the wingsthe wings of a dove she had them for the wind caught the wide folds of her veil and claimed a place in the wide fluttering sheen of her bodice as she fell and fell and fell down from the marble cupolas past the purple shadow of the great gateway to the wide platform where the doves are bought and sold and some of the pigeons followed her and some sat sidling on the coping calling kabootri kabootri but those of them who knew her best fled affrighted into the golden halo of sunshine behind the rosered pile the swimmers miriam miriam what is it canst thou not tell a body bound to a millstone as i thy tongue goes fast enough when i wish thee silent it was a womans voice that was beginning to lose its fulness and sweetness in other words its womanliness which called up from the courtyard where the hum of the quern grinding the yellow indian corn deadened all other sounds footnote copyright by macmillan co it is naught mother only hussan and husayn once more it was a womans voice also from the roof where the indian corn was drying to a richer gold in the sunlight but it was a voice which had hardly come as yet to its full roundness in other words to its perfect womanliness hussan and husayn what makes them be for ever fighting like young cocks there was an instants pause then the voice from the roof came piously god knows probably he did but miriam herself might have been less modest as to her knowledge for the case stood thus it was a corner house between two sequestered alleys which intersected each other at right angles and there had been a lingering lover expectant of some recognition in each alley now if halfahandful of golden corn be thrown as a guerdon over the parapet just at the angle and if the lovers hotblooded young sparks spring forward incontinently to pick up the precious grains and meet then indeed mother they were very like cocks remarked miriam gravely as she stepped daintily down the narrow mudstairs again to resume her spinning in the courtyard once more she spoke truth but hardly the whole truth since when featherless bipeds are picking up grains of corn out of a gutter they can hardly avoid a resemblance to feathered ones so the whir of the wheel joined the hum of the quern and both formed a background to her sudden girlish laugh at the recollection of what she had seen through the peephole in the parapet the whole thing was a play to this osmanzai girl who for all her seclusion knew perfectly well that she was the beauty of the village and that many another spark besides hussan and husayn would be only too glad of halfahandful of indian corn to pick up out of the gutter but these two being the most expert swimmers in that quaint bare colony of huts set on a loose shale slope with the wild wicked rush of the indus at its foot were perhaps the most interesting that is to say if you excepted khasia the big soft shepherd who came down sometimes from the grassy fircrowned slopes higher up the gorge the mahaban or great forest hills beyond which lay the black mountain a strange wild country is this of the indus gorge just as the great river begins to think of the level plains in front of it a strange wild people are those who live in that closepacked flatroofed village upon the shale slope where a footfall sends the thin leaves of micaschist slithering away into the rushing river there is no stranger country no wilder people for this is sitana the place of refuge for every mohammedan fanatic who finds the more civilised plains too hot even for his fiery faith sitana the dwellingplace of the syyuds who since the days of their great leader ahmad have spent their lives in killing every helldoomed infidel they can get hold of in cold blood and as the pigs of hindus live on the other side of the rushing river it follows that those who kill must also swim since there is no bridge far or near that was why hussan and husayn and many another of their sort with carefully oiled thews and sinews of bronze would go down the shale slope on dark nights and slip softly into the icecold stream then if there was a glint of moon you could see them caught in the great upward curve of the mad current inshore the two skinbladders that were slung under their armpits making it look as if six dark heads not two were drifting down and down yet somehow drifting nearer and nearer to the other side where the pigs of hindus were to be found but even a glint of moon kept them as a rule talking of future nightsunless there was some cause to raise their recklessness to feverheight for even that glint was enough to make the police watchers on the other the english side slip softly also into the stream and give chase a strange wild chase indeed it was down and down in the dark till the blockade was run or the venture abandoned for another night or stranger wilder still two men with knives met on the crest of the current and fought a strange bloodless fight hacking at the bladders because they were larger than the head and the loss of them meant equally certain disablement for there was nothing to be done in that wild stream if they were pricked but to cast them free and diveto dive down and down past the current to come up please god nearer home so because of those watchers on the other side the sitana swimmers could not start openly nor from the same place they went singly silently but the next morning ere the light came fully they would all be resting together on the steps of the little mosque unless indeed some of them had not returned were in fact to return no more and the worshippers would be crowding round one or two perhaps while the others looked on enviously to hear how some traveller had been happened upon and done to death in the dark upon the undulating tract of low jungle on the other side then the worshippers going home would say casually in their houses hussan killed his man last night that makes him two ahead of husayn and ahmad the new one hath another so that brings him next to husayn who will need to work hard and the women would gossip about it among themselves and say that of course miriam the villagebeauty would choose the best swimmer when the time came for the curious choice which is allowed the pathan girl among lovers whom she is supposed never to have seen as yet however miriam had only laughed and thrown handfuls of yellow corn into the gutter and said things to the aspirants female relations which were sure to be repeated and make the rivalry run fiercer than ever she did all this partly because of the big shepherd partly because it was good for the faith to stimulate the young mens courage but mostly because it amused her it was far however from having that effect on the englishman who was responsible for the reputation of the district over the water the more so because his name happened to be john nicholson and john nicholson was not a man to allow any increase of crime within his borders without knowing the reason why and meting out punishment for the offence what the deuce does it mean he said to the trembling native official in charge of that particular portion of the country which lay over against sitana there have been twenty murders this quarter against ten in the last and i told you that for every man killed on our side there were to be two in sitana what on earth are your swimmers about if they are not so good as theirs get others get something there must be some fault on your part or they wouldnt cock their tails up in this way remedy it that is what you have got to do so dont ask questions as to how it is to be done ill back you up never fear and then he took his telescope out as he sat on his horse among the low bushes down by the rushing river and prospected before he galloped off neck or nothing as his fashion was to regain his camp thirty miles away and write an urgent letter to government detailing fully the measures which he intended to adopt for the repression of these scandalous crimes but even a telescope did not show him miriams face as she sat spinning in the courtyard and the rest of the long low flatroofed village clinging to the shaly slope seemed very much at its usual that is to say the commonplace nest of as uncommon a set of religious scoundrels as could be found north or south so he told himself that they must have been strengthened lately by a new contingent of fanatics from the plains or that the approaching mohurrumtide had raised their religious fervour to boilingpoint he allowed these reasons to himself though he permitted none to his subordinate but neither he nor the scared police inspector dreamed of that laughing girls face over the water which was the cause of hussan and husayns unusual activity still as he gathered his reins into his left hand he paused to give a more kindly look from under his dark eyebrows at the inspectors knockknees why dont you get some of their swimmers he asked curtly i could doubtless he could he was a man who got most things which he set himself to get yet even he might have failed here but for that girls face that handful of yellow indian corn and the fierce fight which followed for both between those two hussan and husayn who as they were finally held back from each other by soothing friendly hands felt that the end was nigh if it had not already come brothers of the same belieffellowworkers in that stream of deathfirst and second alternately in the great race for mens lives they knew that the time had come when they must be at each others throat and settle which was to be best once and for allwhich was to be best in miriams eyes and then to their blind wrath came an authoritative voice the voice of the holiest man there the syyud ahmad whom to disobey was to be accursed there is too much of this brawling came the fiat tis a disgrace lo hussan husayn here among the elders swear before the lord to have done with it swear that neither will raise hand again against a hand that fights for the same cause swear both of you a chorus of approval came from the bystanders as those two thus checked stood glaring at each other there were a few grains of the yellow indian corn still in the gutter at their feet and they looked at them as they swore never again to raise a hand against one fighting the good fight that same day at dusk hussan and husayn sat on the edge of the stream their feet almost touching the water their skinbladders beside them their sharp knives hung in a sheath round their necks their bronze muscles shone even in the growing gloom from head to foot they were lithe strong graceful in their very strength they sat close to each other as they had often sat before looking out over the tumbling rush of the wild current to the other side of the river yea then i will go forth tonight as thou sayest hussan and when i return equal we will draw lots which is to take service on the other side so be it husayn i will wait for thee and see if thou couldst kill one of their swimmers twere better then will it be easier to get his place hit up brother from the water tis more deadly than the downward stroke and as they sat side by side speaking quietly almost indifferently the evening call to prayer rang out over the wild wicked stream and without another word they faced round from the river to the western hills the parapet of miriams house stood out higher than the rest of the village perhaps they made it the kaaba of their prayers though they were orthodox enough in their genuflexions hussan and husayn have been made by the pir sahib to swear they will not fight any more said a girl who giggled as she spoke to miriam when they were coming back with their waterpots from the river loh there be plenty others who will answered the round sweet voice that had not yet come to its full sweetness and roundness they are all like fightingcocks except the shepherds belike tis the sheep which make them peaceful so they have time to laugh hussan and husayn are ever breathless from some struggle i would not be as they lazybones retorted the giggler thy motherinlaw will need her tongue thy waterpot is but halffull even now still it is heavy enough for my arms replied the sweet voice indifferently yet sharply and the river is far then it added inconsequently but there are streams up in the hills that folk can guide to their doors and the grass grows soft too here is nothing but stones i hate them they are so hard and the big shepherds mother is dead put in another girl pertly whereat the rest giggled louder than ever was it hussan or husayn who three days afterwards appeared suddenly before the districtofficer in camp with a nicely written petition on a regulation sheet of englishmade paper requesting that he might be put on as a swimming patrol on the river opposite sitana in place of one who was supposed to have been killed or drowned there is no need to know no need to know which it was who won the toss when husayn came back with a smile to say that so far they were quits and might begin a new game whichever it was john nicholson looked at the lean bronze thews and sinews approvingly and then asked the one crucial question can you the man smiled a quick broad smile none better huzoor on the indus there is one over the water who deems himself my match god knows if he is john nicholson who had bent over his writing again glanced up hastily so that is it here moonshee write an order to the man at khanpur to put this man on at once he was back at his writing almost before the order was ended and in the silence which followed under the white wings of the tent set wide to all the winds of heaven the sound of two pens could be heard one was the englishmans writing a report to headquarters saying that the increase of crime must be checked by reprisals the other the natives bidding the inspector put on the bearer as a government swimmer for signature huzoor came a deferential voice and the stillbusy pen shifted itself to the shiny paper laid beside it and the dark keen kindly eyes looked up once more for half a second well good luck to you i hope youll kill him whoever he is by the help of god huzoor by the help of god which was it hussan or husayn who in the growing dusk walked up and down the shaly glacis below the long cluster of sitana watching the opposite bank with the eyes of a lynx for each stone of vantage each shallow whence a few yards start might be gained which was it husayn or hussan who in the same dusk paced up and down the low bank on the other side watching in his turn with untiring eyes for the quicker curve of the current where a bold swimmer might by one swift venture drift down faster to the calmer water and so have a second or two in which to regain breath ere the fight began what matters it whether the panther was on the western bank and the leopard on the eastern they were two wild beasts pacing up and down up and down with their feet upon the waters edge up and down up and down even when the moon rose and their shadows showed more distinctly than they did themselves for the oil upon their limbs caught the light keenly like the glistening shale and the glistening wet sand at their feet up and down up and down they paced in the stillness and the peace with only the noise of the rushing river slumberously monotonously insistent up and down up and down till the cry of the muazzim at dawn came echoing over the water prayer is more than sleep prayer is more than sleep ay more even than sleeplessness with sheer murder in heart and brain so peace fell between those two while they turned towards mecca and prayed for what god knows perhaps once more the real spiritual kaaba was what they saw with the eyes of the flesh that flatroofed house just beginning to blush rosy in the earliest rays of the rising sun more probably it was not since they had passed through love to hatred and then prayers over murder was over also for the time since they could not court detection by daylight they are wondrous keen on the other side despite the moon said the elders of the village and the officials over the way alike but there is no fear our watchman will be taken at a disadvantage he is there from dusk till dawn ay replied wiseacres on either side but when the moon wanes what then it came even before that came with a great purple mass of thunderclouds making the black mountain beyond the mahaban deserve its name and drawing two pair of eyes one on either side of the stream into giving hopeful glances at the slow majestic march of gloom across the sky it was dusk an hour sooner dawn an hour later than usual that night and day so there was plenty of time for sheer murder before prayertime and as there was no storm no thunder after all but only the heavy clouds hanging like a curtain over the moon a faint splash into the rushing river might have been heard some time in the night followed by another then after a while a cry broke the brooding silence above the hurrying whisper below the cry of faith and fate and fight allahhoakhbar allahhohukk perhaps it was the muazzim again proclaiming out of due time that god is might and right or maybe it was those two swimmers in the river as they caught sight of each other in the whirling water if so hussan struck upwards from the water no doubt and husayn mindful of advice followed suit and so the six black heads must have gone drifting down stream peacefully save for the hatred in the two faces glaring at each other since the river hid their blows decorously but there was no trace of them on it far or near when the sun rose over the eastern hills and the big shepherd singing a guttural lovesong came leaping down the stony path towards sitana with a bunch of red rhododendrons behind his ear some days afterwards however the native official at the police station rode over to see his superior and reported with a smirk that he had seen through the telescope a great weeping and wailing at sitana two of their swimmers had apparently been killed in fair fight for their bodies had been brought up for burial from the backwater further down the river and as the new man whom the huzoor had appointed had either absconded or been killed also that just made the proportion what his honour had laid down for future guidance two to one hm said john nicholson half to himself i wonder which of the two was really the better man the fakeers drum o most almighty wictoria vr reg britannicorum vi kaiserihind please admit bearer to privileges of praising god on the little drum as occasion befitteth and your petitioner will ever pray etc it was written on a scrap of foreign paper duly stamped as a petition and it did not need the interpolation of imperial titles to prove that this was not by any means its first appearance in court to be plain it had an ancient and a fishlike smell suggestive of many years acquaintance with dirty humanity i looked at the man who had presented ita very ordinary fakeer standing with hands folded humblyand was struck by the wistful expectancy in his face it was at once hopeful yet hopeless turning to the courtreader for explanation i found a decorous smile flowing round the circle of squatting clerks it was evidently an oldestablished joke he is damnably noiseful man sir remarked my sarishtidar cheerfully and his place of sitting close to deputycommissioners bungalow thus european officers object so it is always namunzoor refused the sound of the familiar formula drove the hope from the old mans face his thin shoulders seemed to droop but he said nothing how long has this been going on i asked fourteen years sir always on transference of officers and it is always namunzoor he dipped his pen in the ink gave it the premonitory flick munzoor granted said i in a sudden decision munzoor during the term of my office that was but a month i was only a locum tenens during leave only a month and the poor old beggar had waited fourteen years to praise god on the little drum the pathos and bathos of it hit me hard but a stare of infinite surprise had replaced the circumambient smile the fakeer himself seemed flabbergasted i think he felt lost without his petition for i saw him fumbling in his pocket as the janissaries hustled him out of court as janissaries love to do east or west that night as i was wondering if i had smoked enough and yawned enough to make sleep possible in a hundred degrees of heat and a hundred million mosquitoes i was suddenly reminded of the proverb charity begins at home it had with a vengeance i had thought my sarishtidars language a trifle too picturesque now i recognised its supreme accuracy the fakeer was a damnably noiseful man it is useless trying to add one iota to this description especially to those unacquainted with the torture of an indian drum by dawn i was in the saddle glad to escape from my own house and the ceaseless rumpatumtum which was driving me crazy when i returned the old man was awaiting me in the verandah his face full of a great content and the desire to murder him which rose up in me with the thought of the twentynine nights yet to come faded before it perfect happiness is not the lot of many but apparently it was his he salaamed down to the ground huzoor he said the great joy in me created a disturbance last night it will not occur again the protector of the poor shall sleep in peace even though his slave praises god for him all night long the almighty does not require a loud drum i said i was glad to hear it and my selfcomplacency grew until i laid my head on the pillow somewhat earlier than usual then i became aware of a faint throbbing in the air like that which follows a deep organ notea throbbing which found its way into the drum of my ear and remained thereso faint that it kept me on the rack to know if it had stopped or was still going on rumpatumtumtum rumpatumtumtum rumpa even now the impulse to make the hateful rhythm interminable seizes on me i have to lay aside my pen and take a new one before going on i draw a veil over the mental struggle which followed it would have been quite easy to rescind my permission but the thought of one month versus fourteen years roused my pride as representative of the almighty wictoria reg britannicorum etc i had admitted this man to the privileges of praising god on the little drum and there was an end of it but the effort left my nerves shattered with the strain put on them it was the middle of the hot weatherthat awful fortnight before the rains breaki was youngabsolutely alone every morning as i rode a perfect wreck past the fakeers hovel by the gate he used to ask me if i had slept well and i lied to him what was the use of suffering if no one was the happier for it at last one eveningit was the twentyfirst i remember for i ticked them off on a calendar like any schoolboyi sat out among the oleanders knowing that sleep was mine the rains had broken a cool wind stirred the dripping trees the fever of unrest was over clouds of winged white ants besieged the lamp what wonder when the rafters of the old bungalow were riddled almost beyond the limits of safety by their galleries but what did i care i was going to sleep and so i did like a child until close on the dawn and thenby heavens it was too bad in the verandah surely not faint but loudly imperative rumpatumtumtum i was out of bed in an instant full of fury the fiend incarnate must be walking round the house i was after him in the moonlight not a sign the white oleanders were shining in the dark foliage a firefly or twonothing more rumpatumtumtum fainter this time round the corner not there rumpatumtumtum a mere whisper now but loud enough to be traced so on the track i was round the house to the verandah whence i had started no signno sound gracious what was that a crash a thud a roar and rattle of earth the house the roof when by the growing light of dawn we inspected the damage we found the biggest rafter of all lying right across the pillow where my head had been two minutes before the first sunbeams were on the still sparkling trees when full of curiosity i strolled over to the fakeers hut it also was a heap of ruins and when we dug the old man out from among the antriddled rafters the doctor said he had been dead for many hours this story may seem strange to some others will agree with my sarishtidar who after spending the morning over a johnsons dictionary and a revenue report informed me that such catastrophes are but too common in this unhappy land after heavy rain following on longcontinued drought at her beck and call what is your name i asked phoolijan huzoor she answered with a brilliant dazzling smile i sat looking at her wondering if a more appropriate name could have been found for that figure among the anemones and celandines the primulas pansies and pinksthe thousandandone blossoms which glowing against their groundwork of forgetmenot formed a jewelmosaic right to the foot of the snows above us flowerful life truly that was hers she had a great bunch of scarlet rhododendron stuck behind her ear matching the cloth cap perched jauntily on her head and as she sat herding her buffaloes on the upland she had threaded chaplet on chaplet of oxeyed daisies and hung them about her wherever they could be hung the result was distinctly flowerful her face also was distinctly pretty distinctly clean for a kashmiri girls but coquette flirt minx was written in every line of it and accounted for a most unusual neatness and brightness she caught my eye and smiled again broadly innocently the huzoor would like to paint my picture wouldnt he she went on in a tone of certainty the sahib who came last year gave me five rupees i will take six this year food is dear and those baseborn contractors of the maharajah seize everythingone walnut in ten one chicken in ten but i was not going to be beguiled into the old complaints i could hear any and every day from the hags of the village up here on the murg within a stonesthrow of the first patch of snow picketing the outskirts of the great glacier of gwashbrari i liked if possible to forget how vile man could be in the little shingle huts clustering below by the river i will not describe the place to begin with it defies description and next could i even hint at its surpassing beauty the globetrotter would come and defile it it is sufficient to say that a murg is an upland meadow or alp and that this one with its forgetmenots and sparkling glaciers was like a turquoise set in diamonds i had seated myself on a projecting spur whence i could sketch a frowning defile northwards down which the emeraldgreen river was dashing madly among huge rocks crowned by pinetrees i will give five rupees also that is plenty i remarked suavely and phoolijan smiled again it must do for i like being painted only a few sahibs come very few but whenever they see me they want to paint me and the flowers and it makes the other girls in the village angry then goloo and chuchchu here she went off into a perfect cascade of smiles and began to pull the eyelashes off the daisies deliberately there seems a peculiar temptation in girlhood for cruelty towards flowers all over the world and phoolijan was preeminently girlish she looked eighteen but i doubt if she was really more than sixteen even so it was odd to find her unappropriated so i inquired if goloo or chuchchu was the happy man my mother is a widow she replied without the least hesitation it depends which will pay the most for we are poor there are others too so there is no hurry they are at my beck and call she crooked her forefinger and nodded her head as if beckoning to some one for sheer lighthearted innocent enjoyment of her own attraction i never saw the equal of that face i should have made my fortune if i could have painted it there in the blazing sunlight framed in flowers but it was too much for me therefore i asked her to move to the right further along the promontory so that i could put her in the foreground of the picture i had already begun there by that first clump of iris i said pointing to a patch of green swordleaves where the white and lilac blossoms were beginning to show she gave a perceptible shudder what sit on a grave not i does not the huzoor know that those are graves it is true all our people are buried here we plant the iris over them always if you ask why i know not it is the flower of death a sudden determination to paint her the flowerful life against the flowerful death completely obliterated the knowledge of my own incompetence but i urged and bribed in vain phoolijan would not stir she would not even let me pick a handful of the flowers for her to hold it was unlucky besides one never knew what one might find in the thickets of leavesbones and horrid things had i never heard that dead people got tired of their graves and tried to get out even if they only wanted something in their graves they would stretch forth a hand to get it that was one reason why people covered them up with flowersjust to make them more contented the idea of stooping to cull a flower and shaking hands with a corpse was distinctly unpleasant even in the sunlight so i gave up the point and began to sketch the girl as she sat rather a difficult task for she chattered incessantly did i see that thin blue thread of smoke in the dark pall of pinetrees covering the bottom of the valley that was goloos fire he was drying orris root for the maharajah there on the opposite murg where the buffaloes showed dark among the flowers was chuchchus hut undoubtedly chuchchu was the richer but goloo could climb like an ibex it was he whom the huzoor was going to take as a guide to the peak he could dance too the huzoor should see him dance the circle dance round the fireno one turned so slowly as goloo he would not frighten a young lamb except when he was angrywell jealous if the huzoor thought that a better word by the time she had done chattering there was not a petal left on the oxeyed daisies and i was divided between pity and envy towards goloo and chuchchu that evening as usual i set my painting to dry on the easel at the door of the tent as i lounged by the camp fire smoking my pipe a big young man coming in with a jar of buffalo milk on his shoulder and a big bunch of red rhododendron behind his ear stopped and grinned at my caricature of phoolijan five minutes after down by the servants encampment i heard a free fight going on and strolled over to see what was the matter after the manner of kashmiri quarrels it had ended almost as it began for the race love peace that it had so ended was not however i saw at a glance the fault of the smaller of the antagonists who was being forcibly held back by my shikari chuchchu that man there wanted to charge goloo this man here the same price for milk as he does your honour explained the shikari elaborately that was extortionate even though goloo being the huzoors guide for tomorrow may be said to be your honours servant for the time i have settled the matter justly the huzoor need not give thought to it i looked at the two recipients of phoolijans favour with interestfor that the bunches of red rhododendron they both wore were her gift i did not doubt they were both fine young men but goloo was distinctly the betterlooking of the two if a trifle sinister despite the recommendation of my shikari to cast thought aside the incident lingered in my memory and i mentioned it to phoolijan when on returning to finish my sketch i found her waiting for me among the flowers her smile was more brilliant than ever they will not hurt each other she said chuchchu knows that goloo is more active and goloo knows that chuchchu is stronger it is like the dogs in our village i was not thinking of them i replied i was thinking of you supposing they were to quarrel with you she laughed they will not quarrel in summer time there are plenty of flowers for everybody i thought of those red rhododendrons and could not repress a smile at her barefaced wisdom of the serpent and in the winter time then i will marry one of them or some one i have only to choose that is all they are at my beck and call three years passed before recurring leave enabled me to pay another visit to the murg the rhododendrons were once more on the uplands and as i turned the last corner of the pineset path which threaded its way through the defile i saw the meadow before me with its mosaic of flowers bright as ever the memory of phoolijan came back to me as she had sat in the sunshine nodding and beckoning phoolijan echoed the old patriarch who came out to welcome me as i crossed the plank bridge to the village phoolijan the herdgirl huzoor she is dead she died from picking flowers a vain thing it was at the turn beyond the murg huzoor halfway between chuchchus hut and goloos drying stage there is a big rhododendron tree hanging over the cliff and she must have fallen down it is three years gone three years then it must have happened almost immediately after i left the valley the idea upset me i knew not why the murg without that flowerful life nodding and beckoning felt empty and i found myself wondering if indeed the girl had fallen down or if she had played with flowers too recklessly and one of her lovers perhaps both it was an idea which dimmed the sunshine and i was glad that i had arranged not to remain for the night but to push on to another meadow some six miles farther up the river to do so however i required a fresh relay of coolies and while my shikari was arranging for this in the village i made my way by a crosscut to the promontory with its patches of iris deaths are rare in these small communities and there were but two or three new gravesall but one too recent to be poor phoolijans that then must be hers with its still clearly denned oblong of iris already a mass of pale purple and white i sat down on a rock and began unromantically to eat my lunch finishing up with a pull at my flask and thus providentially fortified i stooped ere leaving to pick one or two of the blossoms from the grave intending to paint them round the sketch of the girls head which i had with me great heavens what was that i turned positively sick with horror and doubt was it a hand it was some time before i could force myself to set aside the sheathing leaves and settle the point something it was something which even as i parted the stems fell to pieces as the skeleton of a beckoning hand might have done i did not stay to see more i let the flowers close over itwhatever it wasand made my way back to the village my baggage having changed shoulders was streaming out over the plank bridge again and in the two first bearers carrying my cookroom pots and pans i recognised goloo and chuchchu they had both grown stouter and wore huge bunches of red rhododendron behind their ears i found out on inquiry that they were both married and had become bosom friends i have not seen the turquoise set in diamonds since but i often think of it and wonder what it was i saw among the iris and then i seem to see phoolijan sitting among the flowers nodding her head and saying they are at my beck and call if i were goloo or chuchchu i would be buried somewhere else music hath charms footnote copyright by macmillan co it was the very last place in the world where you would have expected to hear the notes of a church harmonium and the old man who seated on a reed stool was playing god save the queen with one finger was the very last person whom you would have expected to see performing upon it but there it stood quite at home between the wooden pillars which divided the central livingroom from the crowd of latticed closets around it and there he sat quite at home on the stool his naked brown legs struggling with the bellows his brown fingers patting down the keys with a sort of pompous precision for punoo was a musicmaster and that was his pupil who with a yawn was watching his proceedings from the floor while she threaded beads on a string intermittently that was also the last place from which one would expect any one to take a musiclesson but old punoo being blind was fully persuaded that bahani was dutifully at his elbow this blindness of his was however far more to his advantage than his disadvantage as a master it was in short the cause of his being one at all since had he had the use of his eyes no mother would have dreamed of employing a man who was not more than fortyfive at the outside in teaching her girls as it was his time was fully taken up in the houses of the clerks contractors barristers and such like who for some reason or another desired to impart the exotic accomplishment of music to their daughters or wives but of all these houses punoo loved the one which contained the harmonium best not because of his pupil since bahani who was betrothed to a young man who might be seen any day on a hammersmith omnibus over on the other side of the world never learned anything but because of the instrument itself to tell truth it had quite a fine tone especially when all the wind in its wheezy bellows was sent into one note and then the playing of it seemed to satisfy him from head to foot all the other instruments the accordions and concertinas even his own fiddle with seven strings of which he was really very fond only employed his head and his hands but this made his whole body as it were to toil and labour after melody as he sat his forehead bedewed with perspiration the expression on his sightless face turned upwards all unconscious of the dingy sordid smokeblackened rafters which limited his vision was quite sufficient to make up for the lack of it in the music it was the expression of a prisoner who through the bars of a cage sees freedom but the odd little gridiron in the centre of the dark room which gave it some light and air from the roof above was scarcely large enough to allow even of punoos wizened figure to pass through lo it gives one a melting of the liver and a sinking of the heart to hear thee masterjee remarked mai kishnu bustling in with a handful of radishes for the picklestew canst not play something more lively something that goes not wombling up and down like an illgreased wheel something with a count in it that gives a body time to catch the beat of it for sure i could make better music with my ladle and tray better music for a bride anyhow and mark my word bahani when thou art really one there shall be none of this boohooing and owwowing that might set free thoughts of wolves and god knows what monsters to damage all thy hopes tis not likely mai said punoo desisting to speak with great dignity that bahani will have mastered so much tis not given to all to play god save the queen as i do that is good hearing ejaculated the housemother piously but the girl gets on i hope master punoo her father writes of it often and the instrument as thou knowest cost fully ten shillings in punoos account which he retailed to his other customers it had cost five times that amount and he had a spirited description of the auction where colonels and deputysahibs and barrackmasters had bidden in vain against bahanis father mool chand who was municipal clerk in an outlying district according to punoo also it had cost five hundred times that amount when the padre sahibsometimes it was the lord padre sahibthe bishophad sent for it originally from england there was a further legend vague and misty even to himself which he kept holy as it were from profane use by locking it away in his own breast which hinted that the harmonium had been thrown on the market from no desire to get rid of it but simply from pecuniary necessity the chaplain having been forced into selling his greatest treasure in order to pay the bill for a new one to tell truth punoos estimate of the harmonium was vague and misty on more points than this he was in fact absolutely ignorant of anything concerning it save that if you blew persistently at the bellows and pressed the keys it made a noise which somehow or other seemed to set you free and yet kept you longing for something more punoo knew not for what having not the slightest idea that he had been born with music in his soul and that if he had first seen the light in the western hemisphere instead of the eastern he would most likely have been a wagnerite or some other kind of musical enthusiast as it was to oblige mai kishnu he played minnia punnieya as quickly as he could though it was a pain and grief to him to give up the longdrawn notes which sounded so beautiful in god save our gracious queen but mai kishnu stirred the picklestew to the new rhythm emphasising it properly with little strokes of the ladle upon the resounding brass pot bahani she said must learn that tune against her mans return from being made into a balester barrister whereat bahani with the utmost decorum giggled and blushed over her beads she was a pretty pert girl who looked upon the future with perfect serenity for being married to her first cousin whose widowed mother lived in the house she knew exactly what the amount of friction between her and her future motherinlaw would be and knew also that she would generally be able to escape quietly as she did now from the scene of conflict and leave the two elder women to have it out at full length if they chose they generally did choose because they nearly always had an interested audience for the quaint rambling old house with its rabbitwarren of tiny rooms opening out to little bits of roof was full of relations chiefly women whose husbands were away in government employ they each had a separate lodging as it were though they were quite as often in some one elses room as in their own especially when the sound of shrill altercation echoed through the wooden partitions by a recognised etiquette however all serious disputes were carried on in the wellroom where the women bathed it was more a verandah than a room though the arches were filled up breasthigh with a screening wall but through the hole in the floor above which the windlass stood you could not only see right down into the well on the basement story but also see the people in the street coming for their water it was when bahani was discovered lying flat on the floor so as to crane over and peep into the very street itself that the fiercest quarrels arose between mai kishnu and her widowed sisterinlaw and no quarrel ever ran its course without a reference of some sort to the harmonium and the iniquity and idiotcy of learning to play tunes as if you were a bad woman in the bazaar in her heart of hearts mai kishnu agreed with this view of the question but she would sooner have died than confess it so she invariably carried the war into the enemys country instead by insisting on it that bahani learned in deference to the oftexpressed desire of her lawful husband that husband being the complainants own son and sometimes but not often for she was a faithful defender of the absent municipal clerk she would clinch the matter by telling her sisterinlaw that if there was iniquity or idiotcy about her brother was also to blame whereupon radha who being the widow of an elder brother really was in a way the head of the house would retort that in that case it was all the more necessary for the womenfolk of the family to remember that the salvation of souls lay with them so she would beg to remind all present that this being a dark saturday or a light friday with some particular event in prospect or some particular event in the past it behoved no pious women of that family to eat say radishes on that day now when you have just spent much time and skill in the preparing of pickles for a large household it is aggravating to be told that it is an impious diet still there was always the obvious retort that on such days widows ate nothing at all so then radha with pharisaical acquiescence would retire to her own little bit of a room with her husbands photograph he had been a clerk also hung between two german prints of the madonna and herodias daughter which did duty respectively for the infant krishna and durga devi slaying the demons and begin counting her beads with a clatter and repeating her texts in an aggressively loud voice while mai kishnu after sending the picklestew of radishes down in the windowbasket as an alms to the first beggar in the street would begin to cook something else something as nasty as her deft hands could make it since this oddly enough relieved her feelings but punoo would go on playing god save our gracious queen on the old harmonium with perfect serenity all unconscious of the fact that two women were cursing it in their hearts as a malevolent demon bent on ruining the household it was a quaint household when all was said and done this colony of women whose husbands were for the most part away serving the government in remote stations quaintest of all it was perhaps when in the afternoon the boys belonging to it and there were many thank heaven despite the demon came home from school embryo clerks full of classes and examinations yet with a word or two for crickets and a desire for pickled radishes on every day in the calendar ask your aunt radha mai kishnu would say shortly to their remonstrances over the nasty substitute for the delicacy twas she forced me into giving your stomachsful of my best pickles to some dirty beast of a beggar in the street god forgive me if he was a holy man but he may have been a mohammedan for all i know and what good will that do to my soul but despite the crickets and the examinations despite the vague leavening of western freethought the boys fought shy of their aunt radha perhaps from the veil of uncertainty which their education was necessarily throwing over all things there were so many ideas and one must be right it might be this one in a way they were more afraid of her and her views than mai kishnu was who never doubted at all but then mai kishnu knew that she could always have the upper hand over her sisterinlaw in the matter of cold baths in the winter mornings for radha thought twice about interfering with the beams in other folks eyes when the mote of her own about warm water for religious ablutions was ready to her adversarys hand the boys however though they ate the nasty substitute for pickles without more ado were not so biddable in the matter of god save the queen as they sat on the dark flight of steps between the livingroom and the wellverandah they used to pipe away at it in english in the oddest falsetto and bahani who was a bit of a tomboy would imitate them and then go into fits of shrill laughter at her own gibberish altogether it was a very quaint household and it was a very quaint noise indeed which went up to high heaven from it the boys voices bahanis mocking laugh radhas muttered texts mai kishnus vexed clattering of her ladles and pots and blind punoos perspiring efforts after melody on the old harmonium for he never attempted harmony that was beyond his selftaught execution altogether but the sense of it was there showing itself in sheer delight at pulling out all the stops that still existed and blowing away till he could no more from sheer exhaustion so the years had passed contentedly enough for every one especially for the old musicmaster who every day went away with the unleavened cake which was his only fee knowing that even such payment was in excess of his desires since it was enough for him to have the honour and glory of playing on the harmonium and of boasting about his proficiency on that instrument to his other pupils who were forced to be content with an accordion or some such ignoble instrument and then one day the funny old rambling house was in a perfect ferment of preparation and even radhas face was beaming for her son was coming home he was coming from the hammersmith omnibus and the boardinghouse in notting hill coming from the rush and roar of london to take up the threads of life again in the dark latticed rooms where mai kishnu made pickles and his mother said her prayers above all where bahani waited for him all dyed with turmeric and henna and clothed in tinselled garments the little household temple up on the roof where there were more german prints doing duty as various gods and goddesses had scarcely an instants respite from the multitudinous rituals and if there was a minute or two to spare the women downstairs were sure to remember something else which if left undone would bring the most direful misfortune on the young couple there was no quarrelling now only a babel of shrill kindly voices and there was no music save of a kind to which mai kishnu could clatter her ladles and pans drubbings of drums and endless tinklings of sutarasfor the good lady had set her foot down as regards the harmonium even to the extent of showing off bahanis accomplishment accomplishment forsooth what need was there of such fools talk between a newlymet young couple and though gunesha had come back from the other side of the world dressed like a real sahib that did not prevent his being a young man and knowing a pretty bride when he saw one so thank heaven there they were at last in the pleasant cool upper room on the roof which had been all newly whitewashed and painted and strewn with flowers for the auspicious occasion looking into each others eyes as young people should it was all so proper so touching so infinitely satisfactory that for once kishnu and radha fell on each others necks and wept tears of sympathy but punoo wandered in and out as a privileged guest among the merrymaking and the bustle sidling up to his closed treasure feeling it all over in sightless fashion and longing for the time when he should be called upon as the brides master to display her accomplishment for by this time she could play minnia punnieya and a few other tunes quite correctly but the days passed and those two on the roof despite music and culture despite all the sciences and all the ologies were quite content with those things which had contented their fathers and mothers before them it was not so with old punoo even his fiddle afforded him no comfort and though his other pupils accordions and concertinas gave him the correct musical intervals which his ear approved instinctively but which his hand was too unpractised to reproduce with the accuracy which satisfied him they were poor substitutes for that splendid tone which was born of vehement pumping and perspiration perhaps it was really the latter he craved that feeling of labouring body and soul to give expression to something within him even billing and cooing like a couple of pigeons on the roof however must come to an end and after some three weeks of it the barrister one day discovered that there was a harmonium in the dark arches of the livingroom he was beginning by this time to think that he had perhaps drifted a little too far back into the old life and that as he had every intention when this first very natural and inevitable relapse was over of setting up house on more civilised lines it might be as well to show off his new habits a little and so emphasise the difference which he meant to draw between his life and the life led in the quaint old ancestral house so without more ado without any asking of how it came there or who played on it he whisked his coattails for he had resumed european dress on his descent from the roof over the musicstool with the consummate air of a performer and set his feet to the pedals and his hands to the keys what a wheezy old thing he cried when a sort of agonised moo as from a sick cow came in response bahani standing decorously in the shadow with her veil down in most alluring bashfulness tittered and old punoo who had stood still in sheer surprise moved forward with a superior smile the barrister heard and saw and a frown came to his selfsatisfied face the bellows are leaking he cried again but never mind it shall do something ill make it something indeed the women giggled and stopped their ears but old punoo stood transfixed a great pain a great joy coming to his sightless face was that the harmonium was that god save the queen that paeon of melody and harmony together coming in great waves of sound and bearing him away further and further and further into some unknown land that was yet a land of promise and all these years he had lived in ignorance he had boasted he had said that he could play it his priceless treasure priceless ay he had been right there listen to it was it not priceless a sort of passion of pride surged up in him overpowering all thought of himself then there was a loud crack a wheeze a sudden silence and the barrister stood up wiping his forehead for he had worked hard that has done for the old thing he said with a laugh but it was past work anyhow and i prefer a piano any day of the week dont stand in the corner bahani you must learn to behave like an english lady now and there is nothing to be ashamed of in your husband i assure you mai kishnu and radha looked at each other as if for support and the vague affright and sheer surprise of their faces made them once more sympathetic it is a new world sister whispered the one to the other as they moved off respectively to their prayers and their pickles leaving the barrister making love to his bride over the prospect of the piano he was going to give her but punoo moved softly blindly over to his old seat and set his feet to the pedals and his fingers to the keys but no sound came from them not even that poor travesty of god save the queen which had once filled him with pride and as he sat fingering the dumb keys idly a dim content that it should be so came into the old musicians soul the swansong had been beautiful but it had been a song of death he after all had known the harmonium best
