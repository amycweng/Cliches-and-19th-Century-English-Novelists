sovereignty of air xxv secret despatches xxvi fair odds prologue the new year was already some hours old but the world to which it had come was still dark dark with a curious obscurity that was absolutely opaque yet faintly luminous because of the white fog which lay on all things and hid them from the stars for the sky above was clear cold almost frosty that was why the fog born not of cool vapour seeking for cloud life among the winds of heaven but of hot smoke loving the warmth of dust and ashes clung so closely to the earth to its birthplace it was an acrid bitter smoke not even due to the dead hearthfires of a dead day since theylike all else pertaining to the domestic life of indiagive small outward sign of existence but to the smouldering piles of litter and refuse which are lit every evening upon the outskirts of human habitation dull heaps with a minimum of fire a maximum of smoke where the humanity which has produced the litter the refuse gathers for gossip or for warmth even in the fields beyond the multitude of men where some longlimbed peasant watching his hope of harvest dozes by a solitary fire this same smoke rises in a solid column untilbeaten down by the colder moister air aboveit drifts sideways to spread like a vast cobweb over the dewset carpet of green corn so it was small wonder if here at nushapore with its fifty thousand and odd dwellers in cantonments its two hundred and odd thousand dwellers in the town the smoke fog hid earth from heaven hid even the steady coming of day for it was close on dawn the most silent most restful hour of an indian night yet one still holding that vague sense of life and movement inseparable from an environment in which there is no set time for sleeping or waking in which folk gossip all night and sleep all day should the humour so take them it had so seized on some one apparently this new years night for two voices rose not in whispers but monotone from one of the verandahs in government houserose insistently until from within the closed doors came a sharp though drowsy order for silence chuprao the voices ceased such orders even when drowsy must be obeyed since they come from the master at any rate till he sleeps again so the minutes slipped by upon the round rim of the level wheatfields beyond the smoke the violet sky above the cobwebs faded to grey at the suns approach the fog round nushapore grew whiter more luminous then the voices began again monotonous insistent were they in oldworld fashion beguiling the reality of darkness with legends of some heroic age of light were they more modernly making that reality darker by taking thought for the morrow and discussing say the depreciation of the rupee or were they dreamers still though wakeful and were they discoursing of equality and the rights of the individual such theories are to be heard nowadays even in this indian smoke fog chuprao you brutes or the threatening voice paused as a dull reverberation shivered through the chill air it was the first gun of the imperial salute which every new years morning proclaims that victoria kaiserihind reigns over the fog and the voices in it now when a hundred and one guns each with its message of mastery stand between a man and his sleep what use is there in commanding silence elsewhere so the threat ceased and between the beats of the guns the voices had their say unchecked about what that is a difficult question to answer when the voices are in the night chapter i the totalisator whats the big blackboard with white sums asked little jerry arbuthnot jack raymond who was holding the childs hand looked down at the sixyearold figure in the natty ridingsuit so like his own save for the racing silk which he himself wore halfhidden by a covert coat it is the map of india he began then pulled up at the sight of jerrys face you shouldnt believe everything youre told young manit hampers the sense of humour no jerry thats the totalisatora calculating machine for doing sums in the compound rules ask miss drummond if it isnt the girl thus challenged let the cool disdain which is nowadays so often the prevailing expression of young womanhood for manhood become slightly more aggressive it is a betting machine gerald dont profane the word miss drummond interrupted the man betting is a bracing mental exercise you back your opinion to be right against fixed odds but this fiverupeeintheslottrustinprovidence business is a demoralising compromise you stand neither to win nor lose then please what does come to the five wupees asked jerry urgently practical boy commented jack raymond with a laugh it is as you was generally for you see jerry the world backs the favourite as a rule it likes to follow a lead and if you divide the total of the tickets by their number its poor fun so take my advice young man when you totalise go for a rank outsider and stand to collar the lot lesley drummond being the childs governess frowned i see your mother arriving gerald she said and we were to join her at once come but jerry held his newfound friend fast by the hand you come too he petitioned my mother is just an orful nice person there was a moments pause during which the childs grip on the man tightened before the latter replied i know that jerry your mother and i are old friends but i have only time to see you safe across the green im up in this race i used to wide waces when i was in india once began the child when lesley cut him short you never rode a race in your life gerald and i cant allow you to say that you have then she turned suddenly in the purely impersonal confidence of grievance to the stranger beside her for they had only just been introduced to each other and said i cant think why but ever since gerald landed in bombay just a week ago he has had a bad habit of claiming to have done all sorts of things he never could have done lady arbuthnot thinks it is because the child really does remember india a little you see he was past four when he went home but that she added magisterially with a frown for the culprit does not excuse telling storiesdoes it the mans blue eyes so curiously overshadowed by thick bushy fair eyebrows sought the childs cool grey ones and a sudden reflection of the perplexed obstinacy he saw in them came to his own how the deuce do you know he hasnt he muttered half to himself this isnt england where you can bet your last dib on certainties then he looked at the immaculate white collar and cuffs of the figure in a tailormade coat and skirt beside him and gave in to convention by adding resignedly but you mustnt tell whackers you know jerrymust you i dont protested the sixyearold i weally thought i had but i will anyhow when im big an ill bet wif the bookies evewy time mr waymond like you do that glance at the collar and cuffs showed guilt in it this time not a bit of it said the conscious sinner stoutly youll be a mighty big swell like your father sir george please they call my daddy his honour the lieutenantgovernor now interrupted jerry and his salute is twentyone whole guns they made an orful booming at the wailway station but i liked it an the twoops pwesented arms to him today at the queens pawadedidnt they miss dwummond of course dear as lieutenantgovernor your father is entitled to these honours replied lesley head in air of course echoed the man beside her making her in her turn glance at him and wonder if contempt or envy brought that odd note to his voice either way she admitted reluctantly he would have carried such honours bravely but then so would have half the englishmen she had seen since landing at bombay the environment of india had a trick of giving an air of distinction to the anglosaxon radical as she was inevitably seeing that she had led the life of a definitely independent woman in england for six years she felt a sneaking satisfaction as she walked across the enclosure with the tall spare man whose haggard face looked still more haggard above his gay racing colours the afternoon sun sent blueblack shadows behind them the golden glory in front of them lay lavishly on the shifting kaleidoscope of manyhued dresses to one side the pipers of a highland regiment strutted their floating tartans through a pibroch to the other rose white messtents decorated with flowers and bunting each centring its knot of crowding colourful guests but the densest most colourful crowd gathered round the totalisator which stood between the first and secondclass enclosures so that the sergeants in uniform could attend at the same time to both its fiverupee board fronting the grand stand and its onerupee board giving on the mixed multitude could attend even to the slender dark hands which sometimes stretched over the barrier with five rupees in their palms and a petition to be allowed the higher stake hands unable to grasp the fact that five lesser gains may equal one greater gain an inability provocative of much needless discontent all over the world lesley drummonds eyes as she walked across the lawn grew dazzled at the unusual glitter and colour of the crowd her ears grew confused by the gamut of civilisation struck by the varying costumes there was the first note of western influence in a pair of patentleather shoes yonder the last echo of the east in a white turban above a frock coat its a queer crowd said jack raymond suddenly as if in explanation of her look and i could tell you a lot of queer tales that man for instancehe nodded after a burly figure in a tinsel biretta which had just thrust a flabby waxen hand at him with a liquid persian compliment on the new yearis the biggest brute in india a delhi pensioner by rights but he does buckingham here to the rightful heir that young sweep to the left in cloth of gold rightful heir echoed lesley captiously rightful heir to what angloindians in her limited experience oscillated between supposing her crassly ignorant or absolutely omniscient and either treatment annoyed her for she was accustomed to consider herself and be considered thoroughly well informed the whole caboodle replied jack raymond tolerantly you see there were kings in nushapore i know that of course she interrupted impatiently but do they still claim great moses claim nushapore is a vox clamavi chiefly to mutiny pensions which being mortgaged up to the hilt are of no use to any one but the usurers but they will generally lend the bankrupts enough for the entrancefee to the races so of course they come here in crowds why asked the girl feeling herself a mere mark of interrogation its a change from betting on cocks and kites besides theres the position what position she asked with a prayer for patience he laughed easily all races are equal on a course miss drummond and a racecourse is practically the only place where the native meets us on equal terms look theres the biggest brute in asia elbowing mrs memberoftheboard collins at the totalisator if he tried it on elsewhere some one would kick him and quite right too lesleys disdain became active though she told herself the remark was only to be expected from that type of man may i ask why she said superbly because it is contrary to his own estimate of the proprieties and it is impossible to be virtuous on another persons decalogue isnt it he replied coolly then ere she had time to reply went on there are a lot of chaps want kicking in this crowd i can tell you for instance do you see that man buttonholing the rightful heir with the red tie she asked feeling interested in spite of herself is he english god forbid said her companion piously grecian archipelago i should say for choice but he wont let on anyhow hes a merchant wheat diamonds dust boneseverything out of which he can screw a pice and jehan aziz the rightful heir has the finest table emerald in the worldthe old kings signetring now i dont mind betting it will be in paris before the years out in pariswhy in paris i dont understandnobody could be expectednobody could understand protested lesley jack raymond smiled filthy lucrehis real name is philip lucanasterdoes i assure you miss drummond he knows that heirlooms always pay debts of honour he paused to lift his cap elaborately to a welldressed fair woman who passed with a tall dark man whose face had a wistful look theres a case in point he went on carelessly that fellowhe is a purebred brahmin miss drummondis paying his heirlooms through the nose because he contracted a debt of honour in marrying an englishwoman she has made him sacrifice home friends relations prints his cards mr and mrs chris davenanthis real name is krishn davenundand so tries to hang on to the frayed edge of societyhe glanced at an effusive greeting between the lady in question and mr lucanaster poor thing ejaculated lesley with the wholesale defence of all things feminine which belongs to her type what a terrible experience for her and for him retorted her companion drily matrimonial mistakes though women will not recognise the fact come inevitably in pairs apparently there was some suggestion in his own words for he looked ahead hastily and finding himself closer to an advancing group than he wished to be told jerry he must be off and turned back towards the paddock who was that lesley asked lady arbuthnot who with her husband formed the centre of that little knot of advancing notables she was a beautiful woman beautifully dressed and with the beautiful manners which a perfectly calm consciousness of beauty always gives to a woman her soft voice softened still more as she spoke to her childs governess so there was small wonder that the latters face as she replied told yet one more tale of modern girlhoodthe tale of one womans blind heroworship of another a race steward jerry took a violent fancy to him and i didnt but he said he knew youa mr raymond a faint echo of the name was checked on grace arbuthnots lips by a greeting to a new arrival which when she returned to the subject lent them the continuance of a set smile of welcome yes i knew him very well years ago i shall be glad to meet him again the faint unreality which previous rehearsal gives even to truth was in her voice hes up in this wace quoted jerry sagely or hed have come for he said you was orful nice oh mum do be quick or we shant see him win win how do you know hes going to win sonnie asked grace arbuthnot and there was no unreality in her voice now only a slightly troubled curiosity cos he will answered the child in childish fashion whereat his mother flushed faintly but smiled also jerry was a good prophet five minutes after he was dancing on his chair as crimson and gold came in first oh did you see mum he cried he was quite quite first lady arbuthnot held out her hand to steady the child and her voice seemed to need support also of course i saw dear and i am glad sos every one lady arbuthnot said young nevill lloydcaptain by virtue of his adcshipwho stood behind her raymond is our most popular win it seemed so by the cheer which rose as the winners went by i suppose he has won a lot of money sniffed lesley noting the riders pleased face not a penny miss drummond protested the young fellow raymond is only on the saddle when he rides another chaps horse as hes doing today and it is safer you know i do not know captain lloyd she retorted loftily i know nothing about horseracing why is it safer he coughed uneasily ah i thought you would know you know and its a bit hard to explain you see indian racing is sometimes a trifle oddconsidering i mean that we are all gentlemenor supposed to be so but raymond here he brightened up is always a straight win thats why lucre and his crew he stopped short as one of a group of men amongst whom mr lucanaster showed conspicuous by his red tie paused in the general exodus to answer a bystanders question luck how the deuce is any one to have luck when you cant get a fair bet placed even the devils own didnt get on with his royal highness mr lucanaster acknowledged another of his nicknames by a lavish smile there is faith as mustard in raymond among our nigger friends he said with the eccentricity of accent and idiom which following him into every language he knew made his nationality an insoluble problem he glanced back as he spoke towards a cluster of native gentlemen who following a lead as ever were also making their way from the stand the similarity of their oval yellow faces their thin curves of moustache trained to a fine sweep above the full betelstained lips proclaimed them of the same family but lesley singled out the rightful heir by his clothofgold coatee and by something which rather to her own surprise thrilled her unexpectedlya green gleam of sovereignty on the small supple hand raised in a salaam of servitude as its owner passed the lieutenantgovernor and his party im always glad continued nevill lloyd virtuously when lucre and his crew are hit they get betting with the nawabs and offering em drinks shocking bad formby the way miss drummond come to our tent and have a peachbrandy lesley with another trait of the modern girlher toleration of the male sex up to the age of twentyfivelaughed goodhumouredly it isnt bad form with a lady apparently for thats the fifth peachbrandy ive been offered in half an hour well arent there five tents and you havent been to ours argued the lad quite gravely do come it neednt be a peachbrandy you know have tea or a chocolate caramel just to show there isnt any illfeeling she smiled in sisterly fashion at his kindly cleanlooking young face andjerry having gone with his fatherpassed with it into that marvellous golden glory of indian sunshine which still struck her western eyes as the most noticeable factor in her eastern environment the rest barring the native costumes was hopelessly western she told herself as she stood listening to the scraps of talk around while nevill lloyd struggled for her cup of tea polo talk polite talk political talk then something she could not classify as two natives drifted by with an air of aloofness as they did so a plaintive womans voice rose close to her i shall send baby home as weve been transferred to cawnpore isnt she rather young said some one in answer oh it isnt that replied the first voice i mean that i couldnt take a child to cawnpore i should always be thinking of the well always thinking of the well the words brought home to lesley drummond in an instanta nevertobeforgotten instantthat something which so often chills the golden glory of the eastern sunshine that vision of the sentinel of memory which for both races bars the door of reconciliation that might otherwise stand open for comradeship she had read books on that past tragedy she had told herself that it was past that it should be forgotten and now drink your tea sharp said nevill lloyd with kindly familiarity or youll be getting ague thats the worst of this beastly hole its always in extremes hot as blazes one moment chill as charity he paused for the iron hand beneath the particoloured velvet and brocade glove of india was resolved to have the girl in its grip at once and a rattling thud followed by a dull reverberation rose from the near distance making more than one in the chattering crowd pause also until the sound came again when the pause ended cheerfully in fresh chatter its a funeral explained nevill lloyd in answer to lesleys look the cemetery is close to the course and enteric is shocking bad in barracks just now young summers of ours is down with it too awful ill poor chapcouldnt be worse im afraid a lady passing turned to listen and as she went on said to her companion in a whisper i do hope they wont have to put off the ball tonightive got such a jolly new dress from paris for it another vision came to lesley the vision of a dead lad and a paris dress come for a turnyoure positively shivering said captain lloyd concernedly they had barely escaped from the crush however when sir george arbuthnot appeared in the important fuss of new authority a cipher telegram had come from england he must return to government house at once if captain lloyd would kindly order the carriage its an orful nuisance miss dwummond commented jerry tucking his hand into hers after his fashion with every one he liked for dad and i was going to put five whole wupees on the blackboard thing for the cup wace and now he cant of course but i can cant i dad he added artfully appealing to a weak point in his parent for you pwomised didnt you now the keeping of promises had always been a prop to sir georges somewhat irresolute mind so he promptly gave jerry the five rupees and with a suggestion that miss drummond would help him to get the ticket bustled off leaving the latter no time for remonstrance she stood looking resentfully at the pieces of silver which were to betray her principles then said with chill dignity we had better take the ticket at once i suppose if it has got to be taken come gerald but jerrys face was the face of jerry when he forgot his hymn and his hands holding the five rupees went behind his back to match his consciousness of error im afwaid i dont know please he began dont know what speak up dont be stupid the flaming flag which always heralded the childs confessions of ignorance flew to his face but after his habit he looked his inquisitor full in the eyes what please a wankest outsider is lesley hid her smile deftly she had ample practice in the art with her pupil and i dont know which is the rankest outsider so we must take it on chance she replied tartly the little laddies face fell but he stood firm please id wather take it on thethe other for mr waymond knows lots about betting and you dont know nothing im glad i dont she retorted feeling quite nettled for jerrys obstinate adherence to his ideal was not to be set aside with a high hand and what is more i dont wish to so if youre not satisfied we neednt take the ticket at all so far she got almost spitefully then something smote the womanhood and motherhood in her or she went on suppose we take one on kingscraftevery one says he is sure to win the boys face was a study of pitying contempt kingscwaft he echoed why hes the favourite and im not going to foller a leadim going to collar the lot a sudden mist came to the girls eyes and through it she seemed to see the sturdy little soul enshrined in the sturdy little body she held out her hand and said simply come theres mr raymondhell know the rankest outsider echoed jack raymond quite gravely lets have a look at the card jerry then as he stooped over the child he added shall i read out the names or can you the confessional scarlet flew to the little lads very ears this time only some im fwaid that ones kitten an i know that other oneleast one end of it i do cos its miss dwummonds name which bonnie lesley asked jack raymond and the scarlet flag flew to another face only the other end of it please corrected jerry whereat one flush vanished in two laughs my name doesnt matter dear read the next began lesley when jack raymond interrupted her excuse me we gamblers believe in omenshm countrybred mareundersizedmaidenof course i remember a post entry railed down this morningowner upthat looks goodwhite and green sleevesbetterthe fellow knows his border ballads bonnie lesley it is my boy for the luckof the name trembled on his tongue but the immaculate collar and cuffs made him alter the phrase to the thing the next instant he and jerry were elbowing their way to the totalisator lesley waiting for them out of the crush and watching fresh white strokes come as fast as they could to number two on the blackboard that she thought must be the favourites number while poor bonnie lesley tho rankest outsider was probably thirteen with but one white stroke she turned to the bookmakers booths to see if she could verify her guess by their lists but all save one round which a few determined old stagers were lounging had already closed however she saw what she wanted therekingscraft no bonnie lesley no when she turned back again the little and the big covert coats had disappeared in the crowd indeed she was beginning to wonder what had kept them so long when jack raymonds voice called her from behind this way miss drummond everythings full up this side but ill take you across to the other jerry leaning over the railings below the judges stand beamed with delight but lesley finding mr lucanaster and the rightful heir next her felt herself mixed up with the extreme racing set and their nefarious practices so she glared at her guide resentfully though he was too much absorbed in his raceglass to notice it just in time he said looking round with a cheerful smile now jerry my man steady to win or losethats the game he followed his own advice anyhow and lesley watching his hands felt instinctively that the man must be a firstclass rifle shot but jerry followed the advice also though with a wonder as to whether the strain was good or bad for the child she noticed his fingers clenched white on the white railings in his effort to be calm theyre off the familiar stir of relief ran through the crowd then came the familiar silence while every eye was riveted on the confused onward sweep over the curved tanthat silent halfseen sweep which for all its dimness its silence to the outward ear and eye holds in it from the first a sob a strain of fiercest effort for the inward sight and hearing so at the curve the trail of horses clustered spread out again settled for the straight run home bonnie lesleys had it in her pocket from start to finish jerry said jack raymond suddenly lowering his glasses by jove i wish id he broke off and raised the glasses again but by this time others had seen that the little brown mare was coming home to her stables cheerfully and a blank halfirritated surprise began to leaven the suspense then a voicemr lucanasterssaid what a rotten race it was to many yet as the little mare neared the spectators there was something in the bronze gleam of her straining muscle something in the deerlike bound of her forward sweep something in the eager head with its full anxious eye outstretched as if to pass the post a second sooner something in the slack swing of a pair of green sleeves telling of a win hands down which made every sportsman present forget personal disappointment in a surge of admiration for the game little beast by jove raymond said one of the judges as he passed out what a flyer id give something to own her id give something to have known her corrected another twenty to one ye gods what a chance for my widow and orphans who gave you the tip jack asked an envious voice what tip replied jack raymond imperturbably oh dont fizzlei saw youjust at the lastyou must have about broken the totalisators dont break my dear fellow interrupted jack now jerry if miss drummond is ready we can go and claim your winnings she made no answer till the comparative solitude of recrossing the course was reached then she turned to him and said in a voice to match his own and your winnings also their eyes met and he took his cue once more from what he saw ill get them after it is a good lot for i backed the little mare properly because she had your name only depreciated rupees though jerry can you do sums yet what is five thousand rupees at one shilling and threepence farthing that i think is todays quotation is it not miss drummond his reflected defiance made the original stronger tell mr raymond jerry that you havent yet begun his system of compound multiplication and as i hope you never will he had better drop the subject she had not looked at the straight line of those bushy fair eyebrows or she might have realised the futility of highhandedness but she did realise it with a certain respect from the first words he spoke you have no right to object he said coolly the coincidence of name was not your doingnor mine nor are you responsible for the mares win therefore since neither jerry nor i consider ourselves in your debt for our illgotten gains we leave you out of the question and for the life of me i cant see why you should insist on being in it when you dislike it his sledgehammer commonsense left her gasping and ere she found words he had reverted to negligent banter but of course if you feel guilty ill put the rupees into the poorboxthat is always the refuge of the consciencestricken i can afford it easily for ive had a regular run of luck today so let it be peace and charity with this man now jerry for the rupees and after your pockets are stuffed ill take you to your mother and explain lesley feeling limp admitted to herself that the suggestion was thoughtful she also yielded the point of manners as she watched him standing before lady arbuthnot with jerrys hand as ever tucked confidingly into a bigger one and yet grace arbuthnot was one of those women who as a rule make men look rough im sorry to begin by bringing you a bad boy he said evading her set welcome rather abruptly but miss drummond will tell you how demoralising i am so you must forgive the young sinner for the sake of the old one the words held no intent and yet as grace arbuthnot stood listening and looking at those twothe man and the child handinhandthe faint shrinking which tells of a sudden enlightenment bodily or spiritual came to her eyes you can hardly be held responsible mr raymond she said slowly when the tale was done it is sir georges fault and i will tell him then as if to escape from the situation she turned to lesley by the way have you seen him lately gone home did you say why the reply seemed to take her from the present and the past also so that her manner had all the elaborate graciousness she accorded to mere acquaintances as she said then i will follow his example and say goodbye mr raymond these english telegrams are so interesting arent they especially now the general election is on for it means so much to india doesnt it possibly he replied coolly but it means very little to me lady arbuthnot i am no politician nowadays lesley drummond as driving away she watched the haggard face pass under the big blackboard with its white sums which rose from the motley crowd to show clear against the dusty levels of india wondered once more if his tone meant contempt or envy grace arbuthnot however did not notice the tone at all she was absorbed in something else and as soon as they reached government house went straight to her husbands writingroom after ten minutes she was still standing where she had paused beside him and was drawing her dainty pale gloves through her hands impatiently as she stared at the telegram sir george had shown her for he trusted her absolutely in such matters and in so doing showed his sense she came to begin with of an angloindian family which had written its name large on the annals of empire an only daughter she had kept house for her father the lieutenantgovernor of his time and so from her earliest girlhood had listened to the talk of the ablest men in india and become familiar with the problems of its government then of herself he knew her to be as capable of giving a sound opinion as he was knew that no one from the himalaya to cape comorin took a keener interest than she did in the welfare of the people yes i too thought they might perhaps withdraw it but still it is mean inexpressibly mean she said at last her voice was loud and firm and sir george glanced uneasily at the door of his secretarys room for the fear of a certain proverb about grey mares lingered with him it dies hard in indian bureaucracy horribly mean she went on for it does not lessen your responsibility or alter the position so far as youre concerned sir george took up his pen a trifle irritablya sign that he was beginning to weary of the discussion pardon me i think it does so long as these secret instructions were in my confidential box i was bound in any crisis to follow them but now they are destroyedhe paused at her look pointed to a pile of grey ashes in the fireplace and went on heartilyupon my soul its a relief the contents cant leak out now and ive been awfully nervous about that ever since ewebank took to asking questions about a secret plan of campaign in the house some one got a hint of it somehow and as you know that pestilent paper here the voice of india has been on the badfaith tack and i cant imagine anything more disastrous just at present when the city is seething about the plague and the withdrawal of municipal powers than that this policywhich frankly subverts all our professionsshould be got at even at home it would be ruination during the elections a regular party cry and yet said lady arbuthnot with a fine scorn every sane man knows we cant proclaim everything from the housetops in india knows we must have secret orders and paper or no paper we have them still if there is a row government will expect you a sudden obstinacy came to her husbands face i should telegraph home for orders her hands closed tighter she frowned no you wouldnt george everything might depend on accepting the responsibility of immediate actionyou he drew his chair close to the table and dipped his pen in the inksign that he meant to hear no more i should do what i thought best of course but i should also be more cautious to avoid doinghe changed his phrase to avoid receiving a slap in the face anyhow im not exactly sorry the instructions have been withdrawn even delay in action seems to me to involve less riskof permanent injury i meanthan the upset there would infallibly be if our intention leaked out before the event she paused at the door with a look of tolerant affection but why should it have leaked out besides it did strengthen your hands enormouslythat is why i got father to speak to the councilthat is why i was so glad when he succeeded and he was glad toohe knows the advantage of having it in black and white she said the last words half to herself as she went slowly up the wide shallow stairs so unenglish so still more unindian which led to the upper story of government house she was thinking as she spoke of her fathers letter in which he had told her of his success and given her an outline of what the demiofficial notification to follow would be that letter was still in her jewelbox upstairs where she had placed it as a sort of hostage against the more definite letter to come and suddenly the temptation not to destroy that precis of policy came to her supposing she kept it just to show georgewhose disinclination to accept responsibility she recognised as a source of dangerthat if the worst came to the worst he could still prove a private knowledge in black and white of what had been the government policy the letter was very definite very explicit the thought came to her as she passed into her room and as she did so she saw the reflection of her english maids face in the lookingglass as she stood rummaging hastily in the dressingtable drawers what is it needham the maid turned with a cry of mingled relief and alarm oh milady im so glad youre back i cant find the little jewelbox nowhereit adnt so much in it milady for id took out the diamonds last nightthat was when i seen it last it ad your string of pearls and ayah says shes not seen it either but there was people in the verandah last night for captain lloyd he threw boots at em for disturbin him oh dear oh dear why did i ever come to ingiar here needham dissolved into tears grace arbuthnot turned very pale the little jewelbox she echoed then she pulled herself together and said calmly well it is lucky it was only the pearls go down and ask sir george to come to me at once for if the box has really been stolen the sooner the police know the better half an hour afterwards she was answering the police officers questions still more calmly only a string of pearlslarge onesthey belonged to my mother who got them i believe from one of the late nawabs wives and a few small trinketsthere is a list of themthat was all a letter or two milady suggested needham who had been giving her evidence of no value to any one save the owner smiled lady arbuthnot and her husband smiled back at her for he knew she kept his letters well it is lucky it wasnt worse he said consolingly it might have been the diamonds and if i were you he added to the police officer id let mr lucanaster know at once even if as you say its wiser to keep the matter dark for a day or two he is always buying jewels and even if the thieves dont take the pearls to him direct they might try and trade them off to the royal family and then he is sure to hear of it in the endhe is always having dealings with them chapter ii the kiteflyers bring me more paste women and see there be no lumps in it the last was fit to ruin a bodys reputation said lateefa the kitemaker as he sate on the ground in one of the arched nooks which surrounded the wide sunlit courtyard of a large native house it had been a sort of city palace to the dead dynasty and was now occupied by jehan aziz the rightful heirs family it was built of stucco simulating marble stucco decayed fast crumbling to dust so leaving scars where once there had been ornaments the speaker was an old man though his sleek oiled hair squarecut in the royal fashion just below the ear showed no streak of grey on one side of him lay the raw material of his craft on the other a swiftgrowing pile of the manufactured article ready for sale in the bazaar after his master jehan aziz prince of kiteflyers should have taken his choice that lateefa himself was prince of kitemakers could be judged from the way in which he bent the bamboo slips to a perfect curve and held them thus by three dabs of paste and a sheet of tissue paper it was a miracle of dexterity there were two women in the courtyard one a girl about sixteen who was lounging lazily behind lateefa the other a woman of sixty dressed in ragged dirty garments who was spinning as for dear life an arch or two farther down after a pause during which she looked almost appealingly at the girl the latter rose and limped towards an inner court for khojeeya khanum was slightly lame slightly deformed also owing to her lameness keep the lumps to our dinners auntie khojee called the girl with a pert titter for what with paste and the kites it makes we good women have scarce flour left to fill our stomachs lateefa after watching the limp disappear glanced round at the girl she was a buxom creature overdeveloped for her years and overdressed in the cheap finery of manchester muslin at six pice a yard and german silver earrings at two annas a dozen thy sort of good woman need never starve niece sobrai he said for he was connected by some by way of blood to the heirs of all things or nothing i have told thee that before there is not a drop of her blood in thee he nodded to the inner door i mean no blame some daughters must favour the father indeed i marvel ever there be so few to do it in this family since god knows we men be debauched enough to outweigh the virtue of the sainted fatma herself he shook his head and began on a new kite thou knowest that better than i retorted sobrai sharply though thy memory uncle lateef can scarce hold the poor souls thou hast injured thereby his deft hands left their work and the supple fingers spread themselves in emphatic denial not a one niece not a one he protested lateefa makes kites not souls i take men and women as they came from their makers handsas i came for see you if my kites fly as i make them fly why not his soulshe paused for a thin musical laugh which suited his thin acute facei say not he went on that thou art botched by being built another fashion but that her life he nodded again to the inner or womens court is not for such as theethat thou hadst best appraise thine own needs betimes may be i have already sneered the girl insolently and without thy help pander he turned on her swiftly have a care girl have a care in vice as in virtue the old ways are safest so listen not to that woman from cantonments whom the nawab brings hither when he entertains ah think not i have not seen thee stealing down on the sly to have a word with her sobrai gave a halfabashed titter and to dilaram thy friend of the city also lo uncle what is there to choose between them or their trade either if one comes to dance what matters a veil and if the nawab would keep his women oldfashioned why doth he bring miss leezie to the house ah say not tis only to this outer court where we virtuous need see nothing for tis only the blind cow which hath a separate byre and my sight is good and thy heart bad added lateefa dispassionately as she stood shifting one foot to and fro after the manner of dancinggirls still since god made thee as i make kites thou wilt doubtless fly thine own wayif thou canst find some one to hold the string it needs that ever she began a retort but checked herself as khojeeya reappeared with the paste in a green leaf cup thy work brings quick return lateef said the old lady pausing to look wistfully at the growing pile of kites but my wheel twirls for two hours to a farthing tune she edged closer and brushed a speck of dirt from the kitemakers board in wheedling fashion then went on couldst not spare me something today lateef against the boys medicine he needs it sorely and noormahal hath not had a cowrie from the nawab since the races dost know what he lost he says all but he lies often she spoke without a suspicion of blame simply as if the factbeing a dispensation of providencewas neither to be questioned nor resented lateefa laughed airily lose he echoed jehan hath naught to lose not even credit he sets free of fate he who bathes naked has no clothes to wring tis salig ram his usurer whose fat flesh quivers lest his tame pensioner should die prematurely so take heart my good khojee things cannot grow worse or for that matter better since jehans affairs are as a slipped camel in the mud they can neither go back nor forward for see you he must not die of starvation lest the pension lapse nor must he live riotous beyond reason lest once more the pension lapse through his death by surfeit would to god i had such leadingstrings to comfortable clean living myself but none cares for lateefas soul or body so fret not khojee concerning jehan and as for the boy canst not take the child to the duffrin hospitarl and get physic free plenty women go thither they tell me ay of sorts but not we replied the old lady she drew her ragged veil tighter but sobrai tittered hark to her gentility yet she goes to the pawnshop uncle lateef and does the housemarketing to boottut auntie wouldst pretend it is not so as if our neighbours did not know us all but servantless as if they could not tell worshipful khojeeya khanum kings daughter below the domino by the limp the old worn faceit was one of those providence meant for beauty then marredturned in deprecating apology to lateefa as representative of outraged propriety and proprietor some one must meean she said meekly for ameenan hath but two hands and two feet yet another set would mean another mouth to feed besides i grow so old brother there is no fear the faint forlornness and regret of the excuse made lateefas sharp face soften heed not what sobrai says sister he replied lo thy virtue would stand stiff in a brothel hers grows giddy looking over a wall so she doth not understand not understand retorted the girl shrilly mayhap i understand too much for old folk and old ways i hold not with lickspittling menfolk who wander englis fassen yet would keep us in the old pathwho say as their granddads did that cattle and women must rub along in their tethers but claim a long string to their own kites lateefa interrupted the tirade with a chuckle since they are able to hold it but as i told thee tis the mud in the gutter for the gayest of gay petticoatshe laid his hand on the growing pile of kitesif they try to soar alone i will not ask thee to hold mine anyway she retorted flouncing off in a meditated whirlwind for lateefa was right sobrai was not born of those who are patient in welldoing even without experience her manners were those of a different model aunt khojee looked after her fearfully then once more turned to representative man in apology here are ill words meean she began tremulously yet god knows how hard it is to keep girls silent when the world about them hath grown so noisy in the old days neighbours were of ones own sort now if they be ready to pay full rent that is enough i say naught against oursthough good or bad it was ill done of alidad our cousin to let the house his fathers died in still they be decent folk enough though the son is a balister but see you since he returned from england he hath taken his wife to live as a mem beyond the city and she hath set his sisters agog to learn as she learns of a miss from the missen so what with all this talk and the railway whistle so close and sobrai gossiping as girls will over the partitions lateefas thin laugh positively crackled said i not her virtue would not withstand a wall but heed her not sister she is right for sobrai thou art right for kojeeya khanum ye are both godbred godfed except concerning housesthere thou art wrong he added giving the old lady a shrewd tentative look dead folk should remain in their graves and leave the letting of houses to the living i deem alidad wise for as the old saw says an empty house is the wasps estate jehan should do the like with this if the nawabin would consent to live elsewhere elsewhere echoed khojee aghast where else should noormahal live but in her own house in a smaller one look saw you ever such a wilderness of a place for five women and a child he swept a derisive finger round the wide courtyard the terraced arcades the storied vista of the zenankhana the halffortified gateway where the royal peacocks still spread their broken plaster tails and as he did so the flood of yellow sunshine as if in answer betrayed every cranny in the cracked brickwork every scar in the mouldering stucco tis as a stone on the tail of a kite sister he went on a burden not to be borne by frailty that can scarce support itself he had as he spoke been tying his mornings work together ere taking it to the bazaar and now he stood balancing a balloonlike bundle almost as big as himself upon his hand but he emphasised his remark by withdrawing that support then ere the kites touched ground catching the bundle again so holding them suspended it needs some one to keep feather brains from the gutter he continued gravely and thou khojee art the only body in this house with sense khadjee thy sister hath decorum sobrai desires and noormahal poor soul dreams so let me speak thee soberly thou hast heard of this plague sister khojee cracked all her fingers wildly to avert evil ere quavering who hath not hath it come lateefa shall we be all sent to hospital and poisoned the crackling laugh echoed again fools tales woman fools tales why should the huzoors trouble have they not soldiers and guns wherewith to kill but they have driven out the mimbranscommittee they have taken possession of all things hafiz ahmads wife who lives as a mem said so she said her husband the laugh crackled again ay he is mimber yet he knows which side of the wall to jump and what be the rights and wrongs of the quarrel i know not but as thou sayest the huzoors have taken the reins once more for the plague is nigh so they are meddling with gods work and finding hospitarls and who knows what and hafiz ahmad for all his grievance hath recommended his fathersyea khojee the neighbouring houseas hospitarl so see you sister if folk were wise the hospitarl might come to them and a swinging rent beside since behari lai the town clerk told me the doctors said they must have both houses or neitherthey were so nigh here then is noormahals chance let her claim a writing for halfrent since having right of occupancy by her marriagedowry jehan cannot let without her consent that would stop wheelspinning for bare bread sister but khojees thoughts were not for herself can the huzoors make us go she quavered can they force her lateefa shrugged his shoulders nay nay but if she choose then is that the end interrupted khojee with a sigh of relief noormahal will never choose she hath but two things left of kingshipand it comes closer through her than through jehan mind you though being woman she hath no claim like hetwo things the house and the ring and she will keep bothfor her boy lateefa had his gay balloon balanced afresh on his palm if she can keep the boy he said sardonically but even kites are ill to hold with a rotten string so balancing his burden of nothingness from one hand to another as jugglers play with a ball he passed out under the broken plaster peacocks singing significantly in his high reedy voice the dirge of motherhood which so often echoes out into the indian sunshine from behind closed doors o child who taught thee to deceive o child who taught thee thus to leave my throning arms didst thou not say thou wert their king for aye so soon dost thou deceive so soon hast learnt to leave thy sonships crown to fling it down thy throne is lone ah me ah me it fell on khojeeya khanums ears making her heart sink with its implied warning for a child doomed to disease like little saadut the heir to the heirship of nothingness was but faint hold on the soaring honours of royalty and jehan aziz his father was a fainter one still rumours had come even to the wide ruined courtyard of official reprimands of threats what wonder when even the more reputable members of the royal family looked askance at his doings still he was master in that house and as that was his day for the weekly visit of ceremony he vouchsafed to his lawful wife it behoved khojee to prepare for it after established rule khadeeja khanum khojees twin sister had already done her share of preparation she had put on her best pink satin trousers and a spangled green veil in which she sate squatted on a string bed set in the womens court and sewed at a tinsel cap for the head of the housethat being the correct etiquette on such occasions and khadeeja was far more correct than khojeeya in fact her position in the household was quite different seeing that she had been betrothed in her youth to an ancient suitor who died before she was old enough to be claimed while no one had ever made a bid for khojees limp so while the latters few trinkets had a trick of remaining with the pawnbroker khadjees never paid even a temporary visit to that official then her clothes from that decorous sitting on string beds instead of breathless spinning in the dust remained so spick and span that noormahal poor soul when money ran scarce for the heirs medicine would accuse the general scapegoat of extravagance in providing them on these occasions khojee never retorted that the white muslin in which the nawabin denied herself was in the end more expensive neither did she meet khadjees demand for more tinsel with the brutal truth that the caps were too oldfashioned for jehan aziz to wear family facts of this sort she did not even divulge in her prayers for khojeeya khanums religion like her life was strictly impersonal it could be nothing else since it was barely decent for a woman to intrude even her own salvation on a creator whose attributes were distinctly masculine so while khadjee sewed and noormahal cuddled the sleeping saadut as she crouched on another bed khojee dragged out the state carpetwhence all the state and most of the carpet had retired in favour of bare stringset the cushions prepared the pipe the sherbet and the hand punkah lest the master should be fatigued by his condescension for to her all these ceremonies were a sort of sacrament to any intercourse between the sexes without which it was distinctly improper and with which it was possible to receive even a scapegrace with benefit to yourself having done all this she crossed to noormahal and crouching beside the bed began with a crooning song to massage the long slender limbs tucked up under the long slim body for her niece though not half her age was nawabinas such mistress of the house nay auntie remonstrated noormahal in a deep full voice thou also wert up all night with the boy and art as tired as i trra retorted khojeeya old hemp hath fibre young hemp flower and twill freshen thee against thy mans coming the almost pathetic raillery in the old face which had never known a lovers kiss was quite charming but noormahal frowned better prepare the childs food she said shrinking even from the touch of those caressing hands mayhap his father will be glad if he looks better her voice low for her race and sex suited the fine aquiline face whose fairness was enhanced by the exceeding darkness of the large melancholy eyes these in their expression matched the extreme passivity of face and figurea passivity which held no trace of supineness for the rest there was much ignorance and obstinacy in the face but nobility in both she sate curiously immovable until khojee reappeared with a cup of milk it was a jubilee cup with clasped hands of union upon it and a portrait of the queenempress surrounded by flags and mottoes and noormahal held it to the lips of the little heir to nothingness or all things with tender cajoleries wake up my heart wake light of mine eyes wake little king she murmured and under her lavish kisses the boy roused to smile first at her then at the cup finally at the old woman who knelt holding his little bare feet in her wrinkled hand as if they were a gift he was a pretty child despite the ominous scars on the brown velvet of his skin the hoarse pipe in his childish treble a lively laddie too and arrogant from kinglike ignorance of denial so khojee limped for more sugar noormahal wheedled him into another sip or two khadeeja from her tinsels murmured blessings and even sobrai dismissed by the proprieties from the court against the masters visit giggled from a balcony at saaduts insolence and called to her girlfriends over the wall that he was a pea of the right pod and no mistake certainly his lordliness was matched by jehan aziz when the latter stalked in without a word of welcome for the three women who stood up salaaming profoundly yet even he paid court to the child and yielding to the implied command of outstretched arms took saadut to share the cushion of state on the state carpet they were a quaint pair this father and son dressed alike in wrinkled white calico tights velvet vests flimsy gauze overcoats and round tinsel caps set far back on the white parting of their sleek hair such a startling white parting considering the brownness of their skins the likeness between the two was in a way ghastly the more so because the mans face bore no trace of the suffering which was written so clearly on the boys noormahal watching them with empty arms noticed this with a fierce unreasoning jealousy for her child yet there was a deeper fiercer jealousy than this in the big brooding eyes which took in every detail of the man who scented oiled was all too perceptibly attired for conquest elsewhere she hated him it is true but in india the marriagetie is not a sentiment it is a tangible right and so still young still comely noormahal felt none of the passionate repulsion which a western woman would have felt her wish her claim was to force her husband back to her with contumely was he not hers to be the father of other heirs if this one found freedom but contumely was out of the question jehan aziz still had the green gleam of the kingly emerald on his finger that must first come back to her safe hoarding as by solemn agreement it always came after the rare occasionssuch as the race meetingwhen it had to blazon its claims before the world and now the races were over where jehan said he had lost all all the more reason the ring should come quickly so when sobrai from above challenged jehans leer by peeping and nodding there was no need for aunt khojee to sidle between the mistress of the house and the flagrant impropriety like a hen between her ducklings and the water noormahal would have allowed more insult than that to pass unnoticed she sate passive brooding wondering when jehan would begin on the subject and all around the group the still sunshine burdened the halfruined courtyard with a cruel light it was one of khadeejas pious benedictions with which she embroidered truth as she embroidered her tinsel caps which drove the stillness from that elemental group of man woman and child that trinity for good or evil in which the veriest agnostic must believe the sight she asserted of such a father and such a son filled her soul with certainty that a merciful creator would preserve the child to take his fathers place and wear the signet of his kingly ancestors put in noormahal seizing her opportunity her challenge smote the sunshine keen as a swordthrust with all her desire for diplomacy she could not help it coming jehan glared at her furiously for a second but irritation at a wife soon passes when as in india she is no tieunless she is beloved and noormahal was not besides the broaching of the subject was a relief since it had to be broached somehow even though the negotiations with mr lucanaster had gone no further than a promise of first refusal should the ring be sold not that he jehan had as yet seriously considered sale but even so if salig ram the usurer were to be persuaded to loan money on the rings security it must not be returned to noormahals keeping therefore seeing that little saadut would be at once his shield and his weapon in the fight which was bound to come between himself and the passionate woman whose eyes blazed at him he turned to the child with a laugh and a caress yea saadut thou shalt wear the ring father will keep it for thee the answer came swift and why not mother as heretofore auntie khojee sidled again in deprecation of such a tone towards the master jehan himself would have given his fighting quail source of his only steady income to answer this woman as he answered other women but he could not the child the only child which had come to his reprobate life was her shield her weapon also he looked at this tie between them almost resentfully and thrust it once more to the van of fight because saadut mother hath had it long enough hath she not sonling it is fathers turn now is it not saaduts big black eyesthey had all his mothers melancholy with a childish wistfulness superadded to their velvet depthslooked from the womans face to the mans from his mothers face to his fathers and a vague perplexity a still vaguer consciousness of a hidden meaning came to his childish mind what did they want these big people who always took so much upon themselves unless he expressed a wish when theirs had to give way suddenly he rose to his feet a mite of mankind between those two imperious undisciplined natures which had so thoughtlessly called his into being the veriest atom of humanity and yet by reason of its frailty its inexperience more imperious more undisciplined than that from which it sprung give it to me myself came his hoarse pipe arrogantly give it to saadut he will keep it himself give it i say give it the claim to individual life in a thing to which you have given life startled even this father and mother they paused uncertain so in a second earpiercing shrieks of amazed disappointment rent the air and there was khojee on her knees attempting pacification while khadjee from her tinsels implored immediate gratification give it him nawabsahib she fluttered lo he will die in a fit it is ill denying a child thou canst take it back when he tires of the plaything yea give it him meean pleaded khojee all of a tremble a childs cry in a house is illluck thou canst take it back when he sleeps the suggestion struck the keynote of another resentment in noormahal making her forget the vague opposition which the childs claim had raised she caught saadut to her sharply making that claim her own for now thinking only of his helplessness his cries hurt her physically making prudence impossible yea give it him jehan aziz son of kingsgive it him in jest for a while it is easy for a father to steal his sons right from him while he sleeps jehan sprang to his feet with a fearful curse for the tempest of ungovernable anger which had come to that elemental group in the still sunshine had brought with it the usual sense of personal outrage on personal virtue which alone makes quarrel possible stealdidst say steal he echoed ay but tis as easy for a wife to steal from her husband when he wakes fool when i wrung the betrothal pearls from thee last year didst think i did not know there was a string short didst think i could not count them round my mothers neck when she held me a child noormahal paled yet faced him with a scornful laugh thou didst forget to count the string she sold when thy father refused her bread it runs in the blood nawabjee his look was fiendish now that is a lie woman and thou knowest it the english took them as they take all things besides have i not dallied with them round thy neck since then at my pleasure what are they there still he went on mockingly as noormahals hand all unconsciously found the slim throat hidden by the folds of her veil didst keep them against the chance of my return she glared at him helplessly yet almost forgetful of the brutality of his insult in a greater wrong it was for the child thou knowest she said in a muffled voice for his brideas it was for thine jehan as it hath been ever for every bride in the kings house her words which came not from meekness but redhot rage made even jehan aziz flinch so that he had to bolster himself up with fresh anger ere replying and i let thee think me a fool i took no notice for the boys sake too this new reading of his own cowardice restored his sense of virtue and with it his courage but now thief he went on since thou hast dared to even me to thyself as well as think me fool give me my pearls dost hearthe pearls she drew herself up superbly i called thee traitor she cried that is enough for thee and thief for thee well traitor and thief are fitting mates let us kiss and make friends on that comradeship she returned his insolent leer with a cold stare for one second then in the headlong repulsion from the least tie to him tore the pearls from their hidingplace and flung them on the ground they fell the string snapping to scatter a few of its milkwhite beads about the worn carpet of state even jehan hesitated then the sight of what meant money overcame his dignity and he stooped to gather up the prize the action gave him time for quick thought this windfall might serve a double purpose by selling it cheap to lucanastersahib he could stave off the bigger question of the emerald for a bit and at the same time raise enough to pay his more pressing debts both these considerations brought such a flavour of pure piety to his task that by the time he had finished it he turned magnificently to his heir who silenced from all save sobs by his elders passion was being comforted by khojee while khadjee whimpered like a puppy on her string bed lo saadut he said take thy ring sonling but give it not to thy mother to hoard if thou wouldst grow to wear it since thou mayst starve the while but that is her doing not mine who would let this housewhere i was called thief and found oneand give thee proper care if i had my choice so i take my leave of it for ever khojee still on her knees beside the child turned in swift alarm peace go with my lord she said her head at his very feet the outer courtyard will be ready as ever for the entertainment he interrupted her mockingly i must learn to take my pleasure elsewhere noble aunt twill be an easier task than finding it here so with an insolent stare at his wife he strutted out jauntily didst hear quavered aunt khojee khadeeja khanums answering whimper was almost a howl but noormahal said nothing she was thinking of her tormentors words about the child was it true that the price of the ring might save her darling for the present however the ring itself satisfied him appeased even from sobs he was engrossed in finding out which of his tiny fingers went nearest to filling up its gold circlet as he did so the green gleam of the emerald shone broadly unbrokenly for as mr lucanaster had often told his paris principals the legend scratched on it was so faint that a turn of the wheel would obliterate it yet there it was as yet fuzlilahi panahideen which being translated is by the grace of god defender of the faith words which have caused much shedding of blood and tears but sobrai begum found laughter in the storm they had provoked twas only jehan and noormahal squabbling over the old ring she tittered over the wall in answer to a query in the end she gave him the last of the pearls to pacify him i would have used them to better purpose had i had the luck to have my hand on them and as she sullenly obeyed aunt khojees call to help she told herself that two or three even of the pearls would have brought her freedom would have given her as uncle lateef had expressed it that some one to hold the string of her kite without which aid independence was impossible for sobrai had no mind for the gutter so the pearls if she had them she gave a little gasp in folding up the state carpet four milkwhite beads rolled out from its worn strings she glanced round her hastily khadjee was wiping the dimness of past tears from her spectacles khojee was replacing the cushions noormahal was brooding over saadut who had fallen asleep with both his thumbs thrust into the ring as they thrust the fingers of a corpse which might otherwise come back to disturb the living with what should be buried and forgotten there was no one to see and no one to know for jehan would sell or pawn the remainder none the wiser even if he suspected anything he would make no inquiries since these sales were done in secret she had no pocket and to tie her prize in the corner of her veil would attract attention so she slipped the pearls into her mouth and held her tongue even when aunt khojee scolded at her for not being quicker such silence paid better than any retort and it also gave her time to mature her plans one thing was certain she must make her push for freedom before there was any chance of discovery for it was just possible jehan might know the number of the pearls the sooner the better as far as she was concerned since she had long made up her mind to accept miss leezies offerwith a suitable feeof educating her to that walk in life she could not remain dowerless unwed within four walls all her life and if one had to amuse oneself was it not better to do it openly in a recognised almost respectable fashion which was countenanced even by the huzoors as she made her plans jehan on his way to his bachelor quarters in the worst bazaar in nushapore was making his and settling that he would certainly lead that pig of an infidel lucanaster to think he would in the end yield the emerald by letting him have the pearls cheap under promise of silence this was imperative partly for the sake of honour mostly because salig ram the usurer might object to any one else getting them chapter iii cobwebs the noonday sun lay shadowless in every nook of the narrow evilsmelling courtyard which formed a common exit to jehan azizs bachelor quarters and three or four other houses whose fronts faced the most disreputable bazaar in nushapore one of these belonged to dilaram the dancer and the remaining ones were tenanted by folk of similar tastes such as burkut ali the delhi pensioner whom jack raymond had styled the biggest brute in asia but he had a double reasoning for choosing the courtyard in that it enabled him better to play his part of buckingham to the rightful heir despite its character however the courtyard was peace and propriety itself in the perpendicular glare of noon peaceful and proper with a dreamy drugged peace a satiated propriety that was in keeping with the heavy yellow sunshine and dilaram herself matched the general drowsiness as she sate muffled in a creased shawl yawning blowsy illkempt upon a wooden balcony overlooking the courtyard she matched the squalor of the scene also a squalor which seemed to put the pleasure that has its marketable value out of possibility in such surroundings jehan aziz who sate on a string bed below looked a trifle less dilapidated than dilaram for his morning toilet had extended to the making of that white parting down the middle of his oiled hair and a due shaving into line of his thin moustache not that these results were due to any energy on his part they were the work of the barber who was now occupied nearer the door in paring burkut alis nails while the heir to nothingness in no hurry to proceed chewed betel thoughtfully and looked at a caged quail which he meant to fight against a rivals so soon as he could rouse himself sufficiently to dress for he had got no further in the way of clothing than the wrinkled white calico trousers which by reason of their tightness have to be tenants fixtures during the term of occupation so sobrai begum hath flitted at last yawned dilaram who was within an aside of jehan with a sudden causeless access of indifference and malice and nawab jehan aziz ruknuddowlahafizulmulk hath in consequence one less mouth to feed peace be with him speak lower fool or the barber will hear and the tale be spread over the town muttered jehan savagely scowling at the sarcasm of the titles a day and a night had passed since aunt khojee veiled to her fingertips and fluttering like any pigeon had fled through the bazaars to tell the head of her house thatnot three hours after he had left it in wrathsobrai had disappeared jehan aziz after established custom had kept the scandalous secret to himself and his immediate family with the exception of dilaram to whom he had gone at once as the most likely person to have an inkling of the girls intentions for the only way to deal with such cases is to get the truant back as speedily as possible and ensure a virtuous silence in the future the silence as a rule of the grave so the chance of the barber having extra long ears was horrible dilaram however glanced idly at the group by the door which gave unreservedly on the gutters of a cramped alley and yawned again not he burkut hath him gaping over signs and wonders that will be gods truth ere the whole of nushapore be shaved they are more to the barbers trade than a girls flight though that also goes far nowadays what with all the talk about such things and this would go far indeed if set agoingwith a head of lie and sparks of truth in its tail like the powder in an eed squib the truth echoed jehan in swift suspicion then thou dost know somewhat after all she yawned again smiling not i had none but my sort danced as in old days in kings houses dilaram would have known who else sought to flutter in her footsteps but with new pleasures nawabsahib come new pains she is not of us in the city that is sure but there are baggages with bleached hair and powdered faces outside it ask miss leezie i heard her say she lacked apprentices her lazy spitefulness was effective and jehan clenched his fine hands viciously he did not particularly desire to get sobrai backexcept for punishmentprovided scandal could be avoided he was indeed well quit of a girl for whom no suitor could be found and who was not to his own personal taste but the suggestion of dilarams words stung horribly god smite their souls to the nethermost hell he muttered making the dancer flick her fingers with a giggle lo hearken to virtue not a rag for the child and a coat for the cat men be no worse in cantonments than here in the city nevertheless the tale as i said could be told to a purpose by a clever tongue it would rouse the common folk more than burkuts lies about portents or the baboos about the plague if they only knew it jehan aziz turned on her like a snake sleepy yet swift ready for dreams or death if thou dost dare to tell she held out her bare brown arm in a quick gesture of silence and rising swept him a salaam that set the hidden anklets beneath her dirty draperies ajingling and proclaimed her what she wasa passed mistress in the oldest of professions for women there is no need my lord she said superbly to teach dilaram her duty to the virtuous women who sit free of shame in the noble houses where she dances we learn that first of all there was an indescribable grace in her attitude a cadence in her utterance which proved her claim she was of the old school educated to her craft the jingle of anklets brought a mans face to a neighbouring balcony a face hollowcheeked haggard with dissipation written on it brought thither by curiosity it remained in approval of the studiouslyposed figure in the creased shawl jehans face too showed a like attraction and burkut ali the nailparing over lounged up with a savage sort of discontent at his own inward admirationa regret as it were for the vices of his ancestors as a rule dilaram and her dancing did not amuse him in the very least he had passed from the old style to the new and indeed was chiefly responsible for the introduction of miss leezie and her like to the nobility and gentry of nushapore but now he was conscious that this in its way was better and the fact formed a fresh item in his general grievance against those who having taken the reins of government from such as he had driven india into changeeven in its wickedness the secret cherishing of this general grievance of his own in the minds of others was burkut alis whole occupation in life the dilatory disaffection of his neighbours a disaffection inevitable in a society which this change had literally ruined could he had discovered be turned to his own profit in two ways first because as confidant to seditious utterances he gained a hold on the utterer secondly because as the repeater of them to persons in high places he gained a hold on the hearer for the rest his manners were perfection his persian a pure pleasure to the ear and both these were at their best whenhis present part in the farce of vague conspirings being that of general backerup of jehans spasmodic belief in his own claims to royaltyhe paused before the heir in the most elaborately courtly fashion and began mellifluously hath it perchance found place in the memory of the most high that this being the deathday of the sainted lady ancestress hafiz begum the dirge for her soul will be intoned by the appointed canons at the family mausoleum and as this will be the last time the last time echoed jehan haughtily how so the mans face in the balcony sharpened with sudden interest between his dissipations he was editor of the vilest broadsheet in the town a broadsheet which existed simply by virtue of its unfailing basis of firm falsehoods burkut knew this and had cast his fly dexterously now feeling the rise he allowed grave concern to overlay the yellow mask of his faceit was one of those which never change except by an effort of will because sire he replied in tones to be heard of all it is known beyond doubt that the english government being hard pressed by reason of famines and the yearly tribute to the city of london which the low value of the rupee causes to be greater every year hath an eye on the endowment of the mausoleum govind the editor stifled a yawn of disappointment that tale is old he put in contemptuously i heard it a week past from the secretariat office my cousin is clerkas i should have been but for injusticeand saw the papers it is true for see you they closed the mints so as to make the poor folk sell their silver hoards cheap and now the rupees are scarce he nodded sagely over his own political economy and as he spoke in urdu the barber as newsmonger of an older type paused in the sharpening of a razor to listen impossible interrupted jehan angrily the government is bound to uphold the shrines and services by strict promises my fathers only lent them the money on those conditions the interest was to be spent govind burst into boisterous laughter for his head was muddled his nerves unstrung by an overnight debauch ay nawabjee crores and crores of rupees lent in the old days and the interest spent now in gardens for the mems to play games in and statues to their own queen but it is no new thing i tell you i am no ignoramusi am middle fail i have read their histories and i know they took all the religious endowments in their own land andhe added louder as an ashsmeared naked figure which had been passing along the alley with the beggars cry of alakh alakh paused to listenwould have killed the religious also but for those among them like gladstone and cainesahib who say as we do that the others are tyrants and have no right to india the hotchpotch of history was interrupted by dilarams yawn hai hai brother she said keep that dreary stuff for burkut or the barberthey can spread it over folks hot imaginings like butter on a hearth cake or give it to jogijee yonder she swept her fingers to the weird figure at the door a figure whose right hand and arm withered in the ceaseless task of appealing to high heaven for righteousness showed like a dry stick pointing upwards though he and his like are never at a loss for lies hast a new one today gopi or is it still the old wonder of the golden paper which fell from the sky into one of mother kalis many embraces jest not of her sister said the jogi in a theatrically hollow voice as he thrust his left armlean as a lath yet round in comparison with that raised claim to virtuetowards her in menace thou art hers even in thy denial of her woman as she spreading disease and death mother of pain embracing the world biding thy time to slay despite the palpable striving for effect something in the words thrilled the woman beneath the courtesan and though she flicked all her supple fingers in derision there was a note of triumph in her voice talk not to me saint as to thy hindoo widows who believe in golden papers and gods yet tis true we of the bazaar lead the world by the nose govind may blacken what he likes with ink burkuts craft may spend itself in spiders webs the plague may come yea even the sniffing out of other folks smellsay and the payment for silencemay be taken from the mimbranscommittee and yet the world will wag peaceful but touch us and it is different let none meddle with the mens women or with our will or they meddle to their cost she tucked the creased shawl closer around her and squatted down once more in the sunshine the heavy sunshine in which those others sate also with a sudden fierce approval in their hearts it was highest noon and the sky was a blaze of molten light so that the shadow from a wheeling kite overhead as it sought with keen eyes amid the refuse of the city for some prize circled in sharp outline about the squalid courtyard falling on one figure flitting to another linking them together as it were by its hungry restless desire so for a space there was a drowsy silence on which the beggars cry for alms as he went on his way pausing at every door in the cramped alley rose monotonously after which burkut stifling a yawn suggested that if the heir to all things wished to receive his due recognition as head of the family at the mausoleum it was time to commence dressing whereupon jehan yawned also and demanded his shoes from lateefa who had just come in with a selected bundle of kites for choice against the evening flight i shall need none today said jehan sulkily my good time hath to be wasted in dirges and prayers for a dead old woman who is naught to me then he added aside half to himself with a frown i must see lucanastermay he roast with fire if it please god assented burkut piously then he added if it is aught i can dothe helldoomed being in my debt for some thingsi might drive a better bargain perhaps jehan had not breathed a word to any one of his windfall of pearls but certain evidences during the last two days that he had or expected to have cash had raised burkuts curiosity but jehan had no intention of having any witness to his interview least of all one to whom he owed money so he turned on burkut insolently i need no mans offices so keep thy right hand to wash thy left if there was resentment behind burkut alis yellow mask the latter hid it successfully then i will but accompany the nawab to the mausoleum he said deferentially its owner cannot go unattended it was a motley cargo which the rickety redflannellined wagonette which jehans usurer allowed him as part of the stockintrade necessary for a pensionearner carried to the stucco tombs of dead kingsfor everything including the dynasty itself had been stucco at nushapore first there was the heir in his secondbest coatee of flowered green satin then burkut burly in a yellow one to match and lateefa despite his calico gayer than either by reason of his inevitable kites finally there was the coachman in ragged livery and three attendants in rags without the livery literal hangerson clinging to the great scraperlike steps which seemed the only reliable portions of the vehicle it had not far to go however over the white road and through the clouds of dust for the mausoleum stood just outside the city in a garden that was irresistibly suggestive of a cafe chantant by reason of its stucco statuary its preparations for nightly illumination and a generally meretricious scheme of decoration the tomb itselfsquat and bulging with inconsequent domesstood on a plinth towards one end of the garden and from it as the wagonette discharged its load at the gates came the sound of monotonous chanting but this hesitated paused ceased in a murmur of the nawab as jehan with a new dignity in his manner passed up the steps and sowith a posse of cringing officials who had hurried to meet him buzzing round like beesentered the wide hall for despite the domes despite the minarets outside this tomb of dead kings was nothing else within it was just a vast oblong hall hung throughout its length with huge dusty cobwebbed glass chandeliers which taken in conjunction with the empty polished floor were suggestive of a ballroom the dancingsaloon of the cafe chantant in the very centre however of the emptiness was a low rolypoly tomb above which rose a mustyfusty baldequin which had once been stately in velvet and pearls but the moth had fretted new patterns on the curtains and the cobwebs lay like torn lace on the canopy nevertheless two faintlysmouldering silver censers standing at the foot of the tomb showed it not all neglected and something else witness to memory lay between the censers under a common glass shade such as covers the marbleandgilt timepiece of a bogus auction or the dusty waxen flowers of a cheap lodging it was the last nawabs turban of state for the rest the hall lay empty save for its officials the minor canons as it were who still received the stipends set apart by the deceased kings for due daily chantings of dirges and so clustered round jehan with courtierlike salaams but not for long since almost before they had conducted him to the royal pewan inlaid square of flooring close to the baldequina fresh arrival sent them cringing and fluttering to greet it with greed in their hungry faces the faces of custodians to whom strangers give tips and this party of english tourists looked promising if only from the reluctant way in which in obedience to a notice on the door they took off their hats and then glanced round with the thankthegoodnessandthegracewhichonmybirthhathsmiled expression which our race learns in the nursery for this is a frame of mind which leads to a contemptuous tipping of inferior races guide says thats the last johnnies capbeastly dirty isnt it said one in a churchy whisper and the others nodded in churchy silence so decorouslybarring a faint desire to try the waltzing capabilities of the floor on the part of a brother and sister in one cornerthey hesitated round the building with the halfshy halfdefiant thus far i will go but no further reluctance to admit any interest in strange places of worship which is also a sign of race and jehan from his royal square watched them oblivious of his prayers until quite calmly innocently they included him as part of the show then he rose and said to burkut who was praying to perfection behind i stay not for this and we are too soon for all thy fuss of being late twill be a good halfhour ere the dirge begins so i go to lucanastersnay he added hastily as burkut began to rise also thou canst stay here and if any of note come in my absence tell them i return so with a cunning smile leavening his scowl at the tourists he passed out in truth he was glad of the excuse which made it possible to take no one but lateefa who was to be trustedwho indeed had to be trusted in all things since he knew all thingswith him to mr lucanasters house for even if he had left burkut outside during his interview there was no saying what the latter might not have discovered or say he had discovered which would answer his purpose of pressure quite as well for jehan like most of burkuts acquaintances was quite aware of the latters method five minutes after therefore since mr lucanasters house lay conveniently close to the city and his numerous clients there jehan found himself teteatete with a shrewd commercial face intent on the scientific counting of a string of pearls with a paperknife three six nine twelve came mr lucanasters voice as the ivory slipped between the triplets of pearls fifty and five he said finally and jehan nodded fifty and five he assented what will you give me for them huzoor mr lucanaster drew a despatchbox towards him opened it looked at a paper and smiled lavishly nothing nawabsahib he said calmly for to begin with there are five short on the string there were sixty on it when it was stolen jehan nearly jumped from his chair stolen he echoed it is a liethey are minethey were my mothers the lavish smile continued exactly nawabsahib the description says so and they were stolen from government house two nights ago but i tell you it is impossiblemy house was wearing them excuse me but you sold your mothers pearls last year i happen to know because gunga mull who bought them was acting for me you had refused my direct offer if you remember and you lost a thousand rupees in consequence it is safer to trust me in the end nawabsahib put in mr lucanaster suavely but not one string protested jehan trying to be haughty this one i kept and if the huzoor does not wish to buy i can sell it elsewhere as i did before he stretched his hand for the string but mr lucanaster sate back in his chair dangling the pearls and looked at the rightful heir as a spider looks at a fly i wouldnt try if i were you nawabsahib he said slowly it might lead toto difficulties and the coincidence is not veryvery credible but if you are really in need of moneyhe spoke still more slowlythere is always the emerald let me see i offered you six thousand didnt iwell let us say eight andand nothing to be said aboutabout these he passed the pearls deftly through his fingers as if appraising them and added they are really very fine pearls nawabsahib quite noticeable pearls i havent seen better for a long time so it is a pity they are unsaleable at present by and by perhaps or in some other place does the huzoor mean began jehan blusteringly mr lucanaster looked up suddenly sharply drew the open despatchbox closer dropped the pearls into it and closed the box with a snap i mean nothing nawabsahib except that for your own sake those pearls had better stay there for the present you will only be tempted to raise money on them in the bazaar and as iif i were asked my opinion as i certainly should bewould say they were the stolen pearls it is better not to run the risk of my having to give evidence ii will complaini will go to the commissioner stammered jehan completely taken aback i wouldnt if i were you a police inquiry would be the devil to a man of your character and meanwhileuntil you let me have the emeraldheres something for current expenses jehan looked for a moment as if he would dearly have liked to fling the notes which mr lucanaster pushed over the table to him back in the donors face but he refrained money was always something and some of it might even go to pay the poisoning of this helldoomed infidel who dared to pretend he thought the pearls were stolen for jehan was shrewd enough to see the others game not that it mattered whether he pretended to think or really thought the pinch lay in that threat of a police inquiry and neither the truth nor the falsehood of a charge mitigated or increased the sheer terror of that possibility so jehan minus his pearls but with five hundred rupees in his pocket drove back to the tomb of his dead ancestors in a tumult of impotent anger he felt himself closer in the toils than he had been andnaturally enough in a man of his sortthe utmost of his rage was expended on the person over whom he had most power of retaliationthat is on noormahal why he asked himself had he been fool enough to let her get hold of the emerald again it had been within his reach and now it was gone againhoarded by a foolish woman for the sake of a barren honour barren no not altogether barren as he stood once more in the arched doorway of the mausoleum this feeling came to assuage the sting of his treatment by mr lucanaster and yet to make its smart more poignant for the assemblage had gathered the chandeliers were lit and the myriadhued flash of their prisms hid the dust hid the cobwebs and gave a new brilliance to the mourners gathered in their appointed places the tourists were gone now these were his own people they were waiting for him as he paused a new arrival entering by a side door paused alsopaused right in front of him before the glass case containing the last kings turban of state so after salaaming to it profoundly sought the square belonging to his rank jehan gave a low savage laugh of satisfaction and passed on to his here it was the first here at any rate honour was his burkut watching him swagger over to his prayers smiled if this sort of thing went on he would have his choice of fostering a real conspiracy or denouncing it that was the best of having an open mind at least two courses were always open to one so when the dirge was sung he went and paid his respects to one or two officials and then the time for gossip and kiteflying having arrived joined the worst company in nushapore where he talked sedition and backed the paper nothingnesses as they dipped and rose an inch or two only to fall again until the dusk blotted their gay colours from the sky but below the bastioned river wall abutting on the railway bridge which was the favourite meetingplace of kiteflyers the dusk brought out other colours to take their place close at hand and farther off halfway across the river and right upon its farther shore came red and green lights steady as stars until in the far distance a red changed to green the signals which had stood against the evening express dropped and it showed upon the bridge like some huge glowworm slackening speed as it came for the station lay not two hundred yards from where the bridge ended in a semifortified gateway so the train slid past below the bastioned wall almost at a foots pace and half a dozen or more english lads part of a fresh draft from england just up from bombay thrust their heads out of the window curious to see what this strange place what this strange race with which they were to have so much to do were like well i am blowed if they arent flyin kites like christians said one in a hushed voice an i thought they was all eathen i did chapter iv an unforgotten past mr raymond lady arbuthnots voice was insistent yet soft she wanted to rouse the sleeper without attracting attention and now that the waning of daylight had ended outdoor amusements people had begun to drift into the club the library tables were being rifled of the new picture papers the smoking bar was fast filling with men and sounds of womens laughter came from the quaint vaulted rooms where badminton was being continued by electric light but an almost eastern peace still lingered in certain nooks between the interlacing aisles of the building which had once been the palace of kingsand in one of these grace arbuthnot had run her quarry jack raymond to earth in a loungechair fast asleep over a french novel the remains of a stiff whiskypeg stood on a small table and grace arbuthnot looked at it vexedly then at the face but half visible in the dim light for the lamp had been deliberately turned down she had not seen it closely for twelve years except for those brief minutes at the racemeeting now nearly a week ago for rather to her indignation mr raymond had not followed up the renewal of their acquaintance by calling what is more he had emphasised the omission by writing his name in the visitors book as a perfect stranger might have done the fact had roused her antagonism she had told herself that she would decline to have that past of theirs treated as if it were not past and forgotten for though ten years ago she had certainly been engaged to jack raymond they had broken off their engagement by mutual consent with their eyes open so it was foolish to fuss about it now and so partly from this antagonism partly from a diametrically opposite motivethe inevitable womans desire to keep some hold on the man she has once lovedit had occurred to her when the days passed and brought no news of the missing jewelbox that if she were to consult any one regarding the letter it might be well to choose jack raymond he was one she knew absolutely to be trusted by any woman his positionmiserable as it was from an official point of viewgave him unusual opportunities of being able to help her and finally why oh why should he go off at a tangent and make her feel responsible and yet as she looked at his sleeping face noting its change the unfamiliarity where once all had been so familiar she frowned and turned as if to go wondering what had induced her to think of consulting this man what could he do now once upon a time when he was differentwhen he was as she recollected him the thought softened her face and sent her back to call again mr raymond he did not stir was the whiskypeg responsible for the soundness of his sleep and was she responsible for the whiskypeg she had known for years that he had drifted away as it were from everything that made life seem worth living to her but the contrast between her fate and his had never come home to her before the wife of a lieutenantgovernoras he might have been if he had not thrown up the service in a petand the secretary to the club what a miserable failure for such a man a man who for two long years had been her idealwho even now could do should do she bent towards him suddenly quite irrationally and whispered jack as she paused expectant there was a halfmischievous smile in her pretty eyes and yet they held a suspicion of tears it was such an odd world why could not a woman forget when she had ceased to care men did this one certainly hadno the still small voice had apparently taken time to filter through to its destination but it had found the chord of memory and struck it sharply yes what is it dear came the answer drowsily then jack raymond stirred stared finally woke to facts i beg your pardon lady arbuthnot he began rising hurriedly i had been playing some hard games at racquets and but you always do sleep about this time dont you ive noticed you in the distance she said coolly the suggestion in her words that she still had some right to criticise added to his surprised irritation at finding that he had somehow gone back to the past why the deuce should the memory of the very inflection of her voice as she used to say jack have come back to confuse his brain and absolutely make his heart beat yes he replied with palpable hardihood youre right i generally do sleep theres nothing else to do you see between tennis and whist but if you want any stores from the godown i am quite at your commands there is an awfully good stilton on cut if youd like some she beat her foot impatiently this thrusting forward of his duties as a sort of highclass grocer was impayable he could not think she had sought him out in order to buy stilton cheese of him and yethow like the old headstrong jack it was do tennis and whist make up your day now mr raymond she said swiftly it used not to be so the reproach in her voice was plain and he resented it she had left him to go his own way and he had gone it what business was it of hers now you forget the racing and the betting he answered coolly and my incurable idleness has at least this virtueit leaves me as i said at lady arbuthnots disposal he gave a little formal bow which sent another pang of memory through her the fact annoyed her how intolerable it was that despite his degeneration into a highclass grocerhere she smiled faintlyhe could scarcely speak a word to her here in the semidarknessthey two alonewithout bringing back ah so much yes it was intolerable it must be ignored or rather the solid sensible facts must be dragged out into the daylight and given their real significance i am glad of that she replied for i want you to help me but let us sit downpeople will be less likely to disturb us then he obeyed feeling restive under her calm superiority yet admiring it she was no failure anyhow he had been right in his choice years ago not that it mattered since all that had once been between them had been forgottenby him at any rate absolutely forgotten mr raymond she began suddenly leaning closer to him over the table surely it would be foolish in either of us to be ashamed or to pretend forgetfulness of the close tie that was between usonce i have not forgotten he said involuntarily then paused disconcerted at his own collapse which was true his denial or affirmation of memory both in a way she smiled as women do at remembrance even when they believe they wish forgetfulness i said pretend mr raymond she corrected we are not likely to forget why should we on the other hand why should we remember he asked the past lady arbuthnot is past the very idea of his thinking it necessary to assert this made her frown exactly so therefore i come to you because memory gives me a friend nothing more and i need a friend just now you have plenty of them to choose from he began you always had and i choose you she put in with a charming little nod he sat bewildered for a moment then said stiffly may i ask why if i may answer by the question why not surely we need not be strangers and besides and besideshe echoed grimly a womans second reason is generally better than her first lady arbuthnots face grew grave mine is mr raymond infinitely better what i want your help for is no mere personal matter it is something in which you might do a yeomans service to the government you are very kind he interrupted brusquely but as i thought you knew i found out twelve years ago that the government could do very well without my services it might have done better with them you are very kind he repeated and this difficulty of yours she flushed up excuse me it was you not i who wandered from the point i knew my reasons for choosing your help however let us stick to business i have lost a jewelcase so i heard he said and i am sorry it should have contained your pearls pearls she thought vexedly did he think she had come to him about the pearls that was but a step better than stilton cheese his following words however disarmed her they belonged to your mother i remember they were beautiful pearls yes she assented softly and paused but it is not the pearls she went on i will tell you what it is and why i am anxious he sat listening to her story with rather a bored look it is most unlikely the letter will turn up he said at last an indian thief would throw it away even though as you say it was in a sealed official envelope he knows nothing of the value of documents but it is a pity you kept it for that matter had it that sort of thing is a mistake something in his tone made her say quickly you blame fatherwhy you know how he trusted mehow you she felt inclined to remind him of his own confidence in her but she refrained remember i have always been in the swim he suggested could i help that she asked feeling him unfair what i mean is that every one even my husband i have always heard you do a great deal for sir george he said nastily regretting his unfairness even as he spoke he need not have done so save for his own sake since her defence annihilated him as i would have done for you mr raymond ii beg your pardon he said limply feeling himself a brute this paper or letter then as i understand it would have been a sort of safeconduct to prevent the authorities rounding on sir george after the event as they are apt to do asa thought seemed to strike him and he looked at her sharplyas they did on me your experience has been useful to you lady arbuthnot she flushed up again how could i prevent its being so i am not a fool but you know quite well i do not come to you on his account it is because i am so afraid of the contents of that unfortunate letter leaking out with this general election going on he shrugged his shoulders and rose i am no politician as i told you but as a personal matter she rose also and challenged him with eyes voice and manner i do not choose it to be a personal matter it is more than that it might concern the prestige the honour of our government surely you must still care for that you used he interrupted her with a laugh it would be in a parlous state if it depended on me i dont trouble my head about patriotism nowadays i assure you she came a step nearer as if to bar a hint he gave of leaving is that possible she asked almost sternly within gunshot as we stand now of a place where englishmen died in hundreds to keep the hand of their race upon the plough of india the lightness had no choice but to pass from his face mine left it ten years ago lady arbuthnot he said his voice matching hers and yours excuse me is not the one to wile it back but for your husbands sakenot for yours that past is pasti will she lost her temper absolutely then who thinks who wishes it otherwise can you not understand my motive in coming to you perfectly he said coolly you feel responsiblewhy god knows for the hash i have made of my life i speak from your point of view remember of course nothing i can say will mitigate this feeling it is a habit you good women have now i as a man should have thought that the palpable result of my going my own way instead of yours would have given you the certainty of having been right in refusing to countenance it she did not speak for a second and when she did there was a tremor in her voice that doesnt lessenthethe pity of it she said half to herself it is pitiful even if you had any one wife or child she broke off and added apologetically one can scarcely help regrets once more the man in him felt annihilated by the revelation of the woman in her mymy dear kind lady he said touched in spite of himself i can assure you i get along splendidly all round youre all too kind and as for the kids he added half nervously for she looked as if she would cry and he wished to cheer her up im chums with the lot of them jerry for instance what a ripping little chap he issuch a lot of go but he isnt a bit like you she stood looking at him without replying for a moment and the halfpuzzled expression which had been in her face when she had watched him and the child standing handinhand at the racecourse returned to it no she said nor like his father he has harked back in face to my mothers peopleshe was a distant cousin of your fathers you remember and in mindwho knows but im glad you like him he returns the compliment it seemed so indeed for jerry himself appearing that instant had his hand tucked into jack raymonds even before he delivered his message which was to the effect that dad was wanting mum to go home he gabbled this through in order to say with a military formality learned to his great delight from captain lloyd ah sir im glad its you cos it isnt weally dark an miss dwummonds weading the spectator so its just the time for you to show me the pwoperest places in the garden mound please as you pwomised you would i mean the places where people was blown upor deaded somehow you bloodthirsty young ruffian laughed jack raymond feeling relieved at the interruption all right come along i promised to take him round and tell him about the defence lady arbuthnot he explained but perhaps you will allow me to find your carriage for you first thanks she replied curtly my husband will do that goodnight mr raymond i am sorry i was not so successful in my request asas my son he stared after her yet once more women were inexplicable here was this one quite happily marriedhe had known that for yearsand yet she would have likedwhat the deuce would she have liked he turned half impatiently to the child and said come along young briton and be sentimental over the past come and contemplate the deeds of your ancestors and make believe youre a hero thats the game but i am going to be one when im growed up you know protested jerry the man paused and looked down at the child if you get the chance dear little chap he said bitterly but the mischief is that what with express trains and telegrams youve seldom to do more than youre told to do and so most of the cbs and vcs are given for doing ones simple duty my dads a cb commented the child sagely but then he can do his compound duties too can you can i echoed the man and his voice belied the inevitable smile on his face well i dont know i expect i could jerryif i tried so handinhand the two boy and man crossed the carriagedrive which lay between the club and the rising ground beyond it ground kept as a garden in memory of the deeds which had blossomed in its dust for on that scarce perceptible mound the english flag taking advantage of every available inch to stand its highest had floated for nine long months over the rebel town of nushapore had floated securely though the hands which held it grew fewer and weaker day by day had floated royally though kings palaces challenged it from the right challenged it from the left and now more than forty years after the moundset thick with blossoming treesstretched as a peaceful lawn between those palaces still but the one was an english club and the other government house thats the gate jerry said jack raymond where gunner smith asked the mutineersthey were only three feet from the wall you knowto oblige him with a pipe light because he had been so long on duty that he had run short jerry laughed vaingloriously uproariously that was to cheek em sir wasnt it sir for of course he didnt care if he never smoked no more so long as he kept em outside oh isnt it just orful nicehere he heaved a sigh of pure delight and now please i want where boys like me did sentry an where the guns got wedhot and boomed off of emselves an where every one blowed emselves up like in a stwawbewwycweam smash becos the enemy was cweepin cweepin in dont you know the childs voice ran on eager joyous hopeful and the man was conscious of a thrill that seemed to pass into his own veins from that little clasping hand all in good time jerry dont rush your fences replied jack raymond and the thrill seemed to have invaded his voice so across the lawns and along the winding walks bosomed in tall trees where the birds were twittering their nightly quarrel for the uppermost roostingplace those two boy and man the present and the future of the race with its unforgotten past linking them strolled handinhand and the daylight lingering with the moonlight lay handinhand also lay softly kindly upon all things this is the east battery jerry said the man in a hushed voice to match the peace of the garden campbellhe was a relation of your mothers by the way and so a sort of relation of minenever left it for five months he is here still if it comes to that for he was literally blown to bits at last by a shell he was trying to throw back on the enemy hed done it dozens of times before but this timewas the last there was not much to see only a slab in the dim grass with east battery cut upon it mum told me about that said jerry in an awed whisper his name was gerald same as minehe paused to look doubtfully at the face above himshe said it was an eggsample to me but im not goin to be blowed up first my shellsll always burst just in the vewy wightest places bang in the middle of the enemy so i can laugh at em before i dead jack raymond passing on felt a pang always in the very rightest places that had been the dream of another boyhood the sky was as a pearl overhead a pearl set in a darkening tracery of trees the moon began to stretch faint fingers of shadow after the retreating day and still those two man and boy passed from one immemorial deed to another while the small hand sent its thrill to the big one so that jack raymond wondered at the tremor in his voice as he said pointing through the trees and theres the generals house with the english flag flying still jerry stiffened like a young pointer on its first covey every inch of him centred on the grey tower its flagstaff draped dimly with the royal ensign which rose against the sky then standing square head up he saluted mum told me to do that always when i saw it he explained because its the only place in all the wide wide world where the flag flies day and night to show you know that it never was hauled downnevernever he heaved another sigh of satisfaction but his face took a puzzled expression only you know ive been here before i weally have i wemember it quite quite well an the guns was booming an they was wanting to pull down the flag an i wouldnt let them jack raymond looked down at the child and smiled you or some one of your sort dear old chap and ill bet youd do it again wouldnt you jerry jerry pulled himself together from the mysterious inheritance of the past im goin to some day he said succinctly an now please i want where they buried em after dark all pwoper wif surplices an safe safe home in port and all that but torches and crackbang firings over the wallsthough they was deaders already the description confused though it was by excess of picturesqueness sent jack raymond unerringly towards the little cemetery where so many heroes rest but ere they reached the gate a womans figure showed upon a sidepath theres miss drummond youll have to go home now young man remarked jack raymond feeling that though jerrys enthusiasm did not bore him lesleys might but jerry would have no excuse oh he said confidentially she is only a woman you tell her to come and shell come all wight jack raymond looked towards the springy step and determined pose of the head which was approaching him with alarm but jerry had already run forward slipped his hand into the girls and said he says youre to come too because he is going to tell us all about the gwaves not all protested jack raymond resignedly but if miss drummond can spare us a minute ill show you john ellisons the girls face lit up isnt that about all she asked quickly the very name seems to dominate the place still janalishan thats what the natives call him your father says jerry it means the spirit of kings a good name isnt it for the man who held this garden against all comers even starvation her head was up her voice rang but the thrill did not pass to the mans heart from these as it had from the clasp of that little hand which some day would have a mans grip there was a heap of bunkum talked though about the actual physical privations of the mutiny time they had iced soda and moselle cup on the ridge at delhi you know miss drummond he said out of pure contrariety i should like to be sure of that she began indignantly i should like to be sure of a lot of mutiny tales he interrupted but theres a halo of romance on our side and a shadow of fear on theirs which plays the deuce with abstract truth i wish we could forget the whole business forget forget our glorious past was it so glorious i asked budlu oncehe pointed to a white ghostlike figure which had begun to follow them from the cemetery gatehow a mere handful of us here kept their thousands at bay budlu is supposed to have been inside during the siege as a childs bearerthats why they made him caretaker but ive reason to believe he was outsidenot that it matters now well his answer was the sahibs had nothing to do with it it was the dead women and the dead babies every one knows that the strength of the strongest man is water before the ghost of a mother and child they had reached the slope of that gentle hollow where even in their bitterest stress the living had crept obstinately under cover of night to lay their dead to rest in the shadow of the deserted church and he paused to point downwards to a tall cypress and add there is john ellisons grave lesley paused too calm and still in the moonlight the grassy slopes set with flowers and blossoming shrubs seemed to centre on that hollow of heroes graves as they in their turn centred round the plain plinth with its marble slab under the cypress tree there were but two words on itjohn ellisonbut they filled the eye the heart the brain lesley drummond stood looking at them silently and jack raymond stood watching her approving her silence but jerry whose round childish face had a curious ghostly look on it as if he were seeing visions went creeping on round the plinth his grey eyes wide a stealthy little figure dreaming of torches and deaders and crackbang firings over walls but he was back in a second his face eager startled oh if you pleasehes quite quite shotlyin there close by hadnt we better buwy him bury him who asked lesley but jack raymond had grasped the childs meaning and was passing to the other side of the plinth to see for himself then he looked up from the figure of a man which lay on its back its head supported on the first step of the plinth asked a question of budlu the caretaker in hindustani and finally turned reassuringly to lesley it is only an idle sweep of a loafer miss drummond who has rather a queer story stay ill wake himbudlu reports him soberand he will tell the story himself ive no doubt as he spoke a vigorous shake roused the sleeper to an oath then to a stare finally to a bland smile as he rose bin overtook by slumber sir said a rich mellow voice as possibly in evasion of more salient faults in his personality the owner of it began to brush away the dust and dry twigs which clung to his dirty drillclothing the wich we all of us shall be wen our time comes to lie within the silent toombb he prolonged the final syllable into a reminiscent humming of a funeral hymn until his task was done then he looked up and showed in the moonlight the face of a man about forty smooth shaven of the bulldog type with the mobile lips of a born comedian i done my level best with the job you giv me down country sir he continued affably yet with a furtive apology lurking beneath his assurance but it done no sort of dooty by me i gone down two stone in a six weeks with them pestilential chills so wot with plague follerin famine like the prayerbook sir i made bold to cut back to nushapore i adnt a grave bespoke there sir as i ave here an so i didnt want no deaths bright angel speakin in a chord agaain once more that prolongation of the final syllable was followed by an appropriate tune if you dont mend your ways my man said jack raymond severely youll have no grave bespoke here either the authorities wont allow cant elp emselves sir interrupted the loafer touching the battered billycock hat which he had resumed after a careful dusting its the queens regulations sir that them as went through the siege may wait for the las trump in an eros grave beside is if they choose an lord love you i do choose for they chrisen me in token i shouldnt fear the very day e died he laid his hand on the slab that was why they called you john ellison wasnt it asked jack raymond with a sidelook at lesley which the loafer appraised for he replied coolly yes mlady mr raymon e know the story correc my father died o the drink a few days afore we come into the garding mound an my mothersavin your presence mlady she didnt ave bin to church with im through er real usband aving deserted er or died cruel uncertainshe popped off a few days after i so to speak popped in that was nigh on a ninemonths sequent so i was through the siege mlady from the beginnin an avin no one to promise an vow when they

raymon good gentleman e ave put me in to a many jobs but only local demons they aint someow bin no sort of permanent an so the world goes round and round until our life with sleep is crowneddd he was fairly afloat this time with his rich mellow voice when jack raymond bid him shut up and not play the fool why couldnt he stick to work when it was given him the jauntiness disappeared in a curiously dignified dejection by the lord oo made me sir he said contritely i dunno i begins well thenii dont i git on the lap foolin round them bazaars until i avent a feather ter fly with then e begin to dror me to imm he paused again to indicate the slab and the final syllable merged into the whole first line of they grew in beauty side by side beg parding sir he went on anticipating reproof but the warblin fetches me ome so often wot with penny gaffs an such like that it gits a continooal hold on me too frequent youll lay hold of nothing else soon retorted jack raymond youre out of work now i suppose jes so sir ready for active service and ive a great mind to let you find it for yourself however youre in the strangers home i suppose as usual as usooal sir came the cheerful reply and as they passed on the mellow rich tenor followed them in a florid rendering of home sweet home it echoed through the hollow of heroes over the graveset slope where the descendants of those who held the fort are allowed burial and so passed with the little party to the gate here budlu who had followed all the time ghostlike silent made some petition in urdu to which jack raymond replied with a smile he said something about janalishan didnt he asked lesley you must excuse the curiosity but i am naturally anxious to learn everything about india a most laudable ambition im sure he replied drily budlu only wanted to know miss drummond if janalishan was going back to his grave tonight for if not it would be better to leave the cemetery gate openhe usually locks it at sundown janalishan she echoed aghast he cant call that wretched creaturehe cant think jack raymond interrupted her i dont know very much about the possibilities or impossibilities of india though ive lived in it for twenty years but i do happen to know that half nushapore has a sneaking idea that the wretched creature is well a sort of emanation of the great john ellison he has the same strain you see of sheer devilry pluck ability call it what you willthe something that makes its mark on eastern people and they think he comes for revenge because as you heard him say he is in such a mortal funk of being cheated out of an eros grave if he dies away from nushapore that he always comes back when theres trouble about the natives are quick to notice such things well he may have his tens of thousands this year you mean that the plague will come and a row too if we arent careful jerrys hand tightened on jack raymonds a weal wow sir with sieges and everything sieges well i dont know what do you want sieges for young man the childs face showed confident because i want an eros grave of my vewy own like what that mans got an it wouldnt be doginthemangery like two pieces of cake miss dwummond cos i could lend it to other people till i weally did want it but if it was my vewy own you seehe hesitated then a sudden comprehension seemed to come to himthen i could fight all the vewy biggest big boys wifout caring for i could pop into my gwave an laugh at em even if i was lickedcoscos i should have won weallyshouldnt i sir the moon shone clear on the ruins before them and all around them hidden in the shadows of the trees lay the little world which forty years before had defied a big one through the still silence came only that twittering of birds fighting for a roostingplace until the mans voice said evenly it is a question jerry how far high failure overleaps the bound of low successes ask miss drummond i dont know the answering womans voice came swiftly surely this is no place for an englishman to talk of failure he turned sharply so this girl was at it now she too wanted to rouse him she had heard the storyor part of it i almost wish it were he answered bitterly then we might forget it but the glory of it gets to our headswe come back to it again and again he stopped abruptly for a tenor voice rose in sweet undertones upon that twittering of birds there is a green hill far away outside a city wall the singing and the faint crush of gravel ceased together as the singer passing them drew up and touched the old billycock hat beg parding sir said john ellison loafer but praps youd care to ear there was a man dead o plague taken out o the train i come in this mornin thanks replied jack raymond i know there have been several isolated cases jes so sir not as theres so much isolation not to speak of in them thirdclass cattlepens assented the mellow voice and as the footstep passed on it kept time to the refrain of wait for the wagon and well all take a ride i expect we shall remarked jack raymond grimly and his mind reverted to grace arbuthnot and her husband there might be need for that safeconduct ere long well they must manage things as best they could he wouldnt oh i do hope therell be a wow a weal wow came jerrys prayerful voice chapter v shark lane there was no quainter spot in all nushapore than shark lane as the road near the public offices where the lawyers congregated was generally called though at first sight it seemed to differ little from its neighbours broad white its treeset margins were studded with the usual inconsequentlooking stucco gateposts of an indian station which guiltless of any fence serve to mark the short carriagedrives leading back to the houses and these againcolourwashed pink yellow or bluewere even as other houses of the secondclass yet it did not need the placards on those same gateposts announcing that mr lala ram nath or mr syyed abdul rahman barristersatlaw lived within to tell the passerby that the inhabitants were not european to begin with somewhere or another there was almost sure to be a grass hurdle visiblethe grass hurdle which in india does the duty of a hoarding and ensures privacy indeed a knowledgable eye could infer the exact degree to which the social life within was at variance with the western architecture in which it dwelt by the number and position of such hurdles two or three merely blocking in an arch of verandah being indicative of a lingering dislike to publicity in some new woman a dozen or more screening in a patch of garden ground showing the rigorous seclusion of the old true in not a few cases this sign was absent but then a nameless air of utter desolation a blank stare out on the world told its tale of a keener quarrel stillof family ties family life lost absolutely in the chase after western ways western ideas in such houses the only sign of life from dawn to dusk barring a furtive wielder of a grass broom raising clouds of dust at stated intervals would be the rickety hired carriage like a green box on wheels which every morning and every evening would turn out and in between those inconsequent gateposts conveying a solitary young man and a pile of lawbooks to and from the courts such a very solitarylooking young man that the question sprang inevitably to the spectators lips is the game worth the candle there were others besides spectators in shark lane who asked the question and were not sure of the answer miriambibi hafiz ahmads wife for instance who as aunt khojee put it had been taken away to live as a mem felt it was not of course it was dignified to eat in one room sit in another and sleep in a third as if this trinity of habit were heavens decree then undoubtedly small bronze feet did look entrancing in small bronze highheeled shoes but when there could be no novelreading no writing of notes no arranging of flowers and playing of the piano and when you were accustomed to eat and sleep when the fancy took you then one room was quite sufficient in which to be dull and solitary since there were no friends or relations near to come in for a gossip besides it was undeniable that the pretty bronze shoes pinched the toes that were accustomed to greater freedom therefore it was a joy indeed when on sundays the green box on wheels instead of taking hafiz ahmad to court took her back to the close familiar city to the evilsmelling bazaars below and the scented sensual womans life above so full of laughter and quarrelling so full of sunshine and seclusion with its unending suggestion of sex full also to miriams intense delight of betelchewing and tobaccosmoking for though hafiz ahmad permitted neither in shark lane he never noticed the resultant signs of either on her return so proving himself possessed of that masters degree in the art of compromise which young india has to take before attempting even a bachelors in any other for even miriam found singlemindedness impossible in shark lane and her eulogiums on her new life had to be so strenuous in the city that even simple aunt khojee remarked that wise hens never cackled over their own nests unless they were empty on monday mornings too after her debauch in city ways miriam found it necessary to be aggressively european she would even go so far as to eat the lightlyboiled egg of civilisation for her breakfastthe egg which calls for saltcellars and spoons in other words for refinement and luxury and when her husband had departed in the green box with his lawbooks she would yawn dutifully in all three rooms till nature could no more so she would send surreptitiously for the cooks wife and baby and adjourn to a hurdleclosed verandah where her visitors could be properly screened from the new world since let the master do as he chose there would have been noses on the green in the servants house had its womenkind allowed the tips of theirs to be seen by strangers so miriam would be comparatively content till the advent of the green box sent her back to three rooms and a pair of bronze slippers on the whole this double life of hers was a very fair example of most lives in shark lane where despite all the high aspirations after truth and reality it was quite impossible to reach either since every one was quite aware that they were trying an experiment and that a doubtful one this was the case more especially in the last house in shark lane just where it merged into the more fashionable river road here at the corner a very decorative pair of posts announcing that mr chris davenant lived within stood cheek by jowl beside a similar pair with mr lucanasters name upon them and though one of the two houses was screened it was screened by trellises and creepers behind which a pale pink dress could often be seen fluttering in company with the owner of the other house for mrs chris davenant claimed her full share of western liberty so large a share indeed that one morning a few days after the races krishn davenund as shark lane persisted in calling him sate looking hopelessly at his untouched breakfast in this case also that lightlyboiled egg of civilisation it stood in a correct silver eggstand beside a charming arrangement of ferns and flowers for miss genevieve fuller now mrs chris had been that curious product of latterday london a vulgar girl of good taste as she had walked along the streets her fringe delicately wanton beneath the white veil whose black spots were never permitted to rest in unbecoming places her cold blue eyes had settled unerringly on all the daintiest creations in the shop windows and she would pause before a handpainted sortie de bal or a belaced silk undergarment and say with equal frankness to her companion male or female my that would give poor little me a chance wouldnt it even some of the thirdrate young men from the city over whom she had wielded a cheap empire at her mothers boardinghouse down the hammersmith road had found such remarks reminiscent of the princess from whose pretty lips toads fell instead of pearls but krishn davenund student at the middle temple did not know his mother goose having an all too intimate acquaintance with the poets however the superficial refinement of the girl seen against the background of the only english life he knew had made him think of the lady in comus for he could have no standard save that of books she looked dainty enough for any heroines part even now after eighteen months disillusionment as she stood before him in a paucity of pink muslin neglige which had mostly run to frills and a plenitude of powder she had an open note in one hand a halfsmoked turkish cigaretteof mr lucanasters importingin the other and a rather bored goodnature on her face as she looked at the man she had married because her good taste had told her the truth namely that he was betterlooking and betterbred than any of her other admirers it had been a hideous mistake of course but she was shrewd enough to see that the shock of finding on his return to india that there was literally no place for him in it had been quite as painful to her husband as to herself so she exonerated him of blame with a sort of contemptuous pity and an absolute lack of sympathy it was nothing to her for instance that apart from the temporal loss of finding himself only the son of a hindoo widow who had reverted to the most bigoted austerity on her husbands death instead of the son of a man high up in government service whose position had made unorthodoxy tolerable to relations and friends alike he should have come back to find a change in himself to feel a wild revolt against the renewed contact with things which he had literally left behind him five years before the things themselves were too hopelessly incredibly trivial and childish for her to do anything but laugh at them so he had soon ceased even to mention them though they meant far more to him despite the mission school training which is the foundationculture of nearly all young india his religion was a mere ethical sense an emotional yielding to the attraction of everything to which the epithet higher could be appliedmathematics and morals alike and the givingin to the disgusting rites necessary before he could reenter native society on equal terms with those even who were of lower caste than himself had seemed to him degrading so despite his mothers prayers and the advice of other men who in like position had purchased comfort by acquiescence he had refused to be made clean on the offered terms with this result that the only familiar touch left to him was that which this woman in the demimondaine pink neglige laid on his shoulder as after a time she flung the note down on the table and with a tolerant laugh paused beside him on her way from the room dont be a fool chris she said cheerfully you cant be expected to understand of course so im not really angry it is all right old man heaps of english women do that sort of thing and im going to anyhow so its no good fussing he made no reply he seemed even to himself to have nothing to say nothing that could be said at any rate since the fierce claim for silence and submission even if it entailed the disposal of a corpse which he had inherited from his fathers had to be smothered so he only stared at the note which lay face uppermost it began dearest jenny and he called his wife viva the difference of style epitomised the situation since she preferred the jenny it reminded her of bank clerks and the top of the hammersmith omnibus he realised this now for he was no fool only a reader of books a believer in theories a dreamer of dreams who in the almost brutal blaze of an indian sun had awakened not to realitiesthat was impossible to one who still had no guide save booksbut to a new attempt at dreams one which made him say pompously after the fashion in novels i do not wish it viva and you will please to remember that i am your husband his english barring a faintly foreign intonation was perfect but his wife laughed dont chris it doesnt suit the part besides we were only married at the registrars so if you want a wife of that sort lucanaster says you can marry one if i dont object ive been thinking about it and i dont think i should he stood up and threw his hands out passionately ere covering his face with them and the action utterly unenglish as it was suited him better than his previous calm itits a lie to begin with he cried hoarsely and even if it werenti wont have it saiditit makes me lose myself she drew back a bit and looked at him youve done that already chris and sove i she said calmly now dont interrupt please ive been fizzling for this talk the last month for we shall rub along together so much better when we thoroughly understand each other so im not going to pretend any more chris it doesnt work i tried it at first becausewell because you mean well and i like to make things comfy while i can but im sick of shark lane some of the men wouldnt be bad if they werent so awfully hightonedthats whats the matter with you chrisbut the women beat me i went to see that little fool hafiz ahmads wife yesterday because im a goodnatured fool myself and she said she was dull and you asked me and as i say i like things comfy well she wanted me to play old maid and the cards wereoh filthy that finished me of course it was only a trifle but it did the trick ive chucked i wont play the game any more chris i am going my own way and if you want to see shark lane here i shall be somewhere else you neednt bother or fuss i can take care of myself perfectlyi went about london a lot you know besides doesnt it stand to reason that im a better judge of what an english lady can do than you are why i might as well try and teach you the etiquette of those disgusting temples where your precious stayathome women worship inin the altogether she giggled modestly and then seeing his face gave him a final pat cheer up chris im sure you could marry onea cousin or somethingif you tried he interrupted her with a listless nerveless dignity you seem to think it all pretence but i couldnt go back to the old ways thisthis has meant more to me than that his lips quivered as if with coming tears he had to pull himself together visibly for the rest he went on drearily i am not quite so ignorant as you deem me one reads ofof this sort of situation and i can shape my course as other men have shaped theirs onlyonly do not try my patience too far he meant the last in all seriousness but neither the thought nor the words were his own and the pathos of this despairing clutch on bookknowledge being of course lost on her commonplace vulgarity she laughed once more why chris youve got that as pat as pat quite the injured hub in domestic drama goody me to think i might be going down still on the top of the dear old red bus to the mouth of the pit on a first night well thats over so we must just both be as chirpy as we can goodbye chris ive got to dress for lucanaster s coming for me in half an hour and dont expect me till you see me they did talk of tents out a dance and a regular night of it you really neednt fuss chris you cant understand you see when she had gone he sate staring helplessly at the boiled egg as if he expected something to hatch out of it even thought forsook him for the first to come was that this woman was his wife wife the word conjured up such a different idea in the hereditary experience which inevitably underlay all things in him that he could go no further in bewilderment so in the effort to escape from the thraldom of the old wisdom which such as he have to make so often he took up the newspaper which lay beside him telling himself passionately that the old order had changed that life held more than his fathers had dreamt of yet even as he told himself this the burden of doubt which such as he have to bear came upon him a sense of unreality even in himself closed round him unreal unreal unreal the word typed itself on the columns of the voice of india as he read them the paper was the recognised organ of his class the exponent of its desires its beliefs yet here even that word pursued him here on the first page was a leader stigmatising the temporary withdrawal of independent powers from the municipal committee as an unwarrantable piece of tyranny unwarrantable was it possible for any sane man to call it so knowing as all knew the grievous tale of neglect and wrongdoing in that committee was it possible even apart from that for any wise man not to see that with plague clamouring for an entrance the good of the many claimed a more energetic sanitary reform than the committee seemed able or willing to introduce and as for the hints thrown out that the newlypublished plague regulations were but a sop a blind hiding a very different policy what then was it possible for any government to do more than legislate for the present who but fools imagined that it could or would bind itself to definite action in conditions which could only be guessed at so the tale of unreality went on here was a wellwritten wellreasoned article on the cowkilling grievance but chris being a wielder of the pen himself happened to know the writer and could remember seeing him eating beefsteaks at the temple dinners again in a paragraph headed government greed and peasant poverty could any detail overcome the indubitable fact that india had the cheapest civilised government in the world he ran his eye down another column and caught the phrase social progress above a signature which he knew to be that of a man who had just married a child of ten and what was this the government to which is opposed the entire intelligence of the nation brave words these when the proportion between such intelligence and the general ignorance was withheld what was it ten thousand to one the political training of the mass of the people is still it is true somewhat incomplete it might well be that when the percentage of mere literates was almost negligible even the mohammedan policy was better than the english one true it did not allow freedom of the press ye gods freedom of the press when there was not a newspaper in all the length and breadth of the land could unreality bunkum call it what you will go further than that chris pushed himself back from the table back from the boiled egg back from the newspaper back so far as he could from himself with an odd sound between a laugh a sob and a curse was that all was that sort of ungenerous unreliable almost unimaginable drivel the only indictment which such as he had to bring against those who had depolarised life who had neither given india a creed nor taken one away was that the only arraignment for the tyranny of pain such as his no a thousand times no there was more to be said than that so to him came the fatal facility for words which is the betrayal of his race he sate down to write and heedless of the sound of dogcart wheels and a mans and a womans laughter which came after a time did not rise until he stood up with sheets on sheets of scarcedried manuscript in his hand feeling for the first time in his intellectual life that he was alone hitherto he had always followed the thoughts of the great masters hitherto there had always been some one on the road before him now the question a burning one to his enthusiasm waswould any one come after him hafiz ahmads house the rallyingpoint of young india in nushapore lay close by it was a courtholiday and therefore the chances were great that some meeting or another was being held since meetings are a recognised holiday amusement with those who amid all the unreality of their lives are still terribly in earnest he would go there and seek an audience on his way out however he saw jack raymond riding up the drive jack raymond one of the few englishmen he could count on to be kind yet who despite that had never called on his wife was he going to do so now as a matter of fact jack raymond had had no such intention he had come over to ask chris himself about a post which was vacant and which might keep john ellison loafer out of more mischief but seeing chris coming towards him with a pleased expectant look on his somewhat pathetic face a halfirritated pity made him ask if mrs davenant was at home im sorry she has gone out with lucanaster he repeated unaware of the emphasis he laid on the qualification till he saw poor chris flinch when he said hurriedly but ill come in if i may ive a question or two i want to ask whereupon chris who despite his five years of england and his wifes incessant instructions had never been able to grasp that exclusive use of certain rooms to certain uses took jack raymond straight into the diningroom where amongst the litter of an unfinished breakfast a note on which quite inadvertently the visitor set his ridingwhip lay face uppermost that dearest jenny therefore stared jack raymond in the face all the time he was settling that john ellison should go for a weeks trial as foreman on the new goods station which chris was building he knew the writing and had what poor chris had not a fixed standard of inherited and acquired experience by which to judge the writer and so a curious mixture of pity and repugnance came to the englishman as he looked at the face opposite himthe gentle face so full of intelligence so devoid of characterand thought of that other coarser commoner one it was a question of the two men only the woman dismissed briefly as a bad sort counted for nothing in jack raymonds mind yet if lucanaster had been an englishman it is ten to one that jack raymond would not have said abruptly as he did say when he rose to take up his ridingwhip if i were you davenant i wouldnt let my wife be seen with that man lucanaster of course you cant be expected toto knowbut hes an awful sweep as he spoke his knowledge of himself made him clutch his whip tightly but chris only stood silent for a moment with a wild appeal in his soft eyes then he tried to speak finally he sate down again and buried his face in his hands the straining of the long brown fingers tense in their effort to keep back tears the longdrawn breath trying to keep back sobs made jack raymonds pity fly before impatient contempt im sorry its evidently worse than i thought he said but that sort of thing isnt a bit of good davenant put your foot down say you wont have it chris davenants face came up from his hands with the dignity of absolute despair how can i didnt even you say just now i couldnt be expected to understand she says it too and ive no answer how can i have one when there is no place for meor for her that is it if she had friendsif there was any one to careany one even to be angry but there is no one his head went into his hands again and the pity born of clearer comprehension came back to the englishman like the dove of old with widespread white wings and like the dove of old it brought a suggestion of calmer days to come with it i hadnt thought of it that way he said slowly but i see your point a lead over keeps many a horse between the flags and ill get one for your wife if i can lady arbuthnot is an old friend of minehe was faintly surprised at himself for this remark which came quite naturallyand im sure she will send an invitation to the government house gardenparty then theres the fete and the service ball it may seem a queer cure to you everything is queer admitted chris trying to be cheerful but i know she felt not being askedi remember her saying he broke off for the remark had been briefly that it was no use considering the proprieties if the proprieties didnt consider you well thats settled shell find the invitations when she comes back then therell be the dresses you know and all that chris shook his head i am not sure if i do it is all new but it is more than kind of you if i could do anything for you in return the unreserved gratitude in his face was sufficiently womanish not to rouse the english distaste to all expression of emotion though even so jack raymond put it aside jestingly thank lady arbuthnot my dear fellow shehe paused a remembrance coming to himby the wayyoure in i know with all the voice of india scribblerswrite for it yourself dont you well what is the meaning of those hints about the plague policy what have they got hold of anything definite so far as i know nothing began chris it is i fear a regrettable fact that there is seldom good foundation jack raymond reins in hand swung himself into his saddle lightly yes thank god well if you should hear of anything or if you should have a chance ofsay burking anything likely to upset the applecartthe times are a trifle ticklish in the citytake your gratitude to me or rather to lady arbuthnot out in that chris flushed up surely he began volubly it is the bounden duty as i have just been writing of the educated portion of the community to leave themselves free for reasonable criticism by supporting government wherever possible by throwing heart and soul the englishman holding his impatient mount in a grip of iron looked down with a bored expression no doubtno doubt but the body fills a gap better on the whole goodbye ill see to the invites and you can drop me a line if you hear anything definite chapter vi the money of fools finally sirs came a high straining voice as chris davenant entered hafiz ahmads house the educated youngster of india refuses to let his soaring aspirations remain cribbed cabined confined in the cruel shackles of a political despotism without parallel in the whole history of civilisation the peroration though it seemed to afford the speaker much satisfaction only induced that faint desultory clapping which in england is reserved for prizedays at school that impersonal applause for the results of diligence which remembers that other pupils have yet to speak this was the case here and chris had barely wedged himself into a chair between a writingtable and a wastepaper basket before another orator was in full swing of adjective the row of bicycles in the verandah and a knot of those greenbox hired carriages outside on the road had told chris already that he had been right in calculating on an assemblage of young india but this was a larger gathering than he had expected and he remembered suddenly with a vague shamesince he was a prominent member of the organisationthat it must be the monthly meeting of the society for promoting the general good of people he had quite forgotten all about it still here he was and here was his audience for that roll of manuscript he held he glanced round the double roomfor both dining and drawingroom had been thrown open rather to miriambibis relief since she could now sit unreservedly in the screened verandah and play beggar my neighbour with her fostermother who did duty as ayahand recognised almost every one of note in young nushapore hafiz ahmad was in the chair of course a rather fat young man of the coarser mohammedan type with a short curly beard like many others in the room he wore a scarlet fez though why this distinctive bit of a turks costume should be grafted on a quasienglish quasiindian one is a mystery not to be beaten in incomprehensibility by any other minor problem of our indian empire beside him was lala ram nath the head in nushapore of the only real political organisation in india that is the arya somaj an organisation all the more dangerously political because it denies the basis of politics and appeals to that of religion he chris knew would be the last to admit the position taken up in the roll of manuscript namely that it was suicidal on the part of the little leaven of educated natives to pose as the party of opposition since that was briefly to array itself permanently inevitably against what none could deny was the party of progress the party which had made this little leaven itself a possibility ram nath the breath of whose nostrils was adverse criticism to government who in bewildering defiance of the laws which govern indian life had swallowed redhot radicalism wholesale like a juggler swallowing a redhot poker was not likely to admit this at any time still less now when he was the champion of a wrongfully dispossessed municipal committee chris knew exactly what the lala would say and what the majority of the young menthere was not one over thirtyfive in the roomwould say also and yet their faces were brimful of intelligence of a certain eager earnestness it could hardly be otherwise since the mere fact of their being in that room proved them to be of those whose faculty and desire for acquiring knowledge was so far superior to that of the average man that it had taken them as it were to a place apart to be tempted of the devil perhaps though none the less the fact bore witness to a certain nobility of type so it was all the more strange that whenthe next speaker having finished in a calculated chaos of wordsgovind the dissipated editor who had yawned his tacit approval of dilaram the dancer rose to denounce some trivial iniquity in the ruling race his middleschool english and cheap abuse was received with just the same desultory applause it seemed to chris listening impatiently as if the faculty of criticism had been lost in its abuse as if the one thing needful was antagonism pur et simple the great event of all such meetings in nushapore followed nexta paper by ram nath he spoke admirably and if he wandered occasionally from the point the vast scope of his subject the political national and social aspect of modern india must be held responsible for that an englishman listening would of course have challenged his facts and denied his conclusions but chris did neither he gave an unqualified assent to many and many a point and yet when he listened to the assertion that the cup of our political evils is so full the burden of our social inequalities so intolerable and the tyranny of custom stands out so red and foul that some militant uprising has become essential to national salvation and armed resistance the only hope of amendment he wondered with a certain shame how many of the millions of india would find a personal grievance in social equality or political evil and as for the tyranny of custom what militant uprising was possible among willing slaves for all that he listened not without an answering heartbeat to the lalas eloquence as he skilfully fanned every burning question with a wind of words and let the fretting fingers of subtle suggestion undermine the foundations of fact he was specially bitter against the plague precautions and his hints that there was more behind them than met the eye aroused the only spontaneous applause of the evening yet once more when the wellreasoned admirablydelivered address was over the audience listened with exactly the same receptive expression to the recitation by its author of a hymn for use in the approaching congress in which delegates were told they should to croaking fools their folly leave their canting puerile rant to noble mission steadfast cleave and sprouts devoutly plant it was a very long hymn and it alluded amongst other items to the blazing sun of western lore to dutys trumpet call to england dear home of every virtue sweet nurse to liberty and to indias crying woesit secured a rather more hearty meed of applause than anything else possibly because the audiencebeing above all things scholasticappreciated the difficulty of making english verse so with a resolution that the good of people must be encouraged at all costs and a vote of thanks to mr ram nath the actual business of the meeting ended but not the speechifying half a dozen minor men stood up with a surcharged look but one a tall young fellow with a charmingly gentle emotional face caught the chairmans eye first he was a schoolmaster and at his own expense brought out a monthly magazine which was briefly the most hightoned bit of printing that ever passed through a press bishops might have read it and confessed themselves edified mr chairman and gentlemen he began although formal recognition of our distinguished townsmans magnificent elocutionary effort has not been wanting i wish to record my humble admiration and to state my belief that his forecast of possible difficulties regarding plague precautions may amount to prophecy since alas our poor folk have been strangers to beneficent sanitations from birth and are now as another honourable speaker pointed out in considerable states of ebullition yet instead of applying salutary balms to these uneducated minds i grieve to say that efforts are being made to increase terror witness the golden paper falling from heaven as bolt from the blue in the socalled temple of viseshwar this trick of greedy brahmins ram nath was on his feet in an instant recognised champion of his faith i beg to submit mr chairman that these words are out of order this society is pledged to neutrality and trick of greedy brahmins is calculated to wound pious feelings i second the protest put in another eager voice and beg the objectionable phrase be withdrawn a murmur of approval ran through the larger part of the audience and hafiz ahmad with the scowl of the true idolhater on his face asked the speaker to withdraw the words which he did protesting that as a member of the brahmo somaj he had only spoken with a view to eternal and abstract truth the paper he continued though possibly only the outcome of the quarrel which his hearers must know had been going on for some time between the priests of the two rival temples regarding the relative supremacy of kalima and her consort shivjee here the chairman himself called with alacrity order order this meeting does not deal with such dogmatics and another and smaller murmur of assent followed the gentlefaced schoolmaster apologised again there could be no doubt at any rate he said almost pathetically that the uneducated mind was as the poet said liable to be tickled by straws and so he conceived it to be his duty to draw the attention of the society for promoting the general good of people to this paper which he might add he was going to pillory in his publication with scathing criticism so drawing a slip from his pocket he began to read in the vernacular i kali will come in my dark month i will come for blood woe to them who seek to stay me in the city since i will have blood on my altar whether the hands of strange men stay me or smite me for i am kali the deathmother of all men whether they will it or no yea i will come the vague phrases besprinkled with hollowsounding mysterious sanskrit words brought a curious hush even to that assemblage till hafiz ahmad laughed arrogantly is that all panditjee he asked that bogey will do little as much i venture to suggest put in ram nath suavely as the bogey of supposed invasion of domestic privacy for women the mohammedan though he professed himself above such considerations frowned i demur the caste prejudices will in my opinion be more difficult to place on commonsense footings they had embarked on the fencingmatch which as often as not ended discussion between these two recognised leaders of the two communities hindoo and mohammedan and the attention of the meeting had wandered after them when a new voice brought it back it was chris davenants taller than most there fairer and of better birth than the generality of those who brave the dangers of foreign travel he was the show man of young nushapore for pure culture as ram nath was for ability and as such he commanded attention gentlemen he said it seems to me that this paper which pandit narain das has just read will give our society an opportunity for practical work it means nothing or at most little to any of us here but none will deny it will mean much to many to our friendslet us face the factsto our own families and it is a dangerous paper gentlemen none know that better than we who have passed from the influence of such wordshere that faint desultory clapping became audibleand it is just because we have so passed that i ask this meeting what it is prepared to do in order to combat the possible the probable effect of these mysterious threats hear hear came several voices and then came silence until the pandit said in hurt tones i have already told this meeting that i will publish in my monthly magazine together with criticisms of the most scathing character and put in ram nath rising to the challenge in chris davenants face i venture to suggest mr chairman that this meeting pass a resolution condemning and who will know what resolutions we pass mr secretary interrupted chris with a sudden passion which gave his face a look that was half hope half wistful doubt who will read your diatribes mr editor we we only who pass the resolutions who write the criticisms who know already how to appraise that paper printed words gentlemen are no use to those who cannot read resolutions are naught to those who never hear of them but we have tongues we can speak we can if we choose throw the whole weight of our personal influence on the side of truth even though that side be also the side of a government with which we have many a righteous feud as he paused for breath there was a murmur of approval for the eloquence none for the thought it held gentlemen he went on it is futile for any one here to deny that this paper aims at rousing religious opposition to any precautions whatever against the plague well some of us here myself among the number hold that many of the precautions in the government programme are objectionable and more in the private instructions if rumour says true put in ram nath spitefully i have listened to reasonable criticism reasonable resentment and i have agreed with it but is there any one of us here who would throw all precautions to the winds went on chris passing by the interruption is there any one who really believes that this golden paper fell from heaven if there are i let them pass but for the rest of us i call upon you not to write not to resolve but to speak to speak to our wives our mothers our sistersto the timid women whom such threats alarm briefly to throw our whole personal influence on what we know to be the side of truth there was an instants silence then hafiz ahmad as chairman said perfunctorily i am sure we are all completely at one with our honourable friend such manifest attempts at preposterous intimidation deserve the heartiest contempt of educated minds i second that proposition added ram nath as head of his following we are morally bound to give heartiest cooperation in the difficult task before government in so far as is compatible with strict deference to the private religious feeling of all parties concerned that is the groundwork of true liberty a fine scorn showed on chris davenants face he was about to speak when pandit narain das turned to him with a wistful apology in his and said without demurring to his general principle i would remind our honourable friend whose educational career is a credit to our town that our influence alas is but a broken reed our position in a society of ignorami is anomalous not to say precarious and if we too freely kick against the pricks we are in danger of losing what we have which would be undesirable as john morley says in his valuable work on compromise chris turned on him almost savagely there is no need to preach compromise panditjee we practise it we do not let our opinions influence our own conduct yet we expect them to influence the conduct of our rulers we write these opinions oh yes we write them why because we know that only those read them who agree with us but which of us will go from here today and braving opposition disregarding personal considerations tell even their own immediate families that the brahmins who wrote that paper areare splendide mendax he could not help it he was keenly alive to the legitimate fun made by the opponents of young india out of its intolerable aptitude for unsuitable quotation but he fell a victim to it sometimes himself so as he paused before his own wordsa house as it were divided against itselfhe lost his opportunity for a dapper little gentleman who by reason of a high appointment under government was generally allowed to apply the closure to heated or unwelcome discussions had risen and caught the chairmans eye what our honourable and esteemed townsman mr krishn davenund has just said must receive consensus of universal opinion since it is doubtless of supreme importance to national life priestcraft supernaturalism et hoc genus omne are clearly traits of low civilisation just as popular government enlargement of franchise and diffusion of evolutionary theories are significant of higher still rome was not built in a day nor is there use in raising the wind if we cant ride the whirlwind or control the storm therefore in the interim pending wider liberty of speech i propose that this meeting pass a unanimous resolution condemning such paltry attempts at cockering up superstitious feelings and that the same be duly recorded in the minutes of our society before the relieved applause which greeted this diplomacy was over the wastepaper basket beside chris davenant had received another contribution his roll of manuscript torn to shreds lay in it in obedience to a sudden swift intuition that if he was ever to rise beyond the chaos of lofty aspirations the strictly impersonal admiration for great deeds in his fellows he must leave words behind so silent alone he walked home to his empty house his empty life but others though they passed homewards in batches still full of discussion still drunk with words were passing to environments which were in a way even more empty than his so empty of the sentiments they had just been formulating so much at variance with the ideals they had just professed that the very imagination grows bewildered in the effort to reconcile the two govind the editor however had less difficulty than most in accommodating his mental position to a stool stuck over the reeking gutter of a liquor shop where he refreshed himself with a brandyandsoda and an infamous cigar he was in an evil temper because the meeting which he frequented chiefly because the speakers provided him with ideas wherewith to spice his own broadsheet had been unusually discreet so he would have to write his own sedition unless he could pick up some scurrilous news instead nay friend i know naught to suit thy purpose replied the stout sergeant of police who frequented the same liquor shop to whom he applied save the finding of the ladysahibs jewelbox and the pearls asked govind taking out a greasy stump of pencil the pearls echoed the policeman scornfully as if pearls were to be found by us they can be hid in a bodys very mouth and then if there be not another mouth with a tongue in it there is silence but the box is enough to keep the file of the case open and the inspector content for a while how many are in the lockup concerning it asked govind out of the fulness of his knowledge regarding police methods six yawned the sergeant the coolie who found the box broken and empty flung in the bushes by the latsahibs house he was setting the fireworks for the big spectacle tomorrow he sold it to a pawnbroker that makes two for us then a woman bought the velvet lining from a ragmerchant that makes four she gave it to hashim tailor who works for the huzoors as a cap to her grandchild and he having doubts informed us so he makes five then the fireworkmakers people were turbulent therefore we arrested one of them to show diligence and there was naught in the box when it was found asked govind he was writing now on one of the smoothedout squares of white wastepaper which lay in a pile beside the liquor seller who used them for wiping the rims of the tumblers out of deference to the caste prejudices of his customers against a general cloth god knows yawned the policeman piously the man saith not but there were letters besides the trinkets and the pearls and we may find them if not the others folk will not lose a cowries worth of wastepaper these hard times ay assented the liquor seller eyeing govind askance mine had to be paid for though some seem to think not and paid high too since the fireworkmakers were in the market for their squibs and crackers for tomorrow a man lounging outside in the gutter laughed suddenly viciously they will find enough for them anyhow even if they have the police at their tails he said moving off with a defiant salaam to the fat policeman i would i had handcuffed a pair of them remarked the latter mildly twould have been one trouble and tis well to save oneself what one can these hard times trouble echoed a passerby shaking his head there will be no saving of that in nushapore janalishan hath returned and brought the plague so folk say the liquor seller turned in quick interest to the sergeant of police dost know if he hath returned he asked for the loafer was a customer who owed money and must be got hold of while money was in his pockets for answer the policeman chucked away his cigar end stumbled off the dais of the shop and stood to attention as a figure rounded the angle of the next crossway street followed by a crowd of ragged halfnaked urchins it was janalishan himself washed shaved spruce in a secondhand suit of khaki uniform and a white helmet which he had redeemed from a pawnshop on the credit of his new appointment as foreman of works janalishan who from sheer habit had on finding himself in the city with money in his pocket gone straight for his old haunt from the new resolutions however which with him always began with new work he called for a gingerade plain in a voice of authority which made a little circle gather round him admiringly as after humming a stave of drink to me only with thine eyes while he was opening the bottle he proceeded to pour its fizzing contents down his throat the interest of the crowd seemed to amuse him he sate down on the plinth and drew out a handful of pice in lordly fashion two anna over an above he said holding up the coins and i dont want no change so which of you noble earls here he turned to his following of lads is goin to fight for the balance you understand lurro abhi jut put an be burra burra pailwan for two pice a ed fight now immediately and be great heroes the vile admixture of tongues seemed quite comprehensible to those acquainted with janalishans methods for two urchins stepped forward at once and the rest joined with the other loungers to form a ring john ellison loafer leant back against the wall at his ease now then nap he began back to back fair and square none o yer nigger blarney you young devil fight seeda or it aint worth fightin at all and i wont ave no buttin in the stummick youre pailwans mhenda nahin heroes not fighting rams sumjha the boys professed to understand and having divested themselves of their last rag stood like slim bronze statues in the sunlight are you ready asked janalishan with superb gravity then chul go an may the lord ave mercy on your souls they were locked in each others grip in a second in true western fashion shabbash said the holder of the stakes with an approving nod thats wrestlin none o yer slappins an buttins and booins shabbash boys shabbash the crowd grinned widely at the praise and as the combatants struggled and swayed discussed their family history and took sides after the manner of crowds all over the world quite a breath of anxiety ran through it as a fall came but came sideways there was no dust on the back yetthere would not beyes there would aha aha there was surely there would have been doubtless for the uppermost boys small brown hand had freed itself for a second from its grip and sought blindly on the ground for that recognised weapon in indian wrestling dust for the adversarys eyes had not janalishan seeing the action sprung to his feet stooped over the writhing figures and seizing the top one by the scruff of its neck held it up by one hand and shaken it as a terrier shakes a rat none o yer monkey tricks none o yer niggar blarneying you young sneak he said roughly as he dropped his whimpering prisoner from mid air or ill make mutti of you bus enough tother johnnys jeetgia won here sonny take your do paisa the crowd however which had been betting freely on the event hesitated the supporters of the dustthrower grumbled they were headed by govind who began with great pomp i would have you aware sir that use of dust is not nonregulation in our code therefore the other boy is victor john ellison looked at him condescendingly and turned up the cuffs of his coat with unnecessary elaboration aint it in your code baboo he said with equally elaborate civility an tother chap as won has he im glad thear it but this is my show and by the lord oo made me im goin to run it myself an if any gentleman as a objection to make let im make it now or for ever after old is peace the crowd made way for him hastily as he drove a threefeet passage through it with his elbows but as he walked jauntily down the bazaar the boys fell in behind him and kept step as he did to the wedding march which he whistled in reminiscent continuation of his last words for they knew janalishan of old as one who drunk or sober always had a reward for fair fighting what did the mlechcha say asked a grumbler who did not know english that twas nothing to him what was our custom it was his and that settled it it is their word well let them say it we will see brothers if it is true will we not replied govind viciously a murmur of approval ran through the bystanders but an old dodderer with a white beard who in eastern fashion was dozing through his days waiting for death crouched up comfortably on a string bed set in the sun said dreamily didst say it was janalishan yea it was his word i have heard him say it and he keeps it my sons he keeps it govind turned on the speaker scornfully those were other times baba and another janalishan the times have changed and men too a thin musical laugh interrupted him it came from lateefa the kitemaker who was passing with his bundle of kites for sale lo baboojee he said i know naught of time but my poor portion of it nor of man save my poor self but i change not and i am as others we are like kites the form changes not unless the maker chooses and god so say the moulvies changes not at all he makes men on the old pattern ever the rest is but dye and tinsel so he passed on tossing his bundle and chanting the streetsellers cry your eyes use and choose use your eyes and choose chapter vii crackers and squibs tinkle tinkle ootel ishstar haavunder vartooar tinkle tinkle ootel ishstar haavunder vartooar tinkle tinkle ootel ishstar haavunder vartooar the damnable iteration went on and on the fiddles twangled and squeaked the drum bangers banged the nautchgirl sidled and smirked and shrilled tinkle tinkle ootel ishstar haavunder vartooar lesley drummond sitting in the front row of guests at the reception given by the nobles and landed proprietors of the province to welcome sir george arbuthnot to his new office shut her eyes at last in sheer despair of being able to reconcile the senses of hearing and sight then opened them again to stare with unappeasable curiosity into the blaze of light veiled by a fine film of misty smoke in which all things seemed clear yet dim it came from the prismhung chandeliers which hid the low whitemarble ceiling from the wretched paraffin walllamps hung against the whitemarble pillars from the paper lanterns swinging from the scalloped whitemarble arches but it came most of all from the garden beyond the arches in which this whitemarble summerpalace of a dynasty of dead kings stood centring the formal walks and watercourses for it was lit up in long close rows of soft twinkling lights stretching away into the purple shadows of the night until climbing to every line every curve of the purple shadow of the distant city they showed like new stars upon the purple shadow of the sky the radiance of it the brilliance of it dazzled the eyes the dimness the misty dreaminess of it clouded the brain she felt drugged hypnotised out of realities as she looked towards the dais where sir george the star of his order almost hidden by one of the huge tinsel garlands which had been thrown round the neck of the guests as they entered sat in a gilt chair his solitary figure outlined harshly by reason of his dark political uniform against the background of whitemarble tracery thence she looked to the english ladies in gay decolletes dresses who with a sprinkling of black coats and red tunics banked the dais on either side so to the line of officials and soldiers edging the gangway below the dais finally on to the hosts themselves who sate behind in rows rows on rows ablaze with colour and sparkle rows on rows imperturbable passive without a smile or a frown for the scene in which they bore so large a part so far however despite those great tinsel garlands which were so distracting a novelty upon black coats scarlet tunics and decolletes dresses a certain relevancy to the central idea embodied in that solitary figure of an elderly englishman raised above the rest was not wanting in the details of the spectacle but what thought lesley could be said of that group upon the square of red and greenflowered brussels carpet spread immediately in front of the dais spread between the gilt sofa where she sat with jerry between her and lady arbuthnot and a similar gilt sofa on the other side occupied by the generals wife and her two daughters what an inconceivably unsuitable surrounding they made five englishwomen and a child to those other five and a child two ragged drum bangers two dissipated fiddle and guitar twangers a dreamylooking boy doing nothing and the usual posturing dancer stout as to figure bunchy as to petticoats with glued bandeaux of hair and a nasal quavering voice which paused only for furtive swallowings of the betelnut she was chewing all too palpably tinkle tinkle ootel ishstar she trilled with an affable opulent curve of hip and hand towards the sahib logue collectively for whose delectation she was singing englis fassen an accomplishment she had learned from a girl who had been taught hymns in a mission school haavunder vartooarshe simpered with a special coquettish flirt of her fingers and full petticoat for that respectable father of a family sir george who honest man sat horribly conscious still more horribly bored yet patient waiting for the master of the ceremonies to ask him if he had had enough enough he looked past the pirouettings to that thin line of white faces bored yet patient like his own which fringed those rows on rows of impassive dark ones and stifled his yawns duteously for the sake of the empire no such reasons of state however swayed jerry who dapper and dainty in kneebreeches silk stockings ruffles and a little garland of his own sate fidgeting and yawning yawning and fidgeting as he looked across the pirouettings he could see his dearest mr raymond dozing with dignity in a chair opposite with a peculiarly magnificent garland festooned over him it was bigger than anybodys but dads jerry told himself feeling a trifle aggrieved and he wanted to ask why it was so large when mr raymond was sitting oh ever so far back tinkle tinkle ootel ishstar the drums banged the fiddles squeaked the dancer postured and jerry yawned with commendable monotony till suddenly the little lads patience gave way at the two hundred and fiftysixth time of asking the questionhaavunder vartooar please he said in his clear childs voice it is the star of india dads wearin the queen gave it him for doin his duty hushhush jerry came breathlessly from his guardians but the connection of ideas had been too palpable a titter which broke from the ladies behind him made nevill lloydwho as aidedecamp flanked the dais resplendent in his horse artillery uniformabsolutely choke in his effort to be dignified and the joyous crow which resulted quite upset the general commanding then this chuckle from the right row of officialdom did for the secretarytogovernment heading the left so that his gurgle was the signal for a general roar of laughter to go echoing up into the arches general so far only as the white faces were concerned the dark ones of the hosts were immovable keeping even their surprise to themselves some one ought surely to explain said lesley with a halfpuzzled frown as the laughter ending a general stir of relieved chatter showed that the audience had seized on the interruption as an end explain my dear echoed sir george when his wife took advantage of the stir to repeat lesleys suggestion and point out the dancinggirl standing sullen uncertain whispering to the drum and fiddle i dont think its worth it and i dont see how its to be done besides they ought to have laughed toothey really ought that crow of lloyds im awfully sorry sir put in the offender trying to be penitent through his smiles ill tell you what ill do lady arbuthnot raymond is bossing the supper for them from the club and all that hes president of the committee of entertainment so ill get him sir george frowned we neednt trouble mr raymond captain lloyd and as for the interruption grace it rested with me to stop the nautchgirl at any time and they saw we were amused that is really all they want just so sir assented the secretarytogovernment a trifle ashamed of his lapse from strict etiquette and she had been at it nearly the proper time only five minutes short of the halfhour we gave them and you can use those siras the fireworks will barely be readyin having some of the notables up for a talk that will set the business more than right it seemed so indeed judging by the radiant faces of the favoured few and the hopeful interest of the many who crowded round grateful for a word even from some lesser light so from its eastern formality the scene changed to western ways the crowd of welldressed women became interspersed with red coats and political uniforms a buzz of voices and laughter replaced the silence broken only by the shrillings and twanglings the change was a peculiarly welcome one to mrs chris davenant who having of course been seated in strict accordance with her husbands rank right at the back among the commercial set had been growing sulky over her chance of getting into better society she had not for the last two days snubbed mr lucanaster persistently in order that she and half a dozen tailors summoned hastily should have time to turn out a gown worthy of paris simply for the purpose of having him compliment her on the result she flew at higher game and the movement of the crowd brought her the quarry married a native did she commented a big man in political uniform with a row of medals who was in from an outstation for the show and had asked who the wearer of the flamecoloured satin was flamecolour with ruby sparklings on the curves of hip and bosom out of which the fair white shoulders rose barely well i personally dont find the husband in it if the wifes pretty introduce me will you or get some one else to do it who knows her if you dont the man to whom he spoke looked round helplessly and his eye falling on jack raymond he appealed to him people in nushapore had a trick of applying to the secretary of the club for odd jobs ask lucanaster said jack raymond grimly he knows her awfully well and i dont and thereinafter he watched this seething of the kid in its mothers milk with an almost fiendish amusement it relieved him for one thing of the necessity for speaking to mrs chris himself but as he passed the group which was every instant growing larger round the flamecoloured satin he said a word to chris who was standing listlessly on the outside of it seeing a lot of old friends i expect chris davenants flush made him curse the careless remark and at the same moment some one came hurriedly up behind him and laid a hand on his arm it was a tall old man with a dash and a swing about him still gorgeous still though his brocades were worn and old and with great ropes of pearls wound round him and a straight bar of grey moustache on his keen brown face matching the grey herons plume in his low turban briefly a rajpoot nobleman of the old style ai counsellor of the old he said affectionate confidence struggling with vexation in his face give me some of thy wisdom once more hullo ranasahib whats up something gone wrong with the fireworks asked jack raymond turning at once his tone was friendliness itself and no wonder many a time had he hard rider as he was wondered at the old thakoor of dhurmkotes dash and pluck after boar many a time had they sate up in machans after tiger together and many a time had jackwiser for the reckless proud old sinner than he was for himselfurged him to retrench to keep from the usurers in vain the old man head of his clan would only say not so sahib if the son had lived perhaps but the tiger took advantage of his youth so let me live and die as my fathers lived and died and then he would launch out into further extravagance as fine a specimen of the native gentleman before we meddled with the mould as could be found in the length and breadth of the land wrong with my fireworks he echoed indignantly there is nothing wrong with them though the others stinted me from the beginning out of jealousy yet i had fooled them but now because folk laughed at god knows what they want them earlier it is jealousy again it is to ruin my reputation as connoisseur i who have spent lacs on fireworks i who to prove what i could do with the miserable pittance assigned to me have paid meena buksh fireworkmaker five thousand rupees extrai had but two allowed me huzoorout of mine own pocket or rather out of salig ram the usurers since i reft it from him with threatshe owns land see you as well as money here the old man who had been carried away thus far by his grievance became aware that jack raymonds companion was not as he had deemed some young englishman who would either not care to listen or would not understand if he did and in any case would not make mischief out of the confidence for chris davenant hemmed in a corner beyond escape had been unable to repress a smile at the old chieftains method of proving his good management and economy let me introduce my friend mr krishn davenund ranasahib said jack raymond hastily noticing the old mans haughty stare i think you knew his father pandit sri pershad judge of the small cause court considering that the magistrate in question being more or less in feudal relations with the thakoors of dhurmkote had strained many a point in favour of their extravagance the acquaintance was indisputable yet the ranasahibs salaam was of the curtest compatible with courtesy to the introducer and he drew jack raymond aside to continue in a lower voice they want me to be ready in ten minutes and that means ruin for some fool set fire to a bit of my best set piece and twill take twenty to repair but why not begin with something else suggested his hearer the thakoors face was a study in triumph and disappointment because it is a welcome to the latsahib and a welcome must come first and it is new alsoa welcome in roman candles and sulphur stars my reputation is in it then why not show it as it is and explain the accident the thakoor looked uncertain that might be how would it look think you sahib god then a blankfor that is where the damage comes inour new lieutenantgovernor would it be understanded think you would it look wellin roman candles and sulphur stars god blankthat is where the damage lies repeated jack raymond thoughtfully and then he laughed he had to recover himself however hastily at the old mans bewildered face and say gravely i dont think it would look very well ranasahib especially in roman candles and sulphur stars here another laugh obtruded itself and he added as a cover to it but i can tell you what i can do for yourefreshments i know they are ready ill go off now and get the roastbeef sounded the old chieftain stood looking after him as he went off enthusiastically may the gods keep him that is a man he said aloud to himself if all the sahibs were as he a friend india would be the happier she needs such friends said chris davenant suddenly he had been trying to make up his mind ever since the meeting at hafiz ahmads house to take some decided step towards organising a real party of progress to do this in a way that would ensure confidence with both the government and the people it was necessary to secure some men of real influence and the thakoor was one his word went far both west and east and fate had placed him within earshot so chris had spoken his heart to tell truth in his mouth as the old man turned scowling but something in the young ones face perhaps a look of his dead father perhaps its own inherent goodness made the thakoor instead of ignoring the remark say curtly i see it not what friends does india need then chris pulled himself together for speech and the old man listened first contemptuously then with tolerance thou speakest well he said nodding approval and as thou sayest the people need leaders not baboos come to my house some day and have you my shawl chris said a womans voice interrupting the invitation oh i dont want it now not till the fireworks but you can bring it then to the supperroom so satisfied at having shown her husband that if he were talking to pearls and brocade she had annexed a uniform and medals satisfied also at having shown both the uniform and the brocade in what good company they were mrs chris davenant passed on all white arms and back edged perfunctorily with flames and rubies whowho is that mem asked the old rajpoot swiftly for one of the white arms had incredible to say nudged chriss black one to attract his attention chris gave back the stare defiantly that is my wife thakoorsahib the old chieftain stood bewildered for a moment then he gave a scornful laugh men of thy sort are no friends to india baboojee he said so with a twirl of the straight grey moustache he strode away leaving chris more lonely than ever so absolutely alone that the sheer physical pain of his loneliness drove him on towards the sound of laughter and voices the popping of champagne corks which came from the marblescreened verandah where the refreshmenttables stood it was full of english people only since this part of the entertainment was left by the hosts in alien hands but through the marble lacework filling up the arches the softly radiant lines of light climbing upwards to the stars could be seen and the hum of the multitude waiting beyond the garden to see the fireworks was audible have you all you want miss drummond said jack raymond as he passed he looked well she thought and wore his garland with a difference jerry had hold of it in a second detaining him oh i say please what a whopper he exclaimed why did they give it you for doing my duty of course he laughed i say young man you upset the applecart didnt you lesley looked her regret it was awful and so much worse not to explain it was so rude i dont wonder the people dislike us jack raymonds face took a curiously obstinate look perhaps you would like to explainthere is the thakoor of dhurmkote he is more like an englishman in his mind than any native i know shall i introduce him and let you get it off your conscience a minute after the little groupjack raymond explaining the old rajpoot listening lesley waiting for the laugh to come and jerry watching puzzled doubtful how far the joke would be against himgave grace arbuthnot in her solitude of honour a pang of envy it was dull always talking to the proper people and jack raymond need not keep aloof from her so pointedly it was so foolish as if it were possible in a sort of denial she just touched the gold lappets of sir georges coatthe faintest lightest fingertouchas he stood talking to the general but he turned at once do you want anything dear she flushed and laughed a pretty flush a pretty laugh chiefly at her own impulsiveness nothing dear absolutely nothing she said and he smiled back at her none the less she still watched the group enviously but lesley for her part was beginning to wish she had not joined it for the discovery of her own mistakes was never a pleasant process to the young lady and something in the old thakoors face warned her she was out of her depth ap ne suchh furmaya ap ne be shakk suchh furmaya came the courteous old voice as jack raymonds ceased and the courteous old face bent in grave approval over the childs please what does he say asked jerry sober as a judge jack raymond had not a smile either though he looked hard at lesley he says translated literally that you caused the truth to be told without doubt you caused it to be told jerry heaved a huge sigh of relief and looked up into the old face his childish one full of confidence in course i did i knew it was the star of india cos mum told me an i dont know why the grownups laughed but he didnthes a nice old man an i like him so to the old chieftains inexpressible delight he tucked his hand into the rajpoots and said thank you sir you and i are out of it miss drummond remarked jack raymond as after permission asked and granted the thakoor went off proud as punch to show the chota sahib who had only spoken the truth to the rest of the committee that you and i lingered somehow pleasantly in the girls memory so that when she returned to lady arbuthnots side and the latter somewhat to her own surprise felt impelled to make some remark on the conversation she had noticed lesley replied carelessly yes i think i like him better than i did he isnt half bad grace arbuthnot felt suddenly as if she could have boxed the speakers ears not half bad and except in position and one or two things which did not could not show in mere acquaintance jack raymond had changed very little since the days when he had been her ideal of all a man should be what was more that ideal of hers had not changed at all yet here was this girl thinking him not half bad the advent of the generals wife however fullas usualof fears about everything created a diversion was not lady arbuthnot afraid of catching cold in going out to watch fireworks to be sure she was wearing a high dress which was perhaps more suitable but anyhow was she not afraid of getting it spoilt with the oil and the dirt and if she was not did not the underlying doubt as to the general safety of the position disturb her supposing it was only a plot to get the whole european community together unarmed and blow them up after the mutiny anything was possible my husband shall take you in charge interrupted grace and as he has to be escorted everywhere by the biggest swells you will be quite safe for they would hardly blow themselves up she spoke politely enough but as she passed out to the terrace she said aside to lesley what a fool that woman is yet she is not much worse than half the others if anything could make us lose our hold on india it will be the womenas it was in the mutiny jerry who had come back was holding his mothers hand and looked up all eyes and ears do you think there will be one weally he asked with quite a tremble of eagerness in his voice no jerry certainly not she replied quickly vexed he should have heard and if there were there is no use in being frightened his face flushed crimson itit isnt that he began gripping her hand tighter then paused perhaps because at that moment a line of coloured fires swept in curves against the background of purple shadow to form the legendgod bless our new lieutenantgovernor a hum of applause not for the words but the roman candles and sulphur stars rose from beyond the garden on the terrace too admiration was loud and the old thakoors delight was boundless he was here whispering sir george that he had only been allowed two thousand rupees there apologising to the rest of the committee for imaginary shortcomings or down in the smoke and noise below urging the pyrotechnists to be quick to spare no pains to show the huzoors what they could do that will we muttered an underling as he stooped to his task the letting off like minuteguns of the detonating maroons which the native loves and another man as he bent to touch a fuse with his portfire gave a sinister laugh and remarked under his breath that scarred necks could do without pearls so in hot haste the set pieces succeeded each otherthe catherinewheels span dropping coloured tears the firefountains played the great clouds of smoke edged with many tinted reflections of the lights drifted sideways and beyond them the balloons sailed up one by one to form new constellations in the sky but the curved rockets paused with a little sob of despair and sank back dropping the stars which they had hoped to set in high heaven and above the noise the bustle the popping of squibs and crackers came the sound of an english military band and the minuteguns of the maroons lesley drummond on the lower terrace watching listening was conscious of a curiously new sense of enjoyment almost exultation her life the emotionally restricted life of the modern girl who having freed herself from minor interests has not yet found wider ones had been though she would never have admitted it cold and grey but tonight for the first time she realised that her nature held other possibilities the dim darkness the faint light the mystery encompassing the mirth around her even jack raymonds voice asking carelessly as he passed how she was getting on made her feel dizzy with pleasure we are having a splendid time she answered joyously arent we jerry but jerry answered nothing he was much too absorbed his wide grey eyes were wider than ever staring out at the fireworks what is it jerry she asked curiously what do you see oh nuffing yet answered the little lad but if it was to come as he spoke a sudden scream rose from a group of ladies close by a man running as for dear life to set and light a fresh row of firefountains squibs and crackers had stumbled tripped fallen against the low parapet and in his attempt to save himself had dropped some of the fireworks over on to the terrace nor was that all the flaming spouting gerb he carried in his left hand as a port fire had swung round on them and there they were in the middle of gauze and muslinalight a knot of squibs was the first to explode darting hither and thither wickedly like snakes amid the frills and flounces amid the screams keep back keep back shouted the men and some had their coats off in a second while others held the ladies filmy dresses back beating the sparks off with their hands or stamping them out with their feet but there was a round black something with just a tiny glow sizzling slowly into it which no one noticed as it lay alf hidden under a velvet gown no one but jerry the next instant he was standing with it in his hands confused for the moment by the dense circle round him through which he saw no way for a small boy drop it drop it shouted some one and lesley was beside him trying to snatch the detonator from him but he dodged from her with an appealing cry its mine it weally is my shellit weally is he dodged nevill lloyd also who dashed at him yellingdrop it you young fool and he might have gone on dodging others till that tiny glow sizzled in to the powder if some one else realising the situation and the few seconds grace that remained had not shouted hold tight jerry hold tightand so with that reassuring request had run to the child caught him in his arms and forced a way through the crowd to the parapet now my lad heave came the order and jerry who had held tight heaved since these were reasonable orders heaved not an instant too soon however for the round black thing was still so close when it changed to a flash a flame a roar that it left jack raymond and the child wholly dazed and half blind all singed and powdergrimed they were still standing so bewildered the mans face and the childs close together disguised by their very griminess into quaint likeness when grace arbuthnot came up to them he isnt hurt said jack raymond quickly setting down the child partly to prove his words partly because he wished to dissociate himself from the situation as far as possible the action however brought him closer to her eyes and something in them something in the faint perfume of heliotrope about her dress the perfume he remembered so well made him feel ashamed of his own thought he is really not hurt he continued in a low voice for her ear alone and he behavedas i should have expected your son to behave he had not meant to say so much but something of the old confidence seemed to have returned to him with the old memory and to her also for she shook her head and said almost with a smile he is not a bit like mehe is far more like you she paused startled at her own unconsidered words and looked at him with a sudden shrinking in her face very he replied catching up the boy again we are both black sheep come along my hero and scrub some of the likeness off but as he carried jerry away on his shoulder to the dressingroom he told himself that she was right the boy was like him now that it had been suggested to him he saw it clearly not in face but in the nameless ways which show a likeness in the inward stuff that has gone possibly to make up a very dissimilar outside the explanation was simple of course it was a case of reversion he himself had always been counted a typical raymond and jerry through his mother had harked back to that distant almostforgotten ancestor something had made the current set that way once more that was all but what something was it possible that the mind had this power as well as the body he swung the child to the attendant grimly and bade him wash the chola sahibs face and be sure to take off all the black that likeness at any rate need not remain the other left him curiously helpless curiously ashamed chapter viii the temple of viseshwar chris had followed his wife into the supperroom with the vague hope of feeling that he had a place somewhere that he belonged to something even to her he had found her surrounded by strangers and evidently forgetful of his very existence so a resentment had come to lessen his selfpity resentment at many things what right for instance had that proud old semisavage to say that such as he were no friends to india it was a lie such as he were its best friends yet as he made the assertion he knew it needed proof what had such as he done to show their friendship very little even he himself a sudden determination to act came upon him a resolve not to let another day pass without showing that he at least knew which way true friendship lay so partly in disgust at the trivialities around him partly from a restless desire to think the matter out once for all he told his wife curtly that he was leaving the dogcart at her disposal and passed out through the garden into the almost deserted roads beyond the very thought of shark lane however was repellent in his present frame of mind avoiding that direction therefore he wandered on aimlessly conscious only at first thatafter the glare and the noisethe darkness the stillness was restful to eyes to heart to brain he did not think at all for the time he was absolutely at fault utterly depolarised so he felt startled roused to a definite sensation of mingled pleasure and pain when forced to pull up by a shadowy void before him he found it was the river that despite the confusion in his mind his body had led him to the old way of salvation to the old purification the night was too dark for him to see what lay before him but his memory held its every detail these were the bathingsteps and below him lay the oldest building in nushapore the temple of viseshwar here to the insignificant block of roughhewn stone tapered to a spire which rose square and bare from the very water his mother had brought him as a child here with childish delight in the action childish disregard of its meaning he had hung his jasmin garlands round the smooth upright black cone which was all the shrine held for worship yet which even so had been to his childs ignorance a god as such in a way familiar comprehensible commonplace but now it was neither now to his wider knowledge it had gained so much in mystery in awe by being symbol of the great incomprehensible problem of life and death that as he stood in that weddinggarment of culturea suit of dressclotheslooking down through the darkness to where he knew that lingam must rise smoother more worn by worship than ever a shiver ran through him at the thought that there among the withered chaplets at its feet humanity had knelt for ages and found no answer to the riddle of life he sat down mechanically on the uppermost of the steps and gave himself up as it were to the night conscious of a vague content that it should be so dark to begin with it hid many things best left unseenhimself most of all for that meant forgetfulness of much his dressclothes for instance and things to be classed with them then it hid the railway bridgestrange sight in such environmentwhich spanned the river a few yards below the little spit of rock ending the steps on which the more modern temple sacred to kali shivas consort had been built but something more modern still found foothold on that same spit of rock though farther out hidden below the levels of the river this was the first pier of the railway bridge from which the two drawbridgesone towards the town the other towards the riverwere worked thus securing the passage against attack from either side the pier itself rose sheer from the water a solid block of masonry and was prolonged into a tower gated at each end chris picturing it in his minds eye thought how quaint a neighbour it was even to kalis temple though her cult could not claim the mystery the significance of the other hers was the cult of ignorance of terror and his he was a smarrta brahmin by birth and as he sate there in the darkness thinking of that upright stonesevere rigid in its mysticismand then of the manyarmed bloodstained idol in the temple beyond a proud exultation in his own priesthood to the older cult surged up in him he had almost forgotten his birthright forgotten that he had been called by god to a place of honourto the place of teacher that his was the right to explain the mystery to the people to show them the way of salvation but he remembered it now and all insensibly a balm came to his pain from the knowledge of what lay about him unseen yet familiar he sate listening to the lap of the river on the footworn steps picturing to himself its fringe of dead flowerpetals from the dead days worship and even the stir in the vague shadow of the pipal trees telling of the sacred monkeys who with the dawn would descend to claim their share of offerings with the gods seemed to still his own restlessness and as he listened feeling more than thinking the asceticism of many a holy ancestor who had left the world behind to follow his ideal of good rose up in suggestion that he should do so also why not why not claim his inherited right of sainthood in order to preach his doctrine was not that after all the only thing worth doing in this life was not this the only reality was not all else maya or deception such glimpses of the real beyond the unreal come to most of us at times making us feel the spin of the round world we have deemed so steady beneath our feet making us feel the fixity of the stars above us the mysterious denial of sunset the illimitable promise of dawn and when they come peace comes with them it came to krishn davenund making him forget the red hammersmith omnibus and all things pertaining thereto as he sat feeling the familiar touch of the darkness until in the east beyond the river the grey glimmer of coming light in the sky showed him the curved shadow of the worlds horizon and after a time the grey glimmer of the curved river came to show him the straight shadow of the temple then in the vague light he stood up with a vague light in his mind also as he did so something fell from his arm it was his wifes shawl which he had been carrying unconsciously all the time as he picked it up the coincidence of its faint pinkish colour banished the regret which came to him at having forgotten to give it her ere leaving for this was yogi colour so called because it is worn by all ascetics his english wife had admired the delicate salmonpink and he had therefore had her white rampore shawl dyed that tint strange indeed a thousand times strange that this should be close to his hand now the cue thus given was followed and with a passion which stifled his sense of bathos he was the next instant throwing off his dressclothes so with the thin fine shawl about his nakedness he passed down the steps towards the river towards the sacrament of his race and caste the chill touch of the water sent his hot blood to heart and brain he could scarcely keep his voice to the orthodox whisper as he began the secret ritual which he had not repeated for years om earth air heaven om let us worship the supreme splendour of the sun may his light lighten our darkness the words blent with the silvery tinkle of the water falling back from his upraised hands and at the familiar sound a stir came from the branches of the pipal trees behind him and from the shadowy water below them a couple of shelldrakes sailed out with their echoing cry to the lighter level before him the sound of that first libation to the gods had awakened the temple world as yet however he and nature had worship to themselves therefore waist deep in the water he stood free to dream once more that he was twice born regenerate raised high above the herd yet free also to return to the new ways if he chose since there was none to see as yet but ere he had finished the ritual an old man still half asleep came yawning down the steps carrying a tray of little platters filled with coloured powders having reached the waters very edge he set these in a row and kept an eye on chris for he was the pujari of the temple with the right for a small fee to remark the bathers with their proper caste marks what race my son he asked drowsily as chris came up out of the river the question sent a vast pride through the young man with bare limbs scarce hidden by the dripping shawl he stood hesitating for a brief second and then squatted down beside the familiar earthen platters brahmin shivbakht he said the old man salaamed ere reaching for the sacred white gypsum which is brought from the snows of amarnath and once more that pride of race swept through the soul whose body awaited its sign of election but the swift cold touch on his forehead which followed woke chris to realities to the question do i mean it and the whispering kiss of other bare feet upon the steps warned him that if he wished time for deliberation he must remove his telltale garments of civilisation before the light made them manifest if these were hidden away he himself in his yogi coloured shawl could easily pass muster especially if he retreated to the leastfrequented part of the steps where they ended in a ruined wall split by the pipal treeroots here then he found some convenient crevices for his clothes and after spreading his shawl to dry in orthodox fashion sat down beside it in the recognised attitude of meditation his arms crossed on his knees his chin resting on them he was not likely to be recognised even by broad daylight for the companions of his later years were not of those who worship he would have leisure therefore to think to decide but once more he reckoned without himself without the swift response of his senses to the once familiar sights and sounds the causeless laughter of women filling their waterpots the tinkle of their anklets the cries of the flowersellers the ceaseless splash of water falling on water the very leapings and chatterings of the monkeys putting off time in play till the bathings should end in offeringsall these made connected thought impossible while eyes and ears were open in despair at last he flung the halfdried shawl over his head stuffed his fingers into his ears and leaning back against a treetrunk tried to forget where he was tried not to feel those white bars on his forehead which seemed to burn into his brain but in the effort to answer that question shall i go or staythe effort to remember and yet to forget he fell into dreamland finally into sleep and as he slept fate took the answer into her own hands and turned his tragedy into comedy for a small and curious monkey who had watched the secretion of those dressclothes from afar took advantage of his slumbers to creep down stealthily to a crevice and make off with its contentsnamely a pair of trousers the monkey however being small was soon dispossessed of his prize a bigger one claimed it and sent the first owner to whimper and gibber indignation from the topmost branches and then grin fiendishly as a yet bigger one despoiled his despoiler and so unerringly the garment of culture passed to the stronger till the biggest old male of the lot after inspecting every seam and trying to crack every button conceived that it must be some kind of adornment and after hanging the legs stolewise in front the seat cloakwise behind crossed its arms over its stomach feeling satisfied it had solved that problem meanwhile chris had awakened to the impossibility of remaining where he was for even his brief return to the normal in sleep had been sufficient to convince him of the hopelessness of attempting to return to that older standpoint so the day having advanced with the giant strides of an indian dawn he rose to retrieve his clothes and sneak off with them to some quiet spot as he did so however the sight of some one standing just above him made him squat down again and cover himself once more with the shawl for it was his new foreman of works john ellison who from the top of the steps was looking down affably nodding to the old pujari who had by this time a circle of customers awaiting hallmark and humming the baptismal hymn which begins in token that thou shalt not fear between the salutations of ramram pronounced with a short a which he showered on the bathers as they passed and repassed tis janalishan said one in answer to a question from a stranger he feeds the monkeys and when sri hunumans monkeys are fed by him the feasting of sri yamas crocodiles is not far off put in a listener emphasising his allusion to the god of death by a placid look towards a tinselbound corpse swung to a bamboo which two men were carrying slantways across the steps to the burning place below the railway bridge more than one amongst the bathers overhearing the remark nodded assent and looked with a vague fear at the loafer who had seated himself a few steps down and taken off his battered billycock for being sunday he was off duty and uniform ramram he said with a general wave of the hand so its the old game still sunlight soap monkey brand and a copperbottomed at lloyds doing a fire insurance lordy lord i might ave bin ere last sunday instead o last year an ows mr oneyman the last word intended for hunuman evidently conveyed a meaning to the whole remark for many faces grinned and the old pujari salaamed with all the difficult gravity of a child who knows some timeworn jest is nigh sri hunuman hath been well since the huzoor fed him on quinine pills hid in shivjees raisins last year ho ho ho that was a spectacle a priest with a trident on his forehead chuckled too yea he is strong he stole the sugar yesterday from mai kalis very lap lo even the monkeys know that offerings should be left at shivjees feet he spoke at a group of villagers who in tow of a rival priest were taking their offerings to the further temple john ellison laughed ow appy could i be with either he chanted wot aint shiver and kali settled that biz yet wy dont they get a divorce for bigamy both sides not as i care a dnhe went on in his vile lingo in which all was english save the nouns and verbs the latter having but one tensethe imperative siree oneymans my fancy he as its im its me janalishan an let me tell you that aint no arnsiki bat its zulm an ficker an burra hurra affut these astounding equivalents for tyranny trouble and great misfortune he used with intent for he liked to trade on his reputation as a bird of illomen meanwhile he continued chucking a pice to the pujari with that extreme affability which made even the most alarmed exclude him personally from any share in the coming evil seeing as i was branded a as a babby i wont trouble you agin sonny but theres your fee all the same so now for siree oneyman he drew out a paper of sugar drops as he spoke and scattering some on the steps began to sing click click like a monkey on a stick the effect was magical every leaf of the pipals rustled as the monkeys recognising his call swung themselves downward from branch to branch the bathers paused full of smiles for this common interest shown by one of the aliens who are so often far beyond their simplicity even chris could not help a smile despite the anxiety he was in as he watched the monkeys close in on the sugar drops quarrelling pouching reaching round with all four paws with the exception of one monkey a very large male which coming lamentably last only used three the fourth meanwhile clutching convulsively at its stomach wy oneyman came john ellisons mellow voice full of sympathy wot s up sonny got the crampsate somethin yer dont likehe paused staredwy wotever he paused again and out of the fulness of his bewilderment wandered off helplessly into she wore a wreath of roses but poor chris far off as he was had grasped the truth and turned hot and cold long before janalishan said in an awed whisper wherever in the nation did ole oneyman raise them dress bags he turned to the bystanders appealingly as he spoke but their faces as they gathered round in a circle echoed his own surprise well i am dashed he said softly this beats cockfightin it did for sri hunuman having by this time grasped the fact that dignity was incompatible with dinner had thrown the former aside and having rolled the trousers hastily into a ball had sat down on it as on a cushion while he reached round for sugar drops with both paws whereupon the original thief thinking he saw an opportunity made a snatch at the braces which still streamed over the steps to no purpose however since oneyman only clapped both paws behind and the cushion still in situ hopped to another place a roar of amusement echoed out over the steps and halfadozen youngsters fired with ambition tried the same game also without success sri honeyman eluded every clutch even the despairing one which chris muffled to the eyes in his ascetics shawl laid on those streaming braces they came off in his hands to the crowds huge delight ari brother thou hast the tail anyhow said some in congratulation but poor chris cursed inwardly what were braces without the trousers to wear with them john ellison meanwhile half choked with laughter and drunk with mirth was rolling about kicking legs and arms and shouting go it oneyman go it sonny until from some of the disappointed came the murmur that janalishan had better try and get the trousers himself though all mai kalis priests with sticks and staves had not been equal to making the old monkey give up the sugar on this he rose breathlessly and looked round you bet he said its rule britannier thats wot it is whereupon he took another paper bag of sugar drops from his pocket and walked up to the culprit shabbash oneyman he said with his usual affability you done that uncommon well if ever youre in want of the shiny theyd give you a fiver for that interlood at a music all but times up sonny your turns over so just you change bags like a good boy or the rest of the sentence was a melodious whistling of britons never never will be slaves a dexterous emptying of the bribe and an equally dexterous clutch at the trousers accompanied by a forcible kick behind the three combined were instantly successful and there was janalishan carefully dusting his new possession then he held them up and said suavely fair exchange aint no robbery but if any gent owns these pants let im utterwhich remark he translated in hideous hindustani into koi admi upna breeches hai bolo for one short second chris felt inclined to brave the situation then as usual he hesitated so the moment of salvation passed john ellison rolled up his prize put them under his arm and with a general ramram to the bystanders and an affectionate wave of the hand to old oneyman walked off cheerily whistling this is no my plaid my plaid my plaid chris looked after him helplessly then went back to his tree hopelessly he could not return home by broad daylight in any possible permutation or combination of a swallowtailed coat and a devotees dhoti the only thing to be done was to wait for kindly concealing night being sunday he would not be missed till noon for his wife was a late riser even then she would not be alarmed indeed he had often stayed out all day without her taking the trouble to ask where he had been that thought decided him to stay where and as he was besides despite the shameful absurdity of the cause the result was in a way pleasant it was something to be sent back without responsibility to the old life even for a few hours and a spirit of adventure woke in him as he remembered the things possible to one of his caste any one for instance would feed a brahmin and so after secreting the remainder of his clothes beyond the reach of monkeys under a heap of the ruined wall until he found an opportunity of removing them altogether he set off boldly to beg breakfast in the city the sun now high in the heavens smote on his bare limbsso long unaccustomed to the warm stimulating caresswith all the intoxication of a new physical pleasure but there was another touch still more stimulating which came to him first in a narrow side street close to the city gate a street all sun and shade in bars with womens chatter womens laughter echoing from within the courtyard doors doors all closed save this the first which had opened at his cry for alms to let a womans hand slip through that reverent touch on his palm so soft so kind that glimpse of a full petticoat a jewelcovered throat made his brain reel with recollection his heart leap with the possibilities it suggested how many years was it since he had seen a brahmin woman worshipping her husband that had been his mother and he might have had such a wife as she had been to his father if he had chosen almost if he chose the suggestion repelled yet attracted him and after a time half in curiosity half in affection he turned his steps to the wellremembered alley where his mother still lived he had been to see her of course when he first returned to india but inevitably as an alien and after his refusal to do penance he had not gone at all she had in fact refused to receive him so his heart beat as he stood muffled in his devotees drapery before the door through which he had so often passed to worship clinging to her skirts and gave his beggars cry alakh for shivs sake there was no need to repeat it for this was a pious house the low door opened wide and a young girl held out an alms with the mechanical precision of practice for shivs sake she echoed monotonously and for the sake of a son who has wandered from the true fold her voice held no trace of feeling but chris fell back with a stifled cry for he knew what the words meant knew that he was the wanderer so for a second the girl stood surprised hesitating she was extraordinarily beautiful a slender slip of a girl about fourteen with a long round throat poising the delicate oval of her face and black lashes sweeping to meet the bar of her brows above her soft velvety eyes there was a likeness still to the little orphan cousin who had come to make one more mouth to feed in the patriarchal household when he was a big boy just keen for college the girlchild over whom his mother had smiled mysteriously and talked of the years to come when the head of the house would have had his fill of education for his boy and permit marriage yes this was she his cousin little naraini there is naught amiss my lord she said suddenly drawing back in her turn with an offended air i too am brahmin my hand is pure so indignantly she dropped her alms of parched wheat into the gutter and slammed the door chris down on his knees his blood on fire picked every grain up and then his head in a greater whirl than ever made his way back to the river steps to his hidden clothes to the last hold he had on western life and thought the steps were almost deserted in the noontide therefore wearied out with his vigil of the night and the excitement of the day he lay down deliberately to sleep feeling even thisthis possibility of going to bed without oneto be a relief after all the paraphernalia of pillows mattresses blankets and sheets when he woke the sun had begun to sink and the stream of worship was setting templewards again but the crowd was a different one more temporal less spiritual more eager for gossip less concerned with salvation and chris who had gained confidence in his disguise by this time left the shadow of the trees in order to listen to the talk even to such as he it was an opportunity of gauging the mind of the multitude which did not often present itself and being refreshed by his long sleep he saw clearly that he personally might find this a useful experience the wildness of the rumours current however the absurdity of the beliefs he heard put forward were beyond his patience and more than once he drew down an unwelcome interest in himself by his flat denials his disguise howeverif it could be called a disguise seeing that he was indeed what he professed to beheld out and so by degrees he grew bolder telling himself that the day would not be lost if he could begin to practise what he had preached in shark lane and raise his voice for the truths sake it was not however till the first twinkling lights of the evening service showed in the temples and the red and green signals on the railway bridge answered the challenge that he found himself in the position he had advocated that is one in opposition to many he did not shrink from the situation when it came he had too much grit for that it is a lie he reasserted and turning to the larger crowd beyond the listening few raised his voice listen friends and i will tell you why it is not true that this golden paper fell from heaven into kalis temple why her priests lie when they say it did listen for i am brahmin i know the gods and their ways and i know the huzoors and their ways also who is the lad he speaks well passed in murmurs among the crowd which closed in to see and hear better chris pulled himself together as he stood his figure showing clear against the light that lingered on the river who am i he echoed listen and i will tell you i am twice born regeneratea brahmin of the brahmins there was sudden stir in the crowd a murmur let her passshe knows and then in that clear space where he stood a woman stood also a hindoo widow with bare arm uplifted from her white shroud lie not krishn davenund she said thou art outcast accursed i thy mother say it the face clear cut pale with continued fasting showed no pain no regret only stern reproof thou art not twiceborn now oh son of my desolation she went on her voice shrilling as she spoke thou art twicedead go back to thy new ways to thy new wife a sudden stretch of her hand towards the scarletclad young girl shrinking by her side told its tale of something more bitter than bigotry of a mothers jealousy chris who had fallen back from that unexpected betrayal gave a hasty glance round and what he saw in the faces of the crowd made him realise his position hush mother he began but it was too late her story was well known among the priests they were in arms at once and ere a minute passed chris found himself at bay ankle deep in the water into which he had been driven his back against the sacred temple of viseshwar so adding to his crime by its defilement listen he called but the crowd were already past that and the cries he is a spy he hath defiled us whom hath he not touched he hath been here all day he is sent to make us christians rose on all sides chris his back to the temple set his teeth beyond the crowd that was kept at a yards distance yet by something in his face he could see two women scarlet and white robed sobbing in each others arms and the sight made him savage for their pain how can i defile you he cried i am brahmin yonder is my mother my father all know who dares to take my birthright from me who thyself came viciously from the foremost row of priests where is thy sacred thread apostate chris flinched for the first time it was true in a fit of anger when his own received him not he had removed the badge of the twiceborn with his own hands so he had nothing to which he could appeal nothing old or new listen he began again helplessly and the crowd feeling the helplessness surged closer kill him said one voice dominating the others by the very simplicity of its advice he is nothing he is not of us nor of the huzoors who wants him another instant and the advice might have been followed had not some one claimed poor chrishad not a voice from behind said softly well im dashed if it aint the guvnor now then you niggers the next instant with a plentiful if quite goodnatured use of heels and elbows chris davenants foreman of works was through the crowd into the water and so facing round on those threatening faces was backing towards chris and making furious feints with his fists the while ramram gents he said affably now wot youve got to do is to tell me wot all this is about wot are you doin to my guvnor dont you speak sir he added in

lilt in it he began click click like a monkey on a stick the answer followed in a second with rustlings and boundings the monkeys came to the rescue of the familiar voice for the crowd behind weary of being unable to see what was passing in front turned instinctively to the new interest and so losing cohesion the multitude lost unity of purpose also for the moment nows your time sir shouted john ellison keep close to me then with a wild yell of clear the decks comrades he rushed head down at the fat stomach of the chief priest bowled him over and treating the rest as he would have treated a

listened decorously respectfully it was not till chris attired in the fateful garments with his subordinates white uniform coat superadded and the devotees shawl twined as a turban since it had not been deemed feasible to recover the rest of the dresssuit that night was ready to return to civilisation that john ellison ventured on a parting remark its the onsartainty sir that does the mischief

estimate of the danger and discomforts of uncertainty for far and near from government house where grace arbuthnot sate at the head of a glittering dinnertable round which half the empiremaking bureaucracy of the province was gathered to the veriest hovel on the outcast outskirts of the city where two womenthe lowest of the lowwere grinding at the mill for their daily bread such sweepings of the corndealers shops as they had been able to gather during the day the feeling that none knew what the coming dawn might bring to hovel and house home and country and people lay heavily almost suffocatingly it is a feeling which comes to india none can tell how or why it is in the air like plague and pestilence there is no remedy for it and the fact that we aliens have learnt to recognise its existence is often the only difference between the vague unrest which dies away as it came irrationally and that which brought us the mutiny and which may conceivably bring us one again there is only one thing certain about this feeling whatever passion or injustice or ignorance causes the first quickened heartbeat it is not long before however obscurely the great problem of sex becomes involved in the quarrel between east and west for there lies the crux of toleration of loyalty so with plague and its inevitable interference with domestic life looming before them the hardworked officials who for six days of the week had borne the heaviest burden men can bearabsolute executive responsibility when the executive authority is limitedknew perfectly well as they deliberately tried to forget that burden round the dinnertable at government house that very little would suffice to upset that unstable equilibrium of law and order whichtaken in conjunction with the peaceful lawabiding temperament of the peopleis so remarkable in india and there was so much that might conceivably upset it to begin with the tape machine under lock and key in the private secretarys office next the diningroom at any moment in the middle of a jest or a pate de foie gras its electric bell might begin to ring and the verdict of british ignorance embodied in a message from a secretary of state print itself out in obliteration of the verdict of practical experience for telegrams had been coming fast and frequent of late would inevitably come faster and more frequent every year every month every day as the lessening length of time between india and england made the pulsebeats of either audible to the other then every one round the table knew that those days those hours were also inevitably bringing nearer and nearer that quarrel as to whether cleanliness comes next to godliness or godliness to cleanliness which has yet to be settled between east and west between a race which prides itself on asserting the former in its proverb yet in its practice insists on sanitation and leaves salvation to take its chance and a race which while asserting that salvation is impossible without physical purity practically ignores cleanliness a quarrel which is surely the quaintest dissociation of theory and practice which the world can show all the quainter in that the western proverb is a quotation from the sacred wisdom of the east the question therefore when will the plague come with its corollary if it comes what shall we do underlay the laughter of twothirds of the guests for they were men the remaining third being women were as yet unconcerned the danger had not yet come within their horizon of personal good or evil all except grace arbuthnot and that it had come into hers was due simply to an enlargement of that personal horizon not from any general sense of duty yet in a way the men also limited their wonder to their own line of work the city magistrate with reference to the back slums of nushapore peopled by the idlest most dissolute most depraved population in india the inspectorgeneral of hospitals thought of his native doctors his dispensaries the policeofficer of his badcharacter list his licences to carry arms the generalincommand of the station again thought of his garrison of the four hundred sick in hospital out of eighteen hundred men who might be wanted ere long his were not pleasant thoughts and they were urgent only that morning he had driven down from cantonments to catch the lieutenantgovernor before he went to church and discuss the doctors fiat that nothing short of a complete change a complete severance from the bazaars which crowding round the barracks placed the troops as it were in the midst of a native town was likely to do any good so they had discussed the question during service hours while others were saying good lord deliver us from a variety of evils with the result that sir george had promised to go down to cantonments the very next day and see for himself what the state of affairs was yet despite the fact that all the repressed anxiety present centred round the one word plague the first hint of the subject mooted gravely brought instant protest from a highpitched irish brogue oh plague take it altogether for it is becoming a bore of the fullest dimensions but i hearrd a fine story about it an old martineau yesterday there has been a suspected case in one of his districts an old mohammedan woman travelling alone in a country gig died and the deputycollectora hindoo hungering for promotionthought he ud curry favour with the powers by bein prompt so he burrnt the cart an the clothes an the corpse they didnt mind the corpsebein a womanthough its perdition me dear mrs carruthers for a mohammedan to be burrnt but the clothes were another story and the relatives kicked up a bit of a fuss so martineau had to hold an inquiry did you burrn the corpse he roaredye know his suckingdove of a voice sir says the deputy half bluefunk halfelation at his own action i did the rules provide i didnt ask for the rules sir roars martineau did you burrn the clothes huzoor bleats the baboo forgetting his english it is laid down i didnt ask whats laid down comes the roar did you burrn the cart ghereebnawaz blubbers the deputy i thought confound you sir i didnt ask what you thought did you burrn the driver no no shrieked the wretched creature fallin on his knees it is a lie it is malice it is an invention of my enemies i didnt then sir thunders martineau youre a dd fool sir not to have stopped his mouth there was a lighthearted laugh round the table which for the time being focussed all the qualities which go to make empire not the least of which is the faculty for such laughter laughter which comes to the west sometimes to be celebrated in song and story like that of the ball before waterloo or of the french noblesse in the conciergerie but which is ever present in india giving to its angloindian society an almost wistful frivolity studious in its gay refusal to take anything aux grands serieux till the stern necessity of doing so stares it in the face and with the laugh the grave whitecoated darkfaced servants passed round the table also ignoring the mirth ignoring all things save french dishes and iced champagne lucky it was a woman wasnt it said a voice if it had been a man there would have been real trouble how rude isnt it at least as bad for a woman to be burnt challenged a very pretty one as a man for the woman no doubt replied the brogue drily but in this case the men dont care ye see the mohammedan paradise is already peopled with houris like yourself me dear mrs carruthers so the presence of the sex isnt important enough to fuss about of course not retorted the little lady gaily because you men know we can always make a paradise for ourselves make an mar me dear madam oh i give you eve the woman who is fool enough to think she can keep her husband in one if she gives him a cold lunch of apples deserves to lose everything except her looks the world cant spare the pretty women so far the lightness of both voices had been charming but a new one coming from the other side of the table had the heavy acidity in it of wine that should sparkle and does not for the owner being mrs carrutherss recognised rival sinned against the first principles of badinage by importing spite into it surely thats been said before every one knows cooks are the devil mine is anyhow the devil echoed little mrs carruthers eyeing her adversarywhose bad dinners were a bywordwith a charming surprise i wonder at your saying so why the devil tempts you and you do eat andand some cooks disgust you and you dont her antagonist s protest that the quotation applied to eve was lost in the laugh during which jack raymondwho had found it impossible to evade sir george arbuthnots conscientious gratitude for jerrys rescue as embodied in an invitation to dinnersaid to his neighbour you think miss drummond that we angloindians talk a lot of rubbish he himself had given her small opportunity of judging for he had been very silent all through the meal in fact a trifle sulky why he could not decide and it had annoyed him that he should be conscious at once of resentment and relief at the etiquette of precedence which sent the secretary to the club so far from the beautiful face at the head of the table and lesley for her part after the manner of modern girls had accepted his silence calmly not troubling herself to amuse one who did not trouble to amuse her so she had eaten her dinner peacefully without any reference to her neighbour he however had been unable to attain this philosophic standard this indifference of the independent girl of the world who conscious of an assured position even as an unmarried woman treats man as an unnecessary if on the whole a not unpleasant adjunct to a life that is complete without him was quite new to jack raymond who had not been home for fourteen years he admired it frankly felt that it suited her suited the refined curve of the long throat the faint droop at the corners of the mouth the smooth coils of hair the chill dignity of it all he realisedfor he was a quick judge in such mattersdid not mean anything personal it was not he with whom as he phrased it she desired to have no truck but with the whole creation of such as he or such rather as she chose to consider him for it was evident that despite her almost magisterial calm she still used the womans privilege of making her own heroes and villains in reality she could know nothing about him should he tell her something the question had occurred to him and had found answer in his remark she answered the challenge with a halfbored smile i suppose you like it but it does seem odd to an outsider in what is virtually a picked society and then there is so much to talk about seriously in india we prefer to think about serious things he replied coolly ill bet youshall we say your namesakes oddstwenty to onethat the men round this table do better work for not wasting time inin talkeetalkee i dont bet she said too disdainful for wider notice of his words so i am aware he answered quietly and that reminds me the five thousand rupees i won off bonnie lesley still awaits your instructions mine she echoed in surprise why as to what charity is to profit by my sin there is one for the regeneration of european reprobatesmore commonly called the loafers fund miss drummond which under the circumstances might suit she looked icebergs thanks mr raymond but your eloquence succeeded so absolutely in convincing me i was in no way responsible that i must decline to interfere please do as you choose with your illgotten gains he smiled then the money being in thousandrupee notes shall stay where it isin my pocketbook it gives a gambler confidence to know he has some spare cash about him besides he added hastily a sudden shrinking in her eyes warning him that he had really pained her it might come in for a good deed possibly not probably she began then explained herself hastily i mean of course it is not likely such an occasion will arise dont miss drummond he interrupted gravely keep your bad opinion of me undiluted you cant go wrong there but dont condemn the lot of us for talking rubbish there is generally a reason for it there is generally a reason for most things i believe she said coldly her tone nettled him and as usual when his temper rose he went straight to the point generally he admitted but i dont think you allow for these that lady opposite for instance is talking nonsense all she knows in order to forget that she sang the hymn for those at sea today the padre had it because his wife and daughter are on their way out and a bad cyclone was telegraphed yesterday off socotra her only son is in the same boat then the man next her he went on for lesley was listening with faintly startled faintly distasteful curiosity is trying to forget that the doctors tell him it is a toss up whether he can pull through the next hot weather without leave he cant afford to take any with four boys at school and one at the university luckily if he doesnt pull through his wifeshe has been bossing the show at home these five years because the rupees wouldnt run two establishmentswill be better off than if he did pensions of a hundred and a hundred and fifty mount up you see when theres ten of a family then the pretty woman flirting with the general is trying to forget there is such a thing as a child in the world she left four at home because they telegraphed that her husband wasnt safe alone he was in an outstation and took a doublebarrelled gun to shoot locusts so he said but his bearer wetted the cartridges and sent a camel sowar to headquarters for the doctor he has still to use a hair restorer youll observethats the man over there look how hes watching his wife he has to take her back to the wilderness tomorrow and i shouldnt wonder if he wasnt thinking himself a fool not to have made sure for her sake that his powder was dry brain fever plays tricks with a mans reasoning powers miss drummond lesleys lip curled slightly with the indifferent distaste so many girls have nowadays for the least sentimentality the faintest claim on emotion is it all tragedy she began critically all he interrupted her cheerfully even mrs carruthers has one they fumigated her last paris frock at the quarantine station and took the colour out of it but thats enough i dont want to have to find a reason for the nonsense that is in me are you going to the artillery sports tomorrow she gave no answer but she sat looking at him with an appreciative smile you do it very well though she said then paused i wonder why you gave up the civil service lady arbuthnot told me you did but she didnt say why i expect you lost your temper didnt you it was exactly what he had done but the only person who had ever told him so before had been grace arbuthnot and she had made it a personal matter her eyes had given and claimed so much when she told him while the ones opposite him now were absolutely selfabsorbed possibly he admitted curtly nettled by her cool curiosity you can judge for yourself there was a row in the native city of which i had charge i fired on the mob government thought it was unnecessary and stopped my promotion i resigned and the row she asked quickly that stopped also of course excuse me but lady arbuthnot has made the move lesley stood up tall slender almost conventual in her clinging white dress in the reserved yet absolutely selfreliant look on her face but she paused ere leaving him to say judicially then that proves that you were right to fire and if you were in the right as you were when are you not coming lesley you can finish your discussion afterwards came lady arbuthnots voice in a halfplayful halfimpatient appeal as she stopped beside them to include the girl in the contingent she was marshalling towards the door the servants had gone from one end to the other of the big room there was no hint or sign of the east it might have been a london dinnerparty grace herself in her pale green draperies and flashing diamonds might have been the london hostess whose only care was to get rid of her guests gracefully and so find freedom to be one herself elsewhere it is my fault put in jack raymond quickly it is so seldom any one tells me i do right that i must be excused for delaying a young lady who is kind enough to perjure herself to say so i didnt perjure myself said lesley with a frown i dont as a rule i really think you were right he knew absolutely that her praise wasas her blame had beenquite impersonal that he was forgotten in her sense of abstract justice and injustice but he appropriated the commendation with a bow because he felt that to do so was a challenge to both the women before him to grace of the older type with her cult of sentiment deliberately overlaying her intellect and lesley of the newer type with her dislike to sentimentality as deliberately overlaying her heart he felt with a certain irritation that there ought to be some middle standpoint as he said thank you miss drummond lady arbuthnot recognised the personal challenge instantly what was the virtue lesley she asked proudly only firing on a mob he answered for the girl it is lucky lady arbuthnot that i have no chance of doing so again or the consequences of miss drummonds approval might be more disastrous than that of other peoples blame the sense of something uncomprehended coming to lesley uncomfortably as it always comes made her forbear to squash the maker of the bow and say hastily in halfunconscious effort after the purely commonplace then i hope there wont be a chance but one can never tell can one she blushed at her own inane words when she heard them but grace arbuthnot as she moved on gave a little hard laugh never my dear so long as there are men and women in the world it will be as stephen hargraves said all a muddle she broke off abruptly to look round for through the closed doors of the secretarys room came the imperative ring of an electric bell making more than one keen face follow her example but at the open door where the private secretary was holding up the portiere on one side while nevill lloyd as adc held up the other the former shrugged his shoulders bother that bell he said to little mrs carruthers who was passing theres my evening gone they might spare us sundayespecially when you are dining here ive a great mind to keep them ringing till youve gone dont she laughed supposing it were a mutiny she made the suggestion out of pure wickedness because her rival who owned to never sleeping a wink if the bazaar near her house was noisy and let off fireworks was within hearing surely you dont thinkbegan the timorous lady certainly not consoled the secretary and if it was mrs carruthers thats no reason for breaking the sabbath they dont retorted the gay little lady sunday is over with them ages ago they are six hours before behind you mean the west is absolutely hopelessly behind mrs carruthers nodded airily how do you know you never can be certain can you which is before and which is behind in a circle it all depends on where you are with which piece of wisdom the last paris frock but one trailed off into the drawingroom and deposited itself comfortably and becomingly by the side of a dowdy black one for the sake of contrast and monopoly byandby when the men should return to their allegiance they lingered over their wine however that evening so long that grace arbuthnot grew pale over the strain of waiting to know what that electric bell had meant she was given to worrying herself quite needlessly lesley under similar conditions would have taken the situation in more manly fashion but then she was far more assured of her position curiously enough than grace arbuthnot was of hers for the simple reason that the latter had won it in her generation by her personal and exceptional capability while lesley took hers by right of the ordinary womans new claim to be heard as well as seen and then grace arbuthnot was at another disadvantage her sentiment was a heavier weight to carry than lesleys lack of it and jack raymonds words had set her nerves jarring so at last on the mothers excuse of going to see if jerry were comfortably asleep she left the drawingroom and on her way upstairs paused to listen at the diningroom door as she stood there in her diamonds her seagreen garments trying to catch anything definite in the muffled voices within she felt a sudden vast impatience at her sex felt as lesley would not have felt that it was a disadvantage for the old revolt of womanhood used to be against nature now it is against the custom which shackles nature as she passed on up the wide stairs the strange silence and solitude of an indian house in which all service comes from outside lay about her but in jerrys room the open window let in a sound the most restless sound in the world the rhythmic yet hurried beat of the little hourglass drum used by the natives in their amusements rhythmic yet hurried like the quickened throb of a heart it came faintly indefinitely from the distance and darkness of the city but grace had been too long in india not to be able to picture for herself the environment whence it rose she could see the murk of smoke and shadow the light of flicker and flare on the circling faces round the shrilling voice or posturing figure of a woman was it a wedding or was itthe other thing it might be either for that intermittent noise of fireworks which echoed at intervals like the report of guns belonged to both this time it was a fear of her own self that came to grace arbuthnot as she listeneda fear of her own sexa fear of the hundreds of thousands of hearts beating away in the darkness around her beating perhaps in rhythm to that restless sound and so little might bring the restlessness to a heart her own gave quick assent as she looked down on the sleeping childish face seen dimly by the rushlight set on the floor beside the muffled sleeping figure of the childs bearer for the sight brought back in a second that other sleeping face she had seen a few days before not that the two were outwardly alike the likeness lay within she took a step nearer and then stood looking curiously almost fearfully at the child she had borne she was one of the ninety and nine out of every hundred good women who pass through wifehood and motherhood thinking it their duty to ignore its problemsthe problems which only good women can solveand so it gave her a certain shock to realise that she had passed on that old love of hers to this child of another man yet when one came to think of it what else was heredityif there was such a thing in the mindbut the passing on of ones admirations ones ideals the passing on from generation to generation of ones own affinity for good or evil the slow evolution of the spirit of a race the spirit of a race she stooped suddenly and kissed the little sleeping face and the kiss had in it the thought of another sleeping face and an almost fierce pride of possession but the childs face frowned and a little white nightgowned arm curved itself to shield the cheek from further caresses dont bovver mum im all wight came a sleepy protest grace stood straight again feeling baffled helpless for that dislike to any display of affection had never been to her liking it had been in fact partly responsible for her refusal to fulfil her engagement when jack raymond had lost his temper and threatened to throw up his career she had dared him to do it and being highspirited he had done it and then with bitter regret infinite pain and a vast amount of conventional virtue she had withdrawn her promise to marry him because for the first time in twelve years of steady conviction that she had done right the suggestion that the only justification for such refusal must lie in the inability of one or the other to perform their part of the contract and that that again must depend on what the contract of marriage is essentially came to disturb her but she turned from it impatiently telling herself she was a fool at threeandthirty to puzzle over past problems when the present was full of them and far more interesting ones yet as she went downstairs again that insistent throbbing from the dark distant heart of the city seemed to go with her rousing a perfect passion of reckless unrest in her own was anything certain except present pleasure or pain was it worth while even to be certain was it not better to let that heartthrob quicken or slacken as it chose she felt her face pale her eyes bright as she reentered the drawingroom to see instantly first of all that jack raymond was talking to lesley it required quite an effort for her to remember her real anxiety and with a certain sense of duty seek out her husband who was standing with the commissioner in a quiet corner it was nothing serious i hope george she said he turned to her perplexed but kindly serious my dear oh you mean the telegram no nothing really important though they seem to think it so over there they want me to promulgate some sort of official denial of there being any secret programme in the event of a plague outbreak it is weak of coursein a way a mistake but i dont think it will do actual harmdo you kenyon the commissioner shrugged his shoulders he was not in the secret but had his suspicions no sir he replied not unless there was one and the fact were to leak out it is difficult to prevent this with native clerks especially when the idea of it is present as it certainly is but the reality isnt put in sir george decisively in spite of what that scurrilous fellow says today in the voice of india grace caught in her breath sharply what does it say she asked only that such a paper does exist and that it can be producedwhich is of course absurd his glance at his wife for the comprehension she alone could give made him pause my dear he went on concernedly how pale you are there is really nothing to be anxious aboutis there kenyon for myself im glad of the definite lead over for one thing it makes it feasible for us to do what the doctors have been urging on the general for some time backsend both regiments out to a health camp at moradki they seem to have gone to bits altogether sullivan told me today he had fortyeight cases of enteric alone and that he had never known the men so reckless and hard to managebreaking out of hospital every night i wonder why began lady arbuthnot when the commissioner interrupted her why its simplicity itself dont you know the story well this is it the first battalion of the th regiment here was under home orders from burmah and the men of course saved up every penny they could at the last moment however the second battalion could only produce three hundred boys who could by any possibility pass muster as twentyone the agelimit for india so the authorities wired out to draft every possible man from the first for an extra years foreign service with the second battalionvirtually a strange regiment the men drew out every halfpenny of their savings the day the order came and have been spending it ever sinceand teaching the three hundred boys to spend theirs too its the record of a big blunder just so assented sir george but these mistakes will occur it was unfortunate however that they sent the second battalion here for the first was nearly decimated by cholera at nushapore about three years ago sullivan says he thinks it is largely that they hate the place are in a bit of a funk about it and when that is the case they will do anything for the sake of a distraction grace listening seemed to hear once more that restless throbbing in the air she saw the murk of smoke and shadow the light of flicker and flare the shrilling voice the posturing figure and the encircling faces she clasped her mothers hands tight and thought of her own boyof the spirit of the race chapter x the sinews of war there was a strong smell of carbolic in miss leezies house for the bazaar on which it gave was being cleaned by half a dozen sweepers a watercarrier and the conservancy overseer in a uniform coat with a brass badge his part being to dole out the disinfectant and survey the proceedings from various doorsteps in advance of the slimy black sludge which was being propelled by the sweepers brooms along the open guttersthose scientificallysloped saucershaped gutters that are the pride of every cantonment magistrates heart the cleansing of them was scientific also partly because the conservancy darogha knew that the lieutenantgovernor was due in cantonments that afternoon mostly however because that particular bazaar being a favourite lounge for the dwellers in the barracks round the corner the orders regarding its cleanliness were strict it was therefore as clean as it is possible to keep a road between two tightpacked rows of mud houses which are guiltless of any sanitary appliances unlimited as to inmates and from which all refuse has to find its way into the gutter unless as sometimes happens the moving of it even thus far is considered too much trouble and it is left to fester and rot in some dark corner within until it betrays itself and brings raids and fines upon the injured inhabitants even so there was filth and to spare for the brooms filth that smelt horribly beneath its veneer of carbolic more than once indeed the whitetrousered legs belonging to the uniform coat and the badge had when the wearer had forgotten sewage in a pull at some shopkeepers pipe to withdraw themselves hastily from the oncoming of a regular bore of unutterable muck which came sweeping along like a tidal wave overwhelming even scientific saucers it happened so at the aeratedwater sellers whose shop was beneath miss leezies balconied apartments it was an excellent position for the trade and though he only charged two pice a bottle for soda and lemonade he found no difficulty in paying a heavy licence for the privilege of selling shahjeshanpore rum potato brandy and bad whisky in addition to the waters but then he could make the latter for less than they could at the regimental factory where they had to use filters and satisfy the inspecting doctor that everything was according to rule and regulation just as they had to satisfy him at the regimental dairies that the few drops of milk given to the soldier in barracks were as pure as care could make them the purity of course raised the price of milk to the authorities but they did not grudge the expense to themselves in such a good cause besides if the soldiers wanted more milkand some of the boys fresh out from home were still young enough to prefer a tumbler of it to one of bad spirit and tepid sodathere was always plenty of the cheaper quality to be bought at the sweetmeat shops and of these as well as of fruit shops and sherbet shops there were many in the bazaar where miss leezie and her kind lodged in the upper stories so that either above or below the dwellers in the barracks round the corner could find enough to satisfy the appetite therefore the smell of carbolic was conscientiously mingled with that of decaying melon rinds sour milk drains and musk and the outcome of the atmosphere was left to providence the immediate result was not savoury especially in the low stuffy room as yet shut out from the light and air of the balcony by wadded portieres in which a woman lounging in one corner was idly allowing her fingers to flirt on the parchment of a drumone of those small quaint drums shaped like times hourglass which produce what grace arbuthnot had told herself was the most restless sound on gods earth it had the same passion of unrest here in this squalid room though it was scarcely loud enough to stir the air heavy with that horrible compound of smells the woman was miss leezie herself as yet negligent in purely native deshabille for the afternoon was still young and she knew that custom would be late owing to the artillery sports indeed she was going to them herself by and by with some of her apprentices in a hired carriage but she was not taking sobrai for sobrai was wilful oddly attractive withal and therefore dangerous to the discipline of cantonments with an evil tongue also so that miss leezie looked over in lazy anger to the opposite corner of the room whence a shrill assertion that the speaker would not be put upon had just risen then thou hadst best go back to the city and dilaram fool said the mistress of the house sharply for if thou stayest here it must be to walk sober as we all do to the time of the fifes and drums my house hath a good name and i will not have it given an ill one for all the apprentices in nushapore so if thou wilt not obey go there be plenty of that sort unlicensed beyond the boundaries but we are different we are approved she leant back with palpable pride against a wall which found its only purification from the rub of red coats and that civilised flavouring of carbolic in the smell of drains and garbage sobrai scowled sulkily she had set her heart on going to the sports in a conglomerate attire of white flounced muslin tight silk trousers nosering and kid gloves preferably on the roof of the hired green box on wheels within which miss leezie would sit in dignified state i did not come hither to rot within four walls i could have done that in the city she shrilled louder still hold thy peace idiot interrupted miss leezie if thou dost dare to raise a commotion now when at any moment the latsahib himself may come driving past twill be the worse for thee wah thou canst do nothing answered sobrai feeling cowed despite the assertion by miss leezies tone nothing echoed the latter with a hideous laugh nay sister such as thou art at the mercy of a whisper i have but to make it and out thou goest neck and crop to the sound of the fifes and drums nay more she rose slowly and with the hourglass of bent wood and parchment in her hand crossed to stand in front of the sullen figure and go on drumming softly in imitation of a march then after a glance at the other drowsy figures in the room she leant down to the girls ear to repeat savagelyay and more i can put thee in as well as turn thee out put thee in the four walls of a real prison remember the stolen pearls sobrai the girl laughed defiantly cunningly lo hast thou thought of that at last but i am no fool leezie i counted the cost ere i gave them in payment to thee see you thy blame for receiving them is as mine for taking them that is the sahibs law and then who is to say they are stolen not jehan he would not own his loss if the owning meant that the city should know one of his women sobrai begum princess was in miss leezies house that would be dishonour for all it hath such a good name she essayed a giggle but it failed before the coarse sensuous face where the blanc de perle of full dress still lingered in almost awful contrast to the veil of eastern modesty listen fool replied the past mistress in the rules and regulations within which vice is safer than virtue listen and quit striving thou art mine not only as those others she flirted her hand from the drum to the dozing girls whom fear of the fife and drum keeps in my power i would not have taken thee without other leading strings knowing thee as i dowilful ay and clever too girlwith patience sure to do wellshe threw this sop in carelesslybut i found the reins to my hand or ever i took thy pearls i knew there were more than jehans amissing for the police come ever to us first more than jehans echoed sobrai stupidly what then this whispered miss leezie fiercely those four paltry pearls shall not be jehans leavings on the carpet but earnest for the whole string of the same set mark you the same set she laughed maliciously which thou didst steal from the ladysahib it is all in the power of the police and they are my friends so if thou dost so much as raise thy voice i will raise mine from the ladysahib faltered sobrai aghast ay from the ladysahib hark that will be the lat himself coming to satisfy himself all is as it should be shall i tell him now when i make my salaam as is due or wilt thou promise she paused her hand on the portiere ere going into the balcony and waited for a sign of surrender from sobrai but it is not trueprotested the latter miss leezie laughed as true as aught thou canst bring since as thou sayest jehan will not own up quick shall i speak sobrai sate stunned silent then dropped her head between her knees so the portiere slid sideways letting in a shaft of sunlight a stronger whiff of carbolic and the rumble of a passing vehicle but only for a second for in the carriage which came rapidly down the swept and garnished bazaar ablaze with sunlight there were ladies and miss leezie therefore drew back decorously to continue gazing however through a side slit he hath his mems with him she explained to the drowsy crew roused by the rumble two and one is beautiful as a houri but they wear no fringe is that to be fassen think you tis as well to be in it and as the carriage passed the slit grew wider and wider as one pair after another of bold black eyes noted the lack of fringe in grace arbuthnot and lesley drummond who were accompanying sir george so far on their way to be shown over one of the hospitals by the head sister under whom it so happened lesley had served when after modern fashion she had gone in for a years nursing it is certainly most beautifully clean it ought to be healthy enough was her remark now as she drove past ignorant not only of the eyes that were turning her into a fashion plate but of everything in the environment it couldnt well be cleaner assented grace with a faint reservation in her voice but she too was unconscious of those watching eyes those mimicking minds quite so admitted sir george dubiously everything is done that can be done of course but it is uncommonly hard to make a bazaar healthy he glanced back as he spoke at the balcony above the sodawater shop the children little naked happy brown creatures were playing in the sunshine the shopkeepers stood up to salaam an ekka load or two of soldiers in uniform their legs dangling outwards on all sides their red bodies jammed to shapelessness in the effort to find sitting room on the jimp seat till the whole looked like a huge toy crab on wheels rattled past towards the artillery paradeground their songs and laughter audible above the rattle so abruptly the bazaar ended and the cantonment church showed its spire above some stunted trees the sweepers having finished the gutters by this time were at work on the church compound clearing away the litter of yesterdays services and they drew up in line the darogha with his disinfectants at their head to salaam brooms in hand as the carriage drove past then suddenly beyond the church separated by it only from the bazaar was the bareness of the barracks a dozen or more of them set at different angles long low all to pattern absolutely indistinguishable from each other save by the big black number painted on the gableends desolate utterly lacking for the most part any reason whatever why they should stand on that particular spot instead of upon another in the dry bare sunscorched plots of ground intersected by dry white dusty roads but two or three of themthose farthest awayapparently had a somewhat efficient one for sir george said pointing them out those are the hospitals over there close to the cemetery ill drop you and go on to my committee the carriage can return and take you on to the sports i can walki mean if there is time after weve settled things the dubious tone was in his voice once more perhaps the renewed smell of carbolic mixed with iodoform engendered doubt as to the efficacy of anything but heroic treatment the smell was strong in the comfortable little room where grace and lesley waited for sister mary and it came in still stronger with the latters workmanlike grey dress and scarlet facings dr sullivan is here and can take you round at once lady arbuthnot she said cheerfully and then if you will honour us he will drive you over to our mess for tea before you go on to the sports it was all so cutanddried so commonplace so as it were inevitable so almost proper to this kindfaced woman whose work it was but the first glance into that unnaturally long unnaturally bare unnaturally clean room with its windows set high so that the twentyfour beds down one side and the twentyfour beds down the other side should be free of draught yet full of air gave grace arbuthnot a sudden almost resistless desire to call aloud to clap her hands to do something anything to drive the sight from her to startle it into flight to rouse herself from the nightmare of it this is the enteric ward said sister mary in a matteroffact tone all the beds are full today and dr sullivanbut he will tell you himself there he is coming from the officers ward have you many in there asked lesley only three and we are not sure of one he owns however to having drunk a lot of milk when he was thirsty out shooting and that is always suspicious we shall know in a day or two it comes often through the milk doesnt it remarked grace dreamily she was absorbed in the face which showed on the bed beside which she was standing a face on the pillow no more all the rest tidy folded sheet and coverlet such a boyish facesleeping or unconscious peaceful absolutely but so strangely aloof even from that long low room with its endless appliances its evidence of energy time money lavished regardlessly in the effort to save sister mary smiled gently tolerantly i think generally we always sterilise our milk in hospital you know as grace arbuthnot shook hands with the doctor who came up at that moment she was conscious of a confused quotation trying to formulate itself at the back of her brain about closing doors when steeds are stolen and sterilising seeds when they have been sown the doctors kind eyes however drove the thought away for they were eyes which seemed to see the nightmare hidden under all the care and the comfort more clearly than sister marys though hers were kind to the uttermost alsokind and quickso that as she passed down the row of beds with the visitors she left the other sisters and the orderlies busy and more than once her eyes and the doctorsthe womans and the mansmet after looking at a boys face with regret or relief in them but no one said a word of better or worse except now and again a wistful voice from the beds that stood so close together what young faces said grace in an undertone there was a constriction in her throat which might have prevented her speaking loud had she wished to do so i doubt if there is a case over twoandtwenty in the ward replied dr sullivan excepthe paused beside a cot in the far corner where a nurse sate at the head and an orderly waited at the footexcept this one he spoke without any attempt at an aside for the face staring up with open eyes at the ceiling was unmistakably unconscious yet even so curiously haggard weary anxious he is a hospital orderly went on the doctor the best nurse i ever came across i wonder how many fellows hes pulled through in his fifteen years of it but it has got him at last though he was careful in a hurry possibly and didnt disinfect theres been a terrible rush lately and very little will do it poor old steady normal he laid his hand regretfully on the anxious forehead for an instant and the expression on his face was mirrored in those around him they called him that lady arbuthnot he explained because he used to beam all over when he could echo that report well if anybody pulls through he ought to in justice but its a bad case you see he is saturated with the poison so on and on they passed down one side and up the other pausing by each bed to look at what lay there and compare it with the chart which sister mary unhooked from the wall and handed to the doctor it got on grace arbuthnots nerves at lastthe methodical calm of it all the smiles that were so cheerfully sympathetic or so wistfully impatient the studious speech the still more studious silence until at last when the end was near and dr sullivans finger travelling over a chart pointed out a level after a series of peaks and passes she could not help seeking relief in the remark that some one was out of the wood a contented smile came to the face she was leaving but a look showed on the one she was approaching which struck her like a blow which she felt she could never forget so full was it of something akin to anger in its hopeless helpless blame he is in the thick of it poor chap said the doctor in a low voice only came in yesterday and graces eyes dim with tears could scarcely see the jagged notches rising higher and higher in the fresh unfingered chart that was being shown her can nothing be done she asked abruptly when the doctor was driving her over to the mess in his dogcart the others were walking and he had just pointed out the temporary hospital they had had to open he shook his head god knows sometimes i think i could with a free hand we do what we can as it is but what can you expect when the men get sitting about the bazaars and eating and drinking filth there is only one way out of it now lady arbuthnot as i hope youll tell sir george get em away into the desert not to be tempted of the devil but towhat shall we saytoto get back the sinews of war he finished proud of his quotation it was apt enough to recur more than once to grace arbuthnots mind as she watched the sports once especially when a tugofwar began and a team of boys big enough but softlooking stood up against the artillery they havent a chance against us said nevill lloyd with pardonable pride to begin with we are accustomed to handle ropes and thenof course if the highlanders had been here still thered have been a fight but these new fellows havent the sinewas yet they pulled pluckily though for all they were worth encouraged thereat amongst other supporters by a number of big upstanding sepoys from the native lines they were in mufti which however was no disguise to their martial swagger and palpable pride of strength dont pull brotherlings they advised put the weight on the rope and stand steady so oh tis gods will he has not given the weight yet it will come brothers meanwhile it is fate not defeat but as they turned carelessly from the end one said to his neighbour ari bhai we could have taught the tope khanawallahs a lesson and the neighbour laughed yea if they gave us the chance but they will not they know we of the pultans are bigger and stronger than they of the rigiments but they would not have the world know it as if it could not see as he stood aside cheerfully almost respectfully to let a smoothfaced freshcoloured boy in a red coat pass he proved his words for he towered a good head above him and could have covered two of him in breadth nevill lloyd standing beside the arbuthnots carriage overheard the remark and frowned i should like to challenge those fellows he said vexedly i know we could pull em over and knock the conceit out of em then why dont you asked lesley smiling she and the aidedecamp had become fast friends chiefly over their mutual devotion to grace arbuthnot they wont let us they say it is likely to rouse illfeeling and all that and then he went on frankly of course it wouldnt do to get licked too often you know and one cant expect our boys to collar men who do dumbbells all day like those fellows do grace sitting beside lesley thought they might do worse but boys or men the sports were good and held half cantonments and not a few from the city interested in the various events while the sun sank slowly to the curiously limitless limit of the level horizon lateefa the kitemaker was there amongst others finding a sale for his airy nothingnesses betweenwhiles as he passed through the crowd with that quaint cry of use eyes and choose eyes use and choose jehan aziz was there also in his thirdbest brocade coat and with a halfcringing halfdefiant avoidance of mr lucanaster who redtied as usual was betting gloves with mrs chris davenant for that the lady in question told herself was quite the correct thing to do and as the ball which was to prove her admittance into the best society had not yet come off mrs chris as jack raymond had predicted was careful though in truth she found a strict adherence to etiquette somewhat slow with an easier code and a greater inclination to scorn it sobrai begum was finding the same thing in the halfempty bazaar where she had been left in charge of a toothless old hag who had once enjoyed the doubtful dignity of miss leezies position but who having grown too old for the post had remained on in the house as a domestic drudge of the most exemplary pattern the poor old soul however suffered from an all too intimate acquaintance with the gutters as they lay reeking in the chill dawns when those for whom she worked lay still curled up in their wadded quilts so when an hour or so had been spent after the approved fashion of her kind in cozening her charge out of illhumour the fever fiend seized on her and laid her by the heels in a backyard more than halfunconscious sobrai therefore relaxed from surveillance began to wonder sulkily how she had best utilise her freedom she had been long enough with miss leezie to make her remember lateefas caution to make her wonder if dilaram and the old ways were not best there was no reason nevertheless why they should be so she was a clever girl in her way with an ancestry of pride as well as wickedness and above all of a fierce faculty for obtaining personal gratification and there was none here all was rule and regulation no freedom no fun no frivolity in a way no choice but that she told herself was the result of miss leezies mean breeding dilaram enjoyed herself more and so would she sobrai begum of the kings house if she had the management of affairs miss leezie said it would not pay but what was money beside amusement and who was miss leezie to judge a low born who did not know who could not play the part a sudden determination to play it for an hour and see the result seized on the girl she had the necessary dress an old one of her mothers which she had brought with her in case the jewels were trumpery of course but they looked well there would be time for a little fun perhaps before her taskmistress returned and the bazaar filled it was a full hour after this determination of hers and the dusk had begun to fall when a young fellow in a red coat came lounging through the still empty bazaar he had just come out of a six weeks sojourn in hospital and so his pockets were full for a soldiers with unstopped ration money he had indeed intended to lavish some of it at the sports and so celebrate his return to freedom but being still given to invalid habits he had fallen asleep after barrack dinner only awaking to find his comrades and every available conveyance gone so feeling illused he had shirked the walk sulked for a while and finally having nothing else to do sought the perennial possibilities of the bazaar round the corner even that was dreary sweetmeat sellers fruit sellers liquor sellers had all followed their clients to the artillery paradeground the very balconies were empty so in a mood compounded of recklessness and bitter homesickness he kicked up some one in the shop below miss leezies apartments insisted on drink and sitting down on a chair placed for him over the gutter relapsed into a sort of halffierce halfsullen torpor it was not in truth very lively for a fairly well educated boy who had only himself to thank that he was notas his schoolfellows were for the most parta city clerk with a cycle but he had been restless and he had read soldiers three and the arabian nights he looked savagely round the glowing gloomfor the attractions of a musical ride by torchlight kept even the shopkeepers late and so the cavernous shadows of their squalid shops were still unlitand swore under his breath at india and all its ways and works no fun no musichalls no anything nothing worth being wicked about even he gulped down the vile mixture of flat soda and bad brandy turned his chair round to face the houses and cocking his feet up on the plinth before the stairs which led up to miss leezies balconies settled himself to wait till the bazaar became lively it would be more so than usual of course that evening since the men had to return to barracks through it it was only a question of waiting till some interest came into life one came very soon and quite unexpectedly this entrance to the balconies was partitioned off from the shops on either side and consisted of a tiny empty square hung with a withered garland or two above the door which blocked the stairs this was closed but it opened slowly after a time and a girl stepped out into the square that was little bigger than a sentrybox stepped out till the billowy curves of faded brocade about her feet almost touched those of no b company he sate up and stared this was something he had never seen before this was the arabian nights it was however only sobrai in the dress of a princess of the blood royal softly orange and yellow in her trailing skirts faintly purple and gold above with a starred green veil hiding all but the gleam of sham jewels the lustre of false pearls and a fingertip placed in warning where the lips should be he took the hint and stared silently his blood racing through his veins not from any suggestion of balconies and their like but from curiosity from excitement from in a way the admiration which is the antithesis of balconies for though he knew it not sobrais dress and address were those of the virtuous woman entertaining her lawful owner so with a salaam whose grace had been caught from noormahal the girl slipped to the ground among her brocades and no b company instinctively slipped his feet from the plinth also there was silence for a second or two then another hand stole out from the green and gold stars that were so shadowy yet so clear a hand clasping an hourglass drum by its narrow waist and twirling it gently so that the leaded silken tassels on its fringe did the duty of fingers and sent that strange unrest throbbing out into the air but the voice that followed it robbed the sound of its usual character and took the restlessness into a definite cause for sobrais song was not of the bazaars it was of the palaces a bards song of old days and dead kings of war and death and victory no b company sate with his hands clenching his knees and listened almost stupidly until suddenly a returning torch flung a great beam of glaring light into the shadows which almost hid the singer and revealed a pair of black eyes amid the stars he stood up then and caught his breath in hard this was ripping simply ripping he had not had to use the adjective for months and with it came back a world of recollectionof idle harmless larks of boyish mischief it almost seemed as if the figure understood for a gleam of pure mischief came to the black eyes as sobrai stood up also in truth she found it ripping also the only bit of fun she had had in a fortnights freedom and behind no b companys red coat some fresh spectators had gathered curious surprised a sudden daredevil delight seized on the girl her voice rose to its fullest pitch she began to dance not with the posturings and suggestions of the bazaar but with dignified gestures and scarcely perceptible swayings suited to her heavy robes and to the words she sang and all but her eyes were still covered by the green and the stars and now a rushlight or two caught hastily from the neighbouring shops came to show more distinctly that graceful figure and a voice or two in english called out to friends behind to come and see the bazaar was refilling but it was forgetting other things in hersobrai the thought the unmistakable admiration drove caution to the rightabout let miss leezie come and see if she chose see that the apprentice had been right that it was amusement people wanted for the present indeed it seemed so how long the novelty might have kept familiarity in check it is impossible to say for there was miss leezie horrified indignant forcing her way shrilly through a gathering of redcoats sufficient to ruin the good name of her house should it be seen by any of the authorities and heaven only knew whether some might not fancy that bazaar as a shortcut home you let er beshes worth ten o your lot remonstrated more than one voice but no b company had got further in admiration than that sobrai for the time had captured his imagination it was vice against virtue or at any rate dull sensuality against romance perhaps sobrai saw something of this in his eyes anyhow with a fierce exultation she threw back her veil and the hourglass drum twirled above her head sent its message out over the clustering crowd so it came to pass that lady arbuthnot driving home saw in the flesh what she had seen in her minds eyethe womans figure centring a circle of eager mens faces stand back clear the way hut hut came the orders of policemen recalled to a sense of duty then came a louder one as an inspector on his way back rode up to see what caused the block in an instant there was an uproar a boys voice dont you touch her you a scuffle a blow a fall a girls shriek finally there was a lull with two redcoats under the orders of a passing officer holding back a third miss leezie protesting innocence and a girl still defiant shrinking back into the darkest corner of the narrow entrance she doth not belong to me shrilled miss leezie she comes from the city i am not responsible i will prove her thief it is a lie i am no thief gasped sobrai shrinking still farther from the policeman who stepped up on to the plinth while the redcoat held by the other two struggled madly oh dash it all muttered the officer to himself this cant be allowed sergeant send your prisoner to the quarterguard under escort and see that every one returns to barracks at once constable arrest both women miss leezie fell on her knees and shrieked huzoor i can prove her thief she hath pearls like the ladysahibs pearls she offered them to me as a bribe to take her into my house this very day and i dissembling said i would see and kept the pearls to show the police i have them she is thief for sure touch me not i am no thief they are mine panted sobrai as the policeman dragged her forward then as the sense of indignity came to her she fought desperately i am no thiefi am no common woman touch me not i am sobrai of the nawabs house the pearls are his i am princess i say will none help me oh lateef lateef say it is true she had broken from her captor with sudden irresistible passion and thrown herself at the feet of some one who had newly pushed his way into the crowd so her hands clasping a pair of thin legs she looked in frantic appeal to the thin face of the kitemaker but lateefa knew his part of hangeron to nobility better than to admit anything derogatory to its honour he essayed to pass on with his quaint cry use eyes and choose use and choose it was perhaps an unfortunately wellknown one and many of those present seeing the girls brocades and remembering her gestures hesitated while one said he is lateefa of jehans house for sure she hath his name pat mayhap she says truth the sergeant of police pulled out another pair of handcuffs with evident joy there is room for both in the lockup he said cheerfully lateefa gave a jerk to the string he held which sent the single kite which he always reserved as his trademark skimming downwards in the gloom to rise again higher than ever mayhap i am lateef for sure as god made me and she is what the devil made hera woman there was something of lateefas philosophy in the policeofficers words when an hour or two later he called round at government house to say that four pearls apparently belonging to lady arbuthnots string had been found in the lal bazaar in a dancinggirls house the house where i saw that girl as i passed asked grace quickly she felt somehow that it must be so that there was a fate in it i expect so answered the policeofficer then he paused it is likely to be a troublesome case sir he continued turning to sir george for she claims to belong to the nawab s house and as if that wasnt enough it seems that one of the soldiers knocked a man down just knocked him down as one would anybody you know he seemed none the worse for half an hour when he suddenly went out spleen of course i wonder when tommy will remember that half the natives about him ought to be in glass cases sir george arbuthnot frowned too it is most unfortunate especially just now these women are really he paused and looked apologetically at his wife however we shall have no more of this sort of thing both regiments go out to moradki as soon as we can get the carriage together we settled that finally the desert will do them good chapter xi the spirit of kings and slaves jerry arbuthnot in his smart little ridingsuit was seated on the top step of john ellisons tomb his pony meanwhile held by a syce trying to snatch a bite of long grass growing close to the bottom one between the two forming a pyramid of which the childs dainty little figure made the apex were several other figures first of all bareheaded eminently respectable in a clean suit of drill was janalishan seated sideways a step below his face towards jerry below againcrouched up knees and elbowswas budlu the caretaker his eyes on janalishans and beside him resplendent in red coat and gold lace the mohammedan chuprassi told off to accompany his little master on his morning rides for the dew still lay heavy on the grass like hoarfrost so that the hoopoes hopping over it in the search for food left greener trails behind them to lattice the grey glisten then came the childs clear high voice you are quite the most youngest hero of the lotsir he hesitated over the title finally gave it palpably as a tribute to the heroism perhaps to the name janalishan brushed a faint speck of dust from his white drill that is so sir i was but a two month when i done the job an that dont leave much margin for honest competition it runs to a monopolly thats what it do sir a regular monopolly he tailed off into polly my polly she is so jolly the jolliest craft in the world which he carolled cheerfully making the hoopoes cock their crests and hold their heads on one side to listen jerry sate looking at them thoughtfully i was afwaid you must be cos you see its such ages ago he said at last argumentatively ages an ages i wasnt even near borned then how much oldern me dyou sppose you are sir it was janalishans turn to look at heavens messengerbirds thoughtfully and admire their golden crowns then he drew his white drill cuffs down over his tanned wrists as if to hide as much of himself as was possible older he echoed whysixanthirty year i should say sixanthirty year o constant wickednessthats about it siro constant wickedness please god he hovered over a penitential response in a minor key and then nodded at the child cheerfully but dont you fret sir there aint no call for it youre all rightyour timell come only you must grow a bit more or you wouldnt never fill a grave like thiswould e budlu he laid his hand on the tombstone and smiled so did budlu and the chuprassi uncomprehendingly so reluctantly did jerry its an orful time to wait he said regretfully an theres goin to be a row quite soon dad doesnt say so but he thinks it for i heard em talking of what theyd have to do if there was one but they hadnt settled when miss dwummond came for me what do you think would be the best thing mr ellison lick em sir for sure replied janalishan succinctly jerrys face flushed sharply almost with vexation oh of course wed lick em but i meant what kind of things just to show em you know thatthat he paused as he often did bewildered by his own thoughts show em echoed john ellison show em why show em that its as you was that there aint no change that its still flags flyin an gord save our gracious queen jerry rose solemnly and took off his cap as the notes of the national anthem floated out over the garden mound into the crisp morning air in which even the nearer shadows showed blue as the distant ones i thought that would be it myself he commented heaving a sigh of relief but im glad to be sure thanks so much the others duteously following his lead had risen also and now janalishan who had reached for the helmet which had been lying on the steps beside him stood looking into it with a halfprayerful expression before putting it on for time was passing and he was due at his work youre welcome sir kindly welcome he said after a pause so jest you wait patientsay sixanthirty year an then if you aint got an eros grave of your own as you can slip into when you fancies itwhy john ellisonthats me sirll up an give you is ananchanst the constant wickedness there sirhe spoke with conscious pride in the magnitude of his offer i cant say fairer nor that so theres my and on it for if ever there was a chip of the old block its you sirthe chippiest of the chippiest he reached out a big brown paw and jerry with great dignity laid his soft white one in it thanks orfully said the child but i wont bovver you ill get one of my vewy own please you bet remarked janalishan briefly thats the game to play same as im and me played forty years back sames you and some other chapll play forty years on times no hobject only a comfortable ome well good day to you sir an if ever you wants john ellison youll find me here mornins and evenins most days on my way to work for e and mes been pals a many years as he walked off jauntily his hands in his pockets he paraphrased john anderson my jo into ellison and put the expression stop full on at the last quatrain now we maun totter down john but hand in hand well come nd sleep together at the foot he paused here at the gate which ended the rising path and waved a hand back at the group in the hollow ere the snick of the latch started him again on the refrain john ellison my chum so he passed with a curious mixture of swing and slouch along the dusty roads towards the railway station which lay on the outskirts of the town about a quarter of a mile from the bridge like the latter it was a semifortified structure capable of some defence the more so because the city wall which it faced was in itself an obstacle to attack from that quarter since it was largely a retaining wall to the higher ground of the city within and therefore solid blank until at the river end it jutted into a bastion loopholed and embrasured but even this would be of little use to a foe for the brickwork was cracked from the parapet right down to the waters edge and the whole building sloped outwards as if even the firing of a cannon would send it toppling over into the river indeed the advisability of so sending it safely under control of science before chance interfered and sent it crashing into the railway bridge had more than once been urged on the authorities the bastion however happened to be part of a royal building which had been given for life to a very old pensioner so it had been decided that destruction should await his death unless matters became worse therefore jehan as head of the six hundred of his like in nushapore still found it the best place in the whole city whence to fly kites for there was generally a breeze off the river and daylight lingered long reflected from the glistening water so at all times of the day and occasionally by the help of a full moon the royal pensioners gathered strong on the bastion quite a little court of themreminiscent strangely of that dead dispossessed court of old dayscentred round jehan the heir of all things or nothing and they would pledge and pawn everything they possessed except their pride on the results of lateefas skill with paste and paper half a dozen or more of these courtiers without a court or a king were lounging on the bastion waiting for jehan to fly a match with another princeling of royal blood when janalishans trolly skimmed past on the line below it they craned their yellow faces to look at him and the little knot of coolies who were pushing all they knew at the trolly for chris davenant had bidden his overseer be at the drawbridge pier at eight oclock to look over the machinery and it was already five minutes past the hour so janalishan had first hustled his own subordinates with oaths and abuse into the utmost haste and was now preparing the halfconfidential halfapologetic look of an offender for his own facesince he could see his superior officers figure leaning over the iron lattice of the bridge waiting for him hurried as he was however he looked up waved his hand to the group on the bastion and called ramram gents and mohammedrussool a salutation compounded from hindoo and mohammedan formulae which he would explain elaborately prevented him from either inderin weak brothers or bowin in any particklar ouse o rimming for his seven years in a surplus chore had given him a curious knowledge of scripture we had better begin by seeing if the hydraulic tank is full up said chris calmly as the trolly stopped in prompt obedience to janalishans imperative woa i say woa didnt i tell yer to tyro stop at the pyli first pier ay ay sir he answered his face expressing a certain disappointment and as he obeyed orders by climbing up an iron ladder which the coolies brought from its hooks on the pier and fixed to a reservoir on the roof of the arched gateway he shook his head gravely it dont give a chap a fair chanst he muttered to himself as he mounted higher and higher it aint bracin enough thats what it aint now if ed a said dn you if youre late agin ill cut yer pay it ud ave given a fellow a straight tip up the narrer path here he paused to measure with a footrule and hummed the while a banner with a strange deviceexcelsior an it dont come ome to the eart if you says it yourself he added despondently not even if you uses fancy swears these had an excellent effect however on the coolies to whom they came simply as forcible imperatives so that in a very few minutes the iron girders on either side had reared themselves back on the central tower and the little party stood isolated both from the bridge and the bank it s as right as a trivet sir said john ellison barrin bein a bit stiff on the crank but a drop o hoilll set that easy for it aint a tenmen job as they made it but a twothats what it isa two at most but when the drop of oil had been applied two men failed to start the hydraulic pressure much to janalishans disgust he set one couple after another of his men to tackle the job without avail look ere sir he said at last persuasively id take it a kindness if youd jest lend me the sight o your and for a moment if i does it all myself theyll begin to talk that ikbally rot o theirs like as i was sandow himself but if they see your and in it too itll be uman beingsthats what itll be so chris davenants thin nervous brown hand gripped the spindle and janalishans great pawfresh as it was from the clasp of jerrys small onegripped the spindle also the two side by side feeling each others touch feeling for all we know that other touch of the child who would come to such mans work after long years why should it not make itself felt in more ways than one that strange force which bids the race continue which gives the spirit of kings or the spirit of slaves then with a slow gurgle the water filled the cylinder and the massive iron girders came down once more to bridge the gulf and make a permanent way between the east and the west banks of the wide river which slid past silently bringing no message from its birthplace taking no message to its grave in the sea best ave er up an down agin onst more sir said janalishan then therell be fair odds on a continooance of virtoo theres nothin like abit sir he heaved a regretful sigh and this time the water gurgled out of the cylinder behaves beautiful she do he commented when the drawbridge having risen and descended again he had set the coolies to work pumping a fresh supply of water into the cistern and had gone himself to lean over the iron latticing at a decently respectful distance from his superior officer who was doing the same thing the parting streamits perfect placidity lost by the obstruction of the wide pierswept under the girders in little petulant wrinkles and furrows but even through these sears and seams of current the jutting spit of rockwhich yielded firm foothold for this first span of the railway bridge yet with equal impartiality gave firm foundation closer inshore to the new temple of kali which challenged the old temple of viseshwarcould be seen clearly or dimly as its broken contours dipped or rose beneath the water quite the lydy she is went on janalishan continuing his approval of the drawbridge aint got no games in erolds out er arms if she likes you an draws in er arms if she dont thats the sort and then some link of thought started him on a song which shared first favourite honours with her golding air all anging down er back in the estimation of his singsong audiences and the notes of whereer you walk echoed out over the river and made the bathers on the temple steps who had been watching the proceedings look up once more towards the bridge whereer you walk cool gales shall fan the glade trees where you sit shall crowd into a shade whereer you tread the blushing flowers shall rise and all things flourish where you turn your eyes the most passionate yet the purest praise a woman ever won from man perfect in its selfforgetfulness in its delight in the admiration of the whole world for what is praised fell from john ellisons lips in almost perfect style for he had been taught the song in those early days of surpliced choirs and chris davenant as he listened staring out over the river clinched his hands on the iron rail in a sudden passion of selfpity this is what he had found in the poets of the west this was what he had sought in the prose of life it was for this he had forsaken so muchthis whiterobed woman with the breezes cooling the hot blood and the trees crowding to shade her from the fierce heat of noon and he had foundwhat something worseyesfor one brief second he admitted the truth that it was worse that naraini despite her ignorance would have given him something nearer to that ideal of all men who were worth calling men than viva with her cigarettes her pink ruffles her strange mixture of refinement and coarseness of absolute contempt for passion and constant appeal to it why had he ever forsaken his people why had he ever forsaken hernaraini i am brahmin my hand is pure the memory of her voice her face as she spoke the words returned to him and with an irresistible rush all that had swept him from his moorings swept him from the common current of the lives around him all the sentimentality all the intuitive bias towards things spiritual swept him back again to that lifeand to naraini its a rippin song aint it sir remarked janalishan who had been warbling away at the runs and trills like any blackbird as he watched chris davenants listening face wraps itself round a feller somehow kep me from a lot o tommy rot that song as in my time an sent me to the flowing bowl instead as he walked over to see if the tank was full he whistled let the toast pass heres to the lass ill warrant shell prove an excuse for a glass with jaunty unconcern he returned in a moment the coolies behind him carrying the iron ladder back to its hooks on the pier all right sir he reported give er two men an shell old her own against a thousand chris absorbed in his thoughts made an effort to wrench himself from them by assenting yes theyd find it difficult without guns unless they could manage it by the river janalishan shook his head not if wed a rifle or two aboard sir to nick em off in the boats couldnt they get along the spit suggested chris absolutely at random might be done mayhap admitted the other after a reflective pause leastways if you was a ram rammer an ad a right o way through the ouse o rimmingbeg pardin sir though you ave chucked old oneyman an is loti mean if you was a hindoo an theyd let you through the temple but even then we could nick em in the water afore they could get ropes slung theres the ladder suggested chris once more he was not thinking of what he said he was asking himself what he had not chucked away recklessly it is only about six feet up they could easily they could easily do a lot if they was let sir interrupted janalishan as he turned to go with a pitying look but we dont let em thats how it is an we aint such bally fools as to leave em ladders no sir two menif they was menud keep that pier a christian country for a tidy time as the trolly buzzed back stationwards the group of yellow faces above the faded brocades gave up watching the manoeuvres of the drawbridge and returned to their kiteflying and on the bathingsteps the men and women returned to the days work on the bastion there was a shade more listless doubt and dislike on the steps a shade more uneasy wonder as to the signs of the times that was all only burkut ali as he weighted his kites tail with an extra grain or two of rice nodded his head and said with a sinister look two could play that game and the first come would be master he who sits on the throne is king and he who sits not is none added jehans antagonist with a wink he had quarrelled two days before with the rightful heirs pretensions to authority in the matter of a dancinggirl and so for the time being headed the dissentient party which with evershifting numbers and combinations made the royal houseto the great satisfaction of the authoritiesone divided against itself if the sun of the universe is ready he went on with mock ceremony his slave waits to begin the match jehans face sharpened with anger he had come there in an evil temper because after having virtuously denied himself an overnight orgy for the sake of steadying his hand for the match lateefaon whom he had relied for a superexcellent new kitehad neither turned up nor sent an excuse consequently the chances of victory were small and now this illconditioned hound was palpably insolent the fact roused jehans pretensions and made him assert them i fly no kite today he said haughtily the match will be tomorrow his opponent smiled as my lord chooses he replied coolly his slave is ready to give revenge at any time revenge echoed jehan sharply wherefore revenge there is no defeat his highness forgets said the other with a pretence of humility scarcely hiding his malice the most learned being member of raceclubs must know that scratch is victory to the antagonist this days match therefore is mine is not that the rule meean he appealed to the most sporting member of the court but jehan without waiting for his verdict broke into fierce invective and had passed from the rules to the rulers when burkutwho had been listening with that sinister look of histouched him peremptorily on the arm and said have a care nawabsahib some one comes jehan turned quickly and saw behind him a sergeant of police he came with a summons for the nawabsahib jehan aziz to attend at once at the cantonment policestation still confused by his anger and scarcely master of himself jehan stood looking at the paper put in his hand and trying to disentangle from the smudge of the lithographed form the few written words which would give him a key to the rest the first he saw was sobrai begum the next lateefa they pulled his pride and his cunning together in quick selfdefence though a fierce longing to have the jades throat within the grip of his thin fingers surged up in him the desire to put her away privily was stronger he folded up the paper with a shrug of his shoulders and turned on the curious faces around him tis only lateefa in trouble with a woman he began and they need his masters virtue to get him out of it sneered his opponent tis too bad were i the nawab i would keep mine for my own use the rightful heir glared at the giber and a vast resentment at his own impotence came to the descendant of kings why was he not able as his fathers had been to sweep such vermin from his path why had he to obey the orders of every jackinoffice then for sobrai herself why could he not settle her in the good old fashion without any ones help as he drove over to cantonments in the ramshackle wagonette this desire overbore the others and his cunning centred round the possibility of getting the baggage back to the ruined old house where screams could be so easily stifled the first step of course was to see lateefa in private and hear his version of the story that meant ten rupees to the constable in charge of the lockup but it was better to pay that at first than hundreds of rupees of hushmoney afterwards if the police went against you so the silver key slipped into the sergeants pocket and the iron one came out which opened the barred door behind which lateefa sat like a wild beast in a cagesobrai meanwhile being accommodated with free lodgings under the charge of an old hag in a discreetly private cell round the corner jehans face grew more and more savage as he listened to what the kitemaker had to tell and that was a good deal for he had gossiped half the night with the sentry on duty miss leeziesobrai singing in the public bazaar to the soldiersall this was so much gall and wormwood to the nawabs pride it almost made him forget the theft of the pearls the more so because the idea of the latter was not quite new to him mr lucanasters assertion that there were five amissing joined to the fact that poor aunt khojee hoping thereby to smooth over the quarrel between him and noormahal had brought him one pearl which had been found in a rent in a cushion had made him suspicious that sobrai had the rest that this indeed had been at the bottom of her flight it was only therefore when lateefa pointed out that it would be necessary to prove that these pearls of sobrais were not the ladysahibs pearls before the girlfree from the suspicion of theftcould be handed over to her lawful guardians that he realised it would not be enough to say that they were his that he had given them to the girl whodespite her evil doingshe was willing to receive back again into his virtuous house for the possibility of denying her assertion that she belonged to it had he felt vanished with her unfortunate recognition of lateefa but now there must be proof and the proof lay in mr lucanasters hands jehan felt hemmed in harried on all sides and he was the poorer by fifty rupees before he bribed his way to an informal interview with the cantonment magistrate and was able to lay before that official a carefullyconcocted admixture of truth and falsehood which should help to secure what he chiefly needed secrecy and delay to this end by lateefas advice he made it appear that sobrai had been enticed away by miss leezie and pointed out that such a tale might give rise to troublecomplicated as it was by that fatal blow of no b companysif it became known especially in these restless times much therefore as he felt the injury the disgrace to himself and his house he was willing to hold his tongue about it provided other people held theirs as for the pearls if after private inquiries it was necessary for him to prove his words he would do so and in the meantime it would only cause suspicion if lateefa who was known to be a member of his household were detained the cantonment magistrate looked at him doubtfully he was almost too suave too sensible yet there could be no doubt that the case might be a troublesome one as the nawab said miss leezie might be fined for keeping her house disorderly sobrai detained pending inquiries and lateefa dismissed without in any way militating against the ordinary course of justice should the nawabs version prove false and if not he was in a way entitled to consideration especially if he would keep the abduction quiet in view of that possible murder case you had better come up again in two or three days said the magistrate finally by which time the police who will have instructions to conduct their inquiries in strict confidence will know if they require proofs and you could produce the remaining pearls of course if they do not the girl shall be handed over to you as her natural guardian and that will end the matter unless her evidence is required huzoor said jehan with profuse salaams that would end the matter to my complete satisfaction and eternal gratitude the look about his red betelstained lips as they wreathed themselves with obsequious smiles was that of a carnivorous animal which scents its prey and there was almost a triumph in his face as he drove back to the city with lateefa he felt himself powerful for once for he knew that if once he could get sobrai back he could torture and kill the girl behind the purdah which none would dare to invade in which he was still kingas much a king as any of his ancestors if he could get her there the only difficulty in the way of that jehan knew and faced instantly if proof were needed lucanaster would never give up the pearls never forbear saying that in his opinion they were the ladysahibs and none other unless he got the emerald in exchange well he jehan must have the emerald ready in case it was wanted then the thought that he might have so had it ready in his own possession but for little saadut made him call himself a fool for yielding to the childs tears they would have been over and forgotten in a minute for what could the child want with an emerald ring a useless bauble not even fit to be a toy chapter xii a mothers dirge but little saadut was of a different opinion he had found that question as to which of his fingers came nearest to filling the gold circle of the ring an absolutely entrancing one the more so because from some reason or another those fingers had suddenly taken to wasting away thus the two which fitted best one day might not be the two which fitted best on the next lo the ring hath bewitched him whimpered aunt khadjee when the child could scarcely be distracted from the puzzle to take the food which only auntie khojee could coax him to eat patient auntie khojee who would have sate all day and all night beside the string cot like that other womans figure if there had not been so many things which only she could do now that they had no servant at all so noormahal alone her face half hidden in her veil watched the child hungrily since from some reason or another as mysterious as the sudden wasting away which had come to the poor little body a fretful intolerance of clasping arms and caressing hands had come to the poor little mind the child cried when his mother held him and only lay content among the cushions of state which khojee brought out for daily use recklessly so that the little heirs restingplace should be as soft as a kings there was nothing indeed of such care and comfort as these women could compass that saadut lacked nothing in fact of any kind which even richer folk of their sort could have given him for they too would not have had the least elementary knowledge of what nursing could or could not do for such sickness as his before that mysterious slackening of grip on life these women the one who watched the one who worked the one who whimpered beside that cot set in the sunshine were absolutely helpless they knew nothing they could not even tell day by day if the child were worse or better if he slept a while or drank a spoonful of milk they praised god and once when they had propped him up with pillows and set a gay new cap jauntily on his damp hair they almost wept for joy to think he was better and when the consequent fatigue made it all too evident that they were mistaken they never recognised that the change for the worse was due to the sittingup it was after this that khadjee with floods of tears gave the only jewels she did not wear to be pawned in order that a hakeem might be called in and then she cried herself sick over the loss so that when the medicineman did come he had two patients instead of one he was a smiling old pantaloon who had been court physician and as such had attended saaduts greatgrandfather who talked toothlessly of the yunani system of medicine and of things hot and things cold of things strong and things weak to aunt khadjees great delight indeed she took up most of the time in detailing her own complaints so that in the end he reassured them hastily as to the child by saying that all he needed was a conserve a mere conserve but it proved to be a conserve of palaces containing thirtysix ingredients the cheapest of which was beaten silver leaf so what with it and auntie khadjees emulsion poor khojees housekeeping purse was empty after a few doses but she sate up o nights spinning and so gathered enough to call in another medicineman this one was of a different sort longbearded solemn with sonorous arabic blessings he had ordered paper pellets with the attributes of the almighty inscribed on them these at least were not expensive these at least were within the reach of povertyeven the abject helpless poverty of these highborn ladies so auntie khadjee forsaking her tinsel capmaking recalled the teachings of her youth and by the aid of the smokestained koran from which she chanted her portion like a parrot every morning traced the words on to tissue paper with difficultyshe suffered from rheumatic gout though she did not know it was anything but old ageand khojee rolled them into pills and covered them with silver leaf and sugar and put them in the sweeties which were the only thing the child cared for so he would swallow mercy and truth and charity and justice and strength as he lay in the sunshine on the cushions of state playing with the ring on which was scratched by the grace of god defender of the faith the courtyard was very quiet very empty as yet for the child was not yet near enough to death to be an attraction to the neighbours he had been ill so long and now was a little worse that was all those three women told themselves they had no means of realising that the disease longsluggish had roused itself to fierce energy that the days almost the hours were numbered so noormahal watched the childs least movement day and night and khadjee wrote the attributes of god for the paper pills while khojee worked her old fingers sore or tramped about openly to do the marketing but no matter how pressed for time she was no matter how far from home her old hands or feet hurried up so that they should be free for another task at sunset a task which so long as they had had a servant had never been omitted and must not be omitted nowmust never be omitted so long as these crumbling walls and the wide empty courtyard held the heir to a kingship and this task was the sounding of the naubut from the gateway where the stucco peacocks still spread their plaster tails in the old days this ceremony of sounding the royal kettledrums as a sign that majesty lived within had been quite an imposing one then a posse of liveried servants and soldiers had gone up into the naubat khana and whacked away at a whole row of slung kettledrums and blared away at the royal nakarahs until all the city knew that sunset had found the king still on his throne but for some years back it had been very different a halfhearted apologetic drubbing on one dilapidated drum a breathless blowing of an uncertain horn had been all and now when only one poor tired old woman limped up the broken stairs it was a very feeble claim to royalty indeed that echoed into the courtyard below though khojee drummed valiantly for all she could and blew her withered cheeks plump as a cherubs over the nakarah feeble as it was however it could be heard and it brought comfort even to noormahals hungry heart for it meant that the child was still on his throne at sunset and that was all the world to those lonely women shut up inconceivably helplessly from all hope almost from all desire for help from that outside world into which only aunt khojee ventured at times timorously and only to return poorer more helpless than she went out once however whenat the risk of a fit of hysterics which might incapacitate aunt khadjee from even the writing of paper pelletskhojee had persuaded her to allow the little knot of silver earrings without which no court lady could be considered decently clothed to pay a temporary visit to the pawnbroker khojee had come back from that outside world with a new look of hope on her face a piece of luck had befallen her she had met quite by chance an old servant of her mothers who when the court had been broken up had taken service as ayah with the mems and this old dame happened to have in her possession a priceless european medicine for just such delicate children as saadut a mem had given it to her she said when her child needed it no more she did not add that the child despite the brands essence of beef and the care of three doctors had wasted away into its grave quite as quickly as saadut was doing with neither and that the unopened tins had been part of her perquisites when the stricken parents had sought distraction from grief in three months leave she only said that they were worth rupees on rupees but that khojee might have them for three because it was for the little heir so the patient bent figure and the limp had come back to that cot set in the sunshine with the feeling that now at last the child who lay among the faded cushions of state must pick up strength since all the world knew that whatever faults the huzoors had they were clever doctorsall too clever perhaps but there could be no danger of poison here this was the actual medicine a mem had given her own child this must be the real thing still to make sure they continued the paper pellets since mercy and truth and justice and charity must counteract any nefarious intent even with this mixed diet of the east and west of essence of faith and essence of beef saadut gained nothing he continued to lose though the women refused to see it for the courtyard was still quiet perhaps once or twice a day some gadabout neighbour in passing would look in and for half an hour or so after she had left noormahals big brooding black eyes would be on the door of the womens courtyard with a fierce fear in them the fear lest she should see the shadow of another newcomer on the angled brick screen before the door the screen built on purpose to show such warning shadows in other words the fear that those strange eyes should have thought it worth while to send other eyes to look on a sight that would not be long seen either in sunshine or shadow but the stillness would remain unbroken and her gaze would go back to saadut ready for her to smile assent when he should smile up at her and say look ammajan because he had managed to jam the ring hard and fast over some combination of fingers the days and nights were cloudless the air kindly and warm and in the silence which comes with the darknesseven to a large town when there is no wheeled traffic in it and the footsteps of men have ceased from going up and down the citythe only sound which came to disturb the courtyard was the shriek of the railway whistlean almost incredible sound in that environment so the days and nights following on jehans vow never to set foot in the house again dragged by were it not best to tell his father suggested khojee the peacemaker one evening when she came down breathless from that futile beating of kettledrums and blowing of horns to find saadut without his usual smile for her efforts he is fond of his father and it might rouse him noormahal leant forward and gripped the cot with both hands no she said passionately may i not keep this myself he is no worse fool thou didst not sound the naubut well that is all i could scarce hear it myself that might well be aunt khojee thought humbly seeing that she was not used to the beating of drums and the blowing of horns and that both were cracked and dilapidated almost past beating and blowing still even she would not allow the child to be worse not even in the watches of the night when a bodys thoughts cannot always stay themselves on the will of god when railway whistles and other strange sounds set the mind questioning what will come and why it should come and this night just at the turn of twelve when the night of a past day turns into the night of a coming one a voice rose on the darkness as it sometimes did the voice of a telegraph peon seeking an unknown owner for a telegram o addum o addum khan dweller in the place of sojourners in the quarter of palaces awake arise o addum a message hath come for thee awake arise o sleepers awake and say where is addum khan for whom a message to go on a journey hath come so on and on insistently the man addumquaintly namesake of the man in whose name all men go on the great journeywas sought until the rattle of a doorchain being unhasped brought silence and the knowledge that addum had received his message from the darkness la illahail ullahobismillahurrahmanurraheem murmured khojee under her breath as she sate by the cot trimming the smoky little rushlight for the cry on addum had roused saadut from a halfdoze and brought opportunity for more paper pellets bismillahurrahmanurraheem he echoed in his cracked little voice quite cheerfully for these words the assertion that god is a merciful and a clement god are the mohammedan grace before meat as well as a prayer and the four years four months and four days at which age children are taught them as their initiation into the church were still close enough to saaduts sumtotal of life to give the repetition a pleasurable importance heart of my heart eye of my eye life of my life murmured old khojee again lo swallow it down my uttermost beloved and sleep she had the child to herself for the moment since noormahal at her earnest entreaty had hidden her face altogether in her veil and with her head on the foot of the bed had gone off into a brief slumber of exhaustion so the old arms and the old lips could show all the tenderness of the old heart which for nearly seventy years had beat true to every womanly sympathy within those four prisoning walls by the light of the rushlight saaduts big black eyes showed bright from the cushions of state so did the emerald in the ring why didst not sound the naubat today lazy one he said suddenly as if the omission had just struck him go sound it nowdost hear saadut wants it he had not spoken so clearly for days and khojees smile came swift nay sonling it was sounded she answered caressingly thou didst sleep perchance sleep again comfort of my heart it will come as ever at sunset but saadut wants it nowhe will have it he will be asleep at sunset sound it now sound it now i tell thee thou ugly one sound the kings naubat for saadut the old vehemence the old imperious whimper brought delight and dismay in a breath to the listener yea yea sweetest she began breathlessly as the old signs of tears showed themselveshave patience pretty old khojee will surely obeyno tears darlingshe will sound the naubat even now she glanced round in her consolations hurriedly noormahal still slept at the beds foot khadjees snoresshe had wept herself into the physical discomfort of a cold in the headrose regularly from an archway all else was silence every one slept even the city yes she would risk itrisk disturbing the neighboursrisk unknown penalties from the breach of unknown bylaws the child must be saved from tears so hastily she caught up the rushlight and leaving the courtyard to the moonlight stumbled fast as her limp would let her up the narrow stairs to the naubat khana the rats scuttled from it as she picked her way through the fallen kettledrums that had once swung from the roof brave in tassels and tinsels that were now cracked mouldering the parchment rent and gnawed one still hung dejectedly at the farther end and towards it she passed rapidly even on it however a rat driven to extremities in that hungry house had been attempting to dine its eyes showed like specks of light as it ran a little way up the tarnished tinsel rope on which the drum swung and awaited her oncoming now aunt khojee like many another woman east and west was desperately afraid of rats yet the naubat had to be sounded she shut her eyes to give her greater courage and put all her little strength into her blow it was too much for the rotten rope the kettledrum clashed to the ground with hollow reverberations worthy of the old days and the old womans frightened cry did duty as the nakarah but behind both sounds came a childs laugh an elfin uncanny laugh and as she pausedin her flight downwardsat the stairhead she saw in the moonlight below an elfin uncanny figure sitting bolt upright among the cushions of state clapping the little hands that held the glistening signet of royalty and chuckling to itself gleefully while noormahal roused yet still bewildered looked about her for the cause and aunt khadjee from the archway gave pitiful shrieks of alarm the naubat the kings naubat my naubat saaduts naubat the cracked hoarse little voice went on and on till it became breathless and after it ceased the sparkle of the ring still showed in the little applauding hands what istwhat didst do asked noormahal reproachfully thou hast made him in a sweat lo hearts delight let me wipe thy foreheadtis only amma janthy amma she added coaxingly but there was no need for that saadut lay cuddled up on his pillows smiling complaisant both hands clasped over his ring saaduts ring he whispered as if it were a great joke a splendid childish secret that was his to keep or tell and saaduts naubut his own he will keep them himself lo bibi faltered old khojee apologeticallyit will do him no harm see it was of himself he rose and now he would sleep he is better not worse bismillah urrahmanurraheem came drowsily from the childs lips finishing that newtaught grace asserting that newfound dignity so with that look of possession on his face he fell asleep again he was still sleeping when an hour or two after dawn the tailors wife from over the alley came in on her way bazaarwards to see how the child had fared through the night and ask what the noise might have been which had awakened her house had more of the old palace fallen khojee who was already spinning for dear life set the question by a great fear was in her old heart because of the evil portent of the falling drum but none because of the truth writ clear on that sleeping figure that it would never wake again so khadjee was still writing out the attributes of god and noormahal scraping out another dose of the wonderful western medicine from the bottom of a tin of brands essence against the wakening that would never come he is more like his grandfather than his father remarked the tailors wife as she looked at the child if he had been king he would have been better than jehan she made the assertion calmly and though aunt khojee looked up doubtful of its ambiguity no one denied or contradicted it so the tailors wife passed out of these four walls leaving them empty of all things strange for the very shadows they threw were familiar all her life long noormahals big black eyes had watched the purple one of the eastern wall lessen and lessen before the rising of the sun and the purple one of the western wall grow behind the setting of the sun only on the angled screen at the door the shadows were sometimes new these shadows of some one coming from outside there was one on it now clear unmistakable no not one there were two the shadows of two strange women muffled in their veils coming in as if they had the right to enter a quick terror flew to noormahals eyes at the sight the tailors wife had not been long in spreading her news in an instant noormahal was on her feet fighting the air wildly with her hands it is not true she cried passionately it is not true and then the mockery of her own denial the certainty that it was so came to her even without a look at the child and her voice rose piercingly in the mothers dirge o child who taught thee to deceive o child who taught thee thus to leave old khojee was at her side in a second beating down her hands not yet not yet noormahal oh wait a while it cannot be yet he sleepshe is not dead true he slept still cuddled into the cushions of state but the look of possession had gone from the childish face though the signet of royalty had found its proper place for it hung loose on the forefinger of his right hand some one must call his father whimpered khadeeja khanum even amid the tempest of grief she was mindful as ever of etiquette he must be here to receive the last breath so it came to pass that when jehan returned with lateefa from cantonments to the evilsmelling courtyard in which his bachelor quarters jostled dilarams balcony he found the call awaiting him it had come two hours before the messenger said so it might be too late but it was not jehan entering found the courtyard half full of women the sun was pouring down into it showing the stolid yet watchful faces of the circle of thoseunveiled by reason of their lower rankwho were gathered round the bed set in the centre khojee and khadjeethe former with the tears chasing each other down her cheeks forlornly as she shaded the child with the royal fan and said ameen to the old mullah who was chanting the death chapter of the koran the latter with unreserved sobbingscrouched at the head but noormahal neither sobbed nor said ameen half on the ground half on the low bed she lay still her face hidden about the childs feet she did not stir even when jehans voice rose in unrestrainedand for the time being sincerelamentation in piteous upbraidings of all and everything why had he not been told why had he not been sent for sooner lateefa who had entered with him gave a quick look of absolute dislike and contempt at his principal best thank god they sent for thee at all he muttered as he passed to the head of the cot he had gibed and laughed at the tragedy till then treating itas he treated his kitesas a mere nothingness but thisabove all old khojees forlorn facestruck home best thank god they let thee be in time to claim thy son he muttered again adding as he bent his keen face closer to the childs and thou art but just in time but just in time even as he spoke one of the stolid watching women nodded and looked at her neighbour interrogatively the neighbour looked at the face on the cushions and nodded also so as if by common consent the first faint whimper which heralds the true wailing began khojee paused in an ameen with a gasp khadjee let her sobs grow into a cry but noormahal neither stirred nor uttered sound only as she lay over the childs feet a little shiver ran through her limbs as if she too were passing from the cold world an hour afterwards she was still lying so face downwards unrewarding though they had moved her to the bed where khadeeja khanum had spent so many hours in making tinsel caps one of them which she had made for saaduts four years four months and four days reception into the church of the clement and merciful was on the childs head now for the tenders of the dead had prepared him for his burial khojee had brought out the few treasures of faded brocade the ruined palace still held to fold about him softly and with a sob which seemed to rend her heart had bidden the signet of royalty be left on the little heirs forefinger against the time when his mother should rouse herself to take her last look at him the wailers had departed to return later on khadjee had succumbed to sorrow and sought seclusion even jehan had gone the last to go save lateefa who lingered halfindifferent halfcompassionate impatient of poor khojees tears over a loss that had been inevitable for months yet not liking to leave them to be shed in absolute solitude thou art kind lateef she said at last tis womans work not mans yet without thee brother her soft old eyes met his and the tears in them seemed to find their way into his heart and melt it thou art welcome sister he said gravely i think all is as it should be nowi see naught amiss his eyes as he stood at the foot of the bed whereon the dead child lay travelled approvingly upwards and khojees followed suit but hers went no further than the little waxen hands resting so straightly so demurely on the brocade for the lack of something on them made her start forward incredulously search in wild haste in the folds beneath the still fingers and then fall with a cry at lateefas feet clasping them kissing them give it backit was there but now if thou hast itif he bade thee take itgave it back he stood looking down at her with a curious expression of shame on his face it he echoed what is it thou knowest she pled piteously the ringshe will die if it is not there she cannot lose both she cannot lose all give it back for these first daysgive it for comfort if for naught else or she will die o lateef do this for old khojeeugly khojee lo i have asked naught of men nor husband nor child for i had naught to give yet i ask thishave pitybrother he stooped to unclasp her hands with an almost tender look thy like has more to give mine than thou dost think sister he said god knows even lateef he broke off with a halfimpatient gesture but this is past hoping for if jehan wishes he paused again and shook his head tell her thou hast put it by for safetyshe

replied gaily since they be all lateef has for childrenall of his own fashioning to leave behind him when he dies so with a nod towards the dead child he passed out of the courtyard where the shadows were lengthening for sunset but there would be no naubat to sound that evening so khojee crouched down between the two beds where the mother and the child lay both silent both unheeding and covering her face with her veil thought how best to tell the lie when noormahal should rouse to ask the question chapter xiii a valse a deux temps what am i why a mutiny lady of course dont you see my crinoline i suppose i am the first to arrive but there are a lot of us coming in the dress we are going to have a sixteen mutiny lancers perhaps two and all sorts of fun rather a jolly idea isnt it the speaker was mrs chris davenant as she stood buttoning her white gloves in the anteroom of the club which was all decorated and illuminated for the service ball she was daintiness itself in a widespread pink tarlatane frilled to the very waist a wreath of fullblown pink roses headed the fall of white lace that lay low down on the white sloping shoulders which seemed as if at the least movement they would slip up from their nest of flowers to meet the fair shining hair that slipped downwards in a loose coil from the wreath of pink roses round her head the steward who had been told off to record the costumes and see that no one evaded the rule of fancy dress without permission raised his eyebrows slightly as he bowed and admirably carried out in your case he replied politely ere turning to chris who stood beside the pink tarlatane in the garments of civilisation which had been rescued from sri hunuman he was looking for him moody illhumoured and you i suppose have permission began the steward when mrs chris with a hasty lookhalf of appealat her husband interrupted gaily oh he is mutiny too the fashion in dressclothes has not changed excuse me said chris in a loud voice i come as an english gentleman of the nineteenth century it is fancy dress for me sir are you ready viva the white shoulders did slip from the lace and the roses with the halfpetulant halftolerant shrug they gave and which expressed as plain as words could have done the owners mental position if chris chose to take that line and make a fool of himself it did not concern her she meant to enjoy herself execrable taste remarked the steward at the other door whose business was with the ball programmes which asked his neighbour pointedly oh both but the mutiny idea is the worst who the deuce started it lucanasters lot i believe we couldnt exactly stop it if they chose well i hope to goodness filthy lucre wont come as john ellison or i shall feel it my duty to knock him down oh we barred that sort of thing of course and it is really rather a jolly dressthe speaker gave a glance after the pink tarlataneat least she looks ripping in it she certainly looked her best and had caught the sweetly feminine suggestion of the style better than any other of the score or so of women belonging to the smart set who by degrees came to make up the mutiny lancers a fact which the men belonging to it were not slow to recognise so that a group of stiffstocked uniforms soon gathered round her while mr lucanasterwho looked his best also in the gorgeous array which hodson of hodsons horse in the middle of all the strain and stress of the mutiny evolved from his inner consciousness for his ringtailed roarerscould not take his eyes off her gleaming pink and white he even risked the resentment of more important ladies by rearranging the whole set so as to secure her being next to him in it but that gleam of pink and white was responsible for more than the setting of mr lucanasters blood on fire it made chris for the first time fiercely jealous ever since he had allowed himself for that minute on the bridge to compare his wife with his ideal and his ideal with the little cousin whose familiar beauty had so disturbed him he had been far more exigeant as a husband than he had ever been before and now as he watched his wifes success it was with clouded eyes that followed her wherever she went even when just before supperthe night being marvellously warm for the time of yearsome ones suggestion that it would be infinitely jollier to have the mutiny lancers outside in the gardens sent the whole party of dancing feet trooping out amid laughter and chatter to the lawns and flowerbeds which forty years ago had lain bare and bloodstained under the weary feet of those defenders of the flag the verdict of execrable taste given by the steward had been endorsed by many by none more fully than by the government house party which had come over late but even lesley felt bound to admit that taste or no taste there was a certain uncanniness in the look of these men and women who might indeed be ghosts from that gay nushapore life of forty years back so many a one might have been dressed so they might have danced and flirted and chattered on the very night when john ellison ended that gay life and called them to death with a brief order to close in on the garden mound and defend the flag that floated from its central tower and grace more imaginative more fanciful than lesley found her thoughts wandering more than once in a wonder whether some call to show themselves worthy of that past might not come again come there in the midst of the lights and the laughter there is always an atmosphere of unreality in a fancy dress ball when the masqueraders mean to enjoy themselves but it was more marked that night than grace arbuthnot had ever seen it there was a fascination in itin the uncertainty of it but there was one small soul for whom the sight had fascination not from its unreality but its reality this was jerry who in consequence of a special invitation from the ball committee of which jack raymond was secretary that the little lad might be allowed to see the show till suppertime had been brought over for an hour or two he isnt weally hodson of hodsons horse is he mum he said squeezing his mothers hand tight as in his little eton suit his wide white collar seeming to stare like his wide grey eyes he watched the couples passing out into the garden cos he was bigger its only pwetence weally isnt it of course it is pretence jerry she answered almost carelessly then something in the childs expression made her stoop to smooth his hair and look in his freckled face with a smile you would like to go and see them in the garden wouldnt you well wait a bit and lesley when she comes back from her dance shall take you and then you must be off to bed it is getting late let me take him lady arbuthnot said jack raymonds voice i am engaged to miss drummond for these lancers and i am sure she would prefer not to dance them with me even if she hasnt forgotten the fact he had come up behind her from the supperroom where he had been busy and grace who had not seen him before that evening felt a sudden pang at the sight of him for he was dressed in the political uniform which except on such frivolous occasions as these had not seen the light for ten years she told herself that he looked well in it as he had always done and then the reminiscence annoyed her for she had been taking herself to task somewhat for the persistency of such recollections thanks so much she replied i can see her coming back now so you can combine the two that will do nicely it would in fact fit in very nicely with her plans for in consequence of that taking to task she had been making plans as women of her sort do when they feel an interest in a man which they cannot classify and grace arbuthnot could not classify hers for jack raymond though she went so far as to acknowledge that she could not even now treat him as she treated all other men with the exception of her husband he made her feel moody and restless this was intolerable even though the cause was clearly nothing more than a regret at his wasted life it could indeed be nothing else had she not at the very beginning sought him out solely in the hope of rousing him to better things he had repulsed her by saying that hers was not the hand to win his back to the plough and she had resented this at firsthad refused to believe that the past could interfere with the present but she had been reasoning the matter out with herself during the last few days there had been many links and also many lacunae in the chain of that reasoning yet she had been quite satisfied with the result of it namelya conviction that lesley drummond would be the very person to compass regeneration for women like grace arbuthnot are never more inconsequent than they are in regard to love with a big l since in one breath they call it heavensent and the next set springes to catch it as if it were a woodcock or a hedgesparrow having arrived at this conviction with a curious mixture of shrewdness and sentiment grace had gone on to be practical she herself was debarred by her position from any more becoming dress than the latest paris fashion but that was no reason why lesley should not have the advantage of clever wits and clever fingers for the girl herself was of that large modern type which without in the least despising dress being in fact curiously sensitive to its charm are personally quite helpless concerning it the result of this being that as lesley approached jack raymond stared at the transformation took in its details and finally gave in to the perfection of the dress by saying with a laugh god prosper thee my lady greensleeves my lady greensleeves echoed lesley yes of course it is how stupid of me lady arbuthnot not to have guessed before oh im sorry i promised not to tell who made my dress didnt i the cat was out of the bag and grace flushed up with vexation she had not thought any one would recognise the source whence she had taken lesleys smock o silk and gown of grassy green her pearl and gold girdle and gay gilt knives the crimson stockings all o silk and pumps as white as was the milk she had not even told the girl herself partly from the love of such fanciful little mysteries which is inherent in such as she partly because she feared to injure the unconscious indifference which made lesley look the character to perfection greensleeves was my heart of gold and yet she would not love me and now jack raymond of all people had found her out found her out altogether she could see that in his eyes hear it in his voice as he said whoever made it it is charming this is our dance miss drummond i believe but lady arbuthnot wants us to desecrate the past i mean he went on after a slight pause that we are to take jerry to see some dreadful people dance the lancers there are some pasts which do not admit of desecration put in lady arbuthnot sharply and that is one of them neither to be desecrated nor forgotten he added come along jerry as they passed out into the garden lesley remained silent she was conscious once again of not understanding the whole drift of the words which had just been spoken and this time her temper rose with the certainty that she was mixed up in them so after a bit she frowned and said point blank tell me please why lady arbuthnot chose this dress for me i am certain you know dont you for a moment he was staggered then he laughed why he echoed have you forgotten so soon that greensleeves are your racing colours bonnie lesleys colours im not so ungrateful as that miss drummond but then the money i won on her is next my heart at the present moment fact i assure you for i always carry my bettingbook in my breastpocket so as to be handy she told herself he was incorrigible had in fact almost gone on to the faint blamewhich in a womans mind covers all possible breaches of the ten commandmentsof thinking he was not at all a nice man when jerry as he had already done more than once prevented quarrel by such a tight grip on both the hands he held that alienation seemed impossible to them oh dear he sighed his wide eyes on the couples that were waiting in front of the residency for the native infantry band which had been hastily summoned for the alfresco dance to strike up i do wish there wasnt any nasty old past to come and make it all makebelieve when it might be real cos it is a deader you know and were alive jack raymond looked over to the greensleeves and laughed sound philosophy jerry he said if it was real what would you do jerry looked round thoughtfully beyond the lawns the cemetery gate showed dimly with budlus white figure crouched beside it kill budlu or take him prisoner i spect he replied gravely cos the band you know might be loyal at that moment it crashed into the opening bars of the lancers with all the go and rhythm which the natives put into dance music youre top came one voice no you are answered a second oh do begin some one protested another so with a laugh a scramble a confusion a dozen or more of dancing feet trod the grass which had grown out of blood stains but the confusion ended in order so that the pink tarlatane was in its place to be twirled by hodsons horse and join the clapping of hands which ended the figure there was something weird in the sight out there with the flowerbeds set with coloured lights the chinese lanterns swinging in the trees and the shadowy pile of the residency lyingmore felt than seenwith its solitary tower and drooping flag inside outside outside inside came the reckless gay voices after a time in the far distance a fire balloon from some wedding in the city sailed up into the sky above the trails of smoke rising from the torches which outlined the boundary of the garden mound budlus figure watching the graves of heroes showed closer in then the band busy with cornets and oboes and the masquerading figures with that gleam of pink and white among them watched by chris as he stood half hidden in the shadow of the ruins outside inside inside outside so with another crash of the band the endless circle of men and women caught at each others hands as if in that touch lay all things necessary to salvation inside and outside echoed jack raymond grimly yes brian olynns breeches were comparatively sane but we are all more or less mad tonight my lady greensleeves upon my soul jerry you as the british boy are the only one in the place fit to carry on the british rule so come along and have some supper young man before you go to bed the champagne is athats my department miss drummond its all im fit for but jerry who had let go their hands to step nearer the residency as if he saw something stopped suddenly and pointed mr waymond he said in a loud voice whos that whos who him the child stood pointing into the shadows his eyes wide his whole face expectant jack raymond caught him up by the arms with a laugh and swung him up to his shoulder dont be creepy old mantheres no one there he said as he turned back to the club but jerry was insistent he had seen some one he protested and brought in a long tale of what budlu knew and every one knew including his syce and his chuprassi to prove that he had why budlu himself had seen the ghost several days and it meant something just orful bad for there didnt use to be no ghosts in the mound except janalishan i wouldnt let him talk so much to budlu and that lot if i were you said jack raymond aside to lesley he takes it too hard dear little chap i cant prevent it retorted lesley rather resentfully you see he has to go out and come in through the mound and then he is such a favourite the natives simply worship him i cant think why jack raymond glanced at the sturdy little figure which was now tackling roast turkey and ham in blissful forgetfulness of ghosts i expect they know he replied briefly and they are not often wrong the thakoor of dhurmkote at any rate had no doubts for an hour after jerryunder responsible escorthad been sent home across the garden to bed jack raymond having strolled beyond the line of lights and light feet to enjoy a quiet cigar found the two of them with an admiring tailcomposed of the responsible escort and the old noblemans retinuegoing the round of the batteries while jerry explained them solemnly to the old warrior in english and we beat em here too sir boys like me beat all their biggest men right here wah wah chorussed the tail approvingly while the stern old face melted into smiles with a suchch mera beta suchch truth my son truth hullo you young scamp said jack raymond coming up not gone to bed yetbe off with you at once but the thakoor laid a hand on the arm of authority not in petition rather in blame lo friend of mine he said chidingly why is there no son of thine to match this son of heroes what hast thou been doing all these years the eastern reproof of the old for those who leave their duty to the race undone fell on jack raymonds western ears and held them unexpectedly why had he no son in whom to live again the answer could not be avoidedbecause the woman he loved had jilted him and he had not chosen not chosen what to do his duty he smiled lo friend of mine he answered lightly such things are chance my son might have been a coward but as after having seen jerry marched off in the direction of bed and bidden goodbye to the thakoorwho was far more sleepy than the childhe strolled on with his cigar he knew quite well that the excuse was a false one the thought of inheritance either of heroism or cowardice did not enter into the question with englishmen and englishwomen as a rule marriage was a purely personal matter there in fact lay the fundamental difference between the east and west that was what made it impossible for the two races the sound of voices in anger made him pause he had come back to the verge of lights to the limit of the dancing feet and before him rose the ruins of what in the old days had been the hospital the roof had fallen in but the marble flooring raised above the levels outside by a halfsunk foundation of cellars was still in almost perfect repair and here after supperthe alfresco lancers having proved so great a successthe mutiny group had chosen to improvise a ballroom such things are easily compassed in india where an army of sweepers and servants appear in a moment once swept it needed little garnishing for the great wreaths of coral bignonia garlanded it from end to end and even flung themselves across it here and there like rafters as for lights a few chinese lanterns torn from the trees and swung among the flowers were sufficient for dancing and who wanted more not these masqueraders with whom as the hours grew towards dawn the fun had become fast and furious the clubhouse indeed was now almost deserted except by the line of carriages and even this was lessening every minute supper itself appeared to have migrated to the open during jack raymonds stroll for to his intense disgust he saw a tablewith champagne bottles showing prominentbehind the flitting forms of the dancers flitting unsteadily unevenly for they were trying the old valse and a womans voice rose above the laughter oh do try and remember it is a valse a deux tempsyou cant help treading on peoples toes if you dont jack raymond had flung away his cigar at the sight of the table and was going forward to object forgetful of those angry voices when they rose again close beside him i insist on your coming home vivamr lucanaster sir let my wife go damn said jack raymond under his breath ha grasped the situation in a second and saw its hopelessness go way sirgo way came in mr lucanasters voice dont be foolish there was a faint elation as well as elision in the words no more but it seemed to make them sound more contemptuous yes dont be foolish chris im going to dance this valse with mr lucanaster you can go home if you like the womans voice had the note of defiance in it which means danger but chris did not recognise the fact he had been working himself up to this revolt all the evening and now having begun it he went on in strict accordance to what he had settled with himself was the proper and dignified course to pursue sir he said drawing himself up and speaking with great deliberation you are a scoundrel and i shall take the earliest opportunity of allowing you to prove the contrary if you choose in the meantime pray do not let us quarrel before ladies i request you to unhand my wife it was not only a man who laughed it was a woman and at the sound jack raymond swore under his breath again and slipped towards the voices the gleam of pink and white and the ringtailed roarer must evidently have been sitting out in a small summerhouse where chris had found them and mr lucanaster must have risen and tried to pass out with the pink tarlatane for chris stood barring the way boldly enough but that laugh was fatal to him it brought back in a rush the sense of his own helplessness his inexperience and with it came the selfpity which is ever so close to tears viva he began surely you mr lucanaster waved his hand lightly as he might have waved a beggar away dont be an idiot my good man what the deuce have you got to do with an english ladycome jennie this twotime valse is ripping excuse me said jack raymond stepping forward but mrs davenant is engaged to me if you dont think so lucanaster we can settle the point by and by but for the present i advise you not to have a row it wont pay the assertion varied not at all from that made by poor chris but the method was different and mr lucanaster fell back on bluster youre dd impertinent sir but of course if mrs davenant it will not pay mrs davenant to waste time either interrupted jack coolly holding out his arm especially as she is so fond of dancing it has been a capital ball hasnt it he added as if nothing unusual had occurred when with a halfapologetic look at her partner she accepted the proffered arm and they passed on a pity it is over butperhapsyou may have others like it davenant if you will find the dogcart i will take your wife to get her cloak and i daresay she would like a cup of soup before driving i know it is ready when they were alone she tried a little bluster too but he met it with a smile my dear lady he said it only wants a very little to kick lucanaster out of the club so please look at the business unselfishly it is always a pity to risk ones position for a trifle as he handed mrs chris into the dogcart duly fortified by hot soup chris tried to wring his hand and say something grateful with the result that jack raymond felt he had been a fool to interfere since the catastrophe must come sooner or later the sooner the better it was always a mistake to prolong the agony in anything he felt unusually low in his mind and so after having waited to the very last as in duty bound to turn any wouldbe revellers decently out of the club he lit another cigarhis first one having been interruptedand wandered out into the garden mound again most of the lights were out only a belated lantern or two swung fitfully among the trees but a crescent moon was showing and there was just that faint hint of light in the sky which tells of dawn to come he sat down on the step of the granite obelisk which held on all four sides the closeranged names of those who had given their lives to keep the english flag flying and full of cynical disgust at much he had seen that evening asked himself if nushapore was likely to bring such heroism again to the storehouse of the worlds good deeds perhaps but even so it would have to be something very different from that past storysomething that englishmen and women could not monopolise for if after forty years of government our rule had failed to win over the allegiance of menlike chris davenant for instancewould not that in itself be a condemnation and had it won such allegiance with that scene fresh in his memory jack raymond doubted if it were possible truly the conditions had changed indeed as he had said brian olynns breeches were not in it for topsyturveydom but with the thought came also the memory of what he had said about jerry and the carrying on of british rule and with that came the memory of what the thakoor had said about the boy dear little chap a great tenderness swept through him for the child and for the childs mother the woman who had refused the question was not answered he started upincredulousthen set off running calling as he ran jerry jerry what on earth are you up to jerry jerry for in the dimness that was not quite darkness he had seen a little figure running like a hare between the bushes a little figure in an eton suit with a gleam of white collar jerry jerry you little fool pull up will you there was no answer and he had lost sight of the boy but as he ran on the sound of other footsteps behind him made him look round and pause for it was my lady greensleeves running too he could see the crimson stockings all o silk and pumps white as is the milk as they sped over the grass jerry she gasped where is he what is it on ahead somewhere god knows i told you we were all mad he answered as he ran on the flowering bushes growing thick upon the lawns near the cemetery hid his quarry but suddenly on the double back towards the residency the childs figure showed still running like a hare in the light of a chinese lantern that flared up as candle met paper his face looked dogged whoo hoop gone away stick to im sir stick to im for well all go aunting today well all go aunting today trolled a new voice and two more pairs of running feet joined the chase as janalishan and budlu appeared from the cemetery what in the devils name is it all about ellison called jack raymond are we all mad what is it the ghost sir called back janalishan thets wot it is me and budlu was watchin for im for e s bin takin away my charakter sir an stealin from the poor an needy but master jeremiah must a seen im fust thets ow tis he was wide awake in his bed when i came in panted my lady greensleeves talking about wicked men pretending and i told him to go to sleephe must have got up and dressed jerry jerry stop come back do you hear she might as well have called to the dead the childs figure showed on another double and before himyes before him just rounding another bush was a ghostly figure in a white uniform by jove exclaimed jack raymond ignoring his faint feeling of creepiness there is some one this is getting exciting come on dont let him slip through whoo hoop gone away tantivy tantivy tantivy sang janalishan so round the residency and back towards the hospital where the valse a deux temps had been danced lesley her green sleeves flying like flags ran blindly to pull up in a heap among the little group of balked faces stopped by the wall of the halfsunk cellars below the marble dancing floor a wall all garlanded down to the ground with bougainvillea and bignonia hes here the ghosts here wailed jerry i sor him from the window when i was watchin lest he should pull down the flag oh mr waymond please catch him jack raymond who was feeling below the trailingflowers gave a short exclamation theres a door here have you a match about you ellison lord love you replied the loafer reproachfully i aint such a fool sir as to go ghostunting without a lucifer here you are sir the next instant beneath the creepers that parted like a curtain an open door showed in the match light and in the darkness within was somethingwhat what a horrid smell said lesley as jack raymond took a step inside and held up the match begging your parding miss put in janalishan its a dead rat thats wot it isonce known loved for ever oh my darling horrid echoed jack raymond in rather an odd tone of voice stand back and let me close the door theres no use in any one running the gauntlet of it he had acted on the words before any one could raise an objection and they could only hear his voice inarticulately from within hes got the ghost cried jerry triumphantly i knewd he was here i seed him all along seems a peaceable sort anyhow remarked janalishan as something like a faint whimper filtered through the closed door it was lighter now the sky had paled the shadows were turning grey that was perhaps why jack raymonds face showed so pale and grey and stern above his political uniform as he came out closed the door behind him and flinging down the lighted match he carried trod it under foot it s only a poor devil of a stowaway he said calmly been living here i expect some days ellison or budlu youd better go and call the police stay ill give you a note and miss drummond it is high time that young ghosthunter was out of the dewand you also lesley looked at him with a new swiftness and light in her eyes dew she echoed there is no dew im not a bit wetfeel that she walked deliberately up to where he stood his back still against the door and catching her long green sleeve in her hand held it out ill take your word for it he answered lightly she did not move but her eyes sought his cest la peste monsieur she said in a low voice he looked at her for a second cest la peste mademoiselle he replied with a bow chapter xiv in the toils on the evening after the ball chris davenant sat in the pretty little drawingroom of which his wife was so proud looking helplessly at lala ram nath who had come in on business yet the helplessness was not due chris felt to anything in ram nath it was due to himself to his own actions the feeling comes to most of us at times for the story of the mancreated monster which turns and rends its creator is as old as the world it began with the serpent in paradise and will only end when humanity by ceasing to desire that which it has not ceases to put itself in the power of its own imaginings ram nath however had not reached this stage of development and was still supremely satisfied with his creature surely it is out of the question he was saying in the fluent english which came from constant speechifying that in the present crisis when the eyes of all india are fixed on what we nushaporites will tolerate in the event of this plague epidemic supervening and alas bringing in its train interferences with the liberty of the subjects beyond bearing even to the longsuffering races of india that you should stand aloof from us the recognised defenders of that liberty chris leant his head on his hand wearily in truth he felt aloof from everything in gods round world save that old man of the sea whom he had invited under the name of civilisation to sit on his shoulders what have you decided on doing he asked indifferently doing echoed ram nath a trifle uneasily so far as we ourselveswe that is who form the public opinion of indiaare concerned no definite action seems at present necessary beyond of course the presenting of an unbroken front of opposition to the enemy at the same time there is much to be done on the sly i meanhe interrupted himself hastily at the false idiomunostentatiously in order to gain the mass of the people to our side yes assented chris you and i can afford to admit the truth cant wethat we are not much nearer to the hearts of the people than the english whom we ape he spoke with a concentrated personal bitterness which brought greater hope and confidence into ram naths persuasions undoubtedly therefore our duty is palpable we must seek every sympathy with them that we can legally find for instance their admirable desire for religious freedom their touching devotion to the sanctity of home their vehement defence of the modesty of their women all these are in the abstract put in chris keenly let us deal with the concrete please it is safer he was roused now by pure love of argument his intellect to which he had sacrificed so much had once more asserted itself the battle of mere words had made him forget his heartache they settled down to it with zest as if it had been a debate and when chris by sheer force of argument had made his opponent admit thatsetting generalities asidethe expressing of sympathy in some details though expedient could not be held lawful they arrivedso far as any conclusion wentat a regular impasse since even for ram nath it was far easier to do what was logically indefensible than to assert that it was defensible so after this incursion into the realms of pure reason he had to descend from them with a certain petulance but it is idle to wander beyond the pale of practical politics he said even english statesmen consult the wishes of their constituents and so must we there is this flaw in the analogy interrupted chris eagerly with an evident pleasure in the making of a point that whereas an english constituency chooses its representative we are selfelected true true admitted ram nath a trifle loftily though as mill points out in his admirable treatise analogy does not consist in the identity of one thing with another still to avoid further discussion the question remains whether you will join our organisation he drew a paper from his pocket and laid it on the table it began we the undersigned do solemnly pledge ourselves to uphold and to protect the list of what was to be so upheld and protected was a long one indeed chris running his eye through it recognised most of the first principles of sweetness and light that is practically all put in ram nath rather hastily when the end of the third page being reached chris seemed inclined to turn it you have seen enough to grasp our meaning and decide if you can support us so far began chris thoughtfully there seems little then quite mechanically he did turn the page what was written overleaf was in the sanskrit character and ran as follows and to thee daughter of surabhi framed of the five elements auspicious pure holy sprung from the sun source of ambrosia we vow obedience reverence protection may he be accursed o sin expeller who curses thee may all men know that they who kill them that kill thee are purified chris davenants finger remained pointed accusingly at the blacklettering his clear intelligent eyes sought those other eyes equally intelligent oh that said ram nath in instant petulant excuse that does not concern you or me wei mean our class the educated classunderstand that it does not and soso we ignore it you know as well as i do that if we were to avow our real belief on the cow questionif we did not insist on what is virtually as you very well know the test point between the orthodox many and the heterodox few we the latter might as well give up our aim of benefiting india our hope of influencing its masses it is for this reason that the arya somaj though officered by men like myself has always professed he paused doubtful of committing himself even so far then went on evasively one has to forfeit some independence of thought in the effort to gain a great end is not the whole system of party governmentin which admittedly individuality must be losta proof chris stood up suddenly yet despite the suddenness doubtfully party government he echoed let us find out party first ram nath and as for thathis voice and face softened as he pointed again to the sanskrit letteringthat cannot be for meas yet it may come back also god knows it may become real again likelike other things then i will follow gladly but not now i will not be driven asin time of stressthat might drive me as it will surely drive you and yours ram nath rose too vexedly and put the paper in his pocket we will not be driven it is knowledge that drives ignorance not ignorance knowledge our harness is ready we will put it on the right horse and saddle the ass when the proper time comes never fear deadly in earnest as he was chris could not forbear a smile but his despondent gravity was back in a second not if your hands are tied as they will be he answered slowly not if you are in the toils he had felt in them himself ever since the night before and the feeling grew stronger when ram nath left him to his solitary dinner for his wife after spending the best part of the day in bed recovering from the fatigues of the ball had gone out to dine with some friends and go on with them to the dress rehearsal of a burlesque in which she was singing and dancing she had not taken any notice of last nights quarrel had indeed practically ignored it and said goodnight to himas she passed out to the carriage in her short skirtswith absolute good humour so baffled helpless miserable he sate down conscientiously to the long set meal which his wife prided herself was served with as much ceremony as any in nushapore he said no thank you in polite english fashion to halfadozen dishes and still the solemn exchange of one clean plate for another went on and on till he felt inclined to order the servants with their illconcealed tolerance of him as the husband of their mem out of the room they left him alone at last in company with the dessert but even this was not to his taste yet in a way he felt hungry so he rose and went to the sideboard cut himself a slice of bread helped himself to some mango pickle and ate it with relish then the mere fact of this revival of a childish taste with its bathos its hopeless triviality reduced him almost to tears and he came back to sit before the chocolate pralines and french dragees and leaning his head on his crossed arms give himself up to a dreary amaze the house was absolutely quiet the servants had closed the verandah doors and gone off to their own quarters through the looped portieres whichas in so many indian bungalowshung in the wide arch between the dining and drawing rooms he could see the latter lit up decorously with a superfluity of pink paper shades one of the windows opening on to the garden was ajar and the light from the lamps made the thin split bamboo screen hung beyond it to keep out the flies look like solid wood but as after a time impelledeven in his blank uncertainty regarding all thingsto think of going into the drawingroom decently and in order chris looked up from his dreary meditations the solidity of this screen wavered and he saw the cause a thin delicate hand was pulling the screen aside so as to see into the room who is it he called at once what do you want krishn davenund came a voice it was a womans krishn davenund he echoed stupidly his heart beginning to throb well i am krishn davenund who wants me the next instant he was standing as if turned to stone beside the table for the whiteclad figure which showed itself and then came swiftly towards him was his mothers mother he faltered whywhat he paused feeling there was no reason here no reason at all in the clinging hands about his knees in the passionate kisses rained on them regardless of dress trousers regardless of everything save that here was the son that had been lost and was found again not so chris davenant with a certain rage he realised even as he bent over her with tears in his eyes stirred to his innermost soul that above all this emotion lay a doubt to what he ought to do next whether he should raise his mother to the chair beside his raise her to the unaccustomed or crouch down on the floor beside her himself in forgotten fashion horrible hateful thought yet there it was she solved the question herself unconsciously with the dignified humility of eastern womanhood sit thou there son of thy father master of my widowed house she said so at thy feet shall i find son and husband once more then in a perfect ecstasy of joy she lifted her worn refined face to his yea i shall find krishn my balakrishna once more lo canst thou forgive thy mother child thy mother who denounced thee not knowing that thou hadst returnedthat thou hadst come back come back he echoed her face was as the face of an angel over the sinner that repenteth she reached her thin arm from her shroud and laid her finger on his lip hush child let it be forgotten let it be as if it had never been thou canst tell me after why thou saidst no word yet krishn how could i tell but for the old pujari who laid the caste mark on thy forehead again i might never have known he understood then understood why she had come to him why that clinging mothers touch was his own once more poor mother lo krishn she went on interrupting herself hastily at the look on his face be not angry with me if thou didst know the tears i have shed since he told me but yesterday how could i know and to think i might have killed thee say thou dost forgive me speak not of forgiveness mother he said huskily bending to kiss her what else could he do he asked himself could he tell her the truththat he had not come back or had he or even if he had not did he not mean to do so he could not say he only felt himself in the toils once more leave the past alone mother he said fondly the present is enough she smiled rapturously for a moment and then she looked round anxiously nay child not yet there is thy wife i must gain her forgiveness too if mortal woman can forgive one who might have made her widow but i will lie at her feet krishn i will plead with her that is why i came hitherto see herto call her daughter chris with those clinging arms about him chris in the luxury of being loved gave a faint sob she is not here tonight mother he said but fret not she would forgive theeeven hadst thou made her widow the worn old face looked rebuked perhaps a trifle disappointed lo i have heard ever she said with a regret in her voice also that they are as angels without jealousy not as we here the sight of the dark intelligent face above hers seemed to come upon her as if it had been her lovers and she a girl she laid her head suddenly on his knee and laughed a laugh that held a sob then i have thee to myself for now hearts darling she murmuredthou and thy house she looked around her full of childish curiosity and amazement thou art ameer indeed she went on with awe touching the tablecloth gingerly with her fingers and all those dishes she shook her head dismally lo krishn how shall i ever feed thee when thou comest to our poor house yet wilt thou not mind she added thou wert never a greedy one then the curiosity prevailed even over her thoughts of him and clinging to his arm still she raised herself to peer over the table at the drawingroom through which she had hurried thou dost eat here and sleep there she suggested nay krishn think not thy mother a fool but she is so gladso gladand all is so newit is a spectacle her familiar face so austere now in its lines yet still so full of life furrowed by late tears yet smoothed by present smiles seemed to him the most charming thing of his very own he had seen for years he rose like the boy he was in reality and raised her with him come little mother he said in banter come feminine one and see it all there will be no peace for talk till that is over it came naturally to him that tone of superior affection which he had not dared to use for so long so hand in hand he showed her things strange and new and as he did so saying that viva had made this or arranged that a certain content in the fact grew up in him doth she play this asked the widow in her shroud as she touched the keys of the piano with an awed finger yea and sings too he replied proudly she shall sing for thee next timehe had quite forgotten realities in this presentand now he added thou must see the rest for we sleep not here this is but for sitting he took one of the pinkshaded lamps and led the way this is my room he said with considering the circumstances a perfectly childish pomp and delight in his task his mother looked into the slip of a room with approval until she came to the little campbed set in a corner are there no flowers she asked quickly the wedding is not so old yet the pinkshaded lamp trembled suddenly in his hands he had remembered realities and thisthis isthe other he continued passing on the old woman gave a cry of pure delight for there were flowers here roses on the walls the hangings the floor roses fastening up the lace curtains of the glittering bed with its quilt of satin roses even on the dressingtable trimmed like a rose itself where chris with a still unsteady hand set down the rosy light to sparkle on the silver brushes and combs the silvertopped heavenknowswhat that lay upon it for mrs chris had been dressing for a burlesque and had required plenty of paints and pots the old woman in her widows shroud stole over towards it walking softly as if afraid of crushing the roses but there was no awe in her face now only a vast curiosity as one by one she lifted the lids and looked in for this she knew this was common to all women suddenly she glanced round at her son and nodded archly ere proceeding with her inspection yea she is good and thou art blessed in one who careth for thy love she said softly poor chris he stood staring at his mother staring at the paints and patches staring at everything feminine in this world and the next without a word without almost a thought only with a sort of vague wonder if thisthis inconceivable positionwas the common ground between those things feminine a sniff at a silvertopped bottle of whiterose scent ended the inspection by bringing a sudden recollection a sudden new interest to his mothers face lo i had nigh forgotten she said searching in the folds of her shroud with some trepidation then relieved coming towards him narainithou dost remember thy cousin naraini krishn though she was but a child when thou didst leave yea i remember he said his bewilderment passing into something tangible something that sent him hot and cold that made him clinch his hands and try to bring the dull surprise back again what then the girl hath a fancydidst thou by chance seek our house that morning krishn i tell her it could not be that thou wouldst not have gone away but girls fancies are ill to soothe and she hath wept all night lest by her petulance she had driven thee forth she did penance for it poor child within the hour for having shown evil temper to a holy one but since the pujaris tale she will have it that it was thouso i gave my word i would ask thee just to comfort her though it is idle chris stood quite still it is not idle he replied in a set voice ii begged of her his mother gave a horrified exclamation and she did fling the corn in the gutter the gods are good that worse did not come of it the wicked one for this i might have killed my son for hadst thou come in i would have known i was not coming in said chris reverting to a western quickness of speech tell her that please amma his mother pursed up her lips i have a mind not as i have a mind not to give thee what she sent what she sent echoed chris hotly give it me mother give it at once one corner of the shroud came out from the folds obediently it was knotted round something small and scented andeven through that shroudthe perfume of roses drifted from it into the rosy room lo there it isthat and her sense of sin she hath done penance as i said but she shall do ten more or ever i return it was only a little round cardboard box she put into his hand a box with a quaint domed lid such as girls keep their trinkets in but it was covered and lined with brocaded silk that must have been soaked in attar from the scent it held and that somehow suggested the scented fingers which had sewed on the silver and gold twists the little pearls and crystals with which it was so cunningly adorned chris had seen such caskets often in the days when he had gone to weddings with his mother they were part of the brides trousseau made always by the bride herself and this one naraini had made he opened it with a strange mixture of fear and hope fear lest it might contain something to spoil that picture of the girl his memory held and that held his fancy hope that it might hold something to enhance it and it did for it was full of golden corn such corn as she had thrown in the gutter at his feet he sat looking at it long after he had returned from seeing his mother safe back to the city he sat looking at it until the rumbling of carriages outside told him his wife would soon be coming from the burlesque then he took the pinkshaded lamp again and put the little box away in his room in a drawer where there was already a little packet of yellow corn and as he did so he felt that he was in the toils indeed the sound of his wife and mr lucanasters voices as they bade goodnight to each other in the garden did not tend to lessen that sense but in truth that feeling of being enmeshed was not peculiar to chris davenant even in shark lane ram nath himself as he finished an article which was to appear in the voice of indiaan article which he wrote coolly calmly with a certain pride in its even balance of thought and then deliberately interspersed with glowing periods of pure passion for the sake of his audiencefelt as an engineer might feel who knows that the pressure on a throttle valve is getting beyond the escape he can give it and knows also that he cannot stop the stokers from putting on more coal he comforted himself however by thinking what was indeed the truth that he was actually doing no more than many a party politician does in england the difference lay in the environment the difference of throwing matches into a fire which burns rubbish and the throwing of them into rubbish which turns to fire then mr lucanaster even as he told mrs chris tenderly that he had had what he called ripplin time in her company and that he meant to dream of it knew that before he granted himself the luxury of sleep he must think over more important matters than his relations with her and find out how far he had committed himself in regard to them for he had been taken by surprise that day without a word of warning the detectives had consulted him as an expert in pearls regarding the four found in miss leezies house as usual when taken abackfor he was not a villain of the first waterhe had temporised with the question second thoughts however had shown him that by failing at once to admit that he held the remainder of the string for jehan he had tied his own hands from doing so in the future therefore if the latter was called upon to produce them he had only two alternatives he must either deny possession or yield it before that possession was publicly asserted at all in either case he lost his hold on the emerald so partly for this reason partly because he was not prepared to go to the extremes of villainy he felt that he regretted having touched the business at all jehan himself however had no conception that his position in regard to mr lucanaster had altered except by his own possession of the ring the presence of that on his finger indeed would have given him perfect confidence but for the fact that it brought with it a strange recrudescence of responsibility jehan with the ring and jehan without it were two different men he found himself even as he weptand he did weep copiously and openly over little saaduts lossthinking of another heir of vague possibilities and powers his very determination to mete out proper punishment to sobrai grew in dignity the necessity for it became more of a duty less of a revenge and all this made him defer till the last minute any communication with mr lucanaster time enough to let him know that the ring was really within reach when the police should ask for the production of the pearls that might be never and then indeed jehan felt he would be free to make bargains meanwhile the safest place in which to keep the treasure seeing that for all he knew noormahal might have discovered its abstraction and set her agents to recover it was his own finger so there it remained day and night but noormahal had not discovered her loss khojee had told her lie all too well for any doubt in the poor bewildered brain which had more than it could compass in the hopeless effort to realise that saadut was dead and buried for the memory of that first day when they had roused her at the last and she had sate clutching at the little swathed bundle of white and gold till they took it from her had happily gone from her also she still lay for the most part in a stupor lateefa saw her so whenthe etiquette of a mourning house making it inconvenient for him to continue his trade of kitemaking in the wide outer courtyardhe had gone to take away his materials but khojee had told him it was not always so that sometimes the nawabin had paroxysms of grief for which there could be there never had been but one remedy and that was a most precious essence compounded out of the sweetest flowers in a kings garden in the old days it had always been ready in the palace but now whence was a poor old woman to get khushitr that essence of happiness which cost god knows how many times its weight in gold as it was she had gone the length of pawning khadjees best pink satin trousers on the sly in order to get cheaper specifics and somehow or another those precious garments must be redeemed before the mourningparties began or khadjee would die of chagrin also then there would be no one left since even he lateefa was going she spoke as ever without a suspicion of blame and when she hoped he had not forgotten his promise regarding the ring her voice was an apology in itself lateefa as he went out under the gateway with its plaster peacocks told himself that he almost wished he could forget as it was the green gleam on jehans finger kept him on the strain in a quite unexpected way he never saw it but khojees kind wrinkled face and her appeal for old khojee ugly khojee came back to his mind with a curious compelling force as he sat afterwards in one corner of the tiny square of courtyard that was set round like a well with high brick walls where jehan and burkut were playing ecarte with an intolerably dirty pack of cards each crouched on the same string bed which also served as a table he could not help watching that gleam and thereby imperilling the perfect balance of some kites he was fitting with their tails for there was a notable series of matches to be flown that evening and the sideway sweep of a real kite overhead warned him that there would be wind wind sufficient to warrant a trifle of ballast perhaps to these light creatures of his he had one afloat already on trial just above the top of the houses where gay in the sunlight it hung tilted to leeward almost motionless lateefa tested the strain on the cord with a finger as if it had been a violin string and as he did so his high trilling voice warbled over one of those ingenious versicles that are more of a puzzle than of poetryseeing that almost every letter in them has a mathematical valuewhich the idle in india love to turn and twist lateefa made of naught made thee of naught lateef who never sought the life god brought lateef whos bound and caught in right and ought but he forbids thee naught since thou art naught sail east west south or north choose thine own port thou thing of naught jehan swore under his breath the cards were against him the stakes laid on the bed between him and his adversary had taken his last available rupee and of late even burkut had refused to play without money down he looked round sullenly then turned again to shuffle the pack my nakedness against thine he said gruffly the clothes are worth a gold mohur ill warrant that was about it since they were both dressed in the ordinary white garments of nobility at its ease burkut shrugged his shoulders if it please theeas we sit then tis thy turn to deal lateefa looked up quickly from his work the nawab will deal better without the signet of royalty he said significantly and as jehan paused burkut frowned and laughed at the same time yea he said airily that would fetch more than a gold mohur if twere sold take it off my lord i will do what i choose without thy bidding retorted jehan haughtily as he drew the ring from his finger and laid it for safety just behind him on the string bed lateefa could see it plainly as the cards fell from jehans hand cards that were in his favour so much so that he could not avoid a triumphant smile the game seemed his but he played a false card and lost a point he dashed the tricks down with such force that the springy plaited twine recoiled from the blow recoiled and sprang up again lateefa could see the green gleam more clearly than ever now for the ring lay in the dust within reach of his hand it had jumped from the bed like a clay pigeon from a trap under that petulant blow but the players had not noticed it they were going on with their game unconcernedly only lateefas eyes were on that gold and green half hidden in the dust if thou hast the chance he heard the words as plainly as if khojee had been beside him but this was no chance the loss would be discovered in a minute or two and then it would be a mere question of search for there could be no suspicion of any one else since the bed on which those two were playing was set right across the only entrance to that well of wall in which there was no place of concealmentnone no it was not a chance yet he heard his reply now on my kites i promise since they be my creatures to fly or fail as i make them on his kites a sort of dazzle came to the sunshine a dazzle to his brain he gave a sudden reckless laugh his hand went out to the ring swiftly and busied itself still more swiftly as he sang in the varying measure to which such versicles lend themselves a new version of the old words lateefa made of naught lateef whos bound and caught lo he forbids thee naught sail east west south or north choose thine own port the kite whichas he sangtwisted and twirled upwards from his dexterous throw seemed at first as if it was uncertain what to choose i mark the king said burkut with an oily smile and once more jehan with an oath flung down the cards but by this time both kites were tilting steadily to leeward and only lateefas skilful finger could in striking the strings that held them captive have told that one had a trifle more ballast to carry than the other chapter xv the ram rucki jack raymonds admission cest la peste mademoiselle had been made under compulsion lesley he had recognised was not one to be put off by evasion and yet his first impulse had been to keep his discovery to himself for the sense of authority to deal with men and things which he had had in the past was apt to return to him when he found himself in a tight place therefore the necessity for avoiding a scare had seemed to him paramount and he had followed up his lowtoned admission by a rapid request that lesley should take jerry home to bed and say nothing to anybody of the adventure but by the time the green sleeves had disappeared obediently over the dim lawns that were just becoming visible in the dawn his sense of responsibility had passed he told himself it was none of his business and that once he had handed over the case to the police the matter would be ended so far as he was concerned so far also as every one was concerned if the authorities had any sense since lesley would hold her tongue jerrys ghost could be laid and laughed at budlu bribed and janalishan he looked round wondering if the latter had gone or not but could see nothing an elaborately conscientious hawking and spitting however from the shadow of a distant bush told him not only that john ellison was there but that he had grasped the situation ave a quid o bitter yerbs sir came the loafers voice resignedly its a camphor bush sir an there aint no good in givin in to plague an pestilence without a good lord deliver us is there sir the question had an almost pathetic apprehension in it not a bit assented jack raymond have a cigar instead ellison ill light one for you and chuck it over he knew his man knew that without being a coward he was for the moment desperately afraid two very different things since time cures one and the other is persistent so for a minute or two there was silence then from the shadow of the camphor bush came a more confident cough if you did appen to ave a drop o brandy began the voice tentatively though if you avent sir its thy will be done an that bein so theres nothin left but wot the nation you an mes got to do next ow many corpses is there sir jack raymond smiled feeling he had judged his man rightly there is only the poor devil we chased left alive he answered the two children the woman and a servant are dead they have been there nearly a week refugees from down country who managed to slip past quarantine he is a nushapore man by birth and just as they were coming to the journeys end one child fell sick so to escape inspection he alighted at the last roadside station and walked in at night he had to pass the garden mound of course and it struck him it would be safer to find out first if his people would take him in so he knowing the ropes hid his family here for the day then his people were alarmed another child sickened et cetera so he stopped on here getting to and from the bazaar for what he wanted at night dressed in an old white uniform a low whistle came from the camphor bush and a murmur no you dont sonny no you dont yes it was rather a cute dodge but hes an educated man well the last child died yesterday and he went off to get medicine for his wife hoping to sneak back as usual but the garden was full up with chinese lanterns and bands and they were dancing deary dear interrupted the distant voice sympathetically so e ad to lounge around awaitin for gord save our gracious queen to let im see if is lawful wife ad chucked it well sir black or white it do seem cruel ardthere was a pause another ostentatious clearing of the throatbut e knows the worst now sir went on janalishan so why not ave the pore soul out where the breezes blow on is parallel as the sayin is it ud be more olesome special if es got to be took in and as it say in oly writ separate ye the livin from the dead an the plague was stayed beg pardin sir but avin bin seven year in a surplus chore it come naturallike jack raymond thought that it did thought as he sat waiting that the loafer given a free hand would probably settle the business as well as any one else his suggestion was sound anyhow so after a bit there were three shadowy figures planted out on the lawns at respectful distances from each other the last one a dejected heap huddled up on the grass whimpering softly if you ad another o them hantimicrobbertailtwisters about you sir came the suggestive voice between vehement puffings at a cigar it ud tickle im up like as it done me an bein a bombay duck as the sayin is e d smoke is grandmothers curlpapers i know them downcountry baboos week in week out you can ear their bellows blow an gord save our gracious queen as bin cruel ard on em sirto say nothin o its bein a sight safer to pizen is blacksillys jack raymond smiled janalishan was wisdom itself so the further shadow was supplied with a cigar while a comparatively reckless voice hummed cheerfully tobacco is an indian weed grows green at morn cut down at eve thus we decay we are but clay think of this when you smoke tobacco seems to me sir it broke off at last to say that theres only us three to take count on so to speak them pore things in there as sumtotalled up their little bills an as the ministers man said when they come worryin round for a grave an e busy plantin sproutscorpsesll keep an kebbiges wont so why not leave em comfortable for tonight we dont want no crowd comin round to see the place where we laid em do we sir an madam toosaws aint nothin to bazaar folk for the chamber o orrers if they get the chanst then as for im pore devil e must go to quarantine camp as a suspect anyhow so it wouldnt make any odds to im would it sir an we could tell im to old is tongue or worse befall couldnt we sir an that ud tone down the colour a bit as the sayin is more nor lettin the police send round the towncrier how about budlu asked jack raymond tentatively but janalishan was ready for him give im in charge isself as e ought ter be for disreliction o duty in allowin ghosts that ud stop is mouth sir special as e dont know nothin the simplicity of the plan was obvious it would even jack raymond felt take the responsibility of informing the police off his shoulders he need only give the stowaway in charge then go round to the civil surgeon tell him the truth and leave him to decide whether or not to hush up the matter absolutelyas he could easily do by the aid of quicklime and a few stones in that case he said after a pause for deliberation the sooner we move off from this particular place just so sir interrupted janalishan dror the enemys fire hoff the weak spot so if youll take im over to the generals ouse an settle is an budlus ash when the perlice come ill ang round about them pore things inside an warble ymns an psalms an spiritooal songs till youve done the job it wont urt em sir he added apologetically an itll kinder keep up my sperits it appeared to do so for when a quarter of an hour afterwards jack raymond after finishing his task returned to that part of the garden on his way to the civil surgeon he heard quite a cheerful version of wrap me up in my tarpaulin jacket coming from the camphor bush and when just as the sky was primrose with the first sunbeams he returned once more to release janalishan from his voluntary lykewake he found him seated on the plinth of the mutiny memorial going methodically through john browns body as sung by convivial parties with the elision of a word at each verse it was near its end so that only john had to be vocalised when jack raymond came up but the beating of the silent tune went on vigorously while he told janalishan that the civil surgeon had expressed his entire approval of the plan which he characterised as a stroke of administrative genius but is soul goes marchin on burst out janalishan finishing his song at the proper beat then he rose pulled his sleeves over his cuffs and nodded his head gravely thats ow it is sir is soul goes marchin on that sort o strokes come to a feller they do in the garding mound an will do please god as long as theres a white face among the black so singing silver threads among the gold he sloped off through the cemetery then over the wall to his work citywards feeling that so far as he was concerned the incident was over but to jack raymond as he went back to the club came the remembrance that lesley drummond must be told that her question and his answer were to remain a secret between them the idea annoyed him all the more so because of the remembrance of grace arbuthnots guilty face when lesley had let the cat out of the bag concerning the origin of the green sleeves nevertheless it was inevitable so he sat down in an illhumour wrote a stiff explanatory note suggesting that jerrys midnight chase should be treated as a nightmare due to turkey and ham and sent it over to government house yet before doing so he fumigated it carefully with tobacco feeling the while a trifle ashamed of his own smile at the remembrance of those green sleeves but the wearer of them restored to the dignity of a tailormade coat and skirt receiving the note while the telltale odour was still fresh on itfor she had found sleep impossiblefrowned at the recollection of the figure in the political uniform which had refused even to touch those green sleeves frowned not from displeasure but from impatience at her own sense of pleasure in his thoughtfulness for it was unfamiliar to her that sense of rest in another persons care treat it as a nightmare of course how else could one treat that wild medley of green sleeves political uniforms ghosts boys valses a deux temps janalishans only no sane person would ever dream of dreaming such nonsense and yet what was this unfamiliar tingle to her fingertips this curious elation this sense of personal gain as if she had found something new and preciousas if a child idly unfolding a flowerbud had found a fairy at its heart she turned from this fancy still more impatiently resolving to set the whole incident aside but this she soon found was quite impossible that secret between her and jack raymond was inexorable in its claims for instance though the chance of any consequence to him was she knew small she could not avoid watching for his figure to show in its usual haunts listening if his name came up in conversation neither could she avoid relief at the certainty that nothing evil had befallen him that of course was only natural but it was intolerable that the relief should make her blush most intolerable of all when he noticed it and said with a smile no such luck for my friends miss drummond this happened at a teapicnic which lady arbuthnot gave a day or two after the ball more than one person had remarked to her on jack raymonds failure to put in an appearance it was growing late she was conscious of her own anxiety and then in a sudden surge the blood flew to her face at the sight of him close beside her shaking hands with his hostess what is the joke lesley asked grace arbuthnot quickly looking from one to the other once again jack raymond answered for her answered audaciously a dead secret even from lady arbuthnot is it not miss drummond i would rather it was not she replied turning away resentfully to wander off by herself into the garden where the teapicnic was being given a garden which had been the petit trianon of the dead dynasty it was a quaint place tucked away between two angles of the city wall for greater convenience in secret comings and goings to secret pleasures and it was all the quainter now because of the englishwomen sipping tea on the steps of the gilded summerhouse the englishmen calling tennis scores in what had been the rosewater tank in which kings favourites had bathed and on which they had floated in silver barges the feeling of mutual incredibility which in india comes so often to all but the unimaginative came to lesley as she thought of the city so close behind the fringe of tall blossoming trees yet so absolutely hidden by it within half a mile of her lay the courtyard where auntie khojee was starving herself in the effort to get money wherewith to buy the essence of happiness within half a mile of her lateefas kite overlooked in the tornado of wrath which had followed on the disappearance of the ring still tilted to leeward under the burden of sovereignty but of all thisof the romance the squalor the humanity of the lives lived in the cityshe knew nothing except her own ignorance of those lives that and that only was with her in the beauty of the garden the beauty which was as it were the only thing that she and the unseen city had in common and it was beautiful bosomed in those blossoming trees that shut out the world shut in the scent of the flowers it appealed instantly to something deep down in her womans nature for this had been a womans garden the remembrance made her recoil spiritually partly from the thought of what the garden must have seen in the past partly from the mere suggestion that it could appeal to anything in her she walked on quickly recoiling bodily as she did so from an overgrown roseshoot which usurped the path in so doing she displayed frills and flounces a pair of dainty openworked stockings and highheeled shoes but she did not recoil from the sight of these despite her views despite her modern girls theoretical contempt for chiffons and disdain for women whose lives are bounded by the becoming she was not one whit more logical on such points than her grandmothers had been she had not thought out the real meaning of her frills and furbelows or confessed to herself that such feminine footgear belongs inevitably to the path which leads to the petit trianon of life above all she had not seen as women must see before they become a power in the world that the one point on which all races meet no matter what their religion no matter what their ideals no matter what their standard of morality is that which makes petit trianon possible in other words the womans attitude towards the man an attitude so strangely at variance with the sexlaws of nature yet of the beauty of this garden who could doubt within that fringe of blossoming trees a wide aqueductlike a shining crosslay edged by mosaicked marble causeways that were raised above and in their turn edged by a perfect wilderness of flowers and this wider cross composed of flowers mosaic water was set in dense thickets of oranges and pomegranates in this late afternoon all the sunshine seemed concentrated in the cross great shafts of yellow light streamed down its limbs seeming to darken all the rest in the centre where the limbs met a group of fountains sent fine feathers into the air and through their sparkle the gold and marble of the summerhouse gleamed amid its sentinels of cypress at the far end of the garden there was a cloying sweetness in the air a flight of jewelled parrots flew screaming from one screen of flowering trees to the other as if even theywinged creatures as they werecould not escape the thraldom of those high walls hidden by leaf and blossom that sense of prisonmentthe prisonment of pleasurelay heavy on lesley as she paused halfunconsciously before a tiny latticed retreatthe daintiest little retreat in the worldwhich just at the opposite end of the shining cross from the gilt summerhouse rose out of the water made of marble fretwork with a domed top it looked like a lace veil moulded into the form of a singingbirds cage and its latticed seclusion was only connected with the causeway on either side of it by a footwide ledge of mosaic lesley having been in the garden before knew the purpose this retreat had served in the past and her involuntary pause beside it prolonged itself in halfdisdainful wonder for this had been the sanctuary here had been refuge even from the pleasures of the garden and hither if any woman high or low chose to appeal for redress majesty itself had been bound to come and listen leaving majesty and manhood behind it that at least was the idea the retreat itself was more suggestive of beauty gaining in power by seclusion and lesleys lip curled with more disdain as she looked at the finnikin filagree cage her expression however changed to curiosity as she realised that some one was sitting inside it she crossed the ledge of mosaic swiftly and stooping under the laced edge of a low arch went in it was not beauty that she found it was a wrinkled anxiousfaced old woman who rose in a salaam then literally prostrated herself at the girls feet lesley had been long enough in india now to judge rightly of the poverty shown in the dress the bluestriped trousers tight to the knee and full above the short whitybrown cotton veil were to be seenmore or less dirty more or less raggedin every poor mohammedan quarter yet there was something refined in the worn face blurred with recent tears which looked into hers apprehensively as the owner rose to salaam again leaving a small roll of paper bound with coloured silks upon the marble floor lesley was puzzled for an instant then it flashed upon her that this must be some belated petitioner for justice in the old style who had heard probably that the lordsahib was in the garden such rolls of paperwithout the silken tie howeverwere often thrust into the carriage when sir george was in it so she hunted round her sparse vocabulary but finally fell back on the first phrase most newcomers to india learn namely kya mankta what do you want it is an admirable beginning though unfortunately the sympathetic curiosity of it seldom becomes impersonal to the speaker it produced another salaam and such a flood of polished speech that lesley retired to english incontinently is it for the lordsahib she asked hurriedly picking up the roll and pointing with it to the distant summerhouse the title produced a fourth salaam and lesley with some relief stooped under the fretted arch again and began to retrace her steps towards the others sir george she knew had been doubtful if business would allow him to put in an appearance at the entertainment at all but some one would be sure to know what message ought to be sent back to the petitioner who as lesley left the birdcage settled herself down in it again to wait with great precision read it some one please said lady arbuthnot after she had undone the quaint little tasselled silk cord which was fastened with a loop and button round the roll of paper but the order was no such easy matter to obey so far as the conventional arz fidwe yih hai this is the request of your petitioner went the little group of administrators who responded to her request were fluent enough after that came complaints of the character and more than one suggestion that only a regular native reader could be expected to decipher such writing and that it would be best to hand the document over to the office which would be sure to make something of ita remark which made lesley who was listening wonder whether the accuracy of that something was to be considered at all grace arbuthnot however listening also let a curious smile come to her face a smile that gave it an unusual tenderness where is mr raymond she said suddenly going did you say will some one call him back please he appeared ready for his drive home in rather a violent blazer and once more there was that unfailing challenge in his politethey tell me i am wanted lady arbuthnot yes to read this she replied holding out the hieroglyphic in all her life of beauty and grace she had possibly never looked more beautiful more graceful and jack raymond realised it realised also that so far as that beauty that grace were concerned he had not forgottenthat he would never forget and the certainty roused all his antagonism for a moment he stood like a naughty child refusing to say its lesson then he took the paper from her and ran his eye down it persian he said i had better give you the gist of it the writer is one khojeeya khanum a pensioner the nawab jehan aziz is her representative he seems to have been taking toll as they always doit is madness paying pensions in the lump as we do she is starving i suppose they generally are noa faint interest dispersed some of the contempt in his faceit seems she wants money for a specific purposeto buy the essence of happiness that word is itrikhush isnt it sir the commissioner thus appealed toa man who was seldom in fault in speaking the vernacularsfrowned over the symbol itrikhush m it may be but it doesnt matter since it is money she wants ive had one or two complaints about that sweep jehan azizs pensioners already lady arbuthnot and we are going to inquire so ill put this ones name down too if i may khojeeya khanumthanks well goodnight lady arbuthnot ive a reader with a file yards high waiting memost important papers goodnight raymond you havent forgotten the trick i see you are still as good a moonshi as ever isnt he lady arbuthnot except in regard to the essence of happiness she replied coolly making jack raymond stare at her and lesley once more become impatient but the old woman is waiting she interrupted she is waiting for an answer in the birdcage surely some one ought to go and tell her something several of the guests had taken advantage of the commissioners departure to say their farewells also so that those three were left in a group by themselves i will go said grace suddenly if mr raymond can spare time from his whist to find happiness he put in quickly by all means the mosaic causeway was narrow so lesley fell behind the shining limb of the watercross lay to one side of her the edge of massed flowers to the other the sky was deepening in its blue overhead the creeping shadows below had gripped the lace birdcage in the distance making it look cold and grey but the sun which caught the tops of the blossoming trees and made the painted kites that floated above them from the city look like jewels seemed to linger mysteriously in the soft pink of grace arbuthnots dress the gay orange and yellow of jack raymonds blazer and claim them as part of its brightness in the hush of evening the insistent doyoulovetoodoyoulovetoo of one small cinnamon dove hidden in a rosebush seemed to fill the garden until from beyond it came some gay voices discussing the essence of happiness as the departing guests got into their carriages take your choice of the four ws said one wisdom wine wealth women i choose a whiskyandsoda retorted another i give you in the rest especially after tennis by jove that was a splendid game four ws put in a higher key youve forgotten worthoh i dont mean that worth of course the dressmaker man ye dont need his art me dear lady lesley walking behind those two paused suddenly for jack raymond had lingered to hold back that trailing roseshoot from her frills and flounces also and the cinnamon dove startled by the pause fled from the rosebush to silence and deeper shade its flight made her start also frightened at a dove said jack raymond in a low tone and you werent a bit frightened at the plague he was smiling at her his face all soft and kind she had never seen it like that before but as he stepped back to grace arbuthnots side lesley realised that she had the certainty that these two had been lovers once came to her then and brought a curious sense of loneliness the certainly that in a way they would be lovers always brought her a pang before which she stood aghast for there was no mistaking it it was unreasonable elemental jealousy she felt inclined then and there to turn back and leave them to do their task alone they did not want her what was she lesley drummond doing there in that garden whose suggestiveness seemed to stifle her yes to stifle her because she could not escape from it she lesley drummond who in her minds eye she saw a vision of herself alighting from an omnibus at the corner of bond street on a wet day picking her way over the greasy blistermarks of many feet on the pavement heedless of the infinite suggestions in the shop windows to have tea at a ladiesclub with an intimate friend and solve the problems of life by hard and fast individualism tempered by a sloppy socialism solve as if it were possible to solve anything in those conditions above all to solve the greatest problem in the world for women as you drank your tea on a table littered with the literature of chiffonculture whose every page proclaimed that womans aim was to remain temptress her goal a garden such as this they were close to the sanctuary now the others had entered it and lesley paused to look contemptuously at its filagree pretence of protection ere she too stooped under its low arch i think you have it havent you lesley asked grace arbuthnot as she entered to find a puzzled look on all three faces in the old womans it was mixed with a halfindignant apprehension have what she asked coldly the silk cord that was round the roll i gave it to you to hold i think she wont speak without it it seems it is a braceletan amulet the bracelet of brotherhood without which a woman cannot speak to a strange man explained jack raymond ah you are wearing it she was quite idly she had fastened it by its loop and button round her wrist in order to keep it safe she took it off now and handed it to him without a word he passed it to auntie khojee whose withered face settled into selfsatisfaction as she leant forward detaining his hand till the bracelet was safely looped on his brown wrist then the words came fast floods of them and jack raymond listened patiently fine though the filagree of marble was that shut them off from the garden it interrupted the light so that their figures showed dimly to each other but the scent of the garden drifted in unchecked and mixed with the faint scent of heliotrope from grace arbuthnots dress there was something breathless disturbing to the senses lesley felt in that uncomprehending effort to understand it was a relief when silence fell suddenly and there was a pause is that all whispered grace she was next to jack raymond her dress touching him i believe i ought to give her a bracelet in return he began she had one of her gold bangles off in a moment and was thrusting it into his handtake that please doyou might let me do so much surely lesley turned and stepped outside she felt the need of fresh air there was no use my stopping she explained when after an interval the two rejoined her i could not understand not understand echoed grace arbuthnot reproachfully i couldnt understand the words either but i thought the idea perfectly charming i wouldnt have missed the little scene for worlds and she was so delighted with the gold bangle it is really not uncommon lady arbuthnot protested jack raymond who was beginning to feel a trifle restive again and in the old days the ram rucki was constantly sent by distressed i know interrupted lesley captiously you read of it in meadows taylors books but why did she give it to you he paused a quick annoyance showed on his face he turned to lady arbuthnot vexedly i must apologise he said i never realised till this moment that she must have taken me for sir george put in grace quietly didnt you now i was thinking all the time how much better you played the part than he would have done he is like lesley he loathes sentiment no mr raymond i wont take it she added as he tried to unfasten the ram rucki give it to sir george himself if you likethere he is coming to meet us or she continued with an elusive almost mischievous smile as she went forward to greet her husband leaving those two on the path together give it back to miss drummond she gave it you first jack raymond looked after her quite angrily then laughed drew out his pocketbook and laid the ram rucki between the folds of some banknotes i shall end by doing my duty some day if this goes on miss drummond he said resignedly it is really very kind of you all to take so much interest in my spiritual and bodily welfare as a rule lesley would have been ready with a sharp retort now she was silent she was thinking that it was true she had given the bracelet of brotherhood to him first and then once more a vast impatience seized her how unreal how fantastic it was how far removed from the security of the commonplace chapter xvi the prison of life to old auntie khojee however the incident which lesley had stigmatised as unreal and fantastic was quite natural her life and the lives of thousands such as she dreary dull squalid as they seem to the eyes of western women are yet leavened by many wholly unpractical touches which raise them at times to pure romance the secret worship of the gods the thousand and one omens to be sought or avoided the endless fanciful ceremonials all these are in their monotonous lives witnessing to the passion for selfeffacement in something beyond the womans own individualityin something that has to be cajoled and considered not because it is feared but because it is loved and must therefore be kept tied to the apronstringwhich is eves legacy to women of all races and all creeds so as the old lady limped through the bazaars huddled up in a dirty domino with grace arbuthnots bangle clutched close to her heart she felt no surprise at what had happened her only feeling was one of regret for having so long believed folks tales of change if she had only resorted earlier to ancient methods little saaduts life might perhaps have been spared though that of course was gods will just as it was his will also that at the very last gasp she should have been told by a gossip that the lordsahib was coming as the kings came in past times to entertain their friends in the pleasuregarden for khojee was literally at the last gasp even lateefa had not been near the courtyard for three days though he had promised to look in every morning in truth this was not the kitemakers fault since he was once more kicking his heels in the lockup he had not anticipated this result whenon the impulse of the momenthe had slipped the ring instead of a morsel of brick into one of the tiny calico bags which he had found the easiest way of attaching ballast to his kites it had been but the work of a second to do this and send the kite up to hover in the steady west windon trialwith its string attached to one of the wooden pegs driven for that purpose into the brick wall so he had had no time for full consideration but even had he had this he would scarcely have imagined that jehan would at once take the irrevocable step of calling in the aid of the police that being a course which no wise man adopted save as a last resort when the choice only lay between two evils but jehans rage had mastered his caution the loss of the symbol of past power had raised such a tempest of desire for that power of personal coercion that seeing no other means of gaining it he had at once given not only lateefa but burkut ali in charge for having between them stolen the ring and that despite the voluntary demonstration of innocence afforded by a stripping to stark nakedness of both the accused they must he shrilled have swallowed it dire suggestion to an executive whose chief method of detecting crime is by personal discomfort to the fourth and fifth generation of those presumably implicated in it lateefa had felt his liver dissolve had for one brief moment thought of confession but the presence of the police he saw would make that a leaving of the fryingpan for the fire so he and burkut ali the latter vowing vengeance calmly and knowing he would get it too since he had money and jehan had none were hauled away not to judgment but to that worse evil preliminary inquiry burkut however had found bail and he had been back in his haunts for two days making jehan begin to see his mistake while lateefa very sick and sorry for himself still remained in process of observation but by this time his philosophy had returned and as he kicked his heels he composed another mathematical verselet which should equal the values of i lateefa laid on nothingness the burden of all things and the burden of all things made nothingness of lateefa of all this however auntie khojee knew nothing as she made her way straight to the pawnbrokers where she had pledged khadeeja khanums best pink satin trousers for the recovery of these was the first necessity on the morrow ceremonial visits of condolence would begin in the wide courtyard and she dare not ask khadjee to receive them in her ordinary attire grace arbuthnots bangle would of course redeem the trousers over and over again but the old lady decided this should only be left in exchange for one night as it would be easy to return the garment after the morrows visits were over since there would be no more need for it for at least three days and that would set the bangle free for its legitimate purchase of the essence of happiness it was growing dark as she limped along the narrow bazaar the cavernous shops on either side were but half lit with flaring rushlights the continuous stream of people passing one way or the other seemed inevitably to thrust her furtive swathed figure into the gutter and so at one shop round which a crowd had gathered it needed patience before a way could be edged onwards it was a drug shop and it seemed to be driving a roaring trade as a couple of whiterobed men elbowed past her she heard one say with a sinister satisfaction and our somaj dispensary hath trebled its attendance these last days the people know their friends know themselves safe not that the tales of poison at the hospitals are true but what will you these poor folks are ignorant and we have promised what the promise was khojee did not catch nor did she care to know all her thoughts were with khadjees pink satin trousers therefore she felt as if the whole round world had slipped from under her feet when mittun the pawnbroker from the midst of the miscellaneous collection of rubbish in which he sat like a tame magpie possessed by the nestbuilding instinct told her calmly that he had just sold them sold them at an incredibly high price to a lady of the bazaar who was in a hurry for something smart in which to appear at an assignation that evening and then with infinite selfcomplacency he drew out from a bag two rupees and some pice see this mother he said handing her the money tis a chance such as comes but once in a kobaris life who must needs fill his belly a many times with other folks leavings ere he find a grain of corn to stay his own hunger withal here he looked round distastefully at the old lamps keys picklebottles rags booksheaven knows whatthat made up his stockintrade and which in truth looked but indigestible fare yet i am honest he went on this much i made over and above what i loaned thee on them so there tis with but the due interest held back let none say mittun kobari is no honest man who cares not for his customers nay meeanjee fluttered khojee helpless none said that of thee yet would i rather the trousers and i could have given thee gold mittun eyed the bangle covetously give it me now mother i could loan thee ten rupees on that to buy new trousering khojee shook her head timidly for even the pawnbroker being a man had authority tis for tomorrow brother there is not time thou couldst buy secondhand he persisted there be many in the bazaar though i have them not in truth mussumat khojee i would have sold thine for less than i got seeing that old clothes are no safe purchase nowadays what with police inspection and no rags here no rags there as if the plague came in aught but gods will khojee fearful of persuasion assented hastily to the pawnbrokers piety everything was gods will even her failure to redeem the pink satin trousers i will give thee fifteen for the bangle called mittun after her and she quickened her limp from the temptation the bangle was for another purpose still fifteen rupees would purchase the essence of happiness and leave a margin for sagou dam sago and salep misri also for real cardamoms yes surely with fifteen rupees in prospect she might afford herself some real cardamoms for tomorrows assemblage instead of the cheaper kind she had laid in it would give style to the occasion even if the pink satin trousers were unattainable another crowd before a shop delayed her as she limped along in the gutter there was a policeman in it this time and a voice protesting that it was tyranny what had the police to do with the selling of a quilta quilt that was no longer wanted seeing that the grandfather had found freedom ari idiot said the policeman have a care i do not burn it give him his percentage brother advised govind the editor who as usual was hunting the bazaars for news that is what he wants that is the trick yea i know give it him or he will claim the whole in the name of the plague that is what the sirkar does in bombay it claims allmoney jewels clothes and it will do the same here this is but the beginning twill be the end for thee and thy paper editorjee if thou tellest more lies retorted the constable in righteous indignation it is orders i tell thee there is suspicion that some one govind who as usual also had been at the bhang shop gave a jeering laugh bapree bap some one tis always some one or some thing but we of nushapore my masters will show them we are not as those of bombay we can fight for our own there was a surge of assent in the crowd as if it sought to begin at once and khojee clutching her gold bangle tighter fled incontinently down a bystreet so little might turn her limp into a fall and then that fifteenrupeesworth might roll into the gutter and be snatched up by any one here in the tortuous alleys it was at least quiet though it was dark she slithered in the welter of the days rubbish flung from the high houses on either side and a scamper of pattering feet told her she had disturbed some rats battening on a bit of choice garbage allah hamid she muttered piously and went on the sound of wailing from one of the scarceseen houses she was passing reminded her regretfully of the cardamoms for she had left shops behind her then she remembered one not far from the gate of the city which she must pass one of those miscellaneous shops which are always to be found near city gates where travellers can buy most thingsflour and vegetables red peppers pipe bowls tobacco ay and opium perhaps but on the sly since there was no licence over the door it was not the sort of shop that such as khojeeya khanum patronised as a rule still it might have cardamoms the lowcaste buniya with a wrinkled monkey face and long irongrey hair who crouched behind dingy platters and dusty bags looked ghoulish by the one flickering light set in the solitary cavern of a shop for on either side of it was blank wall trending away to narrow alleys khojee hesitated such men drove many nefarious trades still this one might have cardamoms cardamoms he echoed with a leer yea yea princess true cardamoms to satisfy the best of royal bloodhe he those tall houses round his shop held many such as she and he had recognised the accent khojee scarce knew whether to be flustered or flattered beneath her domino and be speedy she said haughtily i have no time to spare thee lo nawabin he jeered i have them such cardamoms as he was rummaging in the heterogeneous mass piled up against the back wall of his shop wait but a moment i have themi have them but two days ago my princess i had them here by chance an unwary pull sent a pile of parcels and bundles in confusion round him and one rolled nigh to aunt khojee whocareful everlaid a hold of it to save a possible fall into the gutter the light fell on something green and sheeny her fingers recognised the feel of satin and the bundle having unrolled itself somewhat she caught sight of the unmistakable cut of a trouser leg she opened it out a little curiously canst not leave things alone snapped the shopkeeper angrily those be not cardamoms they be something i may need for all that retorted khojee with spiritthe spirit which never fails a woman in the struggle for chiffons so there she was testing the satin with her finger appraising the make if they had only been pinkthough that was but a detail since they were beyond her purse the satin better by far than the muchtoberegretted pinkthe whole newer she wrinkled them aside with a sigh give me the cardamoms brother i have not the money for these the man looked at her cunningly if the daughter of kings needs trousers she will find none cheaper they would yet be too dear for me brother she answered mildly the cardamoms will do he edged nearer his evil face growing confidential lo bhagsu never drives a hard bargain with the noble he cringed it might be that the virtuous ladys money would purchase these and save them from the badness of bazaars since they come from virtue and should go to virtue how much hath the princess to offer khojee gave a halfembarrassed laugh it was impossible of course and yet that is as may be she replied what she will offer is this with a flutter of shame and hope she put down the two rupees and the handful of pice then she remembered the cardamoms that she continued telling herself she might as well be bold to the bitter end for the trousers and the cardamoms it was a diplomatic stroke if an unconscious one for bhagsu instantly recognised that she had indeed ventured her all that the chance was his to take or leave he gave a melancholy groan then began to roll up the green satin and tie it round with some of the triplecoloured cotton hanking used at weddings which for some occult reason is always sold at these wayside shops shivjee be my witness he whimpered i give them for naught but what then virtue goes out to virtue and those who live amongst the noble must be noble khojee could hardly believe her ears half an hour afterwards she could hardly believe her eyes askhadjee having retired safely to sleep with a sausageroll pillow and a quiltshe sate in the courtyard gloating over her wonderful purchase it was simply astounding even khadjee must forgive her duplicity in regard to that secret pawning of pink trousers with such green ones as these for reparation all piped and edged and faced with quite a new braiding of gold thread down the front seam and a new scent to them also the wearer must have been in strange parts though the cut was of the north she folded the precious garments with loving little pats brought out the remaining portions of the state toilet from the almost empty store saw that noormahals muslin was as pure and white and smooth as her old hands could make it arranged the cardamoms in little saucers and so when the city had long since become silent curled her tired old limbs on a string bed set across the doorway of the inner courtwhere the servant should have slept had there been oneand slept fitfully for she had to be up at dawn so that everything should be ready for the visitings and yet leave her time to get round to the goldsmiths sell the bangle by weight and purchase some essence of happinesswhich was alas worth its weight in gold yet when it came it had not much effect greatly to poor khojees disappointment even the quivering sobbing keene of her neighbours and relations did not rouse noormahal to any proper display of grief andas the groups whisperedhow could you expect to lose tears unless you shed them was it not a distinct defiance of providence to deal even with sorrow as if it were your own absolutely finally was not khushki dryness one of the fundamental faults in things createdthe other being gurmai heat khadeeja khanum however was quite sufficiently tur and tunda damp and cool to satisfy the most rigid standard of etiquette and what with the real cardamoms the new trousers a pennyworth of orangeblossom oil which khojee had brought with the essence of happiness and a most encouraging report of prevailing sickness and death amongst mutual acquaintances brought by the visitors the old lady had quite a flush on her withered cheeks by evening and admitted to her sister when the latter helped her to undress that the whole thing had really gone off very well nevertheless she was rather fatigued on the next day the day after that khojee returning from the purchasing of some lemongrass oil wherewith to wile away the aching in the back caused no doubt by the muscular effort of a continual whimper found her seated on the string bed in the centre of the lonely courtyard attired in the green satin trousers and concomitants waiting so she said for the bridal party to arrive how stupid khojee was of course having regard to her deformity it was only natural she should take little heed of such things but all were not made that way and it was high time the bridal party did come it seemed indeed as if an undue interval had elapsed since the betrothal day whenif khojee would remembershe wore pink not green anyhow she shahzadi khadeeja khanum was not one to stand any slackness in a bridegrooms ardour and if he did not appear that day she would choose another she did death claimed her as his before twelve hours were over almost before poor noormahal roused at last from her absorption in grief had realised she was ill it seemed incredible the nawabins big eyes larger darker than everencircled as they were by great shadows which seemed to have crept down the oval of her face making it pointed pinchedturned to aunt khojee even at the moment of death in bewildered reproach and regret and thou hast called none in to send her soul forth with prayers oh khojee that was ill done nay i mean no blame for thee alone kind one but for us bothyet we did not knowwe did not dreamdid we khojee stood for a second speechless rigid her eyes staring yearning towards the familiar face over which the awful unfamiliar look was creeping then with a wild cry she threw up her arms and grovelled at noormahals feet nay i knewi knew from the first oh child i have killed heri khojeehush wail not none must know and touch her not noormahal that is for mefor her sister who killed her lo child sole hope of the house stand furtheri can do alli will do allo khadjee khadjee canst thou forgive and i knewi knew in my heart all was not right i knew none would rightly sell such green satin trousershere she broke into sobbing laughteryet wert thou happy sister and i took the blame of theft if it was theftand it wastheft of thy lifeo khadjee khadjee noormahal pressed back by frantic clinging arms into a corner of the dark roomfor khojee declaring the illness to be a chill had insisted on keeping the patient insidecaught in her breath fearfully peace khojee let me go auntielo thou art not well thyselfthe fever hath theethou art distraught with grief as i was come let us go into the light and i myself will call khojee rose to her feet and laid a quick hand on noormahals mouth nay none must call she said sternly her selfcontrol brought back by dread yea come into the light and leave her come and i will tell thee therein the light how dost thou know asked noormahal gone grey to her very lips it is not thatlo folk die of other things i have seen them remember our cousinit was just so khojees mask of despair showed no wavering nay it is the plague they talked of it at the wailing it hath been here and there in the city this week past mittun held it blasphemy that it should be aught but gods will and i cried yea to him but cannot god send it in the clothes her face drawn haggard almost awful in its questioning settled after a second into decision yea it is the plaguethe swellings they speak of are there it was the trousers i killed her and none must know or they will come and poison thee in hospital lest it spread that is why i called no one the courtyard is wide i can dig a grave noormahal gave a sharp cry of horrified dissent yea i canmy hands are not as thine sweetheart soft and fine old khojees ugliness can do more than thy beautythe beauty of kings daughters which none may see remember that child remember thather voice rang clear of sobs for those words she rose from where she had crouched to tell her tale and looked round her with dull yet steady eyes there is no hurry if folk come none need know she is dead i will say she sleeps and at night i can dig yea i knew it from the first but there is no fear hearts darling thou hast scarce been nigh her that is why i kept her close and tonight i will carry her to the outer courtyardthere is a padlock to the nanbut khana stairs and room forroom for her beside them i have thoughtyea thought while i watched there is no fear noormahal all will go well thou wilt have patience as wives should and jehan will return to thee and little saadut from his paradise will smile on brothersay and sisters toosisters whom thou wilt spare to old aunt khojees arms god knows it shall be so deny it not girldare not to deny it he only knows her face through its tears was alight with faith and hope and charity and noormahals as she looked lost its hardness a dreaminess that was almost tender came to the dry bright eyes yea he knows that night after the peacocks with their broken plaster tails ceased to show against the growing dusk there were faint cautious sounds below them where the two women dug at a grave for in this at least noormahal had said she could help it was not finished by dawn and after that khojee worked alone and only by snatches while noormahal watched from the door of the inner courtyard ready to give the alarm should any visitor comeready also to entertain them and the next night khojee would have no help at all how she managed was a marvel but she did manage even khadeeja khanum herself had she been able to make comments could scarcely have found fault with any lack of ceremony and she would certainly have been gratified by her deadclothes for khojee with that terrible remorse at her heart spared nothing from the costume of ceremony the green satin trousers should deal no more death and even the silver earrings the few trumpery silver bracelets parting from which would have been worse than death to the dead woman she replaced with facsimiles in german for silver could be purified by fire and the living had need of it while who knew whether the corpse could tell the difference not likely since god was good and therefore there was no need to be on ones guard against cheating in his paradise so in a way german was as good as silver there for poor khojees white soul arrived at right conclusions by curious methods she worked by them also and when that second dawn came it was a very tired old woman who crept to the string bed set against the door but she rose again early and telling noormahal that since there was now no one in the house but herself while marketings were going on she had better keep the inner door closed went off to the bazaar she limped more than ever because of her tiredness yet she sped through the streets quicker than usual since for the first time in her life she went with her face uncovered there was a breathlessness in that old face and the old hands that held the knotted corner of her veil wherein she had tied every available morsel of silver every scrap of gold lace or ornament for which even a farthing could be got were clasped on each other with almost painful tension lo brother she said mildly to the goldsmith what matters a ruthi or two weigh it quick and give what is just what is just that is all i ask it was not much that bare justice but it was something and there was still a rupee or two over from the essence of happiness from the unavoidable expenses of that secret burial so she passed hurriedly to a grainmerchants shop here she felt lost for a moment lost in the magnitude of what she needed to one whose purchases for many years had been a bare days supply it is for a wedding likely asked the graindealer curiously likely she echoed softly her very brain felt tired and it seemed to her confusedly as if after all it might be a wedding the lordsahib might send help noormahal might be saved jehan might come back to her all things were possible to patience and she khojee was patient enough surely thou must send it in an hours time she said to the corndealer her head being still clear enough for that one single purpose of hers then i shall be back and look you i have paid coolie hire there must be no asking for more that was a necessary warning since when she reached home every farthing would have been spent all but one was spent when she paused beside the public scribe who had set up his desk at a corner where two bazaars met is it a letter mother he asked of the old woman who put out a hand against the wooden pillar of the neighbouring shop as if for support to the housemaster likely she shook her head this time nay meean there is no housemaster she said softly as before and it is not even a letter but a piceworth of words on a scrap of paper listen there is food enough tarry the lords coming without fear or noise i have locked the door canst do that for a pice meean and write clear tis for a womans eyes as she repeated the message swaying to and fro as if she were reciting the koran the scribe smiled at a bystander and touched his forehead significantly if beauty lie behind the door the locking of it is a piceworth in itself he said with a grin and i give the rest if beauty lay behind it she thought as she went on with the paper folded in her hands yes it was beauty for the safety of which her ugliness was responsible had she done all had she forgotten nothing nothing that would ensure noormahal from intrusion until she khojee the plaguestricken had died in the streets for that was her plan when death came close as it surely must come soon as it had done to khojee she would unbolt the doors and wander awaylike a tailorbird luring a snake from its nestinto the outskirts of the city right away from the old house and then what stranger was to know that khadjee had died of plague and was buried by the naubut khana stairs when death came close but not till then surely there was no need till then to face the worldsurely she might claim that much and when she was dead no one would know the lame old woman was khojeeya khanum daughter of kings not even lateefa the thought of him brought her a sudden fear he was the only one who having the right to claim it might by chance seek entrance to the courtyard in the next day or two she might on her way home see him or leave a message to reassure him at the house next dilarams whither she had fled with the news of sobrais escape there was no one in the house no one in the little yard behind it but lateefa had been there not long ago for the clippings of his trade littered one corner and two draggled kites their strings still fastened to wooden pegs in the wall lay huddled in another dilaram might know a message might be left with her as khojee stumbled up the dark stairs to a balcony for the first time in her life she tried to straighten her veil but her hands trembled it would not fold decorously there were three or four drowsy women lounging in the room at the door of which she stood beset by a sudden shyness and three of them tittered at the unusual sight but the fourth said severely what dost here sister this is no place for thy sort ii seek lateefa she faltered and the others tittered louder peace fools said dilaram angrily dost mean lateefa the kitemaker but khojee had found her dignity yea lateef of the house of the nawab jehan aziz on whom be peace tell him courtesan that khojeeya khanum she paused doubtful of her message and in the pause the jingles on dilarams feet clashed once more as she rose to do honour to a different life let the bibi sahiba speak she said in her most mellifluous tones we in the freedom of vice are slaves to the prisoners of virtue tell him said khojeeya khanum that it is well with the prison and the prisoners that they need no service as she stumbled down the stairs again there was no sound of tittering it was nearly an hour after this and the noonday sun was flooding the courtyards when khojee having completed her preparations closed the door between them softly so as not to disturb noormahalwho had already retired for the usual midday sleepand slipped a paper through the chink of the lintel ere drawing it close and padlocking the hasp noormahal could not fail to see the reassuring message there when she woke and began to wonder where auntie khojee had gone as she straightened herself from stooping to the padlock she felt giddily that she had locked herself out of life she had but a few hours left of seclusion and thenthe streets but those few hours she might surely claim so she closed and barred the wicket in the outer door and dragging a string bed into the scant shade cast by the naubut khana found rest for her aching limbs and there she lay silent taking no heed of noormahals knockings and appeals which after a time rose cautiously when they ceased the old woman gave a sigh of relief thus far all had gone well now she had only to wait till she felt she dare wait no more so she lay watching the shadows of the brokentailed plaster peacocks of royalty above the gateway creep over the courtyard up the walls and disappear into thin air chapter xvii the pen and the sword jehan aziz was meanwhile repenting at leisure in oriental fashion that is he had succumbed to the perpetual temptation of a string bed set either in shade or sunshine to which it is always possible to retire without as it were quite throwing up the sponge an englishman who seeks his bed and turns his face to the wall gives himself away the native who does the same thing is not even committed to discouragement and jehan though he had a racking headache from an attempt to drown care in a debauch was not exactly discouraged his anger though impotent was too strong for that indeed his whole force of character lay in his fierce arrogance for he was neither clever nor cunning like burkut ali and so when the day after the disappearance of the ring the latter walked coolly in as if nothing had happened and sat down on the end of the string bed jehan only sat up at the other end and glowered at the man without whom he knew himself to be lost thou hadst best tell the truth lord of the universe said burkut with a fine sarcasm for i have heard many lies from the police my head whirls with women and pearls and god knows what is there so much as foothold anywhere whence we may deal a blow jehan felt comforted by that plural though it roused curiosity to know what burkut would be at in truth the latters first desire for vengeance on jehan only had shifted as he had listened to the tales he bribed the police to tell here it had seemed to him was the possibility of greater mischief mischief which it was true could have no immediate or definite object but which would add something fresh to that rock of offence that stumblingblock in the way of the alien master on which it was the duty of the disloyal to cast every stone they could it took five cigarettes and two whiskypegs sent for from the liquorshop next door ere jehanin the absolute undress which seems to afford comfort to all indians in time of troublehad finished his tale there is much in it remarked burkut slowly as for the ring lateef hath it there is none else and he is a friend of thy house he worked there is it not so bethink thee is there no woman in it who hath a hold on him jehan frowned horribly at the indecent suggestion but even this insult he felt had to be faced none he said shortly unless the jade who escaped burkut grinned cunningly and shook his head my lord doth not understand women lateef hath kept the ring for the honour not the dishonour of the house it will go back if it hath not already gone to the safe keeping which hath secured it all these years jehan winced again under the innuendo think you it is there already it will be if we give him time replied burkut and all the more surely if we say it is there already that is simple since nushapore knows that the guardianship of the signet was not with my lord always it is but to withdraw the charge of theft saying that we have found the ring returned to its rightful owner the nawabin this time jehan ground his teeth he felt his impotence even against this man horribly and then he asked sullenly and then we shall be free to watch lateefa we can give him time to go to his hidingplace and then we can search himand thy house but without the police we must have no more of their methods it hath cost me somewhat to get beyond them now which sum shall be as a debt between thee and mebut there must be no more of it but the pearls replied jehan uneasily the pearls and that jade sobrai whom god curse burkut gave a sudden blink of his long eyes say rather may god curse those who led virtue astray tis a tale my lord to dissolve heart and liver kidnapped by order almost by force bribed to a sahibs pleasure by pearls by four pearls takenoh most horriblefrom a string which the head of her house had with tears sold to that same sahib sold in his honourable indigence which had not hesitated to wrench the last ornament from the necks of virtuous women in order to keep them virtuous he paused in his periods for breath wah said jehan stupidlyhis jaw had almost fallen in sheer surprisethat runs well but the proof burkut smiled a superior smile thy reluctance to allow publicity thy instant assertion that the pearls were thine lo is not the whole true save that lucanaster sahib gave the pearls to sobrai and that is for him to prove tie a lie to a truth and the two will sink or swim together is good wisdom but they must see the pearlsthey said so but yesterday the magistrate sahib go to him and make thy confession say that there was but this untruth the pearls were not they had been thine say that even now if thou canst but get the girl back in secret in secret echoed jehan fiercely when already the police burkut lost patience then fool canst not thou see that in that lies the gain thou canst stand aloof but the helldoomed must answer and not the one but all lo it is a tale for the bazaars for the newspapers and tis not as if thou couldst keep it secret longer thou canst not therefore use it against those whose fault it is that thou canst not he paused suddenly folded his hands in the attitude of service and said reverently what orders hath the pillar of justice the mighty in power the disposer of slaves regarding a necklace of pearls and one sobrai begum a woman of his household the sarcasm bit deep and jehan aziz the rightful heir to such power swore this time horribly feeling as burkut intended that revenge was better than nothing and i will bring trouble to miss leezie also he began viciously when burkut cut him short that were unwise she stands too close to authority say it was dilaram dilaram wherefore put in jehan stupidly burkuts laugh was evil beyond words because they who touch her and hers rouse what they cannot still thou needst not say it for certain that is the best of liesthere is freedom for the tongue in them say it seems so and hearken govind the editor will pay for this news if thou canst get word by means of this money to sobrai herself it would be well she knows her fate if she comes back to thy house promise her escape if she will say it was lucanaster jehans pious wishes for the immediate destruction of all the unfaithful came almost cheerfully he felt infinitely relieved all round so far as the ring went he was inclined to believe that burkut was right it might even now be back in noormahals keeping but before making sure of that it would be as well to see what lateefa would do then as for the pearls he at least got some revenge and the beauty of it was that a solid substratum of truth sufficient to save him from trouble underlay all the lies the pearls were his he had sold them to lucanaster sahib sobrais four did belong to that string she had been beguiled into the cantonments it was only that a different complexion had been put upon the facts a complexion which might almost be the right one since who was to know why sobrai once more the irrational uncontrollable animal jealousy of the thought seized on him and he felt a fierce joy in knowing that the story was one to rouse a similar feeling in many minds and wherefore not were not similar stories true were they not to be heard every day were not tales of the libertinism tyranny and corruption of the sahibs to be read in every line of the newspapers and none contradicted them therefore they could not be contradicted so if this tale were not all true a faint scruple that was as much an inheritance as jehans passion for power lingered in spite of his desire for revenge there were plenty of others far worse that could be proved up to the hilt thus once more that commonest of all indian conjuring tricks the making of one lie out of two or more truths started on its evil errand yet not a mile away from its startingplace rose the government college the courts of justice the secretariat the revenue offices all the plant the stock and lock and block of an administration which take it as you will is the only one india has ever had which has allowed even a whisper to be raised against it without condign punishment at that very moment sir george arbuthnot in his private office was reading an article from the days issue of the voice of india that had been brought over amongst the usual selections from the native newspapers which are submitted by the press censor is it too late he read ere the great crisis comes upon us which may mean so much to the poorest of the poor the richest of the rich to implore the government to think ere it inflicts on the helpless the horrible and needless tortures which there is too much reason to fear have been inflicted on our fellowcountrymen in other parts of unhappy india may we not once more venture to plead with the authorities for our poor townsfolk and point out to them that these weaker brethren have beliefs which they would rather die than deny the sacredness of the cow for instance must and does seem silly foolish to those who eat beef every day but to our people it is a dogma to yield one tittle of it is eternal damnation so with the sacredness of their women this thesis may not be held by our rulers we know that it is not those of us who have seen london do not need to be told this and even a visit to cantonments shows us a different standard tales that are harrowing to the fathers and husbands of india may be food for laughter elsewhere therefore is it that at this crisis we venture to implore the great english government to remember that to us such things are all important that we cannot we dare not away with them the late generous announcement of sir george arbuthnot our popular lieutenantgovernor to the effect that no coercion will be used at the outset has greatly soothed the natural alarm of all raised by general and credible belief in a plan of campaign similar to those approved by authorities in all other parts of india for which diplomatic utterance we poor folk are grateful and which emboldens us to ask the following pertinent questions would it not be possible by treating ignorant poor folk with kindness and consideration to allay their natural fears would it not be well to issue stringent rules that no woman shall be examined for plague even by british soldiers and that brahmins cows and family idols be not wilfully illtreated though it is to be feared alas that jackinoffices must perforce exhibit greed and covetousness should not some supervision be exercised to prevent unnecessary removal of valuables et hoc genus omne from plaguestricken houses finally is it not possible even at this late hour when plague overshadows us with horrible mantles of dread there are persistent rumours of three cases in muhalla kuzai that the cooperation and advice of educated natives be invited as to means of avoiding friction comparisons are invidious but it is not too much to say that messrs bholanath you can leave off there sir said the assistantsecretary it is up one side of shark lane and down the other sir george turned over the slip to the next with elaborate patience it is ingeniously suggestive he remarked by the way have we succeeded in getting any more volunteers for search parties two sir but they are both retired native officers and as that would make all but five military the commissioner thought then we want twenty more send a reminder to shark lane and about the destruction of infected clothes there is only one thing for it sir as we agreed before replied the chief of the police we must have an englishman with each search party its absurd to expect constables on five rupees a month to keep their hands from picking and stealing that fact must be faced we do our best but our department which is the most difficult to deal with is the worst paid thats a nasty story said sir george suddenly he had been glancing through another excerpt hm the ear of the wise editor govinda ram he has the best nose anyhow for unmitigated filth in india remarked the assistantsecretary but of course one cant notice that sort of thing here he shrugged his shoulders the chief of the police who was an old military man squared his there i totally disagree as his honour knows that paper has a greater effect in nushapore than all those highfalutin prints put together and thats all my business id have him up on every slander in the criminal courts you wouldnt allow that sort of thing about the masters to be circulated in a school and the more we remember that our position in india is virtually that of a schoolmaster or if you like it better trustee to a minority the better it will be for that minority bravo grey said sir george with a smile you stick to your colours and a good many of us agree only the people at home wont have it they cant grasp the situation they would as soon believe it to be a grave political danger if the little street boys hung garlands round guy fawkes instead of burning him now about the plague itself is it on us doctor yes sir replied a small man who had just been shown in we have just inspected all the native charitable dispensaries they have no proper records of course and they deny increased attendance but they are almost out of drugs then there are three undoubted cases in the butchers quarter but the fishiest part of the city is all about the garden gate those tall old housesthere has been a lot of deaths poor highclass mohammedans remarked the assistantsecretary significantly rather bad luck sir george rose and put away his papers then we had better start i think everything is settled the great point is to keepto keep normal as long as possible as he quitted the room the men left in it looked at each other right so far but after said one telegraph home for orders what else can you do nowadays do id show them if i had a free hand id settle this lot the chief of the police slapped his confidential file viciously as he pocketed it id limit their circulation by a little wholesome bloodletting not worth it theyre like the fifty thousand irish patriots what patriots asked the chief snappishly he hailed from across st georges channel himself and was a trifle touchy on the point of his countrymens disloyalty the fifty thousand irish patriots whom the orator said were armed to the teeth ready to strike a blow for liberty then why the devil dont they strike it asked one of the audience bedad the polis wont let them hm the polis wouldnt if id my way muttered the old soldier sir george meanwhile had gone straight to his wifes sittingroom for he was already due at his daily reception of native visitors and he had something he wished to tell her scrupulously particular as he was about the absolutely english ordering of his homelife there was something fantasticeven to himtoday in the sight of grace in a low rockingchair reading hans andersen to jerry in a room as dainty and sweet with english flowers as any in an english countryhouse what possible right had this to be here cheek by jowl with the city and between them nothing but shark lane well george she asked almost nervously for despite the days that had passed her fear lest that unlucky letter should turn up to give the lie to her husbands protestations on the part of the government lingered with her only those two ladies my dear he answered with a certain meritorious air to which he had a perfect right for he was almost worked off his legs and might very excusably have forgotten all about poor khojees appeal dawkins inquired they belong to jehan azizs pensioners but there is a discrepancy he says they are young and flighty girls so he is obliged to keep them tight my dear george she was as old as old she need not have been one of the real petitioners my dear in fact seeing that they are strictly secluded i doubt if she could be it is quite easy to personate when no one has any means of knowing and quite easy to say people are young and flighty when they are not if they cant be seen how are we to find out sir george looked thoughtful im afraid we must take the nawabs word or with his approval we might appoint some one who would agree with him interrupted grace impatiently ill tell you what ill do ill go myself his house is somewhere by the garden gate isnt it surely george there can be no objection to that she added noting his look he paused a moment then said gravely only one and that is that we must have as little communication with the city as possible for some time to come grace yes he continued as she looked at him startled it is on us but there is no need of course to worry for the next few days at any rate she rose and stood looking out of the window thoughtfully you never can tell she said father used always to say so to his young officers remember that in india you cannot tell what the next day may bring forth used he to say that to mr raymond if a bombshell had fallen between those two it could scarcely have startled them both more george exclaimed lady arbuthnot reproachfully i beg your pardon my dear he said going up to her with the quaintest look of elated affection as if he were rather proud of himself i dont know why the deuce i said thatexcept thatwell that the best of us cant quite forgeti dont believe you dowe are all a bit fundamental however what i mean is that times have changed since your fathers day and yet you say every one is fundamental she interrupted in a voice that held both tears and laughter tenderness and a faint resentment and that is so truewe go back and back then i shall go back too he replied cheerfully only i must give the new diplomacy a chance besideshere an obstinate look crept over his faceas a matter of fact i have to obey orders like every one else and my orders are clear thanksi dont mean it nastilyto you and your father in fact im very much obliged to you it relieves me of a lot of responsibility all the same i can assure that there is not the very faintest chance of difficulty for the next week at any rate there cannot befor the simple reason that we are not going to offend any ones prejudices for instance no search for plague patients will be made for the present except by special request of the natives themselves so i really cannot see is it likely we could asked grace quickly when we cannot see if a woman is young or oldwhen we have to trust interested people for information george i often wonder you men have the courage to rule india when you know nothing of its women except that there has been one at the bottom of every trouble you have ever had sir george smiled indulgently well my dear i hope they will keep their fingers out of this pie it was rather a vain hope considering that at that very moment govind rams fingers were all black with lithographic ink and that the first edition of his broadsheet was being hawked through the bazaars there was quite a crowd round dilarams balcony where in full dress she sat defiant yet sullen now refusing to say a word now letting herself loose in shrill abuse with disconcerting candour she find recruits for such as miss leezie not she though had she chosen she might here had followed tales halftrue half false that were listened to not with eagerness or anger but with the calm assent which is so much more dangerous since it passes on to tell the tale with additions in the next street by evening it was all over the city that dilaram and her like were to be put in gaol for refusing to kidnap girls for the sirkar and that the sirkar in consequence being hard put to it would be sure to make the plaguewhich the doctors had discovered that very day though god knows folk had been dying that way for a weekan excuse to search respectable houses for recruits to miss leezies profession such a thing may seem impossible to those who have not lived in a native town but those who have know that nothing is incredible to its vast curiosity its still more vast ignorance in the dead darkness of that as in the darkness of night all voices are equal and so round the smouldering rubbishheaps and within the closed doors of the courtyards where the women gathered as in the bazaar the tale was told not with absolute assurance but tentatively so folk said and so no doubt it had been in the past it remained to be seen if it would be so in the present since that was all poor folk had to consider and as the tale was told a sound of sudden wailing would rise far or near in the city to prove part of the tale was true the plague had come chapter xviii the freedom of death jehan aziz had withdrawn his charge of theft against lateefa by saying that the whole affair was a misunderstanding and that the ring was in the possession of the nawabin to whom it really belonged it had been returned to her without his knowledge etcetera etcetera etcetera now a monopoly in lies gives freedom but when you have an accomplice whose fertility of imagination exceeds your own there is tyranny in them jehan found this out when lateefa after one silent second of surprise had grasped the position and instantly claimed his right to lie also for in india false accusation is a sort of personal duel in which the challenger having chosen his weapon cannot complain of his opponents more skilful use of it so lateefa had launched into corroborative evidence of the most startling description did not the nawabsahib remember this and that and jehan had remembered what else could he do but he felt it was dangerous work and was glad when lateefas audience was confined to the coachman who drove them back to the city in the wagonette lined with red flannel and tied up with string yet all the time that he was enlarging lateefa was wondering if there was any truth whatever in the story he had been confirming had the ring really been found the fact that burkut ali was waiting to receive them in the little house next dilarams inclined him to believe it was not and that there was still some scheming afoot but on the other hand the ring might really be lost the kite might have fluttered down in the next courtyard or the next it was a pure chance his first glance into the little backyard however showed him that the chance had been in his favour he had the eyes of a hawk and even from a distance could see not only that those were the kites crumpled in one corner but that the precious morsel of ballast was still in its place and this knowledge gave him instantly an enormous advantage over the two plotters to whom it was of course inconceivable that he should already know for a certainty that the ring had not been found so when in the most natural manner in the world they congratulated each other on his being freed from a false accusation in time to allow of his making kites for the annual competition amongst the immediate members of the royal family for what was called the sovereignty of air he assented cheerfully and waited for them to go further which they did by saying that as it was most important to have the best of kites he had better go back to the old workshop since the courtyard here was too narrow and sunless to dry the paste and paper quick enough indeed the last kites he had made there had flown askew here lateefa crossed to the battered ones in the corner and shook his head over them solemnly it was true he said such kites would ill carry the honour of kings yet since he had none too much leisureif the trial was to be in two days timehe would waste no good daylight in moving tools that could be done at any hour and leave him halfadays work here on which jehan and burkut winked at each other thinking it evident that he was falling into the trap and was manoeuvring for an opportunity of getting at his hidingplace so they gave it to him discreetly by playing cards meanwhile on the string bed set this time within the room across the doorway thus combining complete isolation with comparative freedom whereat lateefa smiled to himself it was quite a happy little family party and lateefa sang as usual of oughts and naughts as he worked sang all the more cheerfully when those two began to yawn he kept them at the yawning out of pure mischief until it was almost dark then he piled the kites he had made in the corner tied his tools into a bundle and asked the cardplayers politely to let him pass whereupon as he knew they would they closed the door and stripped him he did not expostulate he seemed to think it quite right that they should thus prove the truth of their own words he had not he confessed been sure before of the assertion that the ring was in the nawabins possession he had thought that perhaps the lightoftheuniverse had retained it himself now it was evident that he had not and then refusing to resume any clothing except a mere waistcloth of decency or to take his tools or anything which might cause suspicion to go with him he went out into the bazaars leaving those two cursing and swearing and wondering if by chance they had hit on the right lie had the ring really found its way to the ruined palace which was the only other relic of kingship remaining to the rightful heir of all and even that possession was burdened by conditions it is impossible to overestimate what the loss of absolute power means to men like jehan aziz who have nothing to take its place as a rule when their personal interests do not clash with their environments they only grin horribly and contrive to bear the loss but when as jehan aziz did they feel enmeshed in a network of petty limitations their impotent arrogance finds the position intolerable as he flung himself angrily once more on the eternal string bed he felt that the only thing which would satisfy him was the grip upon his finger of a gold circlet set with a green stone on which was scratched the kingly legend and despite burkuts help he had failed to get it as yet meanwhile lateefa naked as he was bornsave for his rag of decency and an embroidered skullcap of inexpressibly filthy white muslin set on the oily grizzled hair that hung in an inward curve about his earswas at large in the gutters and lanes feeling the freedom of a bird newly escaped from a cage his last sense of allegiance to the nawab had gone he had not yet attached himself to the nawabin he did not really care much as to the fate of the ring it had been more a desire to outmatch their cunning than any hope of keeping his promise to khojee that had made him transfer the precious ballastas he had done in the leisure afforded him by that discreet game of cardsfrom the old kite to a new one and leave it in the pile it was a trifle safer there but on the other hand any one might find it at any time if so it would be the fault of fate not lateefas as it would have been had he been foolish enough to try and take the ring or even the kites with him that would have been fatal so as with a twopennyhalfpenny wisp of a muslin scarf he borrowed from a friend superadded to his costumeor the lack of itand a certain soft brilliance of opium in his eyes the kitemaker lounged about in the more disreputable quarters of the town listening to tales and telling them with equal indifference he was in a way the spirit of an indian bazaar incarnate truth had gone from him utterly in its place had come an impersonal appreciation of the value of vice or virtue as a mere ingredient of anecdote and an absolute lack of responsibility for the result of his admixture of good and evil therefore as he sat crouched up in the corner of a frail ladys reception room fingering a lute which he had found there and trilling softly of oughts and naughts while she retailed the latest lies to the shifting audience which came and went up and down the steep muskscented stairs he was at once a thing dreadful a thing pathetic for his keen face seen by the smoking oil lamps set high in a brass trefoil before the mistress of the house was alight with a sensuous spirituality and his lean figure so listless in its lounge was instinct with that power of energy of spring that shows even in a sleeping tiger lo thou in the corner came the narrators voice hold thy peace what are thy oughts and naughts to us of the bazaar take them to thy virtuous beauties who leave messages for thee at dilaramsat dilarams forsooth an odd postarffis for virtue and so my masters she went on the daghdarsthere were five of themcarried the woman off by force and lateefa was not one of the breathless listeners he was winking elaborately at the buxom assistant who was handing round the sherbets and asking irresponsibly didst leave a message for me at dilarams beloved not i fool she giggled thou must be drunk indeed to think virtue fits me yet it is true one such did come when i was at dilarams with her she nodded to the speakerwho having reached her climax was becoming dramatic the light before her making her face all eyes and lipsan old bodyout on thee for thy bad taste lateef and she says says she tell lateef of the house of the nawab that it is well with us in the prisonthat we want no service see you friends not even his nay take it not to heart beloved there be others less unkind but lateefa had risen with a sudden sense of something beyond his present freedom that freedom from truth clothes kitemaking above all things from the methods of the police and that something was auntie khojee for the messenger he felt could have been no one else why had she come to say it was well with her had they made her do so and if so what had they been doing to those helpless women what they could have done had they dared lateefa knew only too well and his brain was too confused to remember that had they dared they would scarcely have bidden him go back to his workshop in the old palace his feet were as confused as his brain but in or out of the gutter they steered him pretty straight for the big ironstudded door with the little wicket in it beneath the naubat khana khojee he called cautiously rattling at the wicket for it was barred as usual at night there was no answer he raised his voiceauntie khojee it is lateef rise sister and let me in she ought to have heard that for he knew her to be a light sleeper he paused doubtfully was she simply asleep or had those two been at work then it occurred to him that he had been a fool not to ask the sherbethander when the message had been left at dilarams it might have been that very day in which case he could afford to postpone his inquiries till the morrow he must find out that was the first thing to be done late as it was growing there was no slackening as yet in the tide of life ebbing and flowing through the bazaars when he returned to them everybody in the city seemed astir and he hastily turned his face to the lampsprinkled caverns of the arcaded shops as he saw burkut ali and jehan aziz coming towards him in the crowd they passed him talking together in low tones and he looked after them doubtfully were they simply promenading as half the town seemed to be doing or their sudden turn down a bylane decided him he followed cautiously alike though the bazaars and the byways of a native city are in form the change of atmosphere between them is striking beyond words so here within a whisper of unceasing talk and movement lateefa found all silent deserted lightless too except when a farthing rushlight at a niched shrine where two lanes crossed shone on the black slime in the gutters as if it had been ink and showed the glistening black streaks upon the windowless walls down which the sewage from the upper stories of the tall houses trickled to the sewage below here and there a dog slunk in the shadows here and there a woman crept furtively from doorway to doorway and overhead with a fathomless depth of purple in which the stars seemed trivial bits of tinsel a notched ribbon of sky showed between the turreted roofs a garland of marigoldssending their curious odour into the general compound of smells as they hung over a closed doorand a muffled sound of womens laughter told of a marriage within a knifestill swinging from the touch of the last visitorand a louder shrill of voices drowning a womans cries told of birth and that faint whimperpractised conventionalmeant death all three within closed doors and now from the vantageground of the last turn lateefa waited and watched those two go on had they been there before had they the means of entry no the rattle of the wicket sounded loudly then the voice of authorityopen open to the master open to the nawab even to that there was no answer and as the two looked at each other jehans face was fierce with rage tis as thou saidst when dilaram spoke of the message he muttered savagely they are in league lateef is here and means to defy us then he raised his voice and called again open open to the possessor open to the master a door or two down the alley creaked ajar showing dim whitesheeted figures of wonder for that was not a call to be ignored lateefa from his corner wondered still more what could have happened something evidently about which those two knew nothing a man who had pushed past the dim shadows into the lane started the question as to when the door had last been seen open whereat voices came from the dim shadows in answer one had not seen it so these three days others had noticed khojees limp that morning the voices grew contentious over the point so that nawab jehan aziz growled a curse under his breath and turned away savagely come burkut he said did i not tell thee they could not have arrived by now the paper at the estation says the mail is changetime let me pass good folk he went on irritably to the little group that hung round curious can a body not come to see if his family be returned from a journey without the neighbours crowding out the remark was plausible explanation enough but as the two passed lateefa in the dark jehan could be heard girding at burkut why had he suggested coming on the sly it would be all over the town how that jehans women had refused him entrance he burkut would be suggesting the police next not the police my lord came burkuts suave cunning voice there be better ways of gaining entry than that nowadays when they had gone and the lanewith clucks of incredulity and remarks that it was time some folk refused to be treated scandalouslyhad settled behind closed doors again lateefa stole back to the wicket once more he had the advantage he knew that it was no obstinacy induced by his presence which kept the inmates silent and jehan had made noise enough to wake the dead the dead but they could not all be dead a vast curiosity more than any apprehension made lateefa look up to the balcony of the naubat khana and wonder if he could climb to it once there the shutters he knew were rotten it seemed possibleif a foothold or two were picked out of the crumbling brick and a rope hitched on to an iron hook he knew of some ten feet up the wall in fact given a quiet hour or so he would undertake to make a felonious entry somehow but it was too early in the night to try the time for such work came with the false dawn when sleep simulated death and that washow many hours away he did not know or care in that strange life of the bazaars night was as day no question of bedtime entered into it so sooner or later he would see that the hour he waited for had come by the look on those ribbons of sky between the closepacked houses that network of sky following the pattern of the network of streets and alleys which was all that thousands in the city knew of the heaven above it the bazaars were scarcely more empty when once again he returned to them but they were less noisy many voices had dwindled to one voice the voice of the taleteller therefore the voice of the most imaginative mind in the assemblage lateefa listened here listened there curious indifferent receptive approvingas the east always approvesthe voice with authority that speaks not as the scribes he wandered here he wandered there even with that absorbing inquisitiveness of his into the courtyard common to dilaram and her neighbours her balcony was dark and silent the police he told himself had likely been bothering her but the light and the sound of a crank in govinds room meant a special edition of lies then with his ear to the chink of the door below he could hear burkut alis voice then jehanslouder shrill with protest or anger they were quarrelling likely over drink or cards yet burkut was sober enough whenbarely giving time for lateefa to find shelter behind the eternal stringbed which was now reared up against the wallhe came out into the yard fool he muttered as he passed not to see his own good as if it mattered he would get house and all mayhap he will be drunk enough by morning what new villainy was he planning lateefa pondered over the question as he drifted on the time of felonies was near for the dogs were forgetting to skulk a sign that men were fewer in the lanes and streets here and there round an ebbing flicker of light listeners lingered and a drowsy voice droned on but for the most part the cavernous arcades showed still whiteswathed sleepers simulating death this however coming swiftly down the bazaara strange swaying headless body with many legs monstrous weird halfseenwas death itself being shuffled out secretly to the city gates folks said true then the plague was abroad he had found himself what he needed for his taska bit of old iron a bit of leathern rope but when he reached the wicket his first stealthy touch on it showed him he needed neither it was ajar he pushed it open noiselessly and entered groping his way since it was dark in the archway below the naubut khana beyond in the open court it was lighter yet even so he stumbled over a bed set right in the entrance as watchmen set them there was no one in it but the quilt was warm so some one had been there a moment ago some one who had gone out by the open door and who would therefore return he crouched in a recess by the stairs that led upwards and waited he had not to wait long a shuffling step sounded outside and after a pause to bar the wicket some one stumbled to the bed and then out of the darkness came a quavering grace before meat that grace which is also the prayer of bloodsacrifice in the name of the merciful and clement god it had not needed the grace to tell lateefa that this was aunt khojee she must have gone out to draw water from the well down the lane for the grace was followed by the sound of rapid thirsty drinking but why had she not drawn water as usual from the well in the womens courtyard he must find out god quench thy thirst sister he said piously then added fear not it is i lateef for she had given a startled cry and let fall the watervessel which bottom upwards gave out a glug glug as the liquid escaped from its narrow neck that was louder than her feeble attempt at sobbing as she crouched up on the bed rocking to and fro it was all her fault she was very wicked she moaned she had tried to go into the streets she had tried to feel as if she were going to die but she could not and then the thirst had been so dreadful but she had only opened the door for a little moment who would have thought of any one stepping in and now he must go away or she would kill him too why did he not go when it was the plague he would surely die and she did not want to kill any one else lateefa could make out enough of her ramblings for comprehension but he did not therefore flinch from the huddledup figure which was now faintly visible in the grey beginnings of dawn the fear of death is not easily learned in the bazaars where so long as it comes naturally it scarcely excites comment nevertheless he cleared his throat and spat as janalishan had done in the garden for that propitiatory offering to the dread destroyer is common to all races all over the world thou wouldst kill no more he echoed his curiosity aroused who hast killed already the nawabin or khadjee or both so once more even there he sat listening listening listening while khojee rambled through her tale of the green satin trousers and her plan to save the nawabin from being dragged away and poisoned which had been frustrated by thirst but who could have expected to want either food or drink lateefa gave a sudden laugh lo brave one he said stooping to pick up the fallen watervessel and when thou hadst got the drink thou didst spill it from sheer fright of a familiar voice of a truth sister women are made in bits like a conjurers puzzle it needs a mans wit to piece them together now think not khojee he continued warningly to shut me out whilst i get thee water if thou dost i swear by my kites i will go tell the daghdars at the horspital to come and poison noormahal the fantasy of his own threat amused him yet it roused a sudden remembrance that others might at least tell the doctors especially if after the scene of last night the door remained shut the neighbours in that case would begin to talk and then he recollected burkut alis words and wondered if the latter could possibly have been contemplating so vile a plan as giving false information the nawab himself would not consent it was infamy but if the nawab was drunk the thought was disturbing so after khojee refreshed by the water had apparently sunk into a profound sleep he went outside and sitting on the doorlintel prepared replies to the questionings which should surely come when folk began to go backwards and forwards to the well he prepared also for the interview with the nawabin which he meant to have by and by he meant to tell her about the ring as an inducement to commonsense the commonsense of escaping while she could from evil to come as he sat answering questions and passing the time of day jauntily he heard a faint knocking from within a lowvoiced khojee khojee art returned yet the nawabin was therefore well so if khojee woke the better for her sleep the whole affair might be simple the sun rose and so did lateefas spirits he joked and laughed with the veiled servingwomen he played with the children when they began to drift out to the gutters he even cast a gay remark or two into the air for the women who stood on the roofs gossiping soon they would be going down into the courtyards the doors would be closed and his opportunity for arguing the matter out with two foolish creatures would come then suddenly the children stopped playing the women scuttled to shelter and lateefa rose with an awful malediction in his heart two englishmen had come round the corner and behind them was burkut ali then he had done it done this infamous thing it is a nuisance coming at the very beginning the english doctor was saying but i cant help myself and one can only hope it will give the lot a wholesome fright his companion shook his head doubt it and to tell the truth i dont understand this request there is hankypanky i feel sure the speaker was jack raymond by pure chance he had passed the hospital on his morning ride just as the doctor was going out on this his first search and remembering the scene in the kings pleasuregrounds the latter had asked him to run his eye over the written request for inspection so as to make sure there was no nonsense thus the names of khojeeya and khadeeja had come to remind him of the silk bracelet at that moment reposing with some banknotes in his pocket it was not in jack raymond to refuse such a lead over he had felt it is true a trifle impatient at the necessity for accepting it but even that feeling had vanished when burkut ali who met them where the lane turned off from the bazaar apologised for the nawabs absence the latter was too much overcome he said by the sacrifice of dignity required in thus proving his devotion to the sirkar in setting such a good example to others to attend in person hankypanky jack raymond had murmured under his breath with a thanksgiving that he was there to prevent more villainy than could be helped lateefa too seeing rahmansahib who was known to all attendants at the racecourse was glad of his presence also but for a curiously different reason he was glad because rahmansahib was by repute not only a real sahib but by repute also he understood what people said thoroughly and was therefore amenable to deceptionthat is to words generally true or false whereas wit was of no use with most englishmen jack raymonds first remark too was reassuring since it betrayed suspicion of burkut alis good faith the door is not closed against entrance he said sharply why was it said to be so burkut who had brought a most venerablelooking villain of the royal house to back him up appealed to the neighbours who already had crowded out to join the rabble which the efforts of a couple of constables had not succeeded in keeping back were they not witness he asked that last night it doesnt matter raymond said the doctor aside ive got to get through with it now and the quicker the better so id rather have an open door than a shut one he slipped through the wicket as he spoke and an odd murmur half of horror half satisfied curiosity ran round the spectators it was true then the sirkar did do such things there is no need for those two to come in it isnt their house objected jack raymond as burkut and the venerable villain prepared to follow stand back sahiban he added in hindustani and sergeant when the conservancy sweepers are through close the wicket this is not a public spectacle true yet in a way the remark and action spoken and done with the best intention the kindest consideration were a mistake they left a crowd with nothing for its amusement but khojees screams of sheer terror as she woke to find the doctor feeling her pulse they were heartrending dangerous screams and jack raymond recognising this and also the fact that the old lady was his petitioner of the garden supplemented the doctors commonplace have no fear mother with something more ornate in persian which changed the screams to piteous cries of poison me not i will die yea i will die without poison and this being almost worse he tried the effect of showing her the ram rucki and asking if a braceletbrother was likely to do her any injury finally as she only seemed to grasp his meaning vaguely he fastened the silken cord on her wrist its touch was magical she clutched at the hand that had put it on and the cries died down to a whimper lo my brother lo my brother my brother tell them i can die let them give me time and i will die yea with time i can die as well as with poison it was impossible to avoid a smile the doctor indeed laughed cheerily no doubt about that mother he said to her in a relieved tone of voice but not just yet you havent got the plague and you havent it either he continued turning to lateefa that is two of youone woman and a servant now if you can show me the other two inmates in like case i can give a clean bill so where are they in here i suppose he passed towards the inner door but lateefa was there before him sharp as a needle the doctors words had made him see that noormahal alone would be no good there must be two women or the tragedy of the green satin trousers would be as surely discovered as if poor khadjee had not been buried and that would mean a segregation camp at best for all three of them it might be impossible to hoodwink the sahibs but he could try so he appealed volubly to jack raymond this was infamy as the huzoor knew to secluded dames it had to be of course but let it be done in the easiest way let the sick womanshe was none so ill but that she could do so much for humanitys sakego in first and tell of the huzoors kindness of how he was a braceletbrother lateefa had of course grasped this fact without in the least understanding how it had happened no doubt she would be able to persuade the secluded ones to come out for inspection and that would be less disgrace than the invasion by male things of their sacred isolation jack raymond watched the keen audacious face narrowly then once more he said aside to the doctor hankypanky that sick woman is as much secluded as the others but id let her go give them a free hand and they will be quieter if we find them out anything is better than hunting them down poor souls lateefa therefore much to his inward delightalso contemptwas allowed free instructions to aunt khojee while the searchparty stood aside we can t let em down easier can we said the doctor as he waited and jack raymond shook his head despondently no he answered but its a brutal business all the sameto their notions and you cant change them in a hurry meanwhile lateefas instructions ran in this fashion khojee was to tell noormahal that the big lordsahib had sent the braceletbrother to fetch her to a private interview that the state dhoolies were waiting that all was of the strictest ceremonial on that point she had a free hand she was to say anything which would induce the nawabin to come out and she herself was to change her dress swiftly and personate khadjee it was a chancethe huzoors might not think of seeing the three women together so with a parting admonition to be brave he pushed the tottering khojee through the inner door closed it and turned to the two englishmen appealingly the huzoors must give time for it is as death to noble ladies to see strangers but the old woman will tell them that the huzoors are as their fathers and mothers may god promote them to be lords hankypanky remarked jack raymond again but it cant do any harm no assented the doctor there was no one there to remind them that that is a formula which can never be safely used in india or to repeat as grace arbuthnot had repeated a lifelong experience embodied in the wordsyou can never tell they are a long time coming said the doctor aggrievedly he was up to his eyes in work and he had waited five minutes ten minutes patiently silently so had the crowd outside silently but impatiently huzoor protested lateefa from the door to noble ladies it is as death he broke off for a sudden shriek rose from within another another and above them a womans voice shrill awful in its intensity of scorn lies lies lies stand back fool thief liar and mixed with these words were others in agonised appealnay noormahal lateef help god and his prophet thou shalt not noormahal lateefa seemed paralyseduncertain what to do but jack raymond the doctor at his heels had the door open they were through it in a second his first glance within however made the former grip the latters arm with a grip of iron and whisper breathlessly keep still man its the only chance for in the centre of that inner courtyard standingarrested for a second by the opening of the dooron the parapet of the wide wall was a tall whiterobed figure its face distorted by passion its black eyes blazing lateef help moaned khojee who was clinging frantically uselessly to one corner of the lone white veil she is mad the ringi had to dressand she toofor the lordsahiband it was not there i told you how it would beit is the ring an awful laugh echoed through the courtyard yea the ring the ring repeated noormahal mockingly saaduts ringthe ring of kingship liar lo i could kill thee for the lie it is not therenoormahal mother of kings dost hear it is not thereit was not there when i went to find it there was selfpity amazement now in the voice which had begun so recklessly and jack raymondwatching the figure with every nerve and muscle tense for actionbreathed a quick breath of relief for selfpity meant almost the only hope of averting the mad leap there was so little chance of preventing but lateefas high voice followed sharply almost exultingly what then he cried when i have it safe yea mother of kings the ring is safe i swear it i have it yonder in the bazaarin the nawabs housei he paused compelled to silence by her face by the outstretched hand which falling from its appeal to high heaven pointed its finger at him accusingly dost hear him she asked mincingly and jack raymond instinctively moved a step nearer he the pandar hath the ring safe safe in the bazaar safe in the nawabs house safe for the nawabs bride look out shouted jack raymond dashing forward for he knew what that thought would bring but he was too late with one cry of liars one horrid laugh the slender white figure leaped into the air the veildetained uselessly in khojees helpless holdfalling from the small sleek head and the nawabin noormahal the lightofpalaces went down as she had stood mocking defiant into the depth of the well the last thing seen of her those wild appealing hands and outside the crowd was listening eager to find fault eager for a tragedy to tell in the bazaars chapter xix on the bed rock my dear chris if you insist on going to see your mother in that horrid filthy city where every one knows the plague has regularly begun said mrs chris davenant to her husband i wont stop in your house thats an end of it i dont see why i should of course if it was your duty to inspect and that sort of thing id have to grin and bear it but it isnt so you cant expect me to run the risk it is my duty to see my mother replied chris with that faint pomp which is inseparable in the native from a virtuous sentiment be it ever so trite she laughed quite goodnaturedly the fact is chris youve an awkward team of duties to drive but a mans got to leave his father and mother you know not that i want you to leave yours go to her by all means if you want to but in that case i shall go where i want and where is that he asked almost fiercely she laughed again to the hotel of course my dear chris i am not a fool not as a rule i mean though i was one of course when i married you but you were a greater fool in marrying me for you knew you were a bit of a prig and i didnt however lets drop that though as ive told you before the best thing for you to do would be to let me slide and marry your cousin will you hold your tongue he burst out almost as an englishman might have done and she raised her eyebrows and nodded approvingly bravo chris that was very nearly rightbut as you dont favour that easy solution you must stick to me you cant eat your cake and have it my dear boy if you marry a civilised woman you must behave as sich and civilised people dont run the risk of infection needlessly they dont go and see their relations if though of course no civilised persons mother would live in a dirty plaguestricken town by choice would she poor chris if he had not been so civilised himself if he had not been such a good sort he could have faced the position better but he saw the justice of hers i think if she were sickhe began she gave a little scream sick my dear chris that settles it i cant have you bringing back microbes itit isnt fair on us you know and there are a lot of jolly globetrotters at the hotelone of them says he knew me in london there was a world of regret in her tone and the pity of it the hideous mistake for her came home to chris there is no reason he said in a sort of despair why i should turn you out of thishere he gave a hard sort of laughi dont really care for it you know viva though i used to think i did so you had better stop here andillill go the pity of the hideous mistake for him came home even to her where she asked you wont go and live in that awful cityyou mustnt do that youre not like them you know youd die of it he felt it was true that he belonged to nomansland perhaps that would be the best solution of the difficulty he said gloomily with a sententiousness which quite took the pathos from the remark she looked at him gloomily in her turn with a certain exasperation oh if you want to of course but my dear chris do you really think im worth that sort of thing from your point of view i mean something about her as she stood dainty as ever reminded him of those days in the boardinghouse down the hammersmith road when india and that part of himself which belonged to india had seemed so very far off he took a step nearer to her you might be viva you might be she drew back in fifty years time perhaps she replied shrewdlyfor as she said she was no fool why chris cant you see that you have just gone dotty over the new idea of woman as a helpmeet and companion and that sort of biz and iwhywe girls have left it behind us a bit in england nowadays the fatal truth of her remarks invariably silenced chris born as he was of a long line of men to whom argument was a religion well goodbye viva i will try and not trouble you any more he said accepting defeat with a pang of remorse at his own readiness to do so at the sense of relief which would not be ignored she shrugged her shoulders dont be so tragic please and remember i didnt send you away you want to go visiting your mother in the city and im quite willing you should provided you take proper precautions so goodbye and take care of yourself there is nothing to worry about you are up to the ropes there and i am up to them here so there is no harm done chris however as he packed a portmanteau of necessaries felt that though this might be true for the present and thoughso far as she was concernedit might even remain true it was a different affair for him there was danger ahead in his future and this became more and more certain as in packing he had to decide on what were necessaries and what were not for that depended so much on the sort of life you were going to lead and what sort of life was he going to lead he ended by taking very little but amongst that little were two things which though they both contained the staple of lifecommon corn could scarcely be called necessaries man however does not live by bread alone so he put these and himself into a hired green box on wheels and drove to a lodging he knew of close to the city yet not of it it was in the upper part of a house used as a meetingplace by the brahmo somaj who by this means paid the rent of the quaint semieuropeanised building it stood in a bit of garden thick with plantains between which two straight mud walks and a curved one showed curiously black and damp as if the soil was sodden with sewage as it may have been but upstairs when the green shutters were thrown back it was fresh and breezy enough a brahmosomaj clerk in the railway whom chris knew and liked had quarters on the ground floor in consideration of his services as secretary and with his help chris soon found himself settled in a bed a table a chairthe last two doubtfully desirablecompleted the furniture and left a delightful sense of space and freedom in the wide empty room he had escaped he felt from shark lane surely from this standpoint it might be possible to be sincere here it might be possible to reconcile himself to his environment his environment to himself he took off his european dress not from any distaste to it but because he knew it to be an absolute barrier between him and his desire so in the ordinary costume of a native clerk he strolled out to pass the time till he could safely go and see his mother safely because she lived amongst the strictest of neighbours whom he did not wish to meetas yet that might be afterwards but not now it was already growing duskfor he had changed his quarters after the days work was overbut the irregular sort of bazaar between him and one of the city gates had not yet begun to twinkle with little lights after its usual fashion indeed many of the shops were closed yet there was no lack of possible customers the roadway was crowded with all sorts and conditions of men it suddenly struck him that nearly all were coming towards him therefore there must be some attraction behind him he turned and drifted with the tide until after a few hundred yards he saw ahead of him to one side of the road a dim clump of stunted trees with a red rag on a stick tied to the topmost branch and showing in a soft yellow radiance which rose from the ground a glint of white tombs among the lower ones then he rememberedan odd regret that he should have forgotten something which to his childhood had been allimportant coming with the remembrancethat this must be the day of sheikh chillis fair which was held every year at this shrine sheikh chilli the pantaloon of india the man of straw the lovers dupe the butt of every one the type which in varying form plays its part in the seriocomic tragedy of sex all over the world sheikh chilli whose beard any one can pull whose wife is never his own whom a child can deceive perhaps that was the reason chris thought why as a child sheikh chillis fair had been such a supreme occasion that and the toysthose toys which as it were set nushapore the fashion in playthings for a whole year and that meant something since the two hundred and odd thousand people in the city idlers by inheritance were great in the manufacture of toys chris who had not seen a sheikh chilli fair for years went forward eagerly as a child himself the whole scene coming back to him with absolute familiarity the rows of little lights set on the ground to mark the streets and behind them ranged in squares the toys thousands of them millions of them baked mud bent bamboo curled cotton sodawater corks matchboxes even brass cartridges all pressed into the service by a truly marvellous ingenuity and between the lights along the paths jammed almost to solidity by the barriers of toys humanity of all sorts and sizes seen in that curious soft radiance rising from the earth below its feet humanity trying to pause and admire trying to pause and laugh helpless for either when standing and driven to gain absolute solidity by squatting down and letting the stream sweep over it a group of dancinggirls showed on the flat plinth of the shrine musicians strummed here and there here and there a conjurer essayed tricks but all this was trivial beside the toys yet they were still more trivial one for a farthing two for a farthing even three for a farthing if you chose mud monkeys or brass rings made out of sliced cartridgecases set with drops of blue or red sealingwax lo came the voices of peasants in for the show see to that that is new and some gravefaced husbandman would buy a sort of mercurys caduceus made of bamboo with two writhing twisting snakes to it fearfully horribly alive this piece of ingenuity indeed ran a couple of cottonwool bears who chased each other endlessly over a loop of bamboo close for the pride of first place in the fair a place for which there was keen competition so that whenever any toy seemed to hit the fancy there were instantly trays of it being hawked about above the crush above the soft light with the crythe best in the fair one farthing one farthing for the best in the fair chris caught in the crowd drifted on with it wondering as he had wondered as a child which of the many claimants up aloft in the semidarkness was the true one it was a strangely absorbing wonder but then the whole scene was absorbingly unlike anything else in the world it was humanity herded by toys limited by them forced to go one way and one way only by them the rows of little flickering lamps between the two seemed as if they were shaking with silent laughter at the sight the best in the fair one farthing one farthing for the best in the fair the cry came this time with something that was hardly a toy and yet hands were stretched out to buy it chris tall enough to see over the heads of his neighbours noticed that more trays full of this something were being hawked on all sides it was only a hank of the coarse ringstreaked cotton thread used in betrothals as an amulet for the bridegrooms wrist and for plaiting into the brides hair attached to it was a thin brass medal apparently cut out of a cartridge case and shaped like the talisman a second wife wears as a safeguard against the machinations of the first it was stamped chris found on buying one with what seemed at first a crescent and a cross but a closer look showed him that the latter was a swastika or deathmark in other words the equallimbed cross with bent ends below that again was a sort of broad arrow the best in the fair safety for females victoria queens mercifulness freedom from tyrannies for one farthing these more elaborate cries came from farther down the serried band of humanity of which chris was a unit and so beyond his reach but after a while the steady glacierlike movement of the whole brought him opposite to what was evidently the home of the amulet for such the something seemed to be here behind the rows of lamps thousands of these cotton hanks lay in tangled heaps behind them again sat the sellers raking in money every one seemed to buy even those who did not know what they were buying what ist for answered one of the sellerswhom chris fancied he had seen in some rather different positionto an old man who had bought a whole pennys worth for the plague of course wear it and none dare come nigh thee it gives the right to peace dost pretend began chris hotly when the seller looking up interrupted him audaciously i pretend naught baboojee he replied i sell amulets for what they are worth a farthing the rest is gods will yet have not all a right to peace my masters have we not all the right to live as we have lived ay and to quarrel with those who interfere above all with those who make promises and break them wholl buy wholl buy the promise of peace the freedom from tyranny the female rulers mercifulness to females the hands were stretching out on all sides still as the onward sweep of that human glacier carried chris beyond the power of argument or denial he found the opportunity of both however when he joined a group beyond the crush in which he recognised several of his shark lane acquaintances he had not meant to show himself in his present dress to them but he was eager for sympathy the police ought not to allow that sort of thing he said decisively it might lead tototrouble i fail to see your point sir replied a keenfaced lawyer it appears to me to lead to the soothing of groundless terrors then the sale of amulets is not prohibited by law nor is there fraudulent statement over and above a general appeal to superstition and ignorance which alas are but too common i join issue with you sir put in another keen face nor to my mind is there even suggestio falsi is not our beloved queen merciful to females and has not the government graciously asserted that there shall be no interference with the liberty of the subject some one behind laughed loudly a trifle uncontrollably and a voice which chris instantly recognised as govind the editors said jeeringly in hindustani ala lalajee there is no lack of gracious words but as i have said ever as i mean to prove when i choose there is more than the words in the lordsahibs officebox prove echoed another of the same type who had paused in passing to join the group thou art behind the times govind it is proved already but this morning two englishmen on excuse of plague visitation offered such insult to three virtuous females that with one accord they threw themselves down the well impossible cried chris and not he only for nearly every man present voiced doubt if not denial there is no doubt reiterated the newsbringer complacently i had it from a man whose uncle was outside they closed the doors and none could enter despite the womens screams it was in the badshahzai quarter and the folk have closed their gates and sit in terror small wonder put in govind eager to have his say in horrors it was thence that the girl was abducted the other day lo tis a good beginning what wonder if folk lay hold of amulets and fair promises i tell you asserted chris passionately it cannot be true and as for the other story was it not told on the word of jehan aziz and which of us would trust him none shall we believe him in this against what we see and know of our own senses we do not believe these stories sir remarked the lawyer pompously false evidence is alas a hobby of our ignorant countrymen there is no doubt a substratum of truth in these stories no pleaderjee interrupted chris vehementlythe conversation shifted between english and hindustani in the strangest fashionthere is no foundation for such stories and we all know it there is foundation for mistakes for wrong enough god knowsbut for such as that no your contention is true put in a temperate voice but the difficulty of sifting wheat from chaff is proverbial once again chris broke from his like in absolute discouragement and yet what could he do to dissociate himself from their policy of noninterference absolutely nothing here in this world mapped out by toys with that soft unsteady brilliance rising from about mens feet he could not even hope to rouse dissent that onward glacierlike sweep full of outstretched hands buying a piceworth of promises would pass by him and his words unheeding of either and after all the lawyer was right so far that miserable strand of the weddingskein which links man and womanthat trumpery brass cartridgecase medal rudely stamped with the hindoo deathmark the mohammedan faithmark and the english possessionmarkwould carry comfort and calm to many a hearth and yet the promise that could not be kept was dangerous he must write of that to mr raymond and then the question came why should he why should he who had no voice at all in his own countrys welfare help those who thought they could dispense with the services of such as he the clock striking nine from the tall italian campanile on which some past bureaucrat had spent money that might have been better used warned him that if he was to write that evening he must do it at once but it warned him also that it was time he went to his mothers should he should he not it was no sense of duty which decided him it was the remembrance that if he went back to his lodging he could kill two birds with one stone he could not only write the warning but also put a certain small rosescented rosesatincovered boxlet and a paper of corn in his pocket in case naraini poor little soul needed comforting something that was not eastern or western but simply human surged up in him as he thought of what her face would be when he proved to her that so far from being angry at her throwing the corn into the gutter he had gathered it upevery grain he had not told his mother that he had done so that is not the sort of information sons give their mothers east or west but he meant to tell naraini he ran up the brick stairs which led from outside to the upper story lightly as a boy feeling a sort of exultation in his new freedom of circumstance he had purposely brought no servant with him for they he knew would have brought shark lane with them and he wished to forget its ways and works for a time so he had determined to engage a new and uncontaminated attendant on the morrow one consequence of this however was that his room was dark today he stood on its threshold feeling of a sudden strangely forlorn and lost then he pulled himself together sharply what a trivial thing is man that even the lack of a bedroom candle should discourage him on the threshold too of a new life especially when he had not so far forsaken civilisation as to be without wax vestas he lit one after another laboriously and managed by their light to scrawl a short note to jack raymond then he rummaged in his portmanteau for the rosescented box trusting more to touch and smell than sight until having found it he laid it beside him on the floor in order to relock the portmanteau ere leaving the room to take care of itself and then then a travellinginkstand and the little casket got mixed up in the darkness and he became conscious of something wet on his hands he sworein englishand lit another match the rosecoloured box was uninjured but his fingers were hopeless he turned naturally to soap water towels and found none there was the well in the compound of course buthe swore again then half inclined to laugh half to frown at the annoyance he felt he began to feel his way towards the stairs as he did so a chink of light at the bottom of a door farther down the wider roof of the lower story from which the upper rooms rose arrested him he might beg for a wash there a voice answered his knock he opened the door and went in then stood petrified seated on a chair facing him his legs very wide apart a bit of lookingglass in one hand a brush in the other janalishan was putting the finishing touches to an elaborate parting he was otherwise got up to the nines in an old dresssuit which he had picked up for the half of nothing at an officers sale his white tie and shirtfront were irreproachable he had a flower in his buttonhole the only discordant note was a reminiscent odour of patchouli he paused awestruckhairbrush and lookingglass severed from each other by the width of his armstretchat the sight of his superior officer in native costume well iameternallyhis present and future state was evidently an uncertainty but he finally said a trifle doubtfullyblessed then he rose and accepted the situation with his usual confidential cheerfulness beg pardin sir he explained titivatin for a op the girls like it an you likes yourself so its all round my at for the lot o us an a straight tip to england expecs every man

recovering his lost sense of dignity under the effects of a nailbrush and a piece of pumicestonehe had often noticed janalishans hands and wondered at their tidiness for a working mansto find out the state of feeling in the city from what i hear people are sayingand you must hear a lot too janalishan laid down the brush and the lookingglass hear he echoed lor love you they dont tell me them tales

veinsbeggin your pardin sir but you know ow tis yes said chris suddenly i know how it is he knew better than he had ever known before when hours afterwardshis blood running like new wine in his veinshe came back from the city and stumbled up to his room the stairs were certainly as john ellison had said most inconsiderate yet one stumble was not due to them but to john ellison himself who was crumpled up snoring peacefully at the most difficult turn hillo he said conclusively after a prolonged stare at chris made possible by another resort to wax vestas on the latters part is that you sonny and then he wandered off melodiously into the parody my mother bids me dye my hair the fashionable hue when chris had seen his subordinate safe to bed he made free with the bit of candleend for his own use and by its light he saw his letter to jack raymond lying forgotten on the floor in a halfdried pool of ink i cannot send that one anyhow he said to himself as he tore it up but he felt as if he could send nothingthat he could never give another thought to such things for naraini had needed comfort and he had given it to her but he could not even think of her a profound physical content lulled him to a dreamless sleep his last thought ere that sleep claimed him being that he had not felt so happy for years chapter xx the old wine chris woke suddenly and yet without that sense of dislocation which such awakening often brings with it the vast content that had been his in falling asleep was his still as with eyes which seemed to him to have grown clear of dreams he lay smiling at what he saw though that was only a wide empty whitewashed room with many windowdoors set open to the dawn and through these nothing but a strip of mud roof and beyond that again the broad blades of the plantain leaves shining greygreen in the grey light a slight breeze swayed them and rustled in the frayed straws of the rude matting with which the floor was covered but that louder more intermittent rustle was not the wind it was the patter of a birds feet and there with tail erect on the coping clear against the glistening greygreen leaves which swayed like seaweeds in a swift tide a striped squirrel was breakfasting on some treasuretrove chris filled his lungs with a long breath he was back in the old world the world where all living things are alike mortal where even man is as the flower that fadeth the beast that perisheth and the old way was better so far he had gone when the consciousness that he was not alonethat strange consciousness of humanity which be the old way never so charming separates men from it inevitablycame to him and he sat up on the low string cot set so regardless of symmetry just where it had first been dumped down in the room his instinct had been right a figure had been seated unmovable as a statue just behind his head but as he turned it turned also and held out a folded paper the figure was that of a young man about his own age and of much the same build but guiltless of clothing save for a saffroncoloured waistcloth the forehead was barred with white lines and a leopards skin hung over the shoulder palpably this was the disciple of some learned ascetic as he chris would have been had not the west interfered with custom the thought made him smile but the face opposite his remained grave almost disapproving the figure rose without a word turned on its heel and disappeared chris left with the paper in his hand felt as if a message had been sent to him from another world felt so still more when he had read the broad black sanskrit lettering inside thy guru calls theeit rancome ere it be too late he sat staring at the words consciousdespite his better senseof a compulsion almost of fear for why had this claim of authority been made now wherefore should the guruthat is the spiritual adviser of his familydesire to see him the answer was but too plain he must already know of that stolen visit chris had made to his mothers house a visit which should one who was her spiritual guide also choose to proclaim it might bring endless trouble vexation disgrace upon her chris stood up inwardly cursing his own recklessness he might he told himself have known that priestly spies would be about him after that incident of the bathingsteps he ought not to have gone not at least as he had gone leaving his mother still in her fond belief that he had done or was willing to do the necessary penance yet without that beliefstrengthened as it had been by his repeated requests for secrecy in the presentshe would not have received him as she had and naraini plainly he must obey the order and so find out what was wanted what was threatened he rose therefore and went out into the cool grey dawn the arcaded courtyard recessed about a cluster of temples where swami viseshwar nath taught his disciples was empty as yet when chris reached it save for half a dozen figures scarce distinguishable from the one which had summoned him all in these early hours were busy over ceremonials of sorts but all looked up at the newcomer with that dull disapproval the guru is within said one sullenly chris did not need direction had he not learned the precious shibboleths of his twiceborn race yonder at the masters feet so thou hast come krishn take thy seat pupil and listen came a voice it was almost dark in the slip of a room behind the arcades but chris could see by the help of memory the unmovable figure the placid face with its wide thin lips he saw in a flash also everything that had ever happened to him in this his earliest school and the old awe that comes with such memories fell on him as he obeyed there is no need continued the voice to tell thee that i know what thou wouldest rather i did not know neither canst thou pretend ignorance of what such knowledge means therefore krishn there is naught to say but this what art thou about to do chris had been asking himself the question but he resented its being put to him that depends he was beginning when the swami stopped him by laying an impassive hand on his wrist to save time i will tell thee out of past yearsas thou didst disappear in themthou shalt returnas thou didst gokrishn davenund brahmin twiceborn there shall be no question asked no answers needed thou shalt return to usi viseshwar nath parohit of thy race say it and none shall quarrel methou shalt return to hold a womans hand and circle the sacred fireher hand narainis whom the gods keep for thee whom i child have kept for thee the words with the nameless rhythm in them which the use of sanskrit phrases gives to the vulgar tongue echoed softly into the arches and chris felt his eyes his ears held captive by the insignificant figure that was hedged about by no sign of dignity or office save the leopard skin on which it crouched naked kept for mehow so he echoed trying once more to be resentful the swami smiled hast indeed forgotten the old life so utterly boy as never to have wondered why one of narainis age remained virgin in thy mothers house chris felt the blood go tingling to his face for he could not pretend to such ignorance he knew that the limit of laxity in such matters had almost been overpast in the hope that when he returned from england he would marry the girl but that possibility had vanished when he had married viva therefore to blame him for the subsequent delay was unfair so he answered boldly i have not wondered i have known and regretted the idle dream but that was over long agoere my father died had he chosen he might the swamis hand stopped him once more not so he said calmly if thou hast forgotten much there are other things thou hast never known that none would have known save thy father and inot even thy motherhadst thou been dutiful and fulfilled the dream listen and reflect thy cousin naraini was betrothed or ever she came to thy fathers house betrothed as an infant to one whowho left her left her echoed chris hotly wherefore that matters not replied viseshwar nath there be many reasons but the result is the same if the betrothed be dead naraini is widow in the pause chris clenched his hands for he saw whither the wily lips were leading him and in a flash realised his own impotence if this were true it is a lie he muttered helplessly i mustmy mother must have known and my father then memory came to remind him that his father had been a champion of widow remarriage and he broke off still more helplessly even so continued the swami not unkindly thy father agreed with me we of the temple have to keep touch with the world krishn yea he gave gold since that is in thy thought to hide the wrong and if he were willing to give her to you his only son as wife wherefore should i speak no harm was done to others no deception to ignorant honour but it was different when he died and thy mother came to me with heart split in twain between the dream and duty to speak of another betrothal so i said thenwait yet a while the gods have mated these two he may return that was better was it not krishn thanthan widowhood for the girl he leant towards the young man as he spoke the words his sombre eyes fixed on chris davenants shrinking face though the latter had known what was coming the certainty of it overwhelmed him he sat staring breathlessly with such absolute paralysis of nerve and muscle that a damp sweat showed on his forehead as on the foreheads of those who are in the grip of death and widowhood was worse than death it would be a living death to naraininaraini with her little rosecoloured rosescented casket which is it to be my pupil came the swamis voice swift and keen as a knifethrust widowhood or marriage chris buried his face in his hands with a groan then he looked up suddenly why he began and ended appeal he knew was useless but he might at least know why this choice was forced on him for choice it was his had been in the eye of the law a mixed marriagehis right as hindoo remained in india the swamis lean brown hand was on his wrist again but it was no longer impassive it seemed to hold and claim him almost passionately because we of the temple need such as thou art my son in these new days when the old faith is assaileday even by such as ram nath lowborn with his talk of ancient wisdom his cult of western ways hidden in the old teachings his cult of the east blazoned in the outside husks of truththe husks that we of the inner life set at their proper value but thou art of us deny it notthe blood in thee thrills to thy fingertips even as i speak thou art of us and thy voice trembled in that dawn over the gayatri thou hadst not said for yearsnay start not we of the temple know allas it trembled krishn when thou didst first learn it here as thou art today at my feet in the silence that followed chris davenant who had so often ridden in a hammersmith bus was conscious of but two things in the wide world that thrill to his fingertips and the scarlet stain of a womans petticoat passing templewards beyond the arches the only scrap of colour in the strange shadowless light which comes to india before the sun has risen over the level horizon so once more the swamis voice came still dignified but with a trace of cunning in it now of argument thou canst not do it unaided krishn but with us behind theegiving more freedom remember that the herd knows or dreamsthou couldst have thy wishthou couldst teach the people true chris listening saw this even as he saw that scarlet streak but all the while he was thinking idly that if naraini were doomed to widowhood the bridal scarlet would never be hers and yet he forgot even this when the swami struck another string deftly our best disciples leave usthe rhythm grew fateful mournfulthe new wisdom takes them soul and body ere they have learned to unhusk the old and find its heart but thou hast found it come back to us and teach us for day by day the husk hides more even on the river krishn where the old sanctuaries of the godhead in man and woman stand side by side the younger priests quarrel over her power and his as if the man and the woman were not together the eternal mind and body and the quarrel grows keen like many another in those days keener than ever since the golden paper fell prophesying blood upon her altar lies krishn lies we know them so but we are driven to them to keep our hold upon the people what other hold have we but ignorance if young wisdom leaves us chris gave a sort of inarticulate cry and his hands rose passionately to his ears as if to shut out the words which were enlisting all things that were good in him on the side of something which he still condemned but as he stopped his ears despairingly a sound came which no hand could quite shut out it was the clang of the temple bell proclaiming that the eucharist of hindooism was ready for communicants that the water of life which had touched the gods was waiting for those who thirsted for it muffled half heard it seemed to vibrate afresh on every tense nerve of his mind and body he stood up dazed half hypnotised by it by the figurea dim shadow of a man that had risen also smiling softly among the dim arches come my son it said so far thou art with us let the rest be for a while but this stripped of its husk is thinecome and as it passed silently into the courtyard chris passed too lost in the familiar unfamiliarity of all things of the clustering spikes of the temples seen against the primrose sky of the drifting hint of incense shut in by the arcades of the bare empty silence broken only by that clanging bell the scarlet streak was passing outwards already sanctified approved others would come but for the moment there was solitude save for that halfdozen of indifferent disciples droning over their devotions and the officiating priest unseen within the temple unseen because it was the swami himself who returning from the darkness of the sanctuaryinto which he had passed swiftly leaving chris hesitating on the lowest stepstood on the upper one the churrunamrit in his hands and bending low said drink krishn davenund and live the words came like a command making the slender brown hands curve themselves into a cup how cool the holy water was on those hot palms dear god how cool how restful the mans whole soul was in his lips as he stooped and drank thirstily a dream a dream but what a heavenly dream chris stood there in that shadowless light of dawn unable even to realise what the dream was and then suddenly a great desire to be alone and yet to find companionshipa shrinking from the routine around him and a longing to find shelter in the hidden heart of thingscame to him as the worshippers answering the call of the bell began to crowd about the temple sothe swami having kept his promise of asking no more of him for the timehe passed out of the court into the bazaar beyond but here the world was already chaffering over the needs of the body and chris who was only conscious of his soul stood bewildered in it uncertain which way to go nothing seemed to claim him not even his work for it was sunday morning and after that act of communion the hope of companionship anywhere seemed strangely enough further from him than ever so he stood idly watching the worshippers pass in and out of the arched entry to the temple court leaving the world and coming back to it with businesslike faces until he saw ram nath approaching him and the sight made him pull himself together swiftly the very man i want said ram nath in english with such an elaborate lack of surprise at chriss costume that the latter felt instantly that it was known and had been discussed in shark lane if you will wait a moment i will walkerback with you the hesitancy showed that something else was known also and chris felt a faint resentment come to lessen his forlornness as he waited while ram nath disappeared towards the temple and reappeared again wiping his hands daintily with a hemstitched pockethandkerchief we of the world he explained as he tucked his arm english fashion into chris davenants have to keep in touch with the priests you disagree i know but i hold you wrong we are driven to acquiesce in much we think untrue in order to keep our hold on the masses what other hold have we but their ignorance if they deny our wisdom the forlornness deepened again round poor chris here was the swamis argument upside down what was it you wanted to see me about he asked resignedly feeling that he could not go on with that subject about this afternoon began ram nath and chris stared blankly what was it possible his companion continued had he forgotten that the afternoon was to see the realisation of their longcherished project of founding an anglovernacular college it came back to chris then and he hastened to deny what had really been the case whereupon ram nath went on mollified at the last moment it seemed some one had remembered that lady arbuthnotwho had kindly consented to lay the stoneought to be presented with a bouquet and hafiz ahmad had claimed the honour for his wife thereby raising so much jealousy in shark lane that he ram nath thought the only solution of the difficulty was to intrust the giving to mrs chris as wife of the vicepresident of the managing committee chris heard himself so described with a sense of absolute bewilderment only of course it might not perhaps be convenient now chris came back to sudden perception of the others meaning she will be very glad he said quickly i will tell her when i go home it was done in a moment but chris felt his dream to be madder than ever as he realised that his afternoons occupation would be standing in a frockcoat simpering while viva presented a bouquet how prettily she would do it how beautifully she would be dressed then in the evening in the evening would the swami come and ask for an answer meanwhile ram nath was full of relief that would settle the difficulty really a most serious one since nothing must mar the harmony of the memorable occasion it would be singularly appropriate too because in order to ensure a large attendance it had been arranged to hold an extraordinary chapter of the national guild for encouraging comradeship to which most of the english officials and their wives belonged in fact it was to be a memorable occasion and one that would fully justify our popular lieutenantgovernor in for the nonce waving his rule against sunday ceremonials in order to allow all employees to be present having here cut in on the lines of the speech he had prepared for the afternoon ram nath was fluency itself and went on and on quite contentedly while chris absorbed in that vision of himself in a frockcoat listened without hearing after all which was the real krishn davenund which the ideal one was the older certainly but change must come to all things they had reached the river steps by this time and he pausedmaking ram nath pause alsoto look down on a scene which had not changed a hairbreadth in essentials for thousands of years yet chris davenants eye noted one change of detail in a moment as a woman passed him on her way to fill her waterpot there was a new sort of amulet on her wrist an amulet made out of a brass cartridge casing he glanced round quickly to see if other women were wearing it and by so doing recognised rather a momentous fact namely that there were singularly few women to be seen and that all who were belonged to the working class he turned to ram nath instantly and pointed out both signs as to one who ought to know their value what is up he said briefly you must have seen these amulets being sold as i did is it a trick and who is doing it and why his companion shrugged his shoulders the priests i should sayit is on a par with the paper which fell from heaven there is always something you think we ought to protest but why such manifestations of the temper of the masses strengthen the hands of the opposition by engendering a fear of resistance in the government and so making for the considerate treatment at which we aim it is not as if such trivialities could do harm they mightthere is some hope of mischief behind themthere must be mischief echoed ram nath acutely you know as well as i that there are many folk in nushapore whose only hope lies in mischief and here comes one of them he pointed to burkut ali who accompanied by a servant carrying a bundle of kites was passing towards the bastion beyond the bridge he was followed by other claimants to the sovereignty of air which was due to be decided that evening after the kites had been chosen and entered for the competition ram nath looked after the faded brocades contemptuously poor devils he saidas an englishman might have said itone cannot help pitying them and yet between ourselves if we were in power we couldnt do anything else with them though of course as the opposition it does not do to say so but to return to our argument believe me the ignorant masses are helpless without a lead and we the educated party will not give it towards anything unconstitutional but others might burkut ali for instance burkut ali not today at any rate he will be occupied in the sovereignty of airreally an appropriate employment is it not replied ram nath lightly and as weand all nushapore which carries any weightwill be otherwise engaged also this affair of amuletseven if there is anything in itwill be like the heavensent paper by tomorrow i at any rate know of no reason why this should not be so he added a trifle resentfully seeing the look on his companions face and if i dont who should well goodbye if you are not coming on chris felt doubly relieved partly at the almost unhopedfor straightforwardness of ram naths words but mostly because he had been growing conscious during the conversation of the fact that wherever he might find comradeship it was not here still in that same weary bewilderment therefore he seated himself on the uppermost step and looked down to where in the deep shadow of the archway of mai kalis temple he could just seeabove the heads of a little crowd listening to a declaiming priesta hint of the idols red outstretched arms they brought back to him in an instant the sense of his own personal powerlessness gripped on either side by east and west what could he do in the afternoon a frockcoat in the evening the swami with his question how should he how could he answer it how could he condemn naraini to a living death how could he give up the past with its good and evil the future with its evil and its good putting himself aside for the truths sake what ought he to do god how powerless he was mai kalis widespread arms seemed to close on him to choke him till suddenly a swift vitality came back to him as a whistlemellow as a blackbirdsmade itself heard behind him he turned with a smile with a sense of relief knowing it was janalishan it was janalishan coming to feed the monkeys janalishan looking marvellously spruce alert selfrespecting seeing that most of his nights rest had been on a brick stair mornin sir he said touching his cap decorously but his hand lingered to hide a smile as he added with deep concern aint lost nothin more o your wardrobe today sir i hope then his recollections got the better of his politeness and the laugh came openly beg pardin sir im sure but wen i think o ole oneyman and them pantsoh lordy lord the recollection however brought more than amusement to poor chris who in truth felt as if he had lost everything it brought a sense of grateful comradeship and there was quite a tremble in his voice a mist in his eyes as he said its all very well to laugh but you saved my life that day ellison you know you did ive often thought of it since the memory of kindness received was almost too much for him he paused unable to go on john ellison looked the other way as he sat down at a respectful distance and began to scatter sugardrops to the monkeys then he cleared his throat elaborately like as you saved me i expect sir from breaking my neck over them blamed stairs last night sir one good turn deserves another as the sayin is so were about quits not he went on as if to make a diversion that i was so to speak onnecessary drunk sir for it was a case o gettin tight or killin a chap as cut me out fair an square with my fancy so it bein fair an square i chose the better part an drowned my sorrers in the flowin bowl its surprisin he continued with the affable defiance with which he always alluded to his own lapses from grace wot a teeny drop o whisky will drown em dont it sir as he scattered the sugardrops he sang the chorus of a drinkingsong with great gusto they were an odd couple those two the alien feeding the sacred monkeys the native watching him silently and both conscious of a bond of fellowship between them i suppose so replied chris after such a lapse of time that the remark seemed almost irrelevant but i never tried it im a teetotaller deary dear ejaculated janalishan sympathetically it was really the only remark he could think of in such an extraordinary connection it doesnt last though does it asked chris after another long pause and it gives you a headache next morning doesnt it janalishans fluency returned to him lor love you no sir not if yous used to it special if kind friends put you to bybye proper he broke off then turned to chris and shook his headnow you sir if i may make so bold looks as if you ad one you takes things too dutiful sir i expecs its ard on the ead sir is duty even so much sympathy drove chris to hiding the mist in his eyes by watching the monkeys they were jostling and hustling as ever over the prize but the sight for a wonder had brought few spectators and such as they were stood far off more curious than amused janalishan looking towards them raised his eyebrows and nodded carelessly got the ump today as you ramsammy well keep it sonny it dont make no odds to me or oneyman do it siree apparently none for the hoary old sinner out and away the tamest there was pouching sugardrops as fast as he could from the loafers hand ellison came chris davenants voice at last with a note of decision in it what would you do if you found yourself inin such a tight place that you couldntyes that you couldnt possibly get out of it do echoed the other slowly as he shook out the crumbs and tore the paper into fragments wy kill the chap as put me there if it was john ellison imself as done the job thats what id do sir chris rose and the note of decision was stronger thanks he said briefly i think youre right but janalishan had risen also and now stood facing his superior officer with an expression of kindly tolerance and mournful respect not sir as there ever is sich an almighty tight place as a chap cant get out of by leavin a harm or a leg or a bit of hisself generally to be cast into ell fire as it say in oly writ for there aint nothin impossible if youve enough of the devil in youthats ow it comes in sir here he paused doubtful perhaps whether holy writ contained this also then went on easily for it aint no manner of use sir reachin round for things as you cant catch no real holt ofyou must jes take wot comes andy though it maynt be much to be proud ofsuch as cuss words an kicks and that like but they give a powerful grip sometimes sir as youd find savin your presence if you was to give em a fair try he paused again looked at chris tentatively then smiled a perfectly seraphic smile full of pity wisdom almost of tenderness if i might make so bold sir wot a man you an me d make if we was mixed up harchhangels wouldnt ave a look in and wots more i shouldnt ave to clean damn myself keepin them kusseye coolies from sneakin the cold chisels an a good name too for the lot though it is cussyou as i make it in general kuzai echoed chris quickly what are those fellows from the butchers quarter giving troubleand i only put them on out of charity why didnt you tell me before but janalishan had reverted to his affable indifference trouble he echoed in his turn lord no sir i has to read the riot act summary most daysthey get quarrelling with the indoos over some cowkillin tommyrot but wen it come to sneakin cold chisels i ad to knock arf a dozen o em down but they dont give no trouble to speak of nor wont he added significantly if theyre spoke to proper ill see to it tomorrow said chris and then once more wondered at his own words this afternoon a frockcoat tomorrow an inquiry into a workmens quarrel and between the two inevitably that decision the rest was all unreal but that was certain that must come janalishan however asafter touching his cap decorouslyhe moved away sang tomorrow will be monday as if all the foundations of his world were absolutely sure and there were others besides these two on the river steps that morning whose outlook on the future showed the same divergence a couple of municipal scavengers armed with the broom and basket which under our rule bids defiance to privilege prejudice and privacy talked with cheerful certainty as they swept up the paper janalishan had torn to bits the sirkar would have to employ everybodys relations if the plague went on as it had begun they were shutting the shops already in the butchers quarter the hospitals were full the bazaars empty of a surety there was a good time coming for scavengers two women however returning with their waterpots from listening at the temple agreed that if as the priest said mai kali had declared there must be blood on her altars ere the plague was stayed what was the use of amulets besides who could tell if the promise was not a trick who briefly could tell anything except that it was an ill time for virtuous women and that those were lucky who could stay at home so with furtive glances and keeping close together they shuffled back to some dim alley to retail what they had heard chapter xxi red paint over on the other side of the city however on the wide stretch of sandy waste behind an outlying dispensary which had been turned into a segregation camp the advocates of certainty and uncertainty had changed places here in the little grassscreened yard six feet square which jack raymonds kindliness had secured for the ordinary reed hut to which poor crushed old auntie khojee had been brought it was a scavenger who doubted a woman whoeven amid tearshad faith lo brother said khojee in gentle reproof as she sat on the string bed hiding her griefblurred face discreetly from the tottering old man who had been sent in to sweep out the premises an old man bowed palsied senile yet still as a male creature claiming that calm perfunctory drawing of a veil an inch or two more over a withered cheek thou shouldst not repeat such tales they do harm as i have told thee before god knows what happened was not the fault of the huzoors it was jehans and mine and lateefs if indeed it was ought but gods will and lies will not bring her back again it was lies that killed her noormahal light of palacesa sob choked the quavering voice but she struggled on truthfullyand the huzoors were kind in concealing what they could what use to drag the honour of the kings house in the dust even jehan saw that and held his peace it is yeye of the basket and broomstrangersnot of the house knowing the honour of the house as in old timewho have done ill in talking and of the girl too lo what thou sayest of her and the pearls may be true but i know naught of it and jehan hath lied ever then for the bracelets have i not worn one and cried for death but death has not come as thou sayest it comes though i have worn this these two days she held out her thin arm as she spoke in order to show the ram rucki which jack raymond in his efforts to reassure her had fastened round her wrist the old man ceased sweeping to peer at it then chuckled wheezily oho oho bibi and wherefore not since that is a ram rucki which all know of old but this other i speak of is new i tell thee it hath the deathmark on it and the arrowhead which claims all for the sirkars use its like none have ever seen before they sold it deceitfully as safeguard yesterday at sheik chillis fair and men bought it for their wives and childrenala the tyranny of it the cleverness who can stand against their ways so now it is proved a sign of death indeed all who wear it all who have worn it are in the huzoors power when they are wanted they will die despite her disbeliefa disbelief founded largely on her own kindly grateful heartaunt khojee felt a cold creep in her old bones how canst tell by now some may escape she quavered the old scavenger waggled his head wisely this i know bibi that in the kuteeks and lohars housesyea and in others too where the sickness was rife for see you it hath been in the city this fortnight past though folk held their tonguesall bought these bracelets for safety all and it is from these very houses that the dead come am i not dom by craft though i grow too old and crooked to straighten even dead limbs have i not seen i tell thee bibi not one of the corpses taken out of the city this morning but had the bracelet on its wrist ay and not one of those carried by force to the hospitarl but had it too it was an absolutely true statement even if capable of a more natural explanation but rahmansahib the braceletbrother did not give them bracelets protested aunt khojee falling back fearfully on what still seemed incredible god knows mumbled the superannuated streaker of dead things mayhap he did not sell them but it was by order a hindoo in the city govind by name hath a paper with the order written on it and signed by the latsahib and wictoriaqueen so there is no lie there bibi he passed out resentfully driving the refuse he had swept up into the world beyond the sixfeetsquare yard with a last flourish of his broom khojee left forlorn sat looking at her ram rucki doubtfully could the tale be true could the huzoors have been capable of such a devilish treachery even so he rahmansahib had not been so his bracelet had brought safety even after two days auntie khojee recognised this the daghdarsahib had laughed at her fear of plague they had given her seclusion of the strictest a musulman woman who had called her my princess had brought her better food than she had had for years and even lateef had been allowed to come during the day and talk to her last not least the daghdar himself had respected her veil and sent a misssahiba insteada miss in a curious dress who had let her cry about noormahal and comforted her with cardamomsreal cardamoms it had almost been a visit of condolence then she was told that in eight days she might go backthough not to the wide dreary house since it had already been utilised as a hospital but rahmansahib had promised to settle that from the rent of this jehan should pay for a more suitable lodging and also allow her a proper pension a braceletbrother indeed yet lying tongues traduced him and she a braceletsister could do nothing but listen to them she wept softly over her own ingratitude so that lateefa finding her thus engaged attempted consolation on the old old lines which belong to all faiths all people by saying that it was gods will that noormahal was taken from the evil to come that she was at peace until finding his comfort unavailing and being pressed for time he told the old lady gently that she must not expect any more of his companionship that day since the term of his more rigorous segregation being over he was free to go out provided he returned by sundown then to his surprise she suddenly ceased her curious whimpering wail and looked up at him swiftly thou canst go out then thou shalt go to him and tell him of the lies yea and tell him that i khojeeya khanum wear his gift andand will never forget him and his beauty and his kindness tell him echoed the kitemaker wondering if he stood on his head or his heels when he was asked to take so fervent a message to a man from so discreet a lady as aunt khojee it did not take long however to make him understand for the old scavenger had swept out the mens quarters also but to the dear old ladys disgust he was inclined to laugh at and be sceptical over both her indignation and that of those who had bought the amulet the tale was not likely to be true why should the huzoors go such a roundabout way to work when they had soldiers and guns to be sure these were few in nushapore at the present moment and folk were saying that the talk about sobrai and noormahal and dilaramgod curse the lowborn pryers who know not how to keep silence for decencys sakehad set the pultan native regiment which was a highclass mohammedan one by the ears but there were plenty of rigiments close by and if it was true what good would a message to rahmansahib do it would only make him angry and if the tale were a lie what would he care did the huzoors ever care what folk said never that was why they ruled the land but aunt khojee was firm even when lateefwho had told her everythingprotested that he had no time to lose that if he was to have any chance of getting at the ring which he trusted was still concealed among the kites it must be before their selection for the flying match since once they were chosen none might touch them till the sovereignty of air was decided even now he might be too late for the courtyard and have to go to the turret ready to seize his chance during the trials and what is morehere he gave a glance at the skyif he knew aught of kiteflying those with fair ballast would surely be chosen today and therefore of course the one which had the ring hidden in the guise of a bit of brick within a little calico bag then it is safe so far it will be guarded till evening and then thou canst see to it asserted aunt khojee autocratically not till after sundown mayhap and i must return then and who can tell what may happen if it is left longer persisted lateef let what may happen the daghdars will not kill theethey are kind and what is the ring now but empty honour since there is no heir but the other is different rahmansahib is braceletbrother he hath been kindwe owe him this wouldst thou be even as jehan lateef willing to steal honour from any never in her long life had aunt khojee been so obstinate i care not so jehan doth not steal the ring muttered lateef revengefully nay sister i will not go she bent towards him and laid a wistful hand on his but if god give him back honour lateef should we hinder itwe who have sinned also not so brother let him decide and for the rest help me lo for all her years this is the first bond between khojeeya khanum kings daughter and a man let her keep it faithful unstained lateef gave an odd sound some part of it being his thin musical laugh sure sister thou wouldst make a saint even of a kiteflyer he said lightly so be it i will go by way of the courtyard then if the kites be gone alreadyas i misdoubt mei will to rahmansahibs with thy message so to the turretor wait till evening as thou sayest tis a chance either way and mayhap if i give god his will with lateef whom he made he may give lateef his will with the kites he made that is but fair sister yea brother assented khojeeya piously not in the least understanding what he said so it will come to pass surely since he is just thus it happened an hour or two after this when grace arbuthnot was once more standing beside her husbands office table as she had stood a few weeks before with the telegram which withdrew the confidential plan of campaign in her hand that a card was brought in to sir george by the orderly he put it on the table with a frown ere looking at his wife again and finishing his remark tear it up my dear and throw it into the wastepaper basket why should you worry about the thing i only showed it to you to amuse you and because it was a good example of the lies the natives will tell the threats they will useon occasion lady arbuthnot who was once more holding a paper in her hand looked up from it her face was pale i think you ought to inquire george i really do if there is anything my dear child interrupted her husband impatiently what can there be didnt i burn the thing with my own hands you mustnt get nervous grace ive noticed you have been so ever sincewell for some little time past and of course all that about the pearls and the loathsome imbroglio regarding them is annoying i should like to kick lucanaster and jehan aziz and the lot anything more unfortunate at this juncture can scarcely be imagined but there is nothing to worry about he laid his hand on her shoulder as he rose to touch the handbell and now my dear he added i have to see mr raymondhe has written important on his card mr raymond echoed grace her face flushing then growing pale again oh george she paused for a moment then spoke more calmlygeorge i want you to do something for me i want you to consult mr raymond aboutabout this matterwill you sir george stood rather stiff and the placidly obstinate look came to his mouth mr raymond he echoed in his turn why on earth should mr raymond know anything about itunless you have been speaking to him she had realised her slip before the suggestion came a suggestion whose truth she was too proud to deny even though her husbands displeasure at the thought was unmistakable i have spoken to him she replied steadily i told him your opinion as to the danger should the hints in the native press prove to have any foundation and he quite agreed i feel flattered remarked sir george coldly as he sat down again perhaps my dear when you are ready to go you will ring the bell mr raymond may be in a hurry grace arbuthnots heart sank within her a womanespecially a sensible womancan hardly live for ten years in close and affectionate companionship with a man without having seen him at his best and his worst and that the latter was the case with sir george now his wife recognised instantly albeit with a clear comprehension of the cause which made her feel a pathetic regret that she should thus handicap a man as a rule so just so unbiassed and that too at a moment when much might depend on his being free from personal feeling since jack raymond she knew would not have come lightly some woman might have fought against facts grace was too wise for that she simply rang the bell and passed into her own sittingroom with that pathetic regret it seemed so pitiful after these long years to find antagonism in these two men and yet what right had she to feel scornful was it not bitterly true that she herself could not forgetnot quite seated at her writingtable her head on her hand she tried to argue the matter out with herself and failed only this seemed clear that once you admitted certain emotions to be inevitable it was very hard to set limits to them surely therefore there must be a firmer basis than the conventional one but what was it she roused herself after a time to the consideration that no matter how the state of tension between herself her husband and jack raymond came aboutand that such a tension did exist she was again too proud to denyit must not be allowed to interfere with matters more important and that it might do so was only too palpable all the more so because those two especially her husband would be loth to admit the very existence of such a possibility therefore she herself must see and talk to mr raymond nay more she must get him to do what her husband would not do make inquiries concerning this threat of publishing some documents if payment for it was not made which was contained in the letter whichhalf unconsciouslyshe had brought away with her in her hand from the office she passed out into the anteroom told the attendant orderly that raymond sahib on leaving sir george was not to be shown out as usual by the office entry but through the suite of receptionrooms and then went thither herself to await and waylay him being seldom used in the morning these rooms leading the one from the other into a hall beyond and so to the grand portico were dim and silent the jalousies closed the great jardinieres full of flowers mysteriously sweet in the shadowy corners and grace herself ready for church save for the bunch of flowers and lace that go to make up the headgear of a grande toilette looked mysteriously sweet also in the curves of a cushioned chair she suited the vista of rooms so empty of trivial nicknacks so restful in its perfect blending of comfort and beauty comfort not luxury beauty not decoration cold in its marble floors warm in its oriental embroideries and above all things charming in both its scented chilliness and scented warmth perhaps she knew that she suited it and that it suited her since the hope of this decides the disposition of furniture in most drawingrooms perhaps in a way she calculated on this also on the effect of memory in reducing jack raymond to obedience since it was in these very rooms scarcely different even in detail that the most part of those two happy years had been spent such unconscious calculations are quite inevitable when women hold as they are taught to hold as sacred the dogma that true womanhood should never permit manhood to forget that it is woman she certainly succeeded in this instance and her wordsoh mr raymond i am so glad i want to speak to you so muchbrought the latter back into the past with a vengeance as inwardly cursing himself for having taken the trouble to come and warn sir george of something he thought serious he mechanically followed the orderlys lead she scarcely looked a day older she certainly was more beautiful and surely the last time he had seen her in those rooms alone there had been just such a scarlet hand of poinsettia against the cold marble above her head you have been seeing my husband she began quite unconsciously and he broke in on the remark with a curious little laugh i have lady arbuthnot and i fear i have wasted my time and his the former is of little consequence but the latter i regret as she so often did out of a blessed unconsciousness that her mental position towards him was quite untenable she appealed at once to that past confidence dont be angry please i was afraid there might bedifficulties sir george she smiled frankly was in a very bad temper i had justshe broke off realising that absolute confidence was impossible then went onbut you must not let that interfere withwith what you think advisable and you do think with me dont you that it would be advisable to inquire whetherwhether that unfortunate letter of mine jack raymond who had remained standing in impatient hesitation between his politeness and his desire to escape as soon as possible stared at her what letter he asked she rose too in sudden surprise and they stood facing each other against that background of white marble and scarlet outspread poinsettia then it was something else she said i thought it must be this he took the letter she held out and read it it says nothing definitely she went on butbut i think it must be that dont you if so what ought we to do the we struck him sharply and he asked have you told sir george told him she echoed flushing a little no i wish now i had at first hehe would have faced the possible danger by this time but now now it is impossible mr raymond i have thought it out thoroughly it would be better to take the risk if that is necessary but it need not be if you will help me he shook his head why should you not her head was up her beautiful face full of a faint scorn her clear eyes were on his unflinchingly he met her look as he always met a challenge with almost brutal sincerity because i do not choose toto stultify the last ten years because i gave up all that sort of thing whenwhen i said goodbye to youhere and you would let that stand between you andno not between youbut between death and life perhaps for others between order and disorder anyhow you think it important i know sir george does not he interrupted what does that matter you are as capable of judging as he perhaps more so why should you be a coward why should you who possiblyno probablyknow far more of the ins and outs of the city than the regular officialsoh dont deny it have i not heard them say ask raymond this or that and raymond will know and have i not been gladso glad that everything has not been spoilt why should you i say give up your own opinion for it comes to that what you came here to tell sir george today for instance you must have thought it important or you would not have come i came because i thought it my duty to acquaint the authorities with certain facts that had been brought to my notice i have done so and that ends it it does not end it you and sir george disagreed you know you did as to its importance you still think you are right and yet you yield to himwhy there was a moments pause and then jack raymond gave a hard laugh why i will tell you the truth lady arbuthnot though you may not like itthough i acknowledge it is humiliatingfor all of us because i have had to yield to him before because he hasnt forgotten and i havent forgotten and you havent forgottennot quite have you it is nothing to be ashamed of it is only naturalone of the limitations of lifebut there it is isnt it he took a step nearer in the silence isnt it he repeated tell the truth grace and shamedont let us say the devilbut fate there put your hand in mine and face our ownforgetfulness she faced it boldly even though he felt her hand tremble in hisdid i ever deny it she said softly with tears in her voice i do not i cannot forget quite it is pitiful of course but why dont he interrupted quickly dont my dear lady you will only make me remember more that is the truth as you say it is pitiful but there it is she stood looking at him with a world of regret some anger and a little a very little scorn and you will let this interfere withwith everything not with everything but with this certainly he pointed to the letter which he had laid on the console below the poinsettias and that is all the easier to do because i dont believe in itquite but if i were you i should tell sir george the truth and let him decide as for the other matter about which i came to speak he may be right and i wrong time will show it may disastrously to manyto indiaeven to empirethe scorn came uppermost now surely he replied reverting to his usual manner the empire can take care of itself if not lady arbuthnot i am afraid it must do without my helpin nushapore goodbye the qualification held all his previous arguments in it and rearoused his own bitterness at his own memories so that as he walked on down the long vista of rooms he felt each wellremembered bit of it to be a fresh injury and his impatience his obstinacy grew at each step why had not grace the sense to believe once for all as he had told her at the very first that hers was not the hand to wile his back to the plough her hand ye gods and he could feel its touch now on his that womans touch so full of possibilities so full of power mr waymond oh mr waymond do please dont go away came jerrys voice from a sideroom used as a schoolroom which opened out from the hall oh please do come and help me wif this im fwaid i dont know somefing i ought to know it never needed much of jerrys voice to cajole any one so the next moment temper or no temper jack raymond was bending over the little figure which perched on a high chair at the table was busy over a map of india hullo young man he said lessons jerry looked at him in shocked surprise why its sunday and ive learned my hymnbout babes an sucklings an such is the kingdom of heaven dont you know an im not llowed to go to church cos mum says im not normal yet dont you fink mr waymond its just orful dull of people always twying to be just the same i like it when mum says im feverish i dweam

long as i do and i did it once too you know weally at least i fink i did though they say i didnt the childs eyes were still over bright his cheeks flushed with the last touches of the sun fever which comes and goes so easily with english children in india and jack raymond smiled softly at the little lad who reminded him so much of his own boyhood even though the remembrance at that particular moment brought a fresh bitterness towards the woman he had just leftthe woman who would have liked as it were to eat her cake and have it and what are you up to now he asked seating himself on the table and looking down at what lay on itthe outspread map a paintbox and a crimsonstained tumbler of waterspoiling the map of india eh i aint spoiling it retorted jerry indignantly im only paintin it wedder mum said i might ill tell you what though young man youll spoil yourself if you suck your paintbrush it came out of jerrys mouth with the usual crimson flag of contrition all over his cheeks its orful hard to wemember when one is finkingfinking of nothin but the wed and yet twyin to play fair play fair echoed jack raymond what game are you playing now jerry oh it isnt a game its weal only i mean the tiddly little bitsjerry his tongue in his cheek was laboriously at work again on rajputana with a brush so surcharged with carmine that it left perfect bloodstains on the general tint of pale yellowi dont want in course to take more n belongs to the queen but they mustnt have the teeniest bit of what belongs to us must they mr waymond i see replied the man slowly you are painting the town red for her majestyi mean the mapisnt it red enough as it is jerry the childin his excitement put down his paintbrush in the middle of bengal as a safe spot not half wed enough an besides theres mistakes an mistakes an the yellow an gween run over the line i dont mind the yellow so much cos we only allow them to be that colour but its dweadful with gween an then theres some orful fings you see that spothe pointed triumphantly to an almost invisible speck of red like a midge bitei made that it wasnt there mum said the map people fought it was too small to put in but its got to be you see so when i give the map to budlubudlus got a little grandson older nor me at school who learns maps and mum said i might give him this oneill tell him it isnt quite the wight size but it may be some time you know perhaps when i gwow up it will be the clear bright eyes grew dreamy as jerry with conscientious care skirted around the possessions of an extremely minor chieftain perhaps echoed the man still more slowly and i expect youd like to make it bigger wouldnt you wather i should think i just would like as mum says her gweatgweatgwandfatherpeoplean yours too she said mr waymonddid just like clive you know an all the people that people wemember the mans face was very close to the childs now as resting his elbows on the table he watched the crimson brush what a jingo you are jerry and if any one were to tryto try and make a really red bit yellow for instanceor even pale pinkwhat would you do jerry went on with his task laboriously i wouldnt let em in course id take away their tumblers an their paintbrushes an everything till they hadnt no excuse an then if they was bad still i d whack em jack raymond rose to go a very sound theory of government young man he said and his voice had an odd ring in it especially the whacking its a pity youre not grownup now jerrywhy arent you jerry looked up with the childs sudden consciousness of a joke and smiled at his friend roguishly why cos you are in course when youre dead ill do it its your turn now oh dont go please you havent told me yet what asked jack raymond pausing with a still odder look on his face jerrys finger travelled carefully down to pondicherry that he said they say it is fwench an its beastly but when i looked in the atlas for fwance colour it was all sortsgweens and blues and yellows and weds all mixed up so please wouldnt it be fair to make it wed too i couldnt help what it looks like could i if i didnt mean cheating my dear little chap replied jack raymond if i were you id paint every blessed bit of it bright scarlet and then suddenly much to jerrys surprise he stooped and kissed the childs puzzled yet open forehead oh fank you said jerry politely mum kisses me like that sometimes and dad too ii like it chapter xxii the better part when jack raymond left jerry painting the map red he was in that curiously illused frame of mind which comes to most of us when a good actionwhich we have steadily refused to dobecomes imperative and ceases therefore to have any virtue save the virtue of necessity when briefly we have neither eaten our cake nor have it he knew perfectly well that sooner or later that daythe later the better to his illhumourhe would go down to the city make inquiries concerning that letter pay for its possessionhere the remembrance of those banknotes ready for use even on a sunday in his pocketbook came to make him swear inwardly at a coincidence that was too much like fate for freedomif needful and then send it to lady arbuthnot he supposed with a polite little note and all because a boy who reminded him of his own boyhood had made him feel that no other course was open to himthat he was bound to do this thingor shoot himself for not doing it the churchbells had just finished chiming as on his way to the club he walked down the mall for the main entrance to government house gave on it and not on the garden mound in his present evil temper even this triviality annoyed him why in heavens name could not lady arbuthnot have let him go as he had come go back to his own lifeto the philosophic peace which had been so pleasant and now what cursed nonsense it was for him to put himself within the reach of disturbing elementsfor they were disturbing if it could even be of any real use to herhere something in his own thought of her so beautiful so good made him realise his position in regard to her still more clearly no despite his respect and her goodness it would not take much to make him passionately in love with her again and would she that was another question but she had not forgotten as he told himself this she and lesley drummond came by in the government house carriage and he paused to let it turn in to the church compound we are dreadfully late im afraid called the former concernedly are you coming was he coming and she could fret herself over being two minutes late good women were really quite incomprehensible especially in india where they did so little to deserve the name the hundred or so for instance in church at that present momentdid they do an atom moreno not half so much as he didfor the good of the world around them or the empireexcept perhaps in supplying it with sons yet there they would be quite satisfied with themselves the thought attracted him he was in no hurry himself to do the thing he knew he must doin fact any delay was welcomeso he turned into the church compound also and stood decorously at the door till the absolution which was being given was over before slipping into the nearest seat next to a very stout old lady whose only claim to be considered even a eurasian was her bonnet but as he had stood for those brief moments looking over the heads of the bowed congregation he had noticed with a sense of the humour of the thing that the percentage of dark blood in the worshippers could be very fairly gauged by their distance from the white robes of the choir boys the good lady beside him however ended the scale of colour for the native christian pur et simple was of course absorbed by the mission churches and the nonchristian native there was no sign of him either no sound of him no thought even of him from beginning to end jack raymond stood up decorously and sat down decorously knelt decorously and listened decorously with a sense of unreality a sense of dislocation from his surroundings that was not much less keen than chris davenants had been when he listened to the society for the general good of peoples at hafiz ahmads house the sermona good one in its waymight have been preached in a london suburb save for this that beyond a little perfunctory solacing of eurasian paupers there was none of the active attempt to carry words into deeds which would have existed in the listeners of a suburban congregation absolutely utterly none not one woman there knew as much as he the idler of the hard povertystricken lives of the people yet these very women when they went home would feel themselves accursed as worldlings if they did not districtvisit or join the charity organisation these considerations did not improve one listeners temper on the contrary they increased his desire for delay for having already warned sir george that in his opinion the city was more unstable than authority seemed to think he washed his hands of that responsibility all he had to do therefore was to get and pay for this paper if needful and so prevent its being made use of against the governmentprevent its being a worry toto jerrys mother he therefore had lunch and a cigar quietly it was in fact close on four oclock when he started riding for the city but at the nearest gate to the bazaar whence the threat of using the information had emanated he gave his pony to the sais bidding him go home since he knew by experience the attention which a european on horseback excites in a native town and without in the least wishing for concealment he had no desire to be followed by gossipmongers the gate in question was that giving on the poor hindoo quarter the glassbangle makers the poultry keepers the burden carriers andin a sort of offshoot halfin halfout of the citythe leather workers that curious class apart from all caste and creed yet necessary to all and from their ignorance their isolation the most difficult to civilise so far jack raymond personally had seen and heard nothing beyond aunt khojees tale as reported by lateefa to give grounds for more than caution but he had not gone a dozen yards down the miserable bazaar which served the neighbourhood before he realised that action might be necessary most of the shops were shut and scarcely a human being was to be seen signsin upsidedown eastern fashionthat the peace of the people was disturbed and it might mean more these signs to be seen of all might have been duly reported to the proper authorities and been disregarded by them but if they had not been so reported there could considering the perfection of organisation for such reports which exists in every native town be but one explanation of the facttreachery he would find out about this he told himself merely for his own satisfaction on his way back since the minor treachery of police constables and such like had its price and he had five thousand rupees in his pocket towards a good deed it would be curious if after all the thought of lesley made him smile goodhumouredly what with the ram rucki and the green sleeves and now this possible good deed it was hopeless to escape that young person he walked on more cheerfully and in a few minutes found himself in the courtyard of dilarams house on his way to govinds den on the second story since hisas yet unknownquarry had given that address the whole house however was so still so deserted that he half feared his journey might be in vain but it was not so the door marked in rough white letterings was ajar and govind yawning dishevelled rose from a corner with an apology of a salaam as his visitor entered the room was almost empty even the printingpress had disappeared gone like all else in the attempt to live upon lies for even with govinds nose for nastiness he had been driven to sell the goodwill stock and block of the ear of the wise to another unwise aspirant towards literary fame his last issue had been the one detailing the horrors of sobrais disgrace and noormahals death to the unusual success of which especially among the mohammedan soldiers in cantonments had been due the unexpected offer to buy the going concern the wouldbe purchaser being a new discontent who having been turned out of a regimental office for falsifying returns was keen on revenging himself by spreading disaffection in the native army govind had naturally jumped at the offer and for two days past had been debauching himself on the proceeds in certain anticipation of more money to come from the sale of something which could no longer be used as copy for he told himself even if his first bold bid for a buyer produced no results almost every native newspaper in nushapore would be glad of anything which might help to damagewhen the proper time camethe good faith of their rulers but now as the figure of a sahib showed at the door his bhangdulled eyes lit up with triumph the next moment however he was murmuring a humble gharibnawaz and wishing that the earth would open and swallow himwishing he had never sent the letter but who could have dreamt of its being answered by rahmansahib oh it is you is it remarked jack raymond recognising an old club baboo whom he had run in for theft of cigars you are govind ram editor are you that simplifies matters i suppose you wrote this and that the talk of knowing a man who knows etc is the usual business you have a paperyou want five thousand rupees for itjust like your cheek youll get two hand it over he made the offer advisedly for he knew the man to have friends in the secretariat knew briefly that he was a likely man to have got holdif not of the lost letter yet of something confidential to haggle with him therefore was mere waste of time more especially as he himself had long since ceased to regard the five thousand rupees he carried about with him as his own money so it might as well goin a good actionand save him bother it did govind who at most had expected five hundred lost no time in producing the paper jack raymond looked at it then at govind you dd fool he said softly i dont think youll find it worth while then he looked at the crumpled document again it was merely a precis as it were written in a clerkly hand of what the rescinded confidential instructions might have been such as any one who by chance had seen themor any scoundrel who had notcould easily have written absolutely unauthentic and of no possible value as proof of anything it was characteristic of jack raymond that the idea of taking back the notes which he had given govind as had been stipulated in advance never occurred to him he was a backer of odds a better of bets he had staked money lightly and lost it so far good but he meant to have his moneys worth hold up you brute he said as govind writhed at the first touch on the scruff of his neck i wont kill you but you shall have the soundest licking you ever had in your life as he spoke the lash of the huntingwhip with which he always rode curled round govinds thin legs making their owner in his sheer animal terror escape from jack raymonds holdstrong as it wasto the floor where he lay on his back his limbs crunched together like a dead crabsa hideous spectacle so hideous that the very licking of such an abject beast seemed impossible huzoor no he gasped no huzoor not that not that i will pay it back i will payi will pay get up you brute and take it decently interrupted jack feeling more decidedly that if the brute would not he would have to give up the sickening business he emphasised his command by another flick with the thong the crumpled crablike terror gave a sort of sob and edged itselfstill on its backtill it could kiss jack raymonds boots frantically not that not that it moaned i will payyea i can pay then in a purely insane fear of physical pain govinds english came back to himo my lord god almighty i can give moneys worthi can give cheapo lord god yes i can telllisten listen so without a pause he burst out into words which first made jack raymond hesitate and thencatching the lash of the whip back into his handpoint to the corner and say sit down there you skunk and tell the truth dont try to escape or i really will do for you the tale which came from between govinds chattering teeth made the listener set his here was confirmation of old khojees story with a vengeance explanation also of the closed shops the empty alleys and the explanation was so natural given an amulet which brought death by the visitation of god at once or in lieu of that death by removal to hospital and subsequent poisoning what more obvious palliativesince gods act must standthan to strike at the works of the devil if by dawn neither hospitals nor doctors remained that would surely mend matters meanwhile in every house to which the cursed charm had gone there must be purification by prayer and fasting by spells and incantations and burnings of the hateful thing it did not need much imagination to picture the scene a narrow court a dead child or husband awaiting dusk for secret removal shuddering excited women hysterical from lack of food listening to the denunciations of officiating priests and mullahs looking at their dead at their livinground whose wrists the amulet had been perhaps an hour beforeand remembering that though half the evil in the future lay with god who was beyond coercion the other half lay with men who were not a reassuring scene in a city whose two hundred and odd thousand inhabitants were curiously unreliable still less so because if those immediately responsible had been true to their salt all this information would have been in the strong hands of authorities hours ago that it had not been so when he left the club jack raymond felt sure why he had seen the city magistrate there reading the illustrated london news who is in it who is working it come hurry up he asked with a significant dropping of the whiplash govind squirmed horribly but protested ignorance it was not that sort of trouble no one had thought of it twentyfour hours ago in spite of all the talk all the misfortunes in spite even of the conspirings it had come of itself that was true the listener knew this sort of thing always did but there were always people to help it on and every hour that had been lost had increased the aiders and abettors by now half the city might be implicated he took out another thousandrupee note and held it out take me to the most likely scoundrel he said briefly you understand govind understood perfectly and from abject terror passed to such infernal such jubilant betrayal that jack raymond put his hands and his whip behind his back in fear of using them for he was going to see this thing through he had still two thousandrupee notes in his bettingbook and that in a native city meant much the only caution necessary being not to bribe the wrong person he passed out into the bazaar with govind feeling a curious sense of power a vast antagonism he would be wise he felt to assure himself absolutely as to the trend any disturbance would take before going with his information to those who could checkmate it for he thought rapidly a few companies of the native soldiers who were at hand could easily stave off action until proper arrangements could be made it is among the railway people protector of the poor said govind fulsomelyhe had reverted absolutely to hindustani its ways and worksthat there is most turbulence for the reason that there is a baboo in charge of works so there is little fear among them then the bengalisthey have a dispensary of their own with a saint who works miracles so they chuprao interrupted jack raymond sternly and remember if you try and throw dust in my eyes ill kill you yet half an hour afterwards he felt that he was no nearer a clear conception of what sort of solid backing these vague threats of violence had than at the beginning every one was only too gladfor sums varying from ten to a hundred rupeesto tell what they knew and what is more to pass the taletelling on but the result was not worth the wasted time he had told himself this should be his last trial that time failed for more when a pure accident put him in possession of certainty he was coming down an almost pitchdark tenement stair some little way behind govind when a door at the turn below opened and a man came out lo govind ist thou well met said the newcomer in a low voice looking no farther than the figure close to him seen in the light from the door be ready for midnight tis to be the generalihospitarl firstall is arranged i have a letter here he was passing on downwards but got no further in speech or step for govindimpelled by a kick from behindfell on him like an avalanche and the next moment jack raymond was beside the heap the letter he said simply give me the letter he had a brief struggle for it since this scoundrel had grit till the buttend of the whip came in savagely handy by that time govind had disappeared rather to jack raymond s relief so leaving the owner of the letter stunned he ran downstairs and put an alley or two between him and the scene of the swift scuffle before looking at his prize since englishman as he was that was no quarter of the city in which to begin violence the letter which was of course in the vernacular was fairly lengthy but he saw enough on the first page to make him turn to the end then with a hurried exclamation take out his watch a quarter to six the next moment he was off as quick as he dared for government house he chose the gate giving on the garden mound as his exit from the city since once there he could run without fear of being stopped as a lunatic or a thief and another reference to his watch following on a swift calculation warned him he had not much time to spare being sunday there were no orderlies in waiting at the office entrance and knowing his way and the way of the place he did not pause to call one but passed on through the house to the entrancehall where some one was certain to be found he was right but the person was not the one he expected it was lesley drummond ready in short skirt for a bicycle ride sir george he said sharply i must see him at once she stared at his hurry his breathlessness sir george she echoed he is not in he has gone to lay the foundationstone of the collegeevery one has gone i only stopped because of jerry not being quite well she paused startled for jack raymond literally threw up his hands in impotent anger fool that he had been to forget of course everybody who could be of any use whatever in this emergency would be spouting rot five miles away on the other side of the city if he had only thought of it before and gone there instead of here there might have been time then to arrange the only plan which was in the least likelyand now what is it mr raymond came lesleys voice let me help if i can he shook his head nobody caneven i cant though i know its the only thingthat it ought to be done at oncethat he broke off with an impatient gestureits no useit cant be helped lesley came a step nearer to him with an odd look of resolve on her face do you mean that it would be wrong of you to do it or that you havent the right i mean is it something you could do ifif you were sir george the quickness of her perception made him say yes frankly would sir george do it if he were here followed sharply he gave another gesture of impatience dont let us play clumps for heavens sake he exclaimed ill tell youthough its no good there is a row on in the city tonightthe native regiment is in iti have a letter hereor at any rate they wont be much help and if once we get fighting in the streets he shrugged his shouldersthe only way is to prevent it starting and moraki is beyond call but theres a wing of the highlanders at fareedabad forty miles down the line if i could have got a wire sent there before the mail passesthe upmail which left here a little agoit could have been stopped and sent back with troops for fareedabad is only an outpostno railway stockso there is only that one chance before midnight there would have been time thenbut now then why dont you send one i yes you you know the cipher you know that sir george would send it pardon me he said recovering his breath recovering his obstinacy his dislike to coercion i am not in the least sure that he would judging by this morning then she wouldlady arbuthnot i mean and youyou are bound to do it for heryou know you are bound i he echoed again yes you she repeated and there was a quiver in her voicebecause you loved each other once oh she didnt tell mei have been learning a lot of things for myself lately and i learned that becausebut that is nothing what i mean is that it hurts her most for she was wrongquite wrongshe spoilt your life perhaps i may be allowed to differ he began stiffening himself again after his surprise but she took no notice of his remark her face was troubled by her own thoughtshe was absorbed in it it has come between you and everything not the regret buti dont know what to call it quitethe value you have put upon it and she has put it too so you want to forget and yet you dont you think it so big a thing that it must be forgottenmade a fuss about but it isnt it isnt really part of one at all ive learned that lately and there is a better wayshe broke off and came quite close to him looking him in the face not to forget and yet not to care do this for her mr raymond do it as you would do it for me here for the first time a faint smile showed in her eyes not on her lips it is a funny thing for me to say perhaps butbut i gave you the ram rucki didnt i and so no matter what else there is in the world that perhaps we cant help i want you to do this for her and for me together as you would for a man as i would do it for a woman she laid her hand on his as she spoke and held it there not in a touch but a clasp andand forgetwhatever else there may bealways he asked steadily forget for you both please she replied quietly for her and for mealways for an instantone short instantthe mans instinctive recognition of womans goodness and kindnessand of something else perhaps which had lain behind the appealmade jack raymond feel as if he must kiss the hand that lay on his then he laid his other one on it returning the clasp but how on earth is it to be done he said frowning as they stood thus like children playing a game the office wont take it without authoritysome ones name couldnt you sent it from herei can signal ive learnedoh such a lot of things that have never been of any real use andno they keep the instrument locked i knowthat wont do ill forge the namei couldand i dont mind he smiled nor ithey cant stop my promotion now but the telegraphoffice will be closed i might get hold of some one perhaps by sayingno for why shouldnt it have been sent from here that question would stump us we might try the railway station yes of course the wire to fareedabad is only a railway one even the regular office could only pass it on by jove thats lucky all round she caught at the idea write it out quickthere are forms in captain lloyds room over there my bicycles ready ill take it how much time have i plenty still he glanced round the room they had just entered and saw another bicycle ill take that and save you lending yours but im coming too she put in swiftly i must im only going while you write to tell the bearer to look after jerryhes in bed alreadywhile im away it wont take long she was down the stairs again as he was wheeling the cycle into the hall the still wet telegram loose in his hand hold that a minute he said that tyre wants a pumpit will save time in the end it wouldnt do to have a smashwould it he spoke quite cheerfully no she replied smiling back as she helped him not if there is going to be a weal wow as jerry calls it something very like one anyhow he answered and you never can tell what may happen if these things arent stopped at once we might have them all over the place by tomorrow morningtrying to pull down the flag perhapswho knows he spoke lightly again but for all that he had thought it worth while to pocket a revolver which had been lying on captain lloyds table and as lesley passed out first with her bicycle he gave a look at the weapon to see how many chambers were loaded that was always a wise precaution so being busy neither of them saw a little figure in a scarlet flannel sleepingsuit which had stealthily followed lesley downstairs a listening little figure with wide grey eyes the next instant those two were careering down the mall fast as wheels could carry them it is a quaint cipher said lesley who hands off was folding the now dry telegram yes replied jack raymond absentlyhe was working out what had to be done i might send it plain but for the cachet of authorityheaven save the markit gives and of course the contents are better not known even by the baboo but im afraid he must know something for i must first of all wire direct to the stationmaster at fareedabad to stop the upmailthere isnt time for the order to go through the magistrate and thats really the thing to make sure of for the downmail doesnt pass fareedabad till midnight and it would take almost as long to get steam up from hereespecially as it is sunday and the railway people all over the place there were not many of them certainly in the wide deserted station which echoed under their hurrying feet indeed barring a few wouldbe native passengers huddled up listlessly in their shawls waiting on the steps outside for the train which experience told them would come sooner or laterfigures common to every railway station in indianot a human being was visible that too was nothing uncommon when trains come four or five times a day at least and the upmail had passed but a short time before so all things were at their slackest after that excitement there must be some one somewhere remarked jack raymond and if not i must break in to the telegraphoffice and you must signal then he laughed you are leading me horribly astray miss drummond i shall be transported for life before i know where i am they will have to transport me too then she said cheerfully but there was no need for felonious entry the telegraphoffice door was open and jack raymond seeing a native clerk asleep inside told lesley she had better remain unseen for the time so she walked up the empty platform with its closed doors and looked down the lessening ribbon of line to the drawbridge pier and came back again absorbed in her own thoughts it was not until she heard the click click of a telegraph instrument clearly audible in the dead silence that she recognised she was passing beyond her goal she pulled up to wait to listen tum what on earth was the man signalling and what symbol was that something she did not know had they a different code no shshkthose she recognised but what a combination was it the cipher no she had seen thatthat was mostly vowels then it flashed upon her that the man was telegraphing nonsensehe was not telegraphing at allhe was against them she had hardly realised this when jack raymond came out there thats done and god go with it he said hurriedly the only thing iswhat had we better do with the baboo he must suspect i have a thousandrupee note left of your money shall i bribe him with it to keep quiet for two hours no she said swiftly savagely you had better kill him he stared he hasnt sent themthe telegrams i meanat least not the last it was all gibberish i was listening he gave a low whistle by jovethen he looked at heryou have been of use his pause was only for a second you d better come in with me and lock the doorwe shall have to see this thing through i expect i remember they told me some of the railway people were in it and if that is so we must prevent them getting wind of this till its too late for them with that he drew out his revolver and went in and lesley following him locked the door behind her chapter xxiii a memorable occasion a memorable occasion the phrase seemed somehow to be inevitable on the further side of the city where as ram nath had foretold all of nushapore that was worth considering was gathered together for the ceremony of laying the foundationstone of the anglovernacular college ram nath may have started the assertion but every one else followed suit sir george in his presidential address the treasurer in his financial statement the distinguished native official whoin proposing the vote of thanks to lady arbuthnot for her able assistancemanaged to drag in the dufferin fund and the benefits of female education by the way so one by one the delegates of the various sects and associations who were blissfully to forget their differences overover this memorable occasion some added a most to it others went so far as to say it marked an era while a peculiarly eloquent speaker went one better by introducing the annals of empire but the point on which they were all agreed wasthat it was a memorable occasion and there was curiously little unreality about the assertion for everybody went about with a noticeable satisfaction that was due to a feeling of duty done it was all infinitely proper also pleasing for when the initial ceremony was over and a pause came for tea between it and the giving of diplomas it was quite a pretty sight to see the mixed multitude walking about admiring and criticising the building that some time or anotherfor funds at the moment were a trifle lowwould be built and this had been made possible by the ingenious and distinctly novel device of laying out the site as a lawn on which narrow beds of flowers followed the lines of the foundations to come while in the centre under what was to be the central dome stood a model large enough to allow the delighted native visitors to creep through it if they chose which had been made of bamboo brown paper and mud plaster by a distinguished toy artist in the city who had had long practice in the making of tazzias for the mohurrum processions he stood beside his latest creation now a perfect incarnation of smile in spotless white robes with a muslin skullcap on his welloiled hair ready to receive congratulations on his work they were many though the english people kept theirs chiefly for the garden i wish i could make my pansies grow as evenly remarked one lady who was devoted to hers as she looked enviously round the readingroom to be that was outlined by a dense border of purple and yellow nothing easier replied the secretarytogovernment who was showing her round cut them to pattern with a footrulethey are only stuck in for the day he pulled up one as he spoke showed it to her rootless then stuck it in again with a laugh it is a regular native dodge they are a at making dreampalaces you know curious isnt it that the mushroom should grow so well in india the most conservative of countries but cheap labour and cheap words are absolutely demoralising stuck in so they are echoed the gardening lady just a regular childs garden but it looks well doesnt it poor things she added stooping to touch a pansy with the caressing touch of the flowerlover but if they were only left alone for a time you know they would soon strike root perhaps admitted the secretarytogovernment dubiously as they drifted off to the teatable where mrs chris davenantwho had presented her bouquet with charming gracewas presiding assisted by chris in his frockcoat with a flower in his buttonhole he was in the eyes of many around him at the pinnacle of prosperity for the lieutenantgovernor as he drank his tea was talking to him as vicepresident yet he did not look happy perhaps because he could catch a glimpse outside the tent of swami viseshwar nath standing apart from the ruck amid the little knot of highcaste hindoos who had brought him there with blandishings and bribes as ocular demonstration of the widespread sympathy and support the college was receiving from all classes of the community and who had promised to be responsible for his bodily and spiritual immunity from defilement by and by chris knew he would have to reckon with that figure whose brown bare shaven head and brown bare legs showed beyond a short salmonpink shirt hung with a rope of big brown beads matching the tint of the skin such an inconceivable incredible figure seen behind that of mrs carruthers in her last paris frock yes by and by chris must make his choice if it had only been for himself that choice it would have been easy but it was for naraini also naraini naraini naraini the thought of her haunted him her very aloofness from such a scene as this the impossibility of imagining her in any part of it held him captive no there was no place here for such as she not even in the tent where a few of the more emancipated wives and sisters and mothers of shark lane were literally on show to the elect and whither lady arbuthnot was at that very moment being conducted by an elate but apologetic husband who was saying with cheerful pomp you will find them very stupid since they have as yet enjoyed small benefit from liberal education but time will show time will show undoubtedly it was showing results already in the foundations of flowers through which the speaker was passing results that were oddly despotic beyond the expectation or control of those who had planted that childs garden the poppies for instance native to the soil as they were had given up the pretence of root the exotic pansies on the other hand winked boldly at the westering sun as at an enemy vanquished it was fate or something beyond fate even here it really remarked sir george almost mechanically is a memorable occasion very indeed assented poor chris realising that it was one at any rate that he was not likely to forget excuse me put in the commissioner coming up hurriedly but if i may sir i should like to have a word with you sir george put down his cup chris moved off and so did the two officials to converse earnestly as they circled round that toy model of the college to come i agree that it is unfortunate admitted sir george pausing at last a trifle impatiently but i refuse to believe there is any immediate likelihood of disturbance it is inconceivable with this going on every one looks content except perhaps the pensioners jehan aziz i notice is absent but that is only decentand one cannot wonder at their annoyance here his glance fell resentfully on mr lucanaster whothe day being sunday when no other entertainment was availablehad honoured the memorable occasion with his presence that has been a most unfortunate business he continued frowning but you will admit that the nawab has on the whole behaved well in allowing both his wifes death and the girls abductionthough i believe lucanaster is as he says out of thatto be hushed up why should he allow it thats what i want to know sir argued the commissioner there is something behind depend upon it and that is never satisfactory with a native the whole thing is fairly maddening just at a time when i wanted to feed the lot on soothing syrupeven the fact that that culpable homicide case in cantonments has to be hung up because the accused is ill with typhoid i wouldnt worry about it though kenyon replied sir george kindly as i told mr raymond this morning raymond echoed the commissioner eagerly what did he say his views are always interesting the kindness vanished something of what you tell me i disagreed with him as i disagree with you however to show you that i have perfect confidence in your discretion and also to back my own opinionfor mind you if i thought there was the very slightest chance of your having to use it i would hesitate to give ityou shall have what you ask for sanction to wire direct to fareedabad after you have seen what the city is like for yourself instead of returning to report it might as you say make the difference of catching the midnight mail though there really is no he shrugged his shoulders tolerantly however you had better have it in order he continued taking out his pocketbook and pencil with a certain elaborate patience and finally with a return to his usual kindly manner holding out a duly signed and dated servicetelegram there he said with a smile i carry forms about with me these times now mind this is a personal favour for tonight only kenyon i wouldnt do as much for any one else in india and it is only to sot your mind at ease you can bring it back to me when you come to report and now for heavens sake let us get over this diploma business i only wish i could come with you to the city but i must see this show through so while the hoofs of the commissioners horse as he rode citywards with the chief of the police and the magistrate who had brought the disturbing rumours echoed down the hard white road which was laid so evenly between a double row of mud roundels protecting lately planted trees the showas sir george had called itbegan it was rather like a schoolprizegiving with men and women instead of children for the inevitable table covered with the twopennyhalfpenny phulkari made for the european market which with its sham orientalism has on such occasions replaced the honest red office baize was set in front of sir george and lady arbuthnot on it were three packed posies in green glass tumblers a pile of diplomas duly made out in the recipients names and another pile of sham oriental brocade bags in which to keep them you belong of course said the secretarytogovernment who was standing apart during the opening speeches to a sunburnt little lady in a wide pith hat who i she answered cheerfully oh dear noi am not often in at headquarters and i get on all right with my schools and that sort of thing without it so it doesnt seem worth while perhaps not replied the man of headquarters once more dubiously it was impossible for him to avoid that attitude towards much that had to pass through his hands so he set the doubtful point aside and listened to the presidents certainties as he enlarged on the great need for closer ties of friendship and sympathy between the rulers and the ruled and the excellent results to be expected from meetings of this kind then of course some one else spoke and some one else and outside the lawn enclosed with grass hurdles and set with those foundations of flowers india was going on its way as it had gone untouched by change for thousands and thousands of years and two women furtively sweeping up a prize of horsedroppings on the outskirts of the assemblage in order to make them into fuel talked as they swept of the amulet that had promised safety and brought death will you come please and form up in line said a steward fussily collecting his candidates among the listening circle it will look better and save time oh dear i hope i shant get put next a native murmured one little lady quite plaintively as she obeyed the secretarytogovernment who overheard the remark smiled still dubiously he smiled again and so did some others when mrs chris davenant came up to receive a diploma whichit had occurred to her astutenessmight be worked to her advantage in english society perhaps the reflection that she had already shown her willingness to enter into social relations with the other race was accountable for these smiles but she herself and chris too were quite grave over it the latter indeed could not at the moment have been otherwise over anything in heaven or earth for not five minutes past as he stood dully indifferent on the edge of that circle of listeners he had felt a touch on the sleeve of his frockcoat heard a low voice tonight krishn at the circling of the lights in kalis shrine we meet there her priests and his to settle this matter and thou must be there also he had not turned to see who the speaker was he had known all too well for the moment he could have laughed aloud at the hideous incongruity of it with viva standing there waiting for her diploma it was growing late the light atoms were trooping in streams across the western sky crowding closer and closer into rays as they sought shelter from the coming darkness in the sinking sun there was a great hush over all things in which grace arbuthnots voice as she read out the names of the recipients could be distinctly heard a hush not a silence that cannot come within earshot of a great city it has taken longer than i thought remarked one of the stewards yawning whenat long lastthe list came to an end gracious exclaimed mrs chrishorrified at the watch mr lucanaster showed her sulkilywe shall be late here chris take this thing while i put on my jacket she thrust the diploma into her husbands hand and left it there as she hurried into the dusk after mr lucanaster who had gone to search for his dogcart jerry will be fast asleep i expect said grace arbuthnot regretfully as she settled herself in the carriage beside sir george for i told lesley to put him to bed early and give him some bromide oh there is nothing the matter with him george only you know he gets a little overexcited sometimes when he has a touch of fever and bromide sets him off to sleep nicely i am sorry lesley couldnt come this afternoonit must have been dull for her at home dull however was the last word lesley drummond would have applied to that afternoons experience when she had followed jack raymond into the telegraphoffice at the station she had simply obeyed orders not knowing in the least what was going to happen he had however he had walked straight up to the clerk who had turned deadly greygreen at his reappearance and seized him by the throat so that violence was over and the offender in collapse on the stool behind him by the time that lesley had locked the door and looked round will you come here please jack raymond said to her quietly youll find a pencil and paper i expect on the tableand where is the cipher telegramoh therethat will do now baboo telegraph that right will you miss drummond if you will look over and tick the letters off as he signals them and let me know when he makes a mistake illill settle it he drew the revolver out of his pocket as he spoke and stood to one side to let those two pass to the instrument of course baboo he continued the lady whounfortunately for youcan signal could do it herself but i prefer that you should do what you are told do you understand the greyness and the greenness became almost deathlike and lesley drummonds colour forsook her also would it be a deathwarrant she would have to give by looking up and saying wrong it might be his facethe face she was accustomed to see so carelesslooked stern enough now even for that yet it might be needful this treacherythere had not been time to exchange a single word about itmight mean so much but he would know how much and so be able to judge yet as she bent over the telegram ticking theto herunmeaning cipher off letter by letter she felt that her heart echoed that uneven shudder of the handles and she felt that jack raymonds eyes upon her as he watched for a sign were like the eyes of fate would she have to give that sign and if so what would happen there was no thought of pity for the man in her mind only a great dread a horrible apprehension of this responsibility for herself yet it must be so she knew that though the words dontdont please dontoh dont be a fool came constantly to the very verge of her lips is that all asked jack raymond when a longer pause than usual came she felt quite sick and giddy with relief as she noddedfor even now she feared lest a look up might be construed into a sign i ought to have told youbefore you beganthat his sort arent obstinate he went on observantly there is no fear ofof thatmiss drummond so now please for the stationmaster and i think it will be better to tell them not to wire back there are evidently railway men in this affair besides we mustnt risk being found out too soon must we so extreme caution and utmost secrecy is our gamethe great thing is to get the troops started before we are found out found out lesley had hardly realised that view of the matter as yet and the thought gave her a qualm yet she went on checking the baboos signals and the brief answers that were asked for just to show that the orders were understood when that was over jack raymond looked at the baboo distastefully then turned to the girlim puzzled what to do with him he said in french whereat the baboo seemed to give up all hope of escape and sank in a dejected heap on the floor rocking himself backwards and forwards and murmuring i quite innocent manoh my lord innocent as suckling babes until jack bid him be quiet it is no use wasting time by trying to find out how far he is in it he would only lie and i know enough for the present as i told you coming along the danger is in the native regiment refusing to keep order if they are asked to do so that would be mutiny and the knowledge of the penalty would make the men reckless and there mightexcuse mebe the devil of a row what we want to do is to avoid the necessity for asking them by having other men available they wont be wanted before ten oclock at earliestthe rush on the hospitals was to be about midnight the fareedabad fellows should be here at latest by nineplenty of time and if we let sir george and co know what we have done by say eight oclock that should do it is no use giving ourselves away too soon and the thing we have to make certain of is that the fareedabad men do come up to time now i could tie the baboo up and lock the door on him but how am i to guard against the likelihood of fellowconspirators coming to look after him they might get to sending telegrams they may be sending them now through the other office for all i know in which case they must be stopped here at any rate this man must have been on his guard against any communication with fareedabad or he would not have been so sharp in fact if we had gone to the post office he would never have repeated our message for as i told you the only wire to fareedabad is the railway one that i expect is why he was on duty however im inclined to think we had best stop here for a time and make certain of course if one of us could stop and the other go it might be best but i cant do without youa message might come through any moment and i should be in his hands the brutehe thought himself quite safe and would have been but for you you locked the door didnt you he walked over to it however to make sure of the fastening and then pushed the heavy office table across it they may have duplicate keys and i dont want them inside he explained then he stood for a moment looking at the girli m awfully sorry but you wont mind i know i wonder if there is a cushion anywhere to make you more comfortable no but a ledger will be better than the bare floor he took one or two and placed them behind the table now if you dont mind sitting down there where i can see you and nobody else caneven if we have to open the shutterthat will do nicely then he turned to the heap in the corner now get up baboojee he said politely and resume your duties you can sit on that stool if anybody comes along keep quiet and dont open the shutter till i give the signal then you can transact business as usual but mind if you try it on again the misssahiba will warn me and i willwarn you he laid the revolver ostentatiously on the table thenborrowing the baboos comforter which was hanging on a peghe sat down at the table in a beautifully babooesque attitude with his legs twined round his chair will i do he asked gravely of lesley when he had finished making himself a smokingcap out of black transferpaper and she could not help laughing softly i assure you it is very serious he said smiling also and im awfully sorry to keep you but you ought to get back in time for dinner dinner she echoed a trifle hurt surely dinner is a minor matter never besides i hope to god we are both going to have a good dinner tonight for that meanssuccess there is no earthly reason why there should be a row you know if we see this through and the troops come up to time he paused lost in his own previsions well he said finally we had better not talk a natives bare feet are more inaudible than our whispers and it wont do to be found out sosteady it is for an hour or so an hour lesleys heart sank after the first ten minutes they seemed interminable to her seated on the ledgers behind the table she could just see jack raymond at the other end of it his head down on his crossed arms was he dozing as likely as not he was just that sort while her nerves were quivering the action had been well enough the excitement of that had carried her with it but now what if mr raymonds estimate of the danger had been excessive he had once long ago fired on a mob in too great haste at least government had thought so what had possessed her in a moment to trust his judgment absolutelyto cast in her lot with his as it were unreservedly she blushed even in the darkness that was fast obscuring all things at the thought you had better light the lamp baboo there is one isnt there by your desk came his voice calmly then he was not asleep and he was very kind but if they were found out if they asked her why she had done this thing what would she answer what could she say to grace arbuthnot who had been wiser even though she had loved the lamp flared up under the baboos trembling fingers and showed her face you poor child came his voice again im bitterly sorry but it cant be long now andand lets hope for that good dinner she was glad of the jesting finish glad that the lamp went out this time under those trembling fingers when it flared up again she was ready to be more cheerful and it was an easier task after that for the deadly quiet passed and the thrill came into life again making her forget the questionwhat if they should be found outin the possibility of being found out all too soon for some one tried the handle of the door hurriedly called loudly on mohun ditta to come out and report then after a time departed with curses you had better open the shutter baboo said jack raymond and go on not exactly as if i wasnt herethat mightnt be safe under the circumstancesbut as if you were thinking of your pension yes sir bleated the baboo i will do best endeavours to please so silence fell again to be broken by another step outside clearly an english step making the listener at the table look up as the steps died away here baboo send this off quick came an english voice and jack raymond had hard work not to look round but the wire was only to lay odds on a race in calcutta and even the strain of listening for each unknown letter did not come to lesley for the baboo showed the adaptability of his kind by reading out the words loudly and saying is that right sir to the sender i hope so baboo said the english boy with a laugh or i shall be stony broke so the steps died away once more only twenty minutes left remarked jack raymond as silence fell again but not for long the first voice came backthis time to the shutterfull of reproaches and the frantic anxiety of the baboo to keep the conversation within bounds and prevent anything absolutely incriminating from cropping up made one listener smile as he sat pretending to copy waybills into a ledger and when the voice passed on and he turned to look he laughed outright to see the wretched creature mopping the perspiration off his forehead had about enough he began then paused for an imperative kling kling rang out from the electric bell asking if the line is clear said lesley from her post and jack raymond rose and stretched himself then thats over the train has reached bahana and we can goandand face the rest he held out his hand to help her to rise face it could she she hesitated and at that moment a step sounded outside rapid with a clink in itthe clink of spurs here baboo said a guttural northern voice this for dispatchberung bearing sirkari take it fooli have no time to loseand give receipt there was a pause then the clink of spurs passed again and jack raymond who had slipped into his chair crossed to the desk looked over the baboos shoulder at the telegram which was in cipher and turned to lesley smiling perhaps we shant have to face it after all they are sending to fareedabad off their own bat well better late than never there was a ring of bitterness in his voice you mean began lesley who had crossed too and now stood looking down at the official signature below the cipher with a half comprehension that they will be a bit surprised when the troops turn up at nine but stay we can dodge them a bit baboo what time was this telegram given in the baboo glanced at the clock a quarter to eight sir nothing of the kind contradicted jack raymond in a tone of voice which turned his hearer greygreen once more it came in atlet me see what is the latest i can give ittwenty minutes to seven fill that in baboo and file itnot there you foolbelow the other onethat didnt come in till halfpast you wont forget these facts will you if you dont ii wont remember that you made a mistake in telegraphing at first do you understand now miss drummond you should have just time to get home and dress for dinner after he had pushed away the table and unlocked the door she followed him out into the still almostdeserted station without a word a lamp or two had been lit at the farther end a group of coolies lounged closer in a light showed from an office ill bring the cycles said jack raymond and she passed out from the semidarkness and shadow into the clear dusk beyond and stood waiting full of a vague amazement at herself and all things behind the long line of sheds the overhanging bastion belonging to the royal pensioners rose dark against the sky where the sunset still lingered pale flawless but the risen moon turned the slanting silhouette into a reality of brick and mortar and the dark spots crowning it to the figures of men and overhead those specks in the pearl grey were kites for the sovereignty of airdelayed by the necessity for some of the competitors appearing on the memorable occasionhad not yet been awarded five or six kites still floated for the supremacy and many a pair of dark eyes watched them wondering which would soar the longest and gain the kingship lateefas most of all as in his capacity of kitemaker to the royal family he pulled in each kite as it sank and added it to the bundle of the vanquished only six kites left and one of them carried the sign of kingship with a vengeance for he had been too late as he had feared he would be in his visit to the courtyard six kites and which of them held the ring no wonder his eyes never left those hovering specks that still defied the falling dew but lesley looking at them also scarcely realised that they were kites she was absorbed by her own mean miserable lack of backbone she had shrunk she told herself from the possibility of having to face failure handinhand as it were with jack raymond and now she shrank from losing her hold on his success or was it her hold on himthe man himself you will just have time if you scorch he said in cheery haste as he came down the steps im going round first to see if those in authority know all i do if they do they cant help falling into line withwith our plans and we can fall out but i shall suggest that if by chance the upmail was a bit late the fareedabad people might have taken advantage etc it will be as well to prepare the way for the troops arriving before theyre supposed to have startedhe paused at the look on her face at least i can do so of course if you would rather not back outbut as far as im concerned i think it would be better to lie low until the rows over at any rate afterwards it may be necessaryor you might wish she shook her head hastily as she mounted goodbye he said holding out his hand andandyour way is better miss drummond better as she sped through the warm peaceful dusk she felt herself a fraud for she could have cried because it was all overbecause she was losing her hold on him but everything was a fraud the peaceful dusk most of all since its peacefulness held danger perhaps death not unknown unlookedfor but expected appraised the gong was sounding as she raced up to the portico a carriage stood at the door some guests for the sunday dinnerparty were stepping out of it she would be horribly late and what excuse could she make to lady arbuthnot none was needed as she came out of her room again after an incredibly short space of time and ran downstairs she overtook grace coming from hers oh lesley she said turning as she fastened her bracelet i wanted to see you and i havent had a moment since i came in sir george is called outthe commissioner met us on our way back it is trouble in the citybut george has sent for troops and they say it will pass over as it was taken in time but of course no one is to knowso george remember has a touch of fever and everything is to go on as usual i mim very sorry said the girl lamely sorry echoed grace im not sure if i am i felt it would come and im glad oh so glad that george was so prompt it will be well over and it must be so for it was taken in time you see by the bye how was jerry this afternoon i only had time to glance in at the door as i ran up to dress but he didnt stir so he must have gone to sleep all rightneedham said he hadnt been talking lesley who had not had time even for that glance felt relieved oh he was very happy i put him to bed and gave him what you left before i went out on my cycle the next moment she had passed into the circle of expectant guests in the drawingroom and was adding her apologies for being late to lady arbuthnots bicycling is a very wholesome exercise gravely remarked the young assistantin for a saturday to monday from an outstationwho took her in to dinner very she replied as gravely telling herself that a vertebrate creature had some excuse for not being able to control its backbone when it was uncertain if it had to stand on its head or its heels chapter xxiv the sovereignty of air after lesley had gone home to dinner and jack raymondin quaint contrastwas off to make certain that a rising in the city was expected before long the station settled down once more into the silence and slackness of betweentrain time on a sunday evening the listless passengers to be it is true still sat in groups on the steps outside and every now and again some onewho ought to have been on duty and was notgave a look in and went off again once indeed an assistant stationmaster called at the telegraphoffice perfunctorily but the baboo had by that time recovered from his paralysis of terror and begun to see his own advantage clearly true he had so far been in with the conspirators as to have promised his collaboration should the authorities be enough on the alert to use the telegraph to fareedabad but in doing so he had thought himself safe from detection he had not been so but now he had once more a hope of safety that wild horses would not have dragged him to lessen therefore the assistant stationmaster went as he had come in ignorance of anything unusual up on the turret of the bastion too which abutted on to the river only a few yards from the first bridgepier and which therefore gave full on the station the kiteflyers went on with their match undisturbed jehan was there and burkut ali together with most of the royal family the former jubilant because his kite was one of those still defying the falling dew and lateefa was there also his pile of vanquished kites growing steadily he sat on the ground beside it his slender hands crossed over his knees his thin acute face upturned it had an odd amusement on it and every time he rose to pull in a fresh victim his high trilling voice quavered of oughts and naughts and on the bathingsteps also down on the other side of the terraced track which ran between them and the turret there was peace they were in fact emptier than usual at that hour for the circling of the sacred lights must be nigh at hand since the priests were already coming for the office among them viseshwar nath the baboo saw him and salaamed at the unusual sight whenwith his wholehearted betrayal of everything likely to be a personal disadvantagehe walked out beyond the station to satisfy himself that the signalman obeyed his instructions for realisingas he sat on his stool still trembling with fear lest by any mischance the soldiers should not come in time and he be blamed for itthat it was necessary to have line clear for the unexpected train he had sought out the right man and told him that a special from the north had just been wired to pass through nushapore in half an hour on its way south so he stood watching waiting to see the red light change to green on the towerpier and catch the first echo of that change in the far distance at the other end of the bridge and as he stood he beguiled his fat body and mind from a faint remorse by telling himself that under the circumstances he was doing the wisest thing for his own party alsothat party of progress which had seized on the ignorant alarm of the herd as a fitting time in which to record their own protest against illegal tyranny since if their plans had been blown upon they were better postponed he heaved a sigh of relief therefore when the signal line clear go ahead showed close at hand and far off but at the same moment he heard a step behind him and turned hastily to see chris davenant chris still in his frockcoat and with a flower in his buttonhole with his wifes diploma of membership in the guild for encouraging intercourse between the rulers and the ruled also in his pocket for he had not been home since he left the memorable occasion neither to the home in shark lane nor the home in the city nor that betwixtandbetween home in the garden of plantains in a way they all claimed him and yet they were all alike insufferable impossible to the man himself looking round his world there was but one thing which brought no sense of revolt with it and that was his work he felt that if he could leave not one thing but all things behind him save this life might still be endurable and so when the foundations of flowers freshened for the time into a promise of stability by the romance of moonlight were deserted alike by the rulers and the ruled he had almost mechanically wandered off to the scene of that work and had ever since been strolling up and down among the general litter and order of his new goods station it soothed him the sight of the piles of brick that would fall into line after his plan the whole paraphernalia brought together to give form to his ideaan idea which would take shape bit by bit according to his will as surely as the sun would risecomforted him and yet it brought no strength for the moment that was coming as surely halfpast eight and at nine the circling would begin half an hour leftfor it would not take him a minute to reach the templesthey were close enough close god in heaven they were too close was it possible to escape from them was there foothold for an honest man between them and the palace of lies in which he had lived so long was there only half an hour left for decision and he had not argued out the matter with himself at all he had only felt he must think and that seemed impossible out here with the moonlight showing each rib of the skeleton roof each tier of bricks waiting for the next and above those black girdersso strong so tensewere the faint stars and among themwhatkites he gave a bitter laugh and told himself that he must get away from fancies into facts he would go into the little galvanised iron shed dignified by the name of the office and there with pen and paper before him think the matter out solidly yes with pen and paper he had always been at his best with them and the memory of many an examination was with him idly as he walked across the line to the station on the other side of it to borrow a light but the only onesin the telegraph and the assistant stationmasters officeswere behind closed doors and so seeing a figure at the end of the platform outlined against the distant dimness of bridge and river he went on towards it i want a lamp baboo bring one over to my office i have to look up some figures he said curtly for the excuse had brought back the memory of something else that he had promised to see to in the works and janalishans advice having come back also made him speak more after the manner of the master than usual thatand the frockcoat possiblyproduced an instant and almost servile obedience on the part of the baboo whose mind was still in that state of dissolution which crystallises round the least thread of authority so the lamp being brought chris sat down and tried to figure out facts taking it from the point of abstract right and wrong to begin with he leant his head on his hand and thought but five minutes after had to pull himself up from a vague regret that already he had failedhe had held back informationthough he had promised mr raymond who had always been so kind what a fool he was what had these personal details to do with it he bent himself to his task again right and wrong higher and lower yet when by chance he looked at the paper before him on which he had been idly jotting down the heading of his subject it was not right or wrong higher or lower that he saw it was naraini he stood up then and faced himself and her he could marry herviva would not mindshe could not help it anyhow she had taken the risk what if he did and thenthen went back on the prieststhen chose for a moment he stood tempted as he had never been tempted in his life before and then the door burst open and the baboo stuttering blubbering in his haste almost fell at his feet oh sir come you are nearest in authority come and issue order sharp you are master sir stop them or this poor devil of baboo is lost issue order sir and stop them from the bridge the bridge echoed chris completely at fault what bridge drawbridge sir almost shrieked the baboo and express train coming instanter oh what can do oh this poor devil this poor innocent devil he was grovelling now and chris bade him stand up and speak urdu almost as jack raymond had bidden govind but as he listened to the baboos words each one each phrase did not translate itself into a definite aspect of the one central fact that had to be reckoned with and so when the tale ended in fresh blubbers he was not ready to acthe had to think the very keenness of his intellectual apprehensionclaimed clear perception of all points and he hesitated as he recapitulated them trouble expected in the cityah about the amulets no doubtwhy had he not spoken troops sent for to fareedabad and coming sooner than the authorities expected how could that be coming in a few moments and the fact of their having been sent for leaking out through the second telegram the commissioners telegram why had there been two telegrams ob lord god moaned the baboo reverting to english at this question because this poor devil of a baboo one fool yet doing duty sirgetting line clear go ahead all serene till kuzai fellows come bribing signalman for midnight train so discovering special beat this poor body to bruisesoh sir issue orders issue orders chris in a whirl stood aghast issue orders what orders yes sir ah come and see sir and issue orders moaned the baboo again come and see well he could at least do that he dashed out at the door and followed breathlessly by the baboo cut across the line as he did so a figure crouching by the telegraphoffice ran towards the bridge end of the station in the moonlight he saw the mans face and recognised him as one of his butchers gang he pulled up short the consciousness that this was something in which he could be no mere onlooker but one in which his part must be played as that mans superior officer coming to him and as he paused looking down the narrowing ribbon of steel he gave a quick gasp of comprehension all lay silent peaceful but against the dark shadow of the piertower a darker shadow was rising and below it that narrowing ribbon of steel ended sharp square as if cut off with a knife the drawbridge was being raised yet above it the green light of safety the signal line clear go ahead shone bright and was echoed from the faint moonshine and the deepening dark over the river and troops in a special train were almost due at the very moment indeed a sudden ringing of an electric bell from the telegraphoffice could be heard distinctly in the silence the sound seemed to finish the baboo he squatted down on the rails murmuring oh flagstation now oh coming instanter oh please master issue orders no not orders something beyond orders surely who was itwas it he himself in a different lifewho had been through this before with some one who had said but we dont let em no sir two men if they was men ud keep that pier a christian country for a tidy time but he was only one for that thing at his feet was not a man the old northcountry contempt for the downcountry swept through chris as fiercely as contempt for the east sometimes sweeps through the west as no doubt it sweeps through the east for the west how many were there he asked swiftly of the gang i mean too many moaned the baboo oh sir too many for one poor man therefore vis et armis forced into telling truth on compulsion because they knowing already of train and troops little knowledge became dangerous thing causing grievous hurt how many reiterated chris fiercely dont men in buckram he could not help the quotation even then five or six and the man who had run forward was one left as a scout of course and that must be another in the shadow of the city wall close to the gap say three or four then on the bridgepier and behind him he turned citywards then realised that ifif the pier was to be held as a christian country it would not matter how many men were on this side of the drawbridge provided those three or four on the pier could be reckoned with if the next moment still uncertain what he should do to gain his object yet intellectually certain of that he had run along the platform swung himself over the low parapet of the retainingwall and dropped on to the bathingsteps the top of which was here not six feet below the level of the line and below him again the temple of mai kali rose out of the levels of the river rose from the sunken ridge of rock on which farther out in the deeper stream the drawbridge tower was built the ridge along which he must pass since he was no swimmer if he was to gain that iron ladder there were lights in the temple twinkling lights in his headlong rush downwards he could see the manyarmed bloodred idol between the figures of those circling round it with the sacred lamps and that compelling clang of the temple bell was in his ears yet he did not pause he was on the threshold when it was barred by viseshwar nath not yet krishn not yet the penance first the vow first it is not that gasped chris forgetful of the possibility nay the probability that what to him was dire misfortune might be to this man a very different thing it is treachery murder a train is due they have raised the drawbridge look and let me pass the drawbridge half a dozen worshippers grouped about the plinth heard the words and looked bridgewards so did the swami and seized his advantage take thy shoes from off thy feet krishn davenund he called in a louder voice and vow the vow first the circling priests within paused at the sound and crowded to the temple door the scattered worshippers curious at the strange sight closed in round the figure in the frockcoat the figure in the saffronshirt yet there was something stranger to come for from within pushed to the front at a sign from the swami came two more figures a widow her face hidden in her white shroud a slender slip of a girl with hers hidden in her bridal scarlet chris fell back from the sight with a cry choose quick krishn choose how could he choose when behind those shrinking figures which meant so much to him he could see that which in a way meant more for hidden in the arched shadows of the temple wafted to him in the perfume of incense and fading flowersyes symbolised even in the redarmed idolwas the great mystery of right and wrong higher and lower which had haunted him all his life it was years since he had stood so close to these eastern expressions of a worldwide thought and the old awe came back to him at the sight choose how could he choose between old and neweven between viva and naraini were they not the same were they not both now then guvnor wot ave you lost this time came a cheerful voice and with it the sound of shod feet running down the steps you jes put a name to wot you want done an im blamed if the best a copperbottomed as ever was allmarked janalishan paused for chris with another crya cry that had a ring of appeal in it like a lost childshad caught at the newcomers hand desperately while he pointed with his other to the gap the bridge he cried in frantic haste look the gang the kuzais have got at it there is a train signalled a train he was going on but that was enough for janalishan more than enough he had wrenched his hand away turned to look for some weapon and found one found it in the sodawater bottle closely netted round with twine prolonged into a cord handle which pilgrims carry so often and which hung on the wrist of one close by him the next instant it was whirlinga veritable deathdealerround his head as he dashed forward among the little knot of people outside the temple and the whole strength of his splendid voice rose echoing over the steps in a triumphant chant i was not born as thousands are there was a free path so far where god was never known he paused here in the narrow entry to say stand back my darlins we aint got no quarrel with you and then facing the priests inside to call back now for it siruse your fists on the ramrammers if they tries to stop yer and taught to pray a useless prayer the words were broken a bit by blows an oath or two yells and desperate scuffling untilbreathless but continuousthe chant rose again among the shadows and the incense to blocks of wood and stone here janalishan clear of all his adversaries save the swami who stood with upraised hands barring the way before the image of mai kali pushed the former aside and aimed a passing swing at the latter the crash of a fall mingled with his gay yoicks forred gone away gone away and the next moment closely followed by chris he was through the temple and waistdeep in the water beyond mums the word now sir he whispered whenafter having given chris a heft up to the lowermost rung of the iron ladder which hung on the pierhe swung himself up by sheer strength and then paused for breath how many on them are there i wonder not more than four or five whispered chris as he climbed the man behind him made no answer but chris could hear him mutter the old complaintit dont give a fellow a chanstit dont really so stealthily they were on the bridge in the rear of the tower like a thief in the night sir whispered janalishan approvingly of that day an hour as it say in oly writthats the ticket an you lay a holt on somethin andy sir even a broken bricks better nor trustin to providencetheres a biggish bit on the track sir anan dont waste time killin its the bridge we want not the butchers now for it were there four or five of them or fifty in the almost pitch darkness of the little inner room chris never knew it was a confused struggle short sharp silent till suddenly john ellisons voice called thatll do sir ive bagged three on em and cant find no more now to business he was out as he spoke in the dim light to lay his ear to the rails and as he listened he smiled to see a couple of figures scudding for bare life along the single rails as only coolies can do in hope of shelter from the coming train in the safety halfway across the bridge ave to be nippy my sons he remarked affably as he rose more leisurely and from habit dusted the knees of his trousers as he turned to look stationwards but what he saw there made him stop the dusting and swear under his breath a little crowd had gathered on the farther side of the gap a hostile crowd armed with sticks and stones and with more for a bullet whizzed past between him and chris who had followed him out and the sharp report of a rifle roused the echoes of the city wall and roused also a sudden sense of strain of anxiety in thousands within the wall thousands till then ignorant that disturbance was in the air or at least that it could come so soon even on the turret amid the schemers and plotters readyperhaps inevitablyto fall in with any quarrel this was so for something else had been in the air absorbing the attention some of those there had remarked it is true on the raising of the drawbridge but others had been ready to tell of the day not long ago when it had been so raised and lowered many times without cause and without result so the attention of all had reverted to the two kites which now remained overhead among the faint stars they were jehans andsince little saadut had resigned his claimthat of the next heir to all things or nothingness a coincidence which by its hint of fatefulness had kept interest keener than usual even lateefa beside his balloonlike bundle of the vanquished was beginning to wonder if aunt khojee had been true prophet and jehans creator meant to give him back his honour but at that rifleshot all else was forgotten and all crowded to the parapet back sir back shouted janalishan roused beyond silence as he grasped a fresh danger and the crowd recognising the new turn of affairs broke silence also in a deeptoned murmur on which a shriller sound rose sharplythe distant whistle of an engine and chris as he dashed back to shelter felt a faint quiver in the linked ribbon of steel beneath his feet shes on the bridge sir said janalishanthere was breathless hurry in his voice but absolute certainty as he felt hurriedly in his pocket for a matchbut we must wait a bit if we looses off till the last minute them kusseyesll swarm over oh jes wait till i gets a holt of themsneakin cold chisels wont be in this job he had the match lit his watch out arf a minute gone say an it takes a cool four minute on the bridge slowin her off an shehe laid his hand on the lever crank of the hydraulic liftkin do it in fifty seconds two and a arf left say for it wont do to miss the train this journeybut you look ere siryou give the timecreep round to the back and keep your heye on the distancesignalwhen she falls sing out and illhe clasped the crank tighterdo sandow and he added to himself as chris disappeared you can talk your ikbally rot all you know tonight you can you fools for it wont come up to sampleno it wont then as if the reminiscence had brought another with it he began softly on the song which he had sung that day on the bridge the song of surplicechoir days he had learned it with an organ accompaniment and a sound was to be heard now growing louder and louder that like a deep organ note seemed to set the whole world aquivering even the very ground beneath his feeta rumble and a roar with a rhythmic pulse in it they are trying to get a rope over shouted chris in two placesfrom the bastion as well janalishans hand left the crank for a second he was out at the door looking not citywards but bridgewards and then he laughed laughed in the very face of a monstrous form with red eyes and a flaming mane coming steadily at him theyll ave to be nippier than they is general he called back his hand once more waiting for its task as he continued his song trees where you sit shall crowd into a shaaa the dainty little runs mellow perfect paused when the wire connecting the distancesignal with the station thrilled like a fiddlestring as the signal fell and chris davenants now followed sharply but they went on again in the darkness backed by that growing rumble and roar is it working i cant hear the water my god if it isntwhat is to be done the brown hand that had found a place on the crank also trembled against the white one do we done our best sir an shes a lydy so the odds is fair aaaaaaa trees where yousit shall crowd intooashade done our best the words blending with the tender triumph of those final bars were in chris davenants ears but a few seconds yet they brought a strange dreamy content with them till janalishan almost before the last note he had learned in his whiterobed days ended burst into a regular yell of relief as the resistance on the crank lessened ceased shes down or nigh it now for the fun and the fightin sir now to see them blamed kusseyes clear of the clamour of confined sound in the little room his voice rose in a laugh as to gain a standpoint on the wider ledge beyond the archway he dashed followed by chris right in front of the thundering engine which was already so close that the glare of its red eyes shone full on their reckless figures as the scream of the dangerwhistle rang out shrill and sharp not in warning to them only not even to the crowd in front that had parted as it were mechanically leaving the steeledged ribbon of rail in its midst clear to the station it was for the long links of carriages behind out of which heads were already craning to catch the first glimpse of the fun and the fighting to which they had been summoned so hastily for there was danger ahead to every one behind the girders of the drawbridge were still slightly aslant they had barely closed into the sockets and beside these a group of halfnaked figures were busy over what janalishan guessed in a second that they were trying to prevent a further closing they were trying to derail the train and he was off like an arrow across the narrow bridge hidden by the clouds of steam that rose in an instant from the curbed monster as the brakes the valves were jammed home hard in the effort to stop it chris could not understand the cry that came back through the steamdrop it you devils thems my cold chisels but as ever he followed on the others heels halfscalded halfdeafened followed blindly until in the clearer air beyondas yetthat snorting sliding resistless fate behind him he saw that the group about the sockets had scattered at the mere sight of that reckless onslaught all but one figurethe figure of the biggest bully of the butchers gang janalishans sworn foethat with a yell of absolute hate had run out as recklessly to bar the way janalishan gave a shout as he closed with it for the man was a noted wrestlernone o yer buttins an booins fight seeda or it aint there was no time for more words since this was no place for a wrestling matchthis narrow platform with the river below it and scarcely room upon it for a man with steady nerves to stand slim and let a fierce shadow with a screaming voice pass in a roar and a rattle and such a fierce shadow half hidden in the steam fog was sliding on battling against the curb thundering shaking the track with brakes down so close dear god so close chris gave a desperate cry of fear and couragebut was beside those two and so was the red glare of the angry eyes seen through the steam clouds so was the scream of the whistle heard above the roar and the rattle now then sir heave yohoyoho ho yoho ho the enginedriver craning from his cab heard so much beyond that fog of steam the officers in the first carriage heard a brief keep your head sir and git a holt of me only those voices no more then everything was lost in an awful grating sounda sound of iron grinding iron to powdera jerk a wrench a dislocation a shock that shook the very air and made the very water in the river ebb and flow as the piers the retainingwall quivered to their foundations but the next instant the rocking engine recovered its smooth slide and the carriages were sliding after it over the girders it had jammed homesliding on to the station to safety to the fun and the fighting and yet a yell of horror rose from the watching crowd not because the onward sliding which left the bridge free of steam clouds left it free also of all trace of those wrestling figures that was only to be expected since if they had not fallen victims to the steamdevil the water must have claimed them it was because the river was claiming something else and the bastion cracked so long had yielded to its importunity at lastyielded perhaps to the shock perhaps to that reckless rush of spectators to one side perhaps to fate and with a silence awful in comparison with the clamour around it it was sliding outwards downwards sliding so slowly that it was well on its way ere an answering yell of terror rose from the figures upon it sliding so softlybrick holding fast to brickthat the final rending was almost unheard in the sound of hissing water closing in on water so for an instant nothing remained except two kites whirling distractedly at the swift downpull on their strings until giving up the battle giving in to fate they yielded the sovereignty of air and sank slowly into the river by this time however some of the claimants to that sovereignty had come to the surface again shrieking for help and reaching round for anything to support them lateefa luckily for him found that bundle of the vanquished close to his hand and managed with its help to get a grip upon a jag of wall luckily for something had struck him on the back as he went down but there was no sign of jehan or burkut ali no sign even of those other two whom the river had claimed and none came to seek for one for none knew rightly what had happened or who the bridgesavers had been save the bridgewreckers and they had fled most of the crowd therefore drifted back to the station or the city the station that was full of the rattle of rifles being shouldered of the tramp of feet falling into line how on earth you got here so soon i cant think said a policeofficer who had ridden up in hot haste at the news of some disturbance on the bathingsteps the upmail by jove what luck it will settle the whole biz i expect and in the city voices were saying much the same thing if the troops were there ready for the first sign what was the use of making it let the rabble rise if they chose let fools commit themselves wise men would wait a better opportunity chapter xxv secret despatches nushapore however was not all wise very far from it out of its two hundred and odd thousand souls there were some to whom the possibility of disturbances meant a longlookedfor opportunity of indulgingwith comparative safetyin criminal habits and there were many also who without any special desire for evil regretted the diminishing chance of a nights excitement and amusement at first some of these found solace in the catastrophe at the kiteflyers bastion though after a time this proved to be less disastrous than might have been expected for out of all those who were known to have been on the building only two or three were even injured jehan aziz it is true had disappeared but even in the first knowledge of this the fact brought scarcely a word of regretespecially in the royal family it felt vaguely that it stood a better chance without him even though the next heir was not close enough to that dead dynasty to hope for the practical recognition of an increased pension from government neither did the sight of burkut ali being carried off to hospital on a stretcher distress it much but it had a word or two of encouragement and sympathy for lateefa who still clinging to his kites refused all help as he sat propped against a wall waiting for the numbness to pass from his legsas it must pass since he had no pain of janalishan and chris no one thought on that side of the bridge for the simple reason that the disaster to the bastion absorbed all tongues for a time and in addition beyond the fact that there had been some fighting for the bridge no one knew anything in the station also there was no one to explain what had happened the baboo who might have told what he knew had in that interval of suspense discreetly fled to his lodgings in the city where he was trying to concoct alibis it was only on the bathingsteps that anything definite was known and there a curious consternation had followed immediately on the rapid raid made by those two through the temple for when the brief tumult of resistance had passed with their passage the only trace of it that remained was fateful beyond words to the superstitious eyes which saw it swami viseshwar nath the high priest of shivjee lay with crushed skull on mai kalis very lap his blood was pouring out upon her altar yet despite the blow which all had seen despite the crash which all had heard not one of her many widespread arms was injured here was a miracle indeed for what had been her words on that golden paper which she had flung in defiance as it were into the temple of her rival yea though they smite me there shall be blood upon mine altar and there was the blood of the archdetractor of her supremacy a miracle indeed to be affirmed or denied to the exclusion of all other thoughts and so on those wide steps leading down to the river the newcomers hastening thither at vague rumours of strange doingsstranger even than fixed bayonets at the city gateswere caught in the conflict of opinions and held captive by the question would mai kali stay the plague now as she had promised to do when there was blood upon her altars or would she not in other words dare menmere mentake the remedy into their own hands and risk offending the great goddess by lack of faith would it not be better to wait a bit and see what happened so coming and going on the stepscoming in fierce haste going in awestruck doubtmen asked themselves if their part was to wait and watch but inside the temple two poor souls crouched in a corner knew what their part as women must be and therefore after a time of fruitless waiting they stole out handinhand and went back to the city back to their empty house realising but one thing that the stray sheep which had been lost and found had gone astray once more had defied the priests perhaps killed his guru and they had left that house empty with such joy believing they were to bring their dear one back to it and now to whom were they to go for advice for weddings and burialssince such things must beif viseshwar nath was dead viseshwar who had known all things concerning the family so they wept not knowing that his death made future happiness for one of them possible the city itself was by this time like a hive of bees about to swarm which is disturbed by a fingertouch people hurried hither and thither causelessly excited anxious yet harmless for those who had meant to give the cue for action hung back at the sight of the soldiers yet many of these wouldbe mischiefmakers had not quite given up hope and their unwillingness to do so strangely enough was in inverse ratio to their hope of achieving any good by raising a riot for while every minute that passed showed the more reasonable the more interested that wisdom lay in postponement those who had very little stake or thought in the matter beyond a general desire to kick over the traces grew more and more desperate as the opportunity for this seemed to be slipping from them govind the editor was one of these and gravitating naturally to his like found himself after a time in one of the bands of discontents who were ready for any trivial mischief that might come handy but as yet even these had no objective and so after all jack raymond had time for a late dinner and he ate a good one too in ignorancelike every one else except a few of the wouldbe trainwreckers who discreetly held their tonguesof the real history of the drawbridge for the steam fog had effectually hidden all the heroism of that struggle for it had hidden all things save the voices in the fog save that almost incredible chanting of a sailors chorus heard by the enginedriver those few words keep your head sir and take a holt of me halfheard by some of the officers and sir george arbuthnot too ate his dinner at the club he did not make so good a one however and when he had finished it hurriedly he paused beside the table where jack raymond was finishing his leisurely to say with rather elaborate point so you were right after all mr raymondandand i was wrongshould i expect have been still more wrong if kenyon here had not insisted on telegraphing to fareedabad he looked as he spoke at the commissioner who had come in for a mere bite and sup jack raymond rose feeling that he liked the man better than he had ever done before feeling for the first time that he was glad he had helped i dont know sir he said cheerfully about the right and the wrong i happened to hear but it was uncommonly lucky the troops managed to nick the upmail or they might have been a bit late it must have been a near shave very put in the commissioner with a slightly puzzled frown i dont know exactly how the deuce they did it but thats a detail for the present now sir if you will write that note to relieve lady arbuthnots anxiety we can start back to the hospitalthough really there is no necessity for itthe danger is over jack raymond shook his head not till daylightit never is i dont mean for the hospital if nothing happens at midnight nothing will but there are lots of other gamesat least i should fancy so he added as he sat down again resuming his dinner and his indifference that is one of the most able men in india remarked the commissioner to sir george it is a thousand pities he allowed and then hurriedly he changed the subject it would have been less significant if he had not done so and sir george felt inclined to ask him to finish the sentence but even that defiance would have been significant in its turn so he gave in resignedly to the awkwardness of the situationfor he could not help feeling it was awkwardand sat down to write his note to grace before returning to the city she had been hoping for some message all the evening and lesley realised how great a strain the waiting for news had been on lady arbuthnots nerves when she saw the sudden relief the note brought with it till then the sunday dinnerparty had been unusually dull now just as people were beginning to wonder if they had not ordered their carriage to come a trifle late a new life seemed to spring up the hostess herself started music by going to the piano and as she did so she found time for a whisper to lesleyits all right the troops caught the upmail and came back in itsharp work wasnt it and george says everything is settling down but i am not to expect him home till one or two oh i feel so happy she looked it andgood singer as she wasshe sang as few had ever heard her sing lesley for one who listened to the quaint little french chansons halflaughter halftears and the pretty comicopera trills and runs with a new perception of the woman who sang themthe woman who was as a rule so unlike most of her sex in her calm intelligence and now now every man in the room was crowding round the piano she was holding them there by something that was not beauty or intelligence not by her looks or her singing but by the womans desire to have and hold the admiration of her world by making it depend on her for pleasurethe desire which made eve share her apple with adam yes that was it the womans desire to have and to hold for herself alone but while the dinnerparty at government house had taken a fresh lease of life under grace arbuthnots guidance there was another dinnerparty going on in nushapore where the good wine of high spirits had come first and the ditchwater of dulness last this was at mr lucanasters and it had been the probability of being late for thisa supreme effort on his part towards something preeminently jollywhich had made him sulky at being delayed by the memorable occasion for to begin with more time would be required for dressing than usual since the party was to be a rechauffe of the mutiny lancers it was to be a mutiny dinner and for the first time mrs chris had consented to act as hostess and sit at the top of mr lucanasters table mrs chris in that bewildering costume of pink roses and white shoulders and everything had been perfect the dinner worthy of a chef the champagne iced enough to cool the tongue not enough to lessen its sparkle and yet at eleven oclock the guests were beginning to leave at halfpast mrs christhere was no mistake in her costume eitherwas eyeing mr lucanaster with the amused superiority to the trivialities of sentiment or passion whichas she had always told poor chrismade her absolutely capable of taking care of herself in any situation no thanks i dont want another cigarette and id rather not have a cherrybrandy before i go back but you can tell the bearer to tell my ayah to bring my cloak and overshoes in here i told her to come and wait mr lucanaster swore under his breath oh i dont think it was quite so bad as that she continued cheerfully ignoring the palpable cause of his annoyance it really was quite jolly at first and nothing could have been better done it was that little fool jones with his cockandbull story of a row in the city and then the dresses you know made one a bit shivery thinking of the mutiny it dideven meand im not that sort but you couldnt help that you knowyour part of it was perfect he looked at her grimly his determination not to be played with in this fashion growing not quite he answered there was yet one thing lacking one thing that i had meant to have securedonly i could notyou were so late in coming i she asked curiously was it something to do with me then with the perfection of your dressit needs something she coloured up pink as her roses and gave a hurried glance at a mirror opposite i do not see it she said angrily yes you do he persisted looking in the mirror also there is something wanted here he pointed to her white throat and in the mirror his hand pointed to it also ahh she sighed thoughtfullyyes pearlsbut i had no real ones andand i can stand pastebut somehow sham pearls no not pearls no never not milkandwater pearls he protested not with roses therehe pointed to the glistening shouldersand roses therethe hand in the mirror seemed almost to touch the glistening hairit should be roses here andand i had some pink topazesa bagatelleyou might have bought them from me if you would not take them as a gift bah a triflejust drops of pink dew hanging from a fine gold chain her hard blue eyes grew covetous she drew in her breath drops of pink dew hanging from a fine gold chainhowhow perfectly delicious and cheap toooh do let me see them why not madame are they not in my office room buthe looked at her and laughedwill you not smoke one cigarette while you inspect them she looked at him sharply in her turn then laughed too he had been clever she rather admired him for it though if he thought he had gained any advantage he was mistaken why not monsieur she answered coolly helping herself from the box as i have to see the topazes i may as well smoke while you are fetching them she threw herself into an armchair and nodded at him but when the pink topazes came as they did come to her after a minute or two she stood up again in the intensity of her admiration there were other jewels in the quaint little indian casket which with an ill grace he had brought back with him from the officeamong them a string of remarkably fine pearlsbut she never even looked at them the topaz dewdrops absorbed her he had been right they were the one thing wanting the only question that remained was briefly how much she could afford to give for them as she stood calculating as only women of her type can calculate mr lucanaster watched her with an easy smile thinking what a curious hold little stoneswhich to him only meant so much moneyhad upon humanity there was a ruby for instance in that very casket which had taken him three years to wile away from a minor member of the royal family then there was the emerald a sudden sound of distant voices echoed through the stillness of the night and mrs chris looked up from the pink dew startled i wonder what that is she said pausing i wish that man jones hadnt told his foolish tales he has made me nervous quite nervous mr lucanaster moved a step nearer you neednt be afraid with me jenny he said attempting sentiment even if there was he got no further for the figure of a very old native withered bent dressed or undressed in the nondescript garb of a scullion showed at the door then advanced with furtive haste and equally furtive importance khodawund it said toothlessly and with joined hands it is about to come again this slave saw it thenin he was khansaman then to rickettssahib bahadur who was killed curse you shouted mr lucanaster what the devil then as the simplest way of getting at the truth he ran into the verandah every servant had disappeared but there was no mistaking the sound that came clearer nowit was the sound of a crowd an angry crowd he stood irresolute for a moment and then along the road that lay between his house and chris davenant s he saw two men running with torches there is thatch to both called one we will take his firsthe who spoilt our plan the others will settle the depraver of kings houses that was enough he was back in the house in a second but not in the drawingroom in his office at the safe which he had left open meanwhile viva alone with the furtive haste and furtive importance which had seen it all before stood paralysed with terror stood in that dress of the year of grace feeling as if that past had claimed her but it had claimed the old anatomy who had returned in his old age to the first rung of the ladder whence he had climbed to that dignity of khansaman to rickettssahib bahadur who was killed they had come back to him those days of livery and gold lace when he had served a lady dressed perhaps in pink tarlatan they had come back and the furtiveness left the remnant that remained of that dignity the importance returned but the mem was not killed huzoor how should it be so when mohubbut khan was there quick follow me huzoor this slave knows where safety lies has he not seen it all before quick huzoor quick the memsahiba is safequite safe if she follows mohubbut khan safe quite safe those words were enough for this woman in her pink tarlatan whose nerves such as they were had been juggled with by that same pink tarlatan she forgot everything else even the pink dewdrops the next instant she was outas many a memsahiba had been out in that fateful maytime more than forty years beforewith no guide to safety but a native servant and this was no servant of hers bound to her by the slender tieslender in the west at any rateof personal service mohubbut khan was only servant of that pastthe past which had brought him nothing for his old age save a return to the greasy swab and miserable pittance of his apprenticeship to service yet as with a breathlessness that had not been in that midnight flight of forty years ago he headed straight as a die for the garden mound he prattled cheerfully of the future as he might have done then let the memsahiba stay herself on the merciful and clement including of course his servant mohubbut as for the master the akasahib who perforce had to think of more than mere safety the merciful and clement had him in his keeping also and though mohubbut could not unfortunately be in two places at once some other slave would doubtless be raised up there was no fear none was not janalishansahibhe pointed into the nightthere to be reckoned with still and had it been possible during that nine long months for any black faceeven mohubbuts which had remained outside after he had put the mem insideto win in to the garden mound so hovering between past and present the old man who had been khansaman to rickettssahib bahadur who was killed chattered of safety until the garden mound was reached and then then he stood in the dim moonlighthelplessbewilderedimportance gone for where was safety where was janalishan ruins and flowers only one thing as it had been forty years before the english flag he headed straight for it comforted the importance returning the memsahiba need have no fear he muttered glibly was not mohubbut khansaman to rickettssahib bahadur who was killedbut the mem was not ah no yet once more the wide ruined doorways of the residency upset the unstable balance of the halfcrazy old mans confidence but only for a moment the next he had lost even importance in quick decision as the sound of running footsteps of mens voices rose against the background of faint elusive cries and distant disturbance which had been with them fitfully in their flight quick huzoor quick they come have no fear the mem was never killed yet they came before and viva tarlatan in ribbons almost fainting with fear followed blindly then sank behind a heap of stones that laypart of a ruined stairin the lowest story of the turret only just in time for the voices were close at hand the steps upon the outside stair that led to the roof lo we can do so much if naught else came savagely we can end their boast brothers the voice was an educated one and there was some answering laughs as five or six white figures passed upwards have no fear memsahiba whispered the toothless comforter janalishan will settle them apparently he did or some one else carrying on the tradition of the dead man who lay in the hollow of heroes for almost ere the last climber could have reached the top they were down the narrow stairs again helterskelter trra said one vexedly to think they should not have forgotten that truly it is ill doing aught against them and they so wise let us go back to the citythere be plenty of fools there said i not so whispered the toothless comforter triumphantly as the steps died away he hath sent them forth discomfited it was even so before when mohubbut was khansaman to rickettssahib who was killedbut the mem was not mrs chris however was past comfort had they come back again she would not have stirred and she sat in the darkness behind the heap of stones shuddering and sobbing too terrified even to hear that monotonous refrainhave no fear have no fear they are idle words when the heart is full of forebodings grace arbuthnot was finding them so but a few hundred yards away though she stood calmly saying them to herself there can be no fear she said why should they do him an injury why indeed echoed sir george with an inward groan born of wider experience of what men can do in such times as these but what can have become of the child he had returned home but a few moments beforeand far later than he had anticipated owing to a raid which had been made on chris davenants and mr lucanasters bungalows which had ended in the burning of bothto find the whole household distracted for jerry had disappeared he was not to be found anywhere neither was his mohammedan chuprassi nor his hindoo bearer both men who worshipped the child who would to all appearance have given their lives for him for an instant sir georges face had cleared at this information but it had clouded again at the utter incomprehensibility of the whole affair lesley had put the child to bed before she had gone out on her cycle he had then been quite happy and was to play with his soldiers on the land of counterpane till he felt sleepy that was the last that had been seen of him needham the maid who worked in the next room had heard no disturbance she had been in and out of other rooms naturally but not for long grace had given a look in about eight oclock had seen the nightlight burning as usuala little dimmer perhapsand jerry not having called to her she had not risked disturbing him then had come the dinnerparty people had stayed late and after they had gone she and lesley had sat up talking expecting every instant to hear sir george returngrowing a little anxious as time went on until about half an hour ago captain lloydwho had gone off after the guests had left to see what news he could pick uphad come back with such good accounts that grace had sent lesley to her bed then not till then the childs absence was discovered how long he had been absent none could tell for the only two servants likely to know the two who never left him day or night were gone also they had hunted everywhere nevill lloyd had run back to the club to give the alarm to the men he had left there a few minutes before grace had made every inquiry of the other servants but she suggested perhaps a man accustomed to crossexamining native witnesses might get at some cluethere is nothing else to be done for the moment assented sir george briefly you had better leave me to do it graceif you are here they will be remembering what they said to you so lesley and gracethe latter still repeating those words there can be no fear who would hurt the child why should they choose him of all otherswent and waited in the verandah overlooking the garden mound for the first hint of nevill lloyds return and yet while grace said the words she was conscious that there might be a reason if some one wanted to force their hand about that unlucky letterthe letter that now meant the worst since the troops had been sent for the promise of no coercion broken at the very beginning unavoidably of course yet none the less disastrously if that letter became public property and lesleys mind also was not without its sting of remorse added to its anxiety as she stood in the fastlightening dawn looking out into the dim shadows for hint or sign ought she to have told grace why her cycle ride had been so long yet that made no difference to this and a knowledge of the truth would only take from grace a belief that had made her glad no she could not tell her now she would wait till jerry returnedif he did return oh what could have become of the child jerry jerry she called almost involuntarily and with the cry came back a memory of that midnight chase after the boy and with that came the thought of jack raymond and his warninghe takes it too hard dear little chap she laid her hand quickly on grace arbuthnots wrist i believe i know she said starting to run come let us find budlu first but she was too late as they rounded the carriagedrive and saw on the grey sky of dawn above the blossoming trees the flagstaff with its drooping flag ready to welcome the sun as ever there was a sound of voices of laughter from the ruins and the next moment nevill lloyd catching sight of them was tearing across the lawns to meet them shouting as he ran its all right lady arbuthnot raymond ran the little beggar to earth in five minutes he was up on the top of the tower with his chuprassi his bearer and budlu the caretaker and the young imp had got my whole sportingmagazine too by jove if id only known that i might have guessedbut raymond did grace who had pulled up felt the relief almost worse than the suspense yet she kept calm lesley she said run back and tell sir george let me cried nevill lloyd or stay id better go and stop the searchparties so with light hearts and feet they left grace alone to meet the little procession that was coming across the dim lawns rather a crestfallen little processionjerry full of yawns and but half awake led by jack raymond and followed by guilty figures carrying the sporting magazine he is very sorry to have made you so anxious said jack raymond grave with difficulty but i have promised you wont scold him because he meant well he thought it was a mutiny and he went to guard the flag and i did guard it put in jerry aggrievedly afore i went to sleep for they comed to pull it downdidnt they he turned sharply to his henchmen huzoor they assented eagerly seeing extenuation in the plea without doubt they came they may have said jack raymond aside i havent had time to find out yet he was asleep when i came with the key of the door in his hand and they were positively afraid to take it from him till i insisted he is more than halfasleep now poor child replied grace in the same tone struggling with her desire to laugh and cry and hug jerry all at once bearer you had better take the chotasahib back to his bed and i will inquire about the rest by and by goodnight jerry or rather goodmorning you gave poor mum such a fright im solly murmured jerry sleepily shrinking as ever from the passionate caress she could not help giving but they weally did comedidnt they huzoor without doubt they came echoed the trio forlornly and i wouldnt be hard on them either said jack raymond as the disconsolate little group moved homewards i fancy they must have had some inkling of the city business and then when he started this game they were in two minds if he wasnt right you were all away you see and master jerry was completely master of the situation i can tell you he must have been thinking about it for some time for he had provisionschocolate caramels and heaven knows whatstored in the crevicesdear little chap and that reminds mehe paused with a laugh and drew an official envelope sealed with a red seal out of his pocketheres his secret despatches they fell out of lloyds cartridgecase he was wearing as he came downstairshe was so dead sleepy he could hardly standand i promised to hand them over to you he has had them he told me these two months and they are most important grace arbuthnot took the envelope gave a glance at it a cry certain yet incredulous it is my letterthe letterhow could he have found it there was a pause as those two stood in the dawn of another day with that immemorial past about them looking at each other almost doubtfully there are more things in heaven and earth said the man at last and so jerry really hashullo whats up now what do you want khodawund replied the furtive importance which was all that remained of the khansaman to rickettssahib bahadur who was killed as it salaamed low to the masters there is a mem yonder in the residency whom i mohubbut brought thither as i brought the other into the keeping of janalishan and he hath kept her yea during the night when the evildoers came he kept her safe as he did of old but now it is dawn and though i tell the mem it is safety she listens not but if the huzoors come she will believe during the night commented jack raymond swiftly as scarcely able to believe their ears those two followed the old mans lead then it is truejerry hashas kept the flag chapter xxvi fair odds the pendulum of india is a heavy one it soon returns to its normal arc and so after a very few days nothing remained to show that any force had sent it beyond its usual swing in nushapore except the charred ruins of two bungalows and they being in shark lane were not so much en evidence as they would have been elsewhere so far even as personal disturbance to the owners was concerned the sumtotal of effect was small for chris davenant had not returned to hear of his loss and mrs chris after the terrors of that night when she had become part of the old halfcrazy khansamans memory of the past seemed glad to be rid of any tie to india indeed as the faces around her became graver when no tidings came of her husband and the impression grew that he and janalishan had in some mysterious way been mixed up in the attempt to wreck the train and the fall of the bastion she seemed almost relieved her one desire was to escape from a place where such terror was possible to return to london to its ways and works to the red hammersmith bus that runs to kew on sundays to the baker the butcher and the little greengrocer round the corner and when she wept it was chiefly becausehaving no worldly goods beyond a torn and tattered pink tarlatanshe could not engage her passage home until a sufficient subscription was raised to pay for it and she had not many friends so far as the one bungalow therefore was concerned there were few regrets on the other hand mr lucanasters were distinctly above the average he had not only been burned out of house and home but of other more valuable things since almost before he had had time to consider how best to ensure their safety an inrush of voices and steps in the verandah had made him think of that most valuable of all possessionshis lifeand leave the resteven the woman in the next room and as if this was not bad enough something else had occurred which had reduced him to helpless impotent cursing and swearing against fate jehan aziz mrs chris davenant and everything that had conspired to bring about such incredible illluck and yet it was a very simple thing almost ludicrously so the very day after the rioting when all nushapore was being searched for evidence the police with great pride had brought him back the casket which had been left open on the table with the pink dewdrops beside it when mrs chris fled with the khansaman of rickettsahib bahadur who was killed it was now closed and had been discovered they said in the house of one govind who had been arrested on suspicion and he to screen himself doubtless from worse accusations had stated that he had found it flung away on the road not far from the blazing bungalow therefore since it was evidently a jewel casket it was most likely part of the huzoors lost property and if so he could detail its contents and open the springlock with his key in order that the description might be duly verified and the necessary forms filled up for one brief second mr lucanaster had returned thanks to such gods as he possessed for this small mercy here was something saved from the general debacle to begin with a very valuable rubyand and then had come the horrid recollection of a certain string of pearls which could not be claimed it had nearly killed him to deny the ownership of the casket but he had denied it there was literally nothing else to be done with that springlock and the key in his possession so when the police took it away in order to find the rightful owner he had gone into his room at the hotelit was next the one to which mrs chris had been takenand shaken his fist at her through the wall and sworn horribly not only at his own loss but at the gain of others which with his experience in jeweljobbing he knew would follow and it did for no sooner was the casket filed open by the police and its contents made known by a list than owners began to crop upcrowds of them but it was when an assistant policeofficer at the club thinking to rouse him from his general despondency by putting him on the track of a good thing mentioned that there had been a ruby in the casket which he really ought to get hold of a ruby that had been claimed on irrefragable evidence as an heirloom by a peculiarly impecunious member of the royal family from whom he could no doubt get it cheap without much troubleit was then that mr lucanaster had fled from his fellows and actually wept to think that after three years hard scheming he had bought that ruby at something like its real value that had been the worst blow but there had been similar ones and quite a large number of the pensioners invested in new cocks and quails and went about with cheerful countenances another result was that grace arbuthnot as she stood one day rethreading the four pearls which sobrai begum had brought to miss leezies house on to the string that had been found in the casket declared that it was just like the last chapter in a novel everything was clearing itself upher face certainly warranted the remarkand rounding itself off neatly for the end she thought as she spoke of the lost letter the recovery of which as jerrys secret despatches had seemed so mysterious until the child had told her quite simply that he had found the envelope in a bush in the gardenflung away most likely by the thief as valuelessand had kept it to play with because some one must have hidden it you know an didnt want people to wead it so it was secwet but she did not speak of this she only said that she had never expected to see her pearls again yet here they were with only one amissingher dear old pearls she held them up to her white throat and smiled thinking of the many happy hours she had spent with their touch upon her if any one had told her that that was the first time they had touched a slender white throat and that the last time a woman had worn them they had been snatched from a slender brown one and flung in the dust from scorn of the hours they had brought to a bride she would not have believed it not her pearls whose else could they be had not even mr lucanaster given his opinion on them as an expert for even that agony had not been spared to the unfortunate man yes answered sir george who had stopped his writing to admire his wife and think how happy and handsome she looked and how glad he was for her sake that the strain and anxiety was over as it seemed to be it is rather curious how everything is falling into line it is always the first step in india of course and so it was only to be expected that things would settle into march time after a bit but jehan azizs death and this finding of the pearls has disposed of that story for burkut ali the doctors say isnt likely to live and the girl is certainly a thief whatever else she may be and it disposes of the pestilent fellow who wrote that threatening letter also he paused then kenyon was only telling me this morning what an extraordinary quieting effect that incident in mai kalis temple has had of course we havent got to the bottom of it quite no one will give evidence because of the miracle but the fact remains that the prophecy was fulfilled then there is the bridge business said grace thoughtfully has anything new cropped up sir george shook his head then frowned not about that beyond the fact that the enginedriver is quite certain he heard singing and that of course points to the loafer ellison and as he was davenants foreman of works the two were likely to be together butbut he frowned again and let his hand busy itself impatiently with a pile of papers there is something else you know we wondered how the troops got here so soon well there is something odd about the telegram times dont tally and it seems another telegram was sent direct to the station to detain the upmail pending orders it came inurgentjust as the train was in and the stationmasterhe is a nativegot flurried and sent up with the telegram we know aboutat least i suppose soto cantonments for further orders when of course the commandant jumped at the chance and now the stationmaster cant find the wire isnt sure if it ever was written out as he was in the telegraphoffice at the time waiting for the upsignals and there is no trace of it this end nothing but the telegraphform i gave kenyon to fill in and which he sent to the railwayoffice but there again the time doesnt tally with kenyons recollections and though the order is identical the wording is slightly different for he put in something about stopping the nightmail which isnt in the wire the commandant received that part seems to have been made into a separate order and construed into the upmail but that may be due to the baboos a couple of greater fools never were they seem to know nothing especially the one here kenyon says the clocks may have been wrong but i cant help wondering davenant seems to have known something and he was seen at his works after dusk if he had been another sort of fellowbut it is impossible there isnt one englishman in a thousand let alone a native who would take such a responsibility i wouldnt and i dont know any one who would at any rate who would and then keep quiet when it was successfulfor it was it made all the difference as ive told kenyon he has the entire credit but for him we should have had a row but if you hadnt given him the telegram sir george shook his head in honest obstinacy i never meant it to be used i didnt believe in the danger as i told mr raymond he was right and i was wrong so that is an end of it my dear he seemed quite satisfied especially when his wife stooped suddenly and kissed the top of his head though he wondered as she left the room if he was really getting a little bald not so much because her lips had thrilled him but because he was observant enough to have noticed that a partially bald head is provocative of wifely kissing still even that evil had to be faced in the cause of empire and so the honest gentleman took up his pen and continued the report of recent affairs which he was writing and in which the credit of saving the situation was given unstintingly not to himself but to others for sir george was a gentleman grace however though she was a lady and despite that kiss of approval felt a trifle annoyed it was very nice of george to minimise his part in the business yet when all was said and done he had consented to give the orderconsented almost in defiance of the official programme the more she thought of it the more aggrieved she felt for him and so when she found lesley alone in the schoolroom she sought her sympathy explained the whole position at great length and wound up by the appeal now do you see what right mr kenyon has to all the credit lesley had so far managed to keep a calm sough without much difficulty at the present moment however something seemed wrong with her work for she was very busy with it at the window no she said at last i dont and then she repeated the remark with palpable resentment certainly not he had nothing to do with itnothing at all grace looked in her direction with dubious curiosity you dont mean do you she asked that you think any one else i dont think anything at all interrupted the girl hurriedly i only say that mr kenyon didnti mean that he isnt the right person to praise but lady arbuthnot was not to be put off because that really is quite absurd as i told george and he admitted that he did not know of any onenot a single man who would have taken such a grave responsibility now do you tell the truth lesley do you know any one perhaps there was more than a single man suggested lesley evasively the knot in her thread becoming extremely troublesome grace from her chair gave an irritated glance towards the window my dear lesley you are not often soso precise as if it mattered to my argument if there were one or two i wish you would leave off threading your needle or whatever it is and come here and be a little sympathetic it means so much to me you knowso if you wish it we will say two do you know of any two people who could and would do such a thing lesley folded up her work with great method but remained where she was why should we complicate matters by saying two she asked pugnaciously and after all it wasnti mean it would not be such a very big thing there must be lots of people in the world who could do it just think even among the men one knows people who could and would echoed grace in the same tone no i dont know any one she paused and added a trifle bitterly i know one who could but then he wouldntmr raymond mr raymond why should you say he wouldnt asked the girl swiftly why you neednt be so fierce lesley interrupted grace with a little hard laugh though you dont think him half bad for many reasons nohe wouldnt helpusin a thing like thatnot he that isnt fair cried lesley in a flame if you knew she paused but was too late if i knew what asked lady arbuthnot rising and coming to the window then standing before the girl to say after a pause you will have to tell me you know lesley you have started me and im not a fool and of course i knowjerry told methat mr raymond had come to cycle with you that eveningthat that was why you were so late but i said nothing because i thought it was only i dont care what you thought interrupted lesley angrily and i wont tell you anything unless you promise not to speak i will promise not to tell any one who ought not to know that i know put in grace arbuthnot proudly i wont promise more and who wants more cried the girl hotly of course if people ought to know they must know that is the only reason why im telling you i didnt mean to but if you can be soso unjust it is only right that you should know the truth i can judge of that for myself when you have told me so you neednt waste time retorted grace a sudden antagonism had sprung up between the two women of which they were both aware of which they were both vaguely ashamed but which they could not ignore thank you said grace with chill dignity when the recital was over you were right to tell me i will apologise to mr raymond to mr raymond echoed lesley carried beyond her resentment by eagerness no lady arbuthnotnot to him he is not one of the people who ought to know that you know may i ask why for an instant it seemed as if lesley would have matched grace in resentment and then suddenly she held out her hands in swift appeal oh dont be angry please but surely after what happened between youi cant help knowing that can iyou owe mr raymond somethingyou ought to let him have thisthis revenge to himselfjust to take the sting away to himself echoed grace scornfully i presume you mean to himself and you oh you may be as nasty as you like about that interrupted lesley hotly but i know i am right it would only be a fresh tie between youa new sentiment lady arbuthnot flushed up to the eyes really lesley you pass bounds you speak as if i wanted toto clutch at mr raymond when i should only be too glad if however as you say my apology is a triviality sir george shall sir george echoed lesley in her turn shaking her head no he is not one of those who ought to know that you know either he may have to know perhaps but it should not be through you look how he will give the credit to mr kenyon and if he knew it was mr raymond he would insist still more on giving it to him you know he would lady arbuthnotthere would be a fuss and every one would talk and he would hate italmost worse than mr raymond why not leave it aloneif we canwhat harm does it do you have grown very wise lesley said the elder woman after a pause love they say has eyes love lesley flashed round on her like a whirlwind ah i wish there was no such thing in the world then we women would have a chance of being sensible love no lady arbuthnot love has nothing to do with itnothing they stood facing each other those two and then a smiledistinctly a pleased smilecame to the older face but my dear child you dont mean to tell me that you are not in love with mr raymond the flush up to the eyes was lesleys now but she stood her ground bravely it does not matter if i am or not i am not going to talk of it and i promised him grace broke in with a little peal of laughter tender amused pathetic yet acquiescent laughter has it got so far as that ah lesley dear im so glad the girl looked at her with a faint wonder a great admiration then shook her head i believe you are made different from me she said soberly i can only understand one thing about it allhow it was that he never forgotwell never quite forgot for there is nothing to be glad of i can assure younothing at all she did not in truth look as if there was but grace as she took sir george his tea as she always did had her eyes full of that mysterious gladness which any sentiment even sorrow brings to some womens faces it suited hers and so her husbands had quite a loverlike diffidence in it as he watched her fingering the thin gold chain with pink topazes hanging from it which he took from a drawer it was in that casket the police found he explained and i told them if no owner turned up for it to send it for you to see and then if you liked it she looked up smiling it is too young for me yes it is true george i am getting oldever so old but ill tell you what we will do if we can buy it we will give it to lesley as a weddingpresent when she marries mr raymond sir george sat back in his chairperhaps she had meant that he should my dear girl he said feebly this is the first i have heard of it mr raymond and i thought never mind what you thought she put in decidedly it isnt quite settled yet but it is going to be oh yes it is going to be well said sir georgerecovering himself for the usual formulahe is a very lucky fellow but it iserall the more likely to be so because curiously enough i have been told to offer mr raymond the trusteeship of the old thakoor of dhurmkotes affairs in fact the old man refused pointblank to have any one else and as we want him to retrench and adopt an heir properly my dear george exclaimed lady arbuthnot how perfectly delightfulitit will settle everything yes ii suppose it will replied sir george dubiously and then his sober common sense came to the frontnot my dear that i exactly see what had totoerbe settled no perhaps not said grace thoughtfully but it will all the same with which mysterious remark she went off to set springes for that love with a big l which was to settle all things she was an expert in the art as women of her type always are and yet the days passed without bringing her success for something of which she knew nothing stood between those two put briefly it was a ramrucki and so when they metwhich was inevitably often under lady arbuthnots skilful handsthey talked of everything under the sunof their adventure together of the extraordinary way in which fate had favoured them of chris davenant and janalishans mysterious disappearances of the pearls and the signet of royalty that was not to be found anywhere they even talked of the thakoor of dhurmkote and the almost endless interest and power of such a life as that now offered to jack raymondthey even quarrelled over his hesitancy in accepting it but they never talked of what lesley had asked him to forgetwhat she had stigmatised scornfully as the rest of it grace became almost tearful over the fact it seemed to her at last as if even here hers was not to be the hand to wile jack raymond back either to duty or pleasure and it was not that task was reserved for a simpler hand a hand that had neither clutched nor refused the hand of a woman to whom the rest of it was neither to be despised nor overestimated and who had neither scorned it nor sought for it it was auntie khojees when one day jack raymond and lesley found themselves deftly manoeuvred by grace arbuthnot into the teteatete of a visit to the old lady not in the least against their wills for he was quite content with and she vastly superior to such palpable ruses besides she really wanted to see the originator of the ramrucki who was now decently established on the top of an offshoot of the city which jutted out into that very pleasuregarden to which the old lady had come with her petition to the braceletbrother so one morning lesley drove down to the garden jack raymond met her riding at the gate and together they strolled along that wide cross of water and marble and flowers and climbed the dark stair which led to the little square of roof and the little slip of room that were only just large enough for auntie khojee and the helplessness for which she cared for khojee helpless as she was had always stood between some one still more helpless and the buffets of fate and would have felt lost without the occupation and there was no reason why she should be without it when lateefa paralysed from the waist beyond all hope of ever getting about again lacked a caretaker and so he sat busy as ever with slips of bamboo and sheets of tissuepaper on the little square of roof just as he had sat in the wide courtyard where the royal peacocks now spread their broken plaster tails over plague patientsthose plague patients which the vast stability of the oriental had by this time accepted as inevitable which it had taken as it were into its immemorial custom lateefa had been once more asking for paste and khojee had brought him somewithout lumpsin a leaf cup for she laid it aside to receive jack raymond with a bismillah of pleasure and the strange miss with a ceremonious salaam lateefa had the latter for both visitors but there was a bold questioning in his black eyes for the huzoor who gave back the look with a valiant attempt at unconsciousness there was a curious peace up there on the roof lesley felt with only one or two of lateefas kites between you and the sky and the even flow of lateefas persian quotations in your ears for auntie khojeeafter disposing her guests on two rush stoolshad hurried into the slip of a room for cardamoms since they belong to congratulations as well as to consolations and nowadays what with her pension and lateefas earnings there were always cardamoms real cardamoms on the roof and many another comfort besides lateefa making polite conversation admitted this openly while jack raymond looked uneasily at lesley wonderingif her knowledge of the vernacular had not been mercifully limitedwhat she would have said to the pointed allusions to the benefit every man derived from associating himself with a truly virtuous woman and the desirableness of settling down in time not as helateefahad done too late for hope of leaving aught behind him but the flimsy children of naught above him a sorry legacy to the world though in their day they had done strange things but the huzoor was wiser he here aunt khojeewho with the most innocent of vanities had spent part of her absence in putting on a very stiff new pink net veil which during the rest of the visit refused to stop on her head and to the old ladys intense discomfiture left her sparse grey hairs indecently exposed at crucial momentsreappeared with the cardamoms to jack raymonds great relief though he soon discovered that the real horror of the situation was only just beginning for seated decorously apart yet with her halfaverted face alight with smiles and interest she began on a series of questions which made his heart sink within him since he knew lesley of old and sure enough it was not long before the latter said aggrievedly you might translate what she is saying after all i did come to visit her you know he left the path of truth then desperately with the result that lesley commissioned him to make the proper reply to such oriental periphrasissomething he was to be sure that would please the dear old thing then he realised that he was hopelessly emmeshed for of course auntie khojee wanted a reply to her question and it was not what she had desired at all she doesnt look a bit pleased remarked lesley de haut en bas dear me i wish i could speak i know i could do better than that and i hate being dependent i wish you could said jack raymond grimly i dont want to be a gobetween his evident illtemper mollified her well at any rate you might try again and say something else so he did and he and aunt khojee had quite an animated passage while lateefa from his kites listened and looked knowing well remarked lesley at last quite angrily i dont see what was the use in my coming at all you might at least give me a hint of what you are talking about it is very rude his temper went then altogether if you want to know he said still more grimly she was asking when we are going to be married lesley gasped marriedshe echoed indignantly yet conscious of a curious desire to smile and feel happy which must be squashed firmlywell if she does mr raymond you can tell hernever her dignity was tremendous i have told her so three times replied jack raymond gravely but she wont believe it she says i dont care what she says retorted lesley quickly she must be made to believe it tell hertell her about the ramrucki and all that she will understand then she may assented jack dubiously but it is a littleahemmixed upisnt it a suspicion that the situation was beginning to amuse him made her say not at all of course she will understand she gave you a ramrucki and whywhy shouldnt i no reason at all im awfully glad you did he looked it and lesley felt once more that absurd desire to smile and feel happy as she sat listening watching the withered old face waiting for the answer it was not much when it came it was only a pursing up of the lips that had never known a lovers kiss a gentle raillery in the kind teardimmed eyes and a brisk flirt of the fingers that had worn themselves to the bone to bring happiness to others trra said auntie khojee with supreme unconcern for explanations trra im afraid it is no go miss drummond said jack decorously i believe itit would save trouble if wefor the time only of course lesley blushed a fine blush i daresay you are right she assented supremely superior it doesnt really matterfor the time she added significantly and after that an almost reckless happiness was added to the peace of the roof lateefa quoted hafiz by the yard auntie khojee got hold of lesleys hand and held it fast with one of hers while the other slid up and down the girls arm with the little caressing pats and pinches with which she had tried to wile away noormahals weariness and jack raymond sat and looked on with with what lesley did not quite realise what the expression was till they were alone together on their way back through the garden once more then she recollected it for his face was all soft and kind all lit up with a delicate raillery a forgetfulness of the workaday world just as it had been that eveningthat evening when another woman had been his companionthat evening when she had felt so lonelywhen the cinnamon dove doyoulovetoo doyonlovetoo came the question from the rosebush once more but the bird did not fly from its shelter now there was no thorn in the path now to make those two pause and startle it so the question followed them doyoulovetoo doyoulovetoo as they walked side by side leaving the sanctuary behind them nearing the gilded summerhouse before them theres no hurry is there said the man suddenly when they reached it let us sit down a bit and talkabout ourselves the girl sat down but shook her head it was only for the time mr raymond she said not pretending to misunderstand his meaning why should it only be for the time why she echoed looking out into the pleasuregarden of kings for a great many reasons i think and then she began on them one by one dispassionately rationally and sometimes he agreed with her despondently as to his character and interests and sometimes he gave in to her greater knowledge regarding her own and the dove cooed on its question and the jewelled parrotswinged creatures as they wereflew from one screen of flowering trees to the other unable to escape the thraldom of the high wall hidden by leaf and blossomunable to escape from that prisonment of pleasure and so you see mr raymond came the girls voice the odds are the odds he echoed quickly almost mischievously ah if it is a question of odds its my inningsill take twenty to one on bonnie lesley he held out his hand she essayed a frown she essayed a smile and then she said really you are too foolishjack and so in the years to come the old thakoor of dhurmkote will no doubt rescind his reproof and having forgotten jerry will call another little laddie a son of heroes and he may be but jack raymond himself will keep that name for a boy who by that time will be at eton or harrow and that boy will think of the graves in the hollow of heroes and wonder if janalishan ever came back to claim his he has not yet and so the two hundred and odd thousand people in the city of nushapore and the fifty thousand people in cantonments still expect him to be there some day when he is wanted and he will no doubt for it is only the spirit of slaves that dies the spirit of kings lives for ever footnotes footnote barrister footnote members of municipal
