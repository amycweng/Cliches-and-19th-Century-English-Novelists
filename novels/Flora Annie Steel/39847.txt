mass usa in the tideway prologue a statue of charity with helpless childhood gathered to the ample bosom and helpless age sheltered by the ample veil behind it a crimson curtain concealing an angle in the stairway in front a crowd streaming slackly yet steadily up the steps a crowd which broke into little eddies of greeting little backwaters of gossip whilst the waves from the rear taking advantage of the pause rippled higher and higher a crowd complaining indifferently of the crush the heat the impossibility of being in two places at oncenot with reference to the haysweet meadows and copses where the nightingales were singing to the moon that summers night but in regard to some other hot staircase where society was due some time ere the sun rose to the man who in a comfortable niche behind the statue sate removed from the pressure of the current the scene was framed by charitys mantle perhaps it needed the setting a crowd generally does whether it be in the old kent road or grosvenor square the big bear i beg your pardon mr lockhart why arent you in rome and is there room for me on that peaceful seat there is always room for golden locks beside the big bearand now lady maud why should i be in rome at this season of the year because being an artist you should not mind malaria besides what is malaria to this insufferable heat and crush doesnt it strike you that our hostess thinks getting into society and getting society into her rooms are synonymous terms did you ever see such a charity lady maud charity interrupted her companion pointing to the protecting arm stretched between them and the crowd let it cover the multitude of sins thank you i suppose i am wicked but youwhy are you here in the swim when you profess to despise usto renounce the world the flesh and the devil because i came to see one who should have nothing to do with that trinity of evil either i came to see you lady maud i couldnt pass through babylon without giving you my congratulations so you are going to be married he paused looking her in the face curiously well why dont you say at last it is what every lady thinks im sure people have been coming perilously near calling me poor lady maud these last two seasons and nowyes i am to marry mr wilsonyou know him i think yes i do know that fortunate man and pardon me lady maud but you and i have been confidential havent we ever since in a tourbillon of white frills and blue sashes you chose to prefer my walnuts to other folks sweeties at dessert now about eustace what is to become of him the pretty face winced just a little havent you heard eustace is to be married also indeed we think of choosing the same day out of bravado nothing of the kind eustace and i have put awaychildish things we have decided to be sensible and he is marrying louisa capper the american heiress i like louisa i trust that feeling is shared by eustace how hopelessly oldfashioned you are big bear i dont believe you will ever learn to shave yourself in tufts and become a civilized poodle of course he likes her she is really a very nice girl and then she only has a father dont you think the american parpar is less objectionable as a rule than the marmar to be seriouswhich i should not trouble to be with ninetynine people out of a hundredeustace and i have seen the error of our ways and we intendin fact i personally expect to be very happy as i said louisa is very where do you spend the honeymoon he interrupted not being in the least interested in louisas part in the business again hopelessly oldfashioned there is but one place nowadays in which to spend a honeymoonparis it is so full of distractions then mr wilson has taken a grouse moor near the north pole eustace is to come there in his new yacht and we are to have a real good time as louisa near the north pole didnt know grouse grew there well it is not very far from it i forget the namebut see there is eustace behind old lady brecknocks feathers he will remember a very handsome dark man in the stream saw her signal and drifted sideways to shelter charity cometh he began please not mr lockhart has patented it already besides i want you to tell me the name of that place in the hebrides roederay yes of course i remember now that it put me in mind of dry champagne by the way you used to paint that coast once mr lockhart do you by chance know roederay what is called a flicker of expression crossed her hearers face it is a poor description for the absolute blank which a chance word brings to some imaginative people by summoning them from the present into the past i know it well he replied and if you will excuse me lady maud i dont think it has much in common with dry champagne her clear rather scornful eyes were on him critically association belongs to hope as well as memory mr lockhart you may have had a mauvais quart dheure at roederay we intend to have a good time dont we eustace rather i doubt it retorted the elder man civilized people like you eustace for instance shouldnt go to those places to begin with there is always a difficulty about dinner lady maud laughed not in these days of ice and telegraphs besides some of us like high teasdont we eustace his face did not change though the appeal took him back many years in his turn but then the speaker was in that past as she was in the present to say sooth she occupied them both fully yes we can endure them do you remember those holidays at lynmouth maud and the feeds we had on the cliffs i wonder if any boy ate more strawberries and cream at a sitting than i could do in those days have you changed much since then she asked smiling up at him mischievously i dont see it do you mr lockhart not a bit replied the elder laying his hand affectionately on the others shoulder eustace is just what he was as a boynot to be stinted in his enjoyment of good things to return however to roederay you wont like its simplicity its habit of taking one right down to first principles it couldnt we are too complexarent we eustace and then it is grim there is an island full of dead people who appear ah i know all about the stone coffins and the bones professor endorwick told me and he is coming north on purpose to explore all the antiquities there he is in the crush with cynthia strong i wonder when that will come off call them here eustace and wisdom shall confound this evil prophet why the professor mr lockhart thinks eileanavarai alone is sufficient inducement for a visit to roederay eileanavaraiisle of the dead you call it we used to prefer another name eileanafaashisland of rest it lies right out in the sunset like avilion lady maud gave a little shiver oh no that is ever so much more grim than the other i hate things whichwhich appeal to the imagination i am quite aware of it he replied quietly hence my prophecy that roederay will not suit you she sate playing with her fan idly island of rest indeed there never was such a placethere never will be ah professor come like a good soul and do battle for civilization and culture are we not far better than the primitives of the north pole are we not stronger wiser more original the learned professor being a little deaf did not quite catch her words he was in addition much given to the jocular style when addressing the weaker sex which he held to have been created for the sole purpose of exercising the social qualities of man so an appropriate remark having occurred to him he came forward primed with it charity lady maud is as a rule said to cover a multitude of sins in this case it conceals the virtues and he was greatly pleased with himself when everybody laughed on the whole i retract original continued lady maud gravely so you neednt defend that proposition professor how can we be original there is nothing new under the sun even ones jokes have been appropriated by past generations everything has been used up not everything said will lockhart to return to roederay for instance you will be nextdoor neighbours to the gulf stream it is not used up far from it that lady maud will be another of the horrid things which appeal to the imagination night and dayday and night she shrugged her pretty bare shoulders there is the gulf stream i like she replied pointing to the crowd still surging onwards why should you abuse it we go on day and night night and day upwards and onwardsto heaven for all you know i defy you and your oldworld ideas and romances we are going down to roederay to paddle about where we choose catalogue your dead people and their beliefs as we choose and we are going to eat our dinner and kill everything we see there is one of the slayers in the stream arthur weeks the best shot in england so people say ah captain weeks mr wilson tells me you are coming to roederay i am glad charity lady maud began the gallant warrior that is not your bird captain weeks mr lockhart my cousin eustace and the professor have all blazed away at that poor joke already of course your gun would bring it down but please be merciful let it go for another day that reminds me gordon said the captain confidentially to lady mauds cousin when the laugh had ceased i was speaking to old snapshot about roederay and he assures me that the birds lie like stones in that part something he said to do with the gulf streambut i dont know much of these scientific things lady maud only i assure you he declares you can kick em up and shoot em like chickens on the last day of the season there was a solemn pause the advantages of roederay seemed exhausted on all sides if some one will give me his arm said lady maud rising i will go upstairsto paradise perhaps mr lockhart i really must say how do you do to our hostess before going on to the next i any luck rick called a lady sitting on the doorstep of eval house to a young man coming up the ferrypath his rod was balanced level in his hand his head bent forward against half a gale of wind which after sweeping the grass slopes into silvery waves raced with white horses over the greener sea beyond yet on the doorstep with the stone house betwixt you and the norwest the day was warm and still as any autumn day can be when a bright sun shines clear out of a brilliant blue sky she was a very small lady looking all the smaller because the energy expressed in every line of face and figure suggested its adequacy for the direction of a far larger mass of matter looking still smaller at that particular moment by reason of her being overwhelmed by a fleecy lamb she was endeavouring to feed with a teapot for the rest a lady long past youth yet with sufficient traces of it left to show that it had been preeminently attractive luck aunt will why yes the best of luck ive seen the most beautiful woman in the world miss willina smiled who will that be now and is it twenty or twentyone you are next month twentyone is ityes time passes then as you are so near mans estate it wont be macleads niece from glasgow she is too red in the face nor katie macqueen youve seen her too often nor me either rick though i used to be called that sometimes the transparent vanity in her tone made her nephew smile in his turn its no homegrown beauty aunt will its a london bellelady maud wilson you should just the sudden upset of a lamb whose four pointed toes strove for foothold against his legs checked further speech his aunt however waving the teapot in her excitement filled up the pause aided by a sick gosling which had fluttered down from her lap as she rose the wilsons why didnt you tell me at once have they come at last and why didnt they come before and where are their servants why didnt they send word to the factor and goody gracious me rick what are they going to do if youll put that teapot at a safer distance and prevent baalam from making me curse utterly ill try and explain a minute of frantic shoving joined by a chorus of hounds from within and miss will macdonald returned breathless to her seat on the steps while the sick gosling fluttered to her lap once more this is what i could gather they have been deerstalking with friends because the grouse here were reported late so they are aunt will i saw a covey yesterday skip please ahem well their servants came by last clansman or rather they didnt because skip again i knowtoo rough for her to put inwont come till return trip go on dear how you do bustle a fellow they expected cooks and scullions all the show in fact including a but oh do skip my dear aunt you should have been a telegraph clerk well wrote for a machine to carbost came along place shut up rick halmar fishing sea pool saw signals of distress piloted em to harbour found kirsty stacking peats lit the fire put on the kettle came home to tell his aunt that is all except that the factor is away to the alan market and kirsty has no english to speak of they have servants with them of course a french maid she is more solid than she looks you see i had to help her out of the machine she hadnt recovered the boat they have been visiting about and mr wilsons man got left behind at inverness looking for lost luggage wired to say he would come on by the afternoon boat ha ha good joke isnt it afternoon boat to roederay now then jump aboard a penny all the way miss willinas sympathetic soul saw no cause for mirth in the vision conjured up by her housewifely imagination she put on the deerstalker cap lying on the step beside her it was a signal for action since within the home precincts she dispensed with any head covering save the thick masses of dark hair which were still her greatest pride ill go over kirsty is an idiot at best she was six whole months learning the happy land at sundayschool besides its not farthen your uncles official position skip please interrupted rick laughing you dont want excuses for being a trump come along his aunts blue eyes flashed and sparkled oh my dear was she so pretty as all that you wont be wanted her husband is there of course aye and her cousin i think at least she called him eustace two of them then preserve us from a third man go you and fish like a christian leaving you to roam the moors alone when i may be appointed to a ship tomorrow and not see you again fordont laugh in that rude way aunt will look here lets compromise ill go so far and fish lochnabuie till you return they passed the slight hollow where eval house sought a faint shelter and the farmyard whence after depositing the sick gosling miss willina had to escape at a run from a motley following of birds and beasts so to the level stretches of moor and the full force of the blustering wind a strange landscape to southern eyes earth air and water blent in a triple alliance so close as to destroy individuality the sea lay landwards the land seawards and over both the norwester swept unrestrained cresting green waves of heather as water with an edging of white foam or purple blossom were those hills eastward across the minch or clouds was that level streak of light westwards the atlantic or a glint of sky was the water showing at your feet between miniature cliffs of sphagnum moss salt or fresh and did the land really sway before the wind or was it only your footstep making the spongy soil rise and fall this however was in the low ground eastward westward the rocks began to pile themselves gregariously in cairns and the moorland rose gradually so gradually that when its edge was reached you were surprised to find yourself so far above the shining plain of sea here on a promontory commanding a magnificent view and also a perfect exposure to all the winds of heaven stood the modern shootingbox of roederay lodge substantial enough for the nineteenth century yet reminding one irresistibly of those swiss chalets in boxes which are to be bought for a sixpence in the lowther arcade the fault no doubt of its surroundings above all of a sound which seemed to monopolize the whole landscapethe sound of the atlantic rolling in upon two miles of shelving sand a little to the southward a sound that went on night and day day and night without a pause rhythmically true to a second not to be shut out by any device of man the strongest must put up with it or go away on this particular september day with the keen bright norwester sending a cross sea round the point its voice had a querulous ring in it very different from the roar which echoed for fifteen miles across the island when the atlantic was in a southwesterly mood rick halmar however being a sailor accustomed to the sea in all tempers took little heed of its tone he sat to leeward of a cairn which tradition said marked the grave of a viking and whittled away at a piece of wood he had found close by the pretence of fishing having been set aside when miss willinas decided little figure disappeared from sight he whittled with more than the sailors ordinary dexterity for his father had been a norwegian sprung from a long line of ancestors who had whiled away the winter days when their ships were in dock with woodcarving not much else save that trick of the knife a straight norse nose and a passion for the sea had eric halmar inherited from the father he had never seen for within a year of that hasty marriage between the shipwrecked sailor and miss willinas younger sister pretty little mrs halmar was in eval house once more weeping and waiting weeping for her handsome husband waiting for her child to be born she wept even after the waiting was over till consolation came in the shape of another husband for she was not a person of great steadfastness and even her land prejudice against the sea as a profession had given way before miss willinas stern common sense the laddie thinks of nothing else said his aunt indeed why should he seeing he comes of pure viking blood on the one side and something of it on the other if old tales be true send him to the navy then if he is drowned it will be decently in the queens uniform so into the navy he went and having passed through greenwich was now awaiting orders at eval where he found a most congenial playmate in his aunt his still beardless face dimpled with smiles as he worked to begin with the wood which had evidently been used as a cow peg was mahogany in other words it must have been stolen from the drift pile on which his uncle by virtue of his official position was supposed to keep an eye since the logs which the gulf stream leaves in its course are government property this amused rick seeing that the mere suggestion of such nefarious possibilities was a sure bait to his uncles anger then the subject he had elected to carve seemed to him amusing it was a replica of a numbo jumbo he had seen amongst the caribbees and which had tickled his fancy by its lavish ugliness so his knife being a perfect toolchest of implements he gouged and punched chiselled and filed until as he stuck the pointed end of the peg into the ground again a very creditable copy of a malignant god stood before him its the best ive done yet he said to himself that dodge of the breadpellet eyes with the shot in the middle of them gives the old devil quite a live look he was not yet twentyone and boy enough to be proud of the ingenuity which had converted some sandwich crumbs and the lead off a cast into a pair of evil eyes man enough however to whistle who is sylvia as he leant back against the cairn smiling at numbo jumbo and thinking of lady maud rick you bad boy cried his aunts eager voice just as he was beginning to forget everything in drowsiness you promised you wouldnt when i threw the last into the minch and this is worse ever so much worse better you mean its the best ive done look at its eyes miss willina pretended to shudder as her hand instinct with righteous vengeance went out towards the idol you might leave it there till we go pleaded rick it really is the best ive done by a long way then you could take it home aunt will and have a real autodafe its more orthodox than drowning besides it will help the peats to a blaze when we go in she burst out suddenly into an amused laugh peats she echoed ah rick if you had only seen them at roederay the room full of smoke that lovely girlshe is beautiful my dearfull of apologies they took so long to kindle she said excuse me said i but you mustnt miscall a peat fire it is the most hospitable one in the world they were all lying crisscross like a crows nest and you should have seen her relief when i had them standing shoulder to shoulder and they flared up like a highland regiment at the skirl of the pipes a little thing that rick but so it was in all i laughed till i cried that house full of telephones electric bells hotwater pipesall the modern whimsthe factor says people wont take a shooting unless there is a fixed bath nowadays well downstairs kirsty and janet the herd four willing hands and no knowledge i tell you kirst is just terrified of the dampers will it be blowing down the house miss willina she says skip please the remark met with a scornful neglect then upstairs those three with the knowledge but never a hand brainsat least two of them had for the husband seemed fickless and no action there they couldnt understand each other and mr wilson went about with his hand in his pocket asking if a fivepound note would do any good my dear sir said i neither five nor ten nor fifteen will help us if the clansman cant put in tomorrow so let us pray for fine weather then i promised to lend them our cook and we became great friends only i dont know why i felt all along as if something was going to happen a sort of conviction things were going wrong a kind of doubt whether we were in our right places a description of miss macdonalds presentiments were apt to embrace all things visible and invisible so rick made haste with a remark and what did you think of the other maneustace the shot was lucky she paused and sat looking out over moor and sea with a mysterious expression of selfcomplacent sagacity well auntie you think nothing my dear gracious goody past four oclock the chickens not fed the cows out in the wind the ducklings still at the stream the whole blessed noahs ark she had risen with the first word and started off like a lapwing so that ere she finished distance deadened her voice wait please wait shouted rick the animals went in two by two remember it was of no avail so he caught up his rod and ran after her leaving the idol to fulfil miss willinas role of sphinx it had been dark some hours before she dropped her knitting with a purposely dramatic start oh rick didnt i say i had a presentiment now ive gone and left that wicked idol on the harpon the alt na heac harp of all places in the world and you a descendant of the vikings rick at work on an infant samuel for his aunts room looked up cheerfully well what has that to do with it what why everything dont you know the legend everything left on that harp disappears the dead take it as a tribute and if they dont like it they send it back to work evil to the living for a month and a day willina mr john macdonald was a silent man but when he did speak his meaning was clear where the devil you get all that rubbish passes me ive lived longer in this island than you ive seen more of the people than you yet i never heard such trash he dived back into his book as suddenly as he had emerged from it and there was a dead silence never mind auntie whispered rick sympathetically for these outbreaks were almost the only things which upset miss willinas majesty ill go first thing and bring numbo jumbo back to be burnt pray do not trouble she replied with an audible sniff if i am foolish i am foolish if it is rubbish i suppose it is rubbish only if anything happens perhaps you will be considerate enough to admit that i foretold it her hurt dignity however vanished before rick halmars face when he came in to breakfast next morning minus the idol gone oh rick you dont mean it isnt there she cried in not displeased excitement john do you hear its gone and you said it was rubbish what do you say now mr macdonald affected not to hear yes its gone said rick numbo jumbos on the loose i expect really that some of the crofters children have taken it for a doll it is all very well for your uncle to scoff eric but the young should have more reverence for the wisdom of their elders retorted his aunt severely but aunt willyou dont really believe i am not responsible for my beliefs to you eric whatever you may be to me and perhaps if you have no respect for me as your aunt you will please to recollect that i am also your godmother it all comes of disobedience thou shalt not make to thyself rick leant back in his chair and roared and if you cant even remember that she went on bristling with dignity you might recollect the punishment meted out to the children who mocked at the bald heads she paused her hand went up suddenly to her coils of hair she tried hard to keep her countenance failed and mr macdonalds deeptoned laughter made a bass to her treble and ricks tenor that nine times out of ten was the end of miss willinas wrath ii i found it said professor endorwick laying numbo jumbo on the drawingroom table at roederay as i was coming over the moor this morning in order lady maud to finish a delightful walking tour by a still more delightful visit oddly enough i found something similar on the grada sands yesterday but this i fear is genuine and therefore quite uninteresting i have it in my knapsack if you will allow me there from the fracture you will observe that it has formed part of a handle probably the paddle of a war canoe as this grotesque which represents the savage conception of aete or fate is generally used for that purpose it has drifted here doubtless in the gulf stream is therefore as i said before uninteresting since most museums possess something of the sort this however is very different it is you will again observe of very recent construction this joined to the fact that i found it on a harp or vikings tomb famous in local tradition points to my mind conclusively towards the survival amongst this primitive people of some if not the original cult of fate i need scarcely say that nothing is more difficult to track home than the faint footstep of a discredited belief simply because rash inquiry results in prompt denial i must therefore be careful and i will ask you also for the present at least to preserve a kindly silence on my discovery he looked round his company as if it were a full meeting of the british association after lunch as a matter of fact it consisted of lady maud her husband and eustace gordon they had barely finished breakfast when the professor ignorant of their discomfort walked in on them according to previous arrangement mr wilson a slight pleasantlooking man with a short beard covering his chinor want of chinhad been moving restlessly from window to fireplace and back again during this speech now drumming with his fingers on the sill now transferring his attention to a fishermans barometer on the mantelpiece again slipping his hands to his pockets as if to force himself to quiet lady maud meanwhile stood by the table looking at numbo jumbo and the despised original so you think the one with the eyes most interesting and i dont she raised the flotsam jetsam in her slender hands scanning it more closely i wonder if you would give me this professor she said suddenly ive taken a great fancy to it my dear lady i am only relieved to find you have not chosen the other he replied with a gallant bow in either case however your desire is my law i believe that beast of a thing is going down again muttered mr wilson from the mantelpiece the clansman will never be able to come in tomorrow its too bad of hooper upon my soul it is my dear fellow remonstrated eustace anything will go down if it is continually thumped its a lovely day a bit blowy but it always blows on this coast the warmth of the gulf stream ah confound the gulf stream lady maud turned to her husband in surprise what is the matter today edward i didnt know a valet was such a hero to his master why josephine hasnt done a hands turn since she caught sight of the steamer at oban but i dont complain he muttered something about hooper having been with him for years and stood looking gloomily out of the window with his back turned to everybody eustace gordon gave a halfcontemptuous shrug of his shoulders and a look at his cousin come out and see the ghillies wilson he said by the way i sent to the inn for whiskey this morning you see professor nothing can be done without it in these parts so i hope you are not a total abstainer the professor coughed gently i believe i am on principle but having observed the fact you mention i invariably carry a flask with me on my walking tours merely of course as a means of acquiring information mr wilson burst into sudden boisterous laughter a good joke that come along we all have a thirst for knowledge on us this morning lady maud left alone with the two carven images took up the seawaif and carried it off to her own sanctum where she stuck it in the place of honour on the mantelshelf then walking to the window she looked out on pale green jostling waves and purplegreen swaying heather i wonder when louisa will turn up she thought irrelevantly after all she would have done better to come on with us and get it over instead of waiting in the yacht for calmer weather suppose it were never to calm down she threw open the window with a reckless laugh the fresh wind raced in bellying the curtains like sails catching her slender figure with such force that she was fain to cling to the sash as to a mast so standing with that background of surging sea and one hand keeping her hair from her eyes she looked as if she were adrift and searching the horizon for some familiar landmark heres luck and wissing you may all go back as you came without any mistakes whatever it was the spokesman ghillie from below toasting the new tenant she looked down to meet eustace gordons amused eyes raised to hers she smiled back at him and closing the window returned to the fireplace there under the eye of fate personified in the war paddle the phrase go back as you came struck her as a curious wish perhaps even a somewhat infelicitous one considering the discomfort of their arrival whereat she laughed as she did at most things not all for lady maud despite many attempts had never been able to get the whip hand of her conscience she had to menager it by driving round anything at which she thought it likely to shy her marriage to mr wilson had been approached in this circuitous way until its manifest advantages completely obscured the central fact that she really loved her cousin eustace as yet repentance had not come to her indeed it came hardly to one so full of common sense and worldly wisdom as she was but it came sometimes once as a child it had come suddenly in the sunlit solitary room into which she had been set apart for reflection and she had knelt down to say naively oh god im sorry now but please dont make me sorry again for i dont like it that briefly was still her attitude towards the ideal she did not love her husband but she thought him sufficiently gentlemanlike and pleasing to save herself regret she did or rather she had loved eustace but the idea of either of them permitting that past folly to interfere with the present they had deliberately chosen was absurd to begin with they would see little of each other and when they did they would carefully avoid the renewal of any confidential relations that was the great safety in these cases for lady maud viewed the matter dispassionately as a case she came down to dinner that evening in a pale plush teagown with long sleeves falling back from her bare arms and smiled at everything at the fact that she got on perfectly without josephines help at the furtive way in which kirsty set down the dinner as if it were a bomb and she in a hurry to escape the explosion at her husbands continued anxiety about the weather at the professors profuse apologies for having intruded on them so inopportunely not at all she said gaily you will make a fourth at whist edward loves a rubber i cant play tonight replied her husband ive a headache you do look a little flushed perhaps it is the wind the wind he echoed petulantly of course its the wind did you ever hear anything like it endorwick i swear i never slept a wink last night what with it and that confounded sea it is enough to drive a fellow distracted you are as bad as josephine laughed his wife she has been in hysterics all day until miss macdonalds cook gave her a whole tumbler of hot whiskey and water since then she has been asleep we have all been trying that remedy put in eustace what with the men coming in and the boats being engaged we shall want more whiskey tomorrow wilson no we shant retorted his host quickly i mean its beastly stuff you know i never take anything but claret myself awfully difficult to get decent claret nowadays remarked eustace with the ease to him so delightfully new of the rich man who quarrels with the supply and not the price so the topic passed ill have a cigar and go to bed i didnt sleep a bit last night said mr wilson shortly after they returned to the bare drawingroom guiltless of all decoration where lady mauds parisian teagown looked so oddly out of place take some hot whiskey and water laughed his wife wont you all go to the smokingroom you must be tired professor after your long walk but the learned mans social beliefs forbade cigars when a charming woman was the alternative so he elected to remain being in reality much fatigued however he shortly afterwards gave way to the seductions of semidarkness and an armchair semidarkness because kirstys lamp smoking horribly they preferred the light of the blazing peat fire outside the wind crooned round the housea lullaby to ears acquainted with its other notes but to those accustomed to the stillness of the south a banshee wail of coming trouble with the firelight playing on the jet agraffes which held the cunning draperies on her gleaming bust and arms lady maud was a picture few men could look on absolutely unmoved but if eustace gordon felt the charm of her beauty he gave no sign of it as yet they sate there in the semidarkness side by side sometimes silent sometimes talking indifferently of indifferent subjects alone as utterly alone in the world as if they two were the only man and woman in it for the barrier which luxury raises between one human being and another had given way supposing for instance the butler instead of bobbing up and down on the minch in the clansman had been at his post would they have been sitting in semidarkness uninterrupted by inroads for coffee cups peats and candles again would any really highclass butler have permitted professor endorwick to snooze undisturbed in his chair for two hours on end not that he did any harm by his slumbers he might have awakened at any moment and joined unhesitatingly in the desultory talk of those two true enough yet when at last eustace did rouse the learned man by lighting lady mauds candle they both felt that the teteatete had not left them quite as it found them that in some of those halfindifferent ordinary remarks a virtue had gone out of them she took the light from him decidedly with a refusal of his offer to pilot her along the dark passages angry with herself for the very thought she still felt that it would be wiser to say goodnight here under the professors eye and as she went up the dim staircase she paused to give a glance at the sea with a wonder as to when louisa would find calm or courage enough to attempt the voyage in a vague way she recognized that things would go more comfortably if she were there but beyond a sense of motion in the deep grey plane stretching away to a paler grey horizon she could see nothing the tide was flowing one way or another that much was certain she opened the door of her dressingroom softly so as not to disturb her husband should he have fallen asleep a great fire burnt bravely in her little sittingroom beyond and something in the unusual silence of it all enhanced its comfort in her eyes if josephine had been awaiting her as usual she could not have put off the task of undressing in favour of sheer idleness by the fire her husband was right something in that rhythmical surge of the sea made one not exactly restless but on the alert disinclined for action yet prepared for it a foolish idea since what could be going to happen to the small household already for the most part asleep the professor would have taken the first opportunity of recommencing that snooze legitimately in his bed and even eustacewhy would her thoughts run on eustace irritated at her own selfconsciousness she took up a book impatiently it interested her and by and by she turned for the second volume to find that it must have been left in the travelling bag which kirstys ignorance had put in the bedroom shading the light carefully she passed through the dressingroom and so into the room beyond giving a tentative glance at the bed as she entered lest she should disturb the sleeper it was empty her hand fell from the light she looked round the room in surprise and the next moment was on her knees beside a figure on the floora figure which even in her first alarm brought back a horrible memory edward what is the matter are you ill once as a slip of a girl out blackberrying she had come upon a tipsy tramp in a ditch a beast of a man who had met her innocent benevolence by stumbling to his feet pursuing her as far as his feet would carry him this was her solitary personal experience of drunkenness and something in her husbands look and attitude revived the dread which had remained with her ever since yet he might be illvery very ill edward what is it this time he raised an unsteady arm against the candle she held to his face and she shrank back shaking all over her first impulse was that of civilizationto ring for help at least for company but what good would that do in an empty house josephine until other women came to share her fears had elected to sleep in a great chamber on the upper storey besides what good would she be kirsty slept outside with the other farm servants eustace no no not eustacenot now at any ratenot till she was certain there was the cook of course people in that rank of life were accustomedoh no no it was not possible what a wretch she was to harbour such suspicions when he might be illperhaps dying with this protest in her mind her rich draperies caught over her arm the candle flaring guttering almost out in the swift search she made her way to the unknown regions beyond the swing door which separated work from leisure here no that must be the pantry there no that was the gunroom so peering in at each room she went along the stone passages till suddenly a door right in front of her opened and eustace gordon came out with a candle in his hand he had been sitting up over the smokingroom fire impelled as she had been to wakefulness by something he knew not what maud maud my darling what is it what is the matter she forgot everything in the comfort of companionship as still shaking with fear she went swiftly to his side edward i think he is ill oh eustace i am so frightened and he in his turn taken utterly by surprise seemed to forget everything save that the woman he loved passionately was there beside him his thoughts had been so full of her nothing but her and now oh come please come he is ill i know he is ill yes i am coming he said with an effort at selfcontrol where is hein your room then with his arm round her they went back through the silent house together those two alone yet not it seemed to her so much alone as when they stood at last with that drunken figure lying on the floor between them she knew the truth at once in his quick exclamation and then everything under sun and stars seemed to slip away and leave them face to face eustace and she eustace and me the low rush of the waves caught the refrain and repeated it ceaselessly dont be alarmed you had better go away she heard the words as in a dream scarcely recognizing the voice in its harsh passion stay he shall not remain here not here in your room then she felt his hands grip hers and the voice rang with fierce resentment maud maud that this should have come to youto you of all people by heaven it is too much i will not bear it she laughed suddenly and broke from him you mean that he has taken too much whiskey well plenty of men do that and you others thinkthink nonenone the worse then she broke down flinging her arms across the bed by which she had been standing oh my god what shall i do what shall i do her outburst calmed him go into the other room dear i will call some one she turned on him as she knelt like a wild animal at bay no not the servants no one shall know i will not have it let me help i am quite strong do you think id let you touch him he burst out go ill manage she crept away cowed by his vehemence overcome by the desire to obey which subdues most women when the command is from one they love back to the fire she had left so short a time ago it was dull now but a touch sent the responsive flames leaping up the chimney would any amount of care restore that confidence in herself which but an hour ago had defied fate eustace and sheeustace and me what evil chance was this she started from a maze of confused fear at his knock at her door a light please you have no bed here and none of the other rooms are fit for you tonight so i have brought this i had to leave himthere why should you trouble she asked drearily with lacklustre eyes on his burden of blankets and pillows i can so easily sit up it must be near morning now he gave her a look so full of passionate adoration that her eyes fell before it do you think i am going to let you suffer one little bitone atom of discomfort because of him no that shall not be you shall never suffer how can you help it how can you ask we may have made a mistake maud perhaps we havnt god knows but if we have why then he came over to where she was standing and took her hands in his so they stood those two alone with nothing between them save a conscience which could be turned aside every barrier raised by the world broken down by a strange fate by a mere turn of the tide goodnight dear he said stooping to kiss her she made no reply no protest perhaps in her heart of hearts she knew that he said the truth that if it was a mistake why then the waves caught up that refrain also as she lay with wide sleepless eyes on the little campbed with which his care had provided her it is a mistakeyou shall not sufferit is a mistakeyou shall not suffer iii when she woke next morning a becapped and beaproned upper housemaid was bringing in her early cup of tea yes milady we ave hall come mr ooper e ave come too milady indeed if it adnt bin for mr ooper we should ave bin picking hup cattle in that horful minch till hevenin but e took it on imself to tell the capting as master would willin pay hextra for us to come as quick as might be and thankful we was milady for some of us mightnt ave lived to see land jane looked as if she certainly would have been one of those to succumb and lady maud gave a sigh of relief tell hooper to go to his masterhe wasnt very well last nightand tell josephine i shall breakfast in my room mr ooper ave gone to master replied jane in a voice which implied that the reminder was unnecessary and if you please milady capting weeks e ave come too we picked im up with some cattle in a boat from some place as begins with an hoich lady maud gave another sigh of relief the sandbags of civilization were a great protection after all and if captain weeks had come eustace would go out shooting with him that would give her a whole day to face the situation honestly she thought far more of possible difficulties with him than with her husband the shock had been terrible at the time but perhaps after all it was an isolated offence heaps of men in society got drunk decently out of sight of their legal womenkind and no one thought the recurrence of the phrase she had used the night before made her pause and hide her face in the pillow in sudden horror at herself and him no without going so far as that one could still be rational edward was devoted to her and if a wife by her influence made a better man of her husband wherein lay the degradation last nightgreat heavens what had come over her last night she had been taken by surprise placed in conditions which no one could possibly have foreseen dragged by main force from every shelter her face burnt as she remembered and yet how natural it had been natural and therefore absurd ridiculous today however was different and so the little pencilled note from eustace which josephine brought in with the breakfast received no reply save a message to say she was perfectly well and hoped he would look after captain weeks if mr wilson was not able to go out a bold parry which made eustace gordon set his teeth yes today was different a new heaven and a new earth the very house transformed for when she came down to lunch the drawingroom was full of tables screens photographs and ferns while in the diningroom the butler stood ready to remove the silver covers and so let loose the pentup energies of two footmen who with bent heads seemed waiting for some one to say grace mr gordon the report ran had taken captain weeks to the carbost beat and would not be back till late her ladyship was to open any telegram which might come as it would relate to the yacht mr wilson had gone to shoot rockpigeon with the head keeper the professor was exploring and begged her ladyship not to wait lunch for him so said the butler gravely as he filled her glass through the window she could see the atlantic guiltless of a white feather and her own courage rose with the outlook as she strolled about the heathery knolls after lunch a boy on a pony appeared with the expected telegram started should be with you tomorrow so that was an end of one trouble then cynthia strong and some others were to come by the next boat will lockhart was cruising about the coast and might look in on them at any time there would be no more solitude not even today since there across the moor came miss macdonald attired for calling and beside her that goodlooking young sailor lady maud liked boys especially handsome ones with palpable adoration in their blue eyes the professor coming in very hot about teatime found the trio having it like children out in a bieldy bit by the burn but with the butler solemnly presiding over the fire a fire which gave james the under footman the hugest delight until his enjoyment was crushed out of him by his superior officer for the butler knew his duty afternoon tea was afternoon tea wherever her ladyship chose to take it that is to say a function at which a footman must preserve an impassive face so poor james put on the sticks with funeral calm and burnt his fingers with great decorum here is a lady professor said lady maudmiss macdonaldprofessor endorwickwho will tell you everything you can possibly want to know about the island she is a mine of useful information at least i have found her so that gracious voice face and manner had been a sort of rapture to young rick halmar for the last half hour and when after launching the others into conversation she turned to him with the undefinable change in manner she could no more avoid in talking to men than the magnet can keep its influence his heart gave quite a throb i didnt introduce you she said smiling because i only know your christian name and im not sure of that rick rick halmar he replied with a blush which took him by surprise for he was not as a rule selfconscious rick she echoed curiously eric my father was a norwegian but it was a boshy name and the fellows on the britannia called me little by littleafter the book you know she laughed a very inappropriate name mr halmar you must be six feet he shook his head five feet eleven and threequarters its too big for a sailor you get in the way of the ropes and things not too big for a manbut listen the professor is overcome already how delightful in good sooth he was actually reduced to the position of listener an isolated assertion of interest being all the speech allowed him as miss willina waxed eloquent over the crass superstitions of the islanders and her own select beliefs ricks face grew brimful of smiles aunt will is as bad as the best herself why the other day i carved out a sort of devila thing they worship in the caribbeesand she was in quite a taking because it was left out on a harpthats a vikings tomb lady maud she has some rigmarole about tribute to the dead their sending back things to work evil to the living but do you know lady maud its awfully rum but i couldnt find the thing when i went to look for it yesterday morning you couldnt find it mr halmar dont speak loud dont attract their attention by looking surprised was itthe devil i meanfearfully ugly the best i ever made had it white eyes with a shot stuck in them lady maud did you find it not i but the professor did its a footstep of a discredited belief and he is going to lecture on it to the british association isnt it perfectly lovely how we shall all laugh but you will tell him of course tell him why should i these things are one of my chief joys in life rick halmar winced but dont you see lady maud its my fault more or less i oughtnt to go carving devils and leaving them about it isnt fair she raised her eyebrows when you are older mr halmar you wont be so eager to accept responsibility by the way does yours extend to another devil of the same sort which was found on grada sands he let his head drop into his hands in comic despair how ones sins do find one out it must be the one aunt will flung into the minch everything comes round sooner or later to the sands has the professor got it too no mr halmar i have it you oh lady maudi am sorry you well may be i have put it into my own room because the professor declared it was genuinea real savage fate nothat isnt true so dont distress yourself i took a fancy to it i have a habit of taking fancies to things and to people so there it shall remain ricks face lit up let me make you a better one he began i said mr halmar that i took a fancy to it and now dont you think you should make your confession like a good boy he made it very prettily but with a frank enjoyment of the mistake which was infectious so much so that the chief sufferer stimulated into unusual playfulness by miss willinas wit actually went into the house for his discredited belief and brought it out for her to burn so with much laughter they stood round the fire causing poor james almost to burst under his efforts after dignity till suddenly with something between a chuckle and a cough the butler himself gave way into the remark that i adnt made a guy forkskckkhkhsince e was a boykhkhkhbut if er ladyship pleased jeames could run round to the gunroom for some powder and ed ave some squibs ready in no time so numbo jumbo was burnt with all the honours and the butler going back for his own tea to the housekeepers room hummed remember remember the fifth of november until the cook with a snort asked wherever to goodness he had picked up such a vulgar ditty now i have no doubt all you learned people think me very foolish said miss willina drawing on her gloves with the air of one who has completed a good work but i really am immensely relieved in my mind i had a presentiment about that devil of ricks besides these old superstitions invariably have their origin in some fundamental fact or law of nature dont you think so professor undoubtedly my dear madam the folklore society but miss willina had a profound contempt for all societies and proclaimed it cheerfully therefore the only remaining thing to be done she continued shaking her head at rick is to make restitution for that naughty boys mischief so if you will walk over to eval some day mr endorwick i will give you that bone ring with the runic inscription about which i was telling you my dear lady cried the professor with greed in his eyes i really could not dream i dont want to give it to you of course she went on frankly but my brother says it should be in a museum so you can put given by miss macdonald through professor endorwick on the ticket and by the bye it was found on grada and malcolm aig says meanwhile lady maud had turned to rick with a quizzical smile do you accept the responsibility of my fate mr halmar or shall i have a private autodafe in my room the boys face positively shone with pleasure as he took her hand to say goodbye i couldnt do anything that would bring you harm i thinkyou are tootoo beautiful the absolute simplicity of the statement rendered it inoffensive and lady maud laughed take your nephew away miss macdonald he is paying me compliments i dont wonder at it retorted the little lady nodding her head and compliments are pleasant things at least i used to find them so why employ the past tense dear lady said the professor with a bow as he shook hands whereat miss willina declared that the only safety lay in flight and lady maud as she went back to the house told herself once more that today was very different from yesterday this background of persiflage with just a serious touch here and there to help out the chiarooscuro suited figures in modern dress tailormade figures guiltless of a wrinkle and oblivious of vitalitys claim for an uncrushed organ or two if her ladyship please said josephine when the dressing bell brought her to her mistress room mr ooper he desire a few word of milady hooper didnt they say he had gone with mr wilson monsieur ave just return mr gordon also wid capitaine veek andmon dieu quel gibier sall i bid him come lady maud at the writingtable rested her head on her hand feeling a sudden need of courage they had all come back and some things must be faced before life could run smoothly once more eustace must be made to understand that there was to be no drifting and her husband must consent to let her hand be on the tiller ropes well hooper rather a diffidentlooking man nervous too in his manner i am sorry to have to trouble your ladyship but i think dr haddon would wish it under the circumstances it is about master your ladyship her heart gave a great throb your master hooper well the diffident man holding on to the doorknob as for support cleared his throat it is a little difficult my lady and mr gordon when he spoke to me was for saying nothing but i have been considering the matter and i think dr haddon who is dr haddon i was not quite sure if your ladyship knewanything but master was under dr haddon for a time itit is for the liquor habit my lady and dr haddon is most successful he was most successful with master four years i have been with him since we came back from america and never till last night he coughed slightly and paused lady maud sate staring at him without a word i am very sorry my lady the other servants will tell you how distressed i was to be absent from my duty it arose from my not understanding the porters accent my lady but it will not occur again i mean my lady thatahemnothing of the sort will occur again so there is no need forfor distress or anxiety you mean that as long asas you are with mr wilson so far she managed in a cold hard voice then came silence just so my ladyit is a question of influence i undertake the entire responsibility there is really no cause for alarm thatthat will do hooper you can go her one thought was to get rid of this man this servant who seemed to have reached out his common hand and touched her very soul he paused still with his hand on the door i beg pardon my lady but there is one thing dr haddons system is based on influence it does not allow any appeal toahemto the moral sense therefore if your ladyship could kindly treat the mistake of yesterday with silence it would be betterfor the system dr haddon ignores failure on principle itit is part of the system and any interference may be dangerous therefore if your ladyship i quite understand you can go when she was left alone she sate staring on at the door he had closed behind him behind whom why the man whooh it was an impossible an incredible position she had married her husband without caring for him but she had married him also because she intended that he should care for her and now what was he but a puppet dependent on this man she had not married edward wilson but wilsoncumhaddon cumhooper and eustace knew it her husband the possible father of her children she had known all along that he was a weak man but that the very possibility of his living decently lay in the will of another was hopeless horrible degradation she had often in society talked lightly of the part hypnotism was to play in the future regeneration of the world but now that even a suspicion of it touched her inner life it left her in wild revolt when all was said and done that man to whom they paid so many pounds a year was master of her fate it should never be better far better that her husband should be drunk and yet what right had she to interfere it will be too late to make milady charmante suggested josephine coming in reproachfully she stood up hastily with clenched hands eustace should not see her degradationshe would show him there is plenty of time she said coldly put on my diamonds josephinethat dress is dull they can wait if i am not ready she was worth waiting for and mr wilsons weak face brightened as she went up to him with easy grace did you have a good day edward i saw hooper for a moment but i forgot to ask him about the sport she failed in her object for all her bravado the eyes she sought to blind saw too clearly so louisa comes tomorrow she said lightly as after keeping all the men her husband included at her feet during the evening she rose to say goodnight and let her hand linger purposely in her cousins so that he should see she did not care that she was not afraid no he replied coldly ive had another wire she came as far as portree and hearing that the gathering is next week decided to stay and show off her new dresses she got about a ton of them in paris if you remember and women even the best of them love to show off his tone roused her to reckless resentment by its assumption of knowledge and condemnation he does not look very sorry for his wifes decision does he professor she asked with a laugh my dear lady how could he be sorry for anything in his present position or i in mine she retorted giving a little mock curtsey over the hand she still held eustace gordon bit his lip but said nothing iv you look worried said will lockhart the place doesnt suit you i told you it wouldnt when we hid behind charity is there anything really the matter his voice took a softer tone anything i could help you to set straight they were sitting by the fire in lady mauds little sittingroom whither they had retired from the bustle inseparable from tea in the drawingroom when bad weather keeps even the sportsmen indoors he said the truth she looked worn and fagged and her pose as she leant back in her easychair was one of listless fatigue nonsense there is nothing the matter nothing more than the usual worries of a hostess in tiresome weather to begin with it has prevented your coming here till you can only spare us a miserable day on your way to rejoin the yacht then louisa after wasting a fine week over the portree gathering was detained there ten days by storm finally just as she started for the highlands one at inverness pour passer le temps it cleared up since then it has been what is called unsettled most of all for poor eustace who never knows for two days together what is going to happen then lady liddell caught cold at a picnic and cynthia strong whom i invited for the professora girtonite you know does mathematics and all thatseems uncertain whether she doesnt prefer arthur weeks a man who hasnt a penny and cant do a sum beyond the compound addition of his bills a catalogue of evils certainly that isnt all the professor who would make her an excellent husband being in that set and with a charming house too at oxford does nothing but go over to eval house to see miss macdonaldyou knew her once i thinkwell he looks on her as an encyclopaedia of discredited beliefs a unique copy of an ancient work on folklore which the lucky finder is bound to purchase besides she has a valuable collection when i knew her broke in will lockhart hotly she did not need any adventitious attractions she was simply the loveliest lady mauds languid hands met in faint applause i thought that would draw you so she was the mauvais quart dheure i am not really laughing so dont be angry only from the way she spoke of you did she speak of me how can you ask and women never speak of the men who have loved them in the same tone of voice they use for the dense indiscriminating multitude who didnt then miss macdonalds voice must change pretty often ah was that it you were jealous nothing so romantic we quarrelled over some bread and butterwe were very young then circumstances favoured absence so forgetfulness came or at least indifference absolute indifference he paused for a moment and so the professor is there constantly is he lady maud smiled behind the fan with which she screened her face from the fire he is there now i expect he went dunehunting in the south this morning and was to stop there for the night thought he might be late besides he must consult the encyclopaedia will lockhart frowned this has made us drift from the point your husband does he like the place apparently and the servants are satisfied too which is a great gain they get all their work done for them by the natives it is an immense relief to shift ones responsibilities to other folks shoulders isnt it he looked at her sharply there is something the matter is it only other peoples loveaffairs and what for instance of that handsome boy downstairs who does sir walter raleighs cloak for your majestys feet all day long lady maud leant forward eagerly her whole face alight you mean rick do you remember once when you were very angry with me saying i was enough to ruin any man in a week it wasnt true big bear i couldnt spoil rick halmar have you tried and failed he asked cynically she shook her head and a soft halfsmiling halftearful look came to her pretty eyes you dont know him and i cant explain yet i tell you that i couldnt spoil one of that dear lads happy days unless she broke off suddenly raising her eyes to the image on the mantelshelf he carved that devil up there she went on with the smile gaining on the tears the professor said it was a savage conception of fate but it isnt it is rick halmars conception of my fate and thatwell that hasnt much of the devil in it come it is time i was returning to my duties as hostess time for me to be going also he replied looking at his watch i have seven miles before me not if you make use of the eval ferryboat she looked at him mischievously i do not intend to make use of it even to oblige you lady maud i might meet the professor and then there would be a pettyassault case of course how tiresome you are i counted on your being here a week at least and people can unmake ever so many quarrels in seven days or make them but the elements are too strong for you lady maud i told you so rick halmar came up as still smiling over the joke they entered the drawingroom im so glad i was afraid you might not come before i left and i must go soon then you can pilot mr lockhart a little way he has to walk over to carbost bay a good bit of the way you mean replied rick turning his bright face towards will lockharts our ferry is far the shortest in fact its the only road for the upperend bridge gave way in the flood last night and the stream isnt fordable yet lady mauds eyebrows went up archly what a nuisance the elements are at times arent they mr lockhart i should think so assented rick cheerfully why we have been trying to get to eileanafaash these three weekshavent we lady maudwithout catching a fine day and a suitable tide on the hop together the sea ford might have done last spring but it was too rough for the ladies to return by boat or else too wet but the first fine day that is it isnt it yes mr halmar cried cynthia strong from the window seat where captain weeks was blissfully useful over a skein of wool and please order the fine day soon for i have to go by the next clansman then i shall go too murmured the captain i suppose the birds will be getting rather wild by that time remarked the young lady tartly theoretically she felt bound to despise her admirer and his occupations practically his murmurs made her heart beat wild why they lie like stones on this coast something to do with the gulf stream im told though i know nothing myself about these scientific things but you can kick em up and shoot em like chickens on the last day of the season and when is that captain weeks laughedthe true mans laugh of surprised tolerance i thought you knew everything miss strong but i dont suppose they think it worth while to teach girls its the th of december for grouse but partridges go on till the beginning of february and theres no real close time for his voice fell to the confidential tone eustace gordon had meanwhile joined the trio at the door yes let it be soon please for i may be going also ive just heard maud from louisa and the last idea is that i am to take the yacht which she is sending here round to cowes and that we are to start at once for less uncertain climes the mediterranean most likely that is veryunexpected but all my friends are flying south like the swallows and i have to go furthest of all said rick ruefully im booked for the pacific station as sure as fate then you must send me home a real numbo jumbo if you come across one she replied smiling up into his eager boyish face with a confidence absolutely free from all alloy wont i and some of those jolly shells too all the pretty things i can pick up thank you rick i like pretty things he flushed with pleasure at her tone and words well goodbye she said turning to will lockhart i hope the elements wont be too strong for you or for you confidence here also but of a different sortthe sort which can give a reason for the faith that is in it it seemed however as if lady mauds wish was not to be fulfilled for as rick halmar and his companion set off across the moor the southwest wind even at that distance from the shore sent a shower of spindrift in their faces no leaving carbost bay for you tonight shouted rick against the wind you had better stay at our place you used to know aunt will long ago didnt you yes but i must get on it may calm any moment and the yacht sails as soon as possible nevertheless when after scudding with the wind at their backs for two miles they came upon the ferry one glance showed even will lockharts inexperienced eye that the cockleshell of a boat bobbing up and down in the backwater could never fight its way through that mad melee of wind against tide in the middle of the narrow stream comparative calm reigned to one side in the inland loch and to the other in the open sea but here the waves leapt at each other in pyramids sending jets of spray upwards with the very force of their meeting a good thrower could easily have flung a stone across the channel for all that it was impassable till the tired tide should turn and join the wind in its race eastward so at any rate said rick adding that his aunt would be delighted at a contretemps which would procure her a visit from an old friend why will lockhart should have hesitated when it was raining cats and dogs and it was twoandtwenty years since he had parted in anger from the hotheaded quicktongued chit of eighteen who was now by all accounts a brisk contented woman of forty is not easy of explanation perhaps the thought of lady mauds triumph rankled perhaps when all was said and done he was not quite indifferent to that possible future with the professor but he did hesitate for a moment that early loveaffair had strangely enough been his first and last not because it was in itself absorbing but because other things more absorbing than love had stepped in to take possession of his life for a year or two no doubt resentment had lingered not very keenly felt but sufficiently so to prevent other loveaffairs then he had painted his first successful picture and that had been an end of all things save art and a rather unreal remembrance that he had loved and lost however common sense came to his aid as it was bound to do in that drenching rain and after all the professor was not in the wellremembered drawingroom whither rick led him neither was miss willina fortunately perhaps for her dignity of which she was extremely tenacious she had been in the pottingshed feeding a late brood of chickens presented to her that morning by an inexperienced young mother who had preferred a bed of nettles behind the peat stack to the comforts of the henhouse nursery so she had ample opportunity of seeing them pass up the ferrypath and of grasping the situation to say nothing of smoothing her hair and washing her hands before putting in an appearance the which is a great support to most women in the crises of life as a matter of fact however miss willina had never regarded this episode of her earliest years of conquest as one of supreme importance perhaps some slight inkling that it really did mean more than she was prepared to admit was at the bottom of her deliberate want of romance on the subject she had had many admirers had them still for that matter she was perfectly aware for instance of the professors interest but for all that she had never felt inclined to marry since those salad days when she had drowned her resentment in the knowledge that half the men who knew her were at her feet why should she marry there was plenty of time and opportunity if she wished it and then when time passed leaving her still miss macdonald she told herself and every one else that it was of her own free will and pleasure as it undoubtedly was she scouted regrets and only when the masterful current of her vitality slackened as even hers had to do at times did she wonder if that early loveaffair had not been at the bottom of her coldbloodedness will lockhart did not think her much changed the daintiness and wilfulness he chiefly remembered were still there and it was like old times to hear her order him up with rick to change his feet and see the swift touch with which she rescued an antimacassar from annihilation when he sate down and this want of change depressed him by emphasizing the long years which he could not forget there she was much as he remembered her and hepeople told him also that he had changed but little yet in those old days it had seemed impossible to conceive of life apart and here they were both free both unmarried talking calmly with a new generation for listener about that past time what had kept them separate except their own free will nothing and yet had either of them deliberately anticipated this ending when they quarrelled over the bread and butter and now she was thinking of the professor or at any rate the professor was thinking of her that was lady mauds account and there was certainly a suspicion of consciousness when the learned mans name was mentioned a palpable flush indeed when a faint whistle overbore that of the wind and she started from her chair rick it cant surely be mr endorwick the blush made her look years younger and will lockhart felt distinctly aggrieved at the fact by george it is though replied her nephew after a glance through the fieldglasses which hung ready for the purpose on the windowknob there he is on the other side of the stream he has hoisted the flag and is blowing away at the whistle like fits his umbrellas inside out and his mackintosh floating on the breeze do look aunt will its awfully comic miss willinas face was a study of dignity and humour the first prevailed eric i am surprised at your levity the poor man will be drenched to the skin and he so delicate such a distinguished scholar too we could ill afford to lose him give me the glass said will lockhart grimly the sight of his supposed successor signalling for the impossible gave him a thrill of satisfaction for he at least was on the right side of the stream and then to the keen little creature at his side came a mood well remembered the born idiot any christian would have stopped at the hotel even if he was wanting to come on a fool for his pains ah whats the use of blowing like a hooter with the wind and tide against you gracious goody rick whats to be done the gawk cant be left there like a windmill the comparison was not inapt for the professor seeing them doubtless against the firelight within was waving his arms frantically ill go down and signal him to that bieldy bit behind the big rock its out of the wind anyhow and the tide will be turning before he could walk back to shelter and ill stop in the boathouse it will comfort him to see me smoking especially if he has forgotten his matches besides i must put new rowlocks to the fouroar well want her and the men too if any one is to cross the stream tonight thats a nice boy said will lockhart putting down the glasses as ricks figure on its way to the boathouse blocked out the professors increasing despair just about the age i was when he paused and looked at his companion yes you were twentyone and i was eighteen they were standing close together the firelight throwing their shadows out faintly against the growing darkness but on their faces the dull autumn twilight lingered blotting out all traces of the passage of time he came a little nearer to her i wonder why we quarrelled he said argumentatively i dont mean what we quarrelled about that was never very difficult to find was it but why did we quarrel finally that last time i dont recollect that you were more wilful than usual no doubt you were more aggravating she retorted quickly do you wish to begin it all over again i will if youve a mind to begin what the quarrel of course no thank you theres the professor hauling down his flag he has seen rick and acknowledged his defeat good man dont you think miss macdonald that it would be more comfortable by the fire than here at the window more comfortable than the professor is poor man that is what you mean how selfish all you men are and then you expect me not to see through you i dont think i ever was quite so exigeant as that was i and do you know i rather wish you would just cast your eye over my innermost thoughts at the present moment it would save me beating about the bush perhaps despite her outward calm she was a little excited for she had taken up her knitting half mechanically and now the needles clashed fast and furious he was leaning towards her his elbows on his knees his hands loosely clasped together and something of his youth not so much in its romance as in its imperious desire to know and understand was in his face miss macdonald ive no right to ask but are you going to marrythat man on the other side she gave a little conscious laugh halfnervous halfgratified that is what you call beating about the bush i suppose whywhy should i marry anybody for the life of him he could not tell save that in a vague way that dead past seemed so pitiful because it was dead and past why did we quarrel he repeated if the clansman hadnt come in unexpectedly that evening after her time and so given me an opportunity of going off in the sulks we should have made it up as usual it seems such a little thing to come between us she laid down her knitting and looked at him thoughtfully a woman less truthful than miss willina might have allowed the inevitable satisfaction of being remembered to give an extra tinge of regret and romance to that past which in sober fact had had little of either but miss willinas sense of humour was of the rare kind which is not blunted by egotism ridiculously little in the novelsi read dozens of them in the winterit is always something pathetic a letter left in a blotting book or a wrong initial on the envelope or a false announcement of marriage something not to be foreseen or helped or if it isnt the fault of fate they get brain fever and forget their own names but we we just quarrelled and didnt care to make it up it isnt in the least romantic im afraid but we didnt forget he said in the same argumentative tone at least i didnt of course not does any one ever forgetabsolutely her voice trembled slightly the pathos of memory was not to be ignored entirely it seems such a pityyou and i leading such lonely lives lonely you should see my noahs ark well dont scoff at me i suppose it is absurd but tonight somehow she interrupted him with a soft hand laid on his dont please dont it is like children trying to pretend that their shadows on the wall are alive but they are shadows nothing but shadows and the light which throws them she pointed to the window with a laugh that was half a sob poor man he ought to be extinguished by this time perhaps you are right he replied sadly still holding her hand but it seems hardthe shadows were so pretty not so pretty as the reality what is that that we have met and forgiven each otherwithout payment aunt will shouted rick bursting into the room theres the professor in the front hall dripping like a drowned rat i got the men and ferried him over on the first chance now they are waiting for mr lockhart miss willina was on her feet in a moment take him upstairs rick and put him to bedbetween the blankets ill come directly with gruel and mustard and rick give him a good scruball overwith the roughestbath towelyou can find the last directions were called up the stairs as she went into the hall to see will lockhart put on his mackintosh properly goodbye miss macdonald im not in the least envious of the professors immediate future he said with smiling eyes but with vague regrets still at his heart im glad though he was at the other side of the stream tonight i liked the shadows and the reality she asked quickly he stooped and kissed the pretty little hand browned by sun and wind it is like the breath of your sea the memory of it will help to blow away the cobwebs until i come backin the summer the summer is over not st martins and one often has a spell of fine weather late in the year when the earlier portions have been stormy she shook her head v well hooper what is it lady maud stood at bay once more with that diffidentlooking man at the door three weeks had passed since his first interview only three weeks and it seemed to her an eternity of fear and anxiety but now the letters written in reply to hers had come from the american doctor and she knew the worst mr wilsons case had at once been easy and difficult easy because of his singular lack of will power difficult for the same reason joined to a very bad ancestral record so bad that his maternal uncle from whom he had inherited his large fortune being deeply resentful of the treatment his sister had endured from her drunken husband had burdened his legacy with certain unusual conditions as to sobriety and control consequently when shortly after his release from the restraints of minority the inherited tendency had shown itself in mr wilson he had voluntarily placed himself in dr haddons charge urged to the step by his fear of pecuniary loss that was briefly the whole story save that he dr haddon continued to have charge of the case and would be obliged if lady maud would cooperate with him in continuing a system which had hitherto been so successful and which he did not scruple to add was mr wilsons only chance of fulfilling the conditions under which he held his fortune for himself he believed there was no danger of a relapse it might even be possible after some years to relax the supervision and in any case he begged her to remember that the hereditary tendency must needs be weakened by a generation even of enforced sobriety he had hoped that there might be no necessity for her to be made acquainted with these circumstances as the whole affair had been dealt with in the strictest confidence and the essence of his treatment lay in ignoring the difficulty but now that the untoward event reported by hooper had occurred it was better she should clearly understand the position of affairs briefly he was paid for keeping mr wilson from losing a very large portion of his wealth apart from that it was an interesting case in regard to hooper he was thoroughly trustworthy and conscientiousa most necessary thing when influence was easy to attain at the same time if hooper failed to commend himself to lady maud he could be replaced in view of the heavy stake at issue however he would recommend extreme caution in making any change as for his reasons for allowing mr wilson to marry under the circumstances they were manifold and his belief in the system was so great that he felt confident lady maud would never find cause for blame in her husbands conduct the letter in its bald statement of fact its assumption of a perfectly satisfactory state of affairs carried with it a sort of cold comfort and yet lady maud felt a wild revolt against it such as no verdict of disease or death would have aroused like most women who marry men to whom they are indifferent she had looked forward odd as it may seem to having children who would give a zest to an otherwise insipid life and now the mere possibility was a terror not in pity for those who might come handicapped into the race but from sheer physical horror that they should be his and hers and this terror came uppermost in the first few minutes of shock i have heard from dr haddon this morning my lady in future i am to take my orders from you so i have come to ask for them the disapproval in his tone was audible she felt a rash resentful desire to bid him go and leave her free but the doctors warning checked the words what if she should have burdened her life for nothingshe who had refused money again and again because it seemed vulgar to her fastidiousness she might appeal to her husband as a man chance her influence against the hooperhaddon system but what if she failed during those last three weeks she had silenced the heart which despite all her efforts would have its way by protestations that she was only awaiting the doctors reply that by and by she would no longer consent to be this mans wife on these terms to live on as if she knew nothing to give neither help nor condemnation to acquiesce without a word in a future which filled her with shame and horror when she knew the facts she would decide and now she knew too much i have no orders she said in a low voice no new ones you can go then suddenly a thought flashed through her and she arrested him with a gesture yes my lady still she was silent one hand gripping the edge of the table her breath coming fast i do not thinkthis placeis good for mr wilson indeed your ladyship broke in hooper relieved i have thought so myselfthethe irregular habits in regard to spirits are trying i think he would be better away exactly so my lady only i did not likeall the arrangements being as it were settled her voice had gained in steadiness by this time there need be no alteration i should remain here of course she paused and hooper shifted uneasily mr wilson had an invitation to perthshire yesterday i should like him to accept it do you understand but indeed my lady i cannot to begin with i am not allowed by dr haddon she stopped him angrily if you cannot obey me there are othersso dr haddon says i consider this place is bad for mr wilson and it is my wish he should leave it do you hear for the life of her try after calmness as she would entreaty and despair made her command falter he must goif only to give her time to think time to settle what course she would choose if your ladyship takes the responsibilityin regard to dr haddon i mean i take it allthe responsibility for everything then i will suggest it i may not succeed but i will do my best and if i fail your ladyship must remember that i was not engaged for such work the grotesqueness of it all struck her sense of humour despite the turmoil of emotion in which she found herself yes yes she said impatiently i will remember it was not your place when he had gone she stood for some time without moving her hand still grasping the table body and mind alike in a state of tension then her nerves seemed to slacken the spirit to leave her she walked listlessly towards the fire and leaning her arms on the mantelpiece rested her head upon them so standing the little curls about her temples outlined themselves against the ugliness of rick halmars devil it is not all my fault she muttered with a sort of sob not all my fault surely i must have time i must have time the rest of the day was torture to her she did not regret the sudden impulse which had decreed her husbands exile if it could be managed yet she dreaded to have him say the words which would proclaim the success of her treachery against him he came over once to where she sate in the twilight pretending to read and laid his hand affectionately on her shoulder it was only some trivial remark he had to make but she started so visibly that eustace watching her as he had watched her every mood during those weeks came to her afterwards with a frown what is the matter maud why should you keep me at arms length surely i know too much for that already what do you know she asked with the recklessness which of late had crept into her manner i know you are unhappy do you remember what i told you that night you shall not suffer her lips trembled and she turned from him hastily to join a group gathered round the professor he had come back from eval house greatly depressed in spirits and with a running cold in his head which cynthia strong was treating with pulsatilla as yet rather unsuccessfully but it required time she explained when the first stages had been badly managed on the old methods the group was engaged in examining the famous rhine ring with which gift apparently miss willina had tried to content the learned man but even its possession failed to comfort him i have deciphered the inscription he said gloomily it is briefly order truth honesty the last word bears many side meanings and perhaps purity would be a better translation all the terminations being feminine it may be inferred that the ring was worn by a woman possibly one of unusual worth it may even have been a badge of virtue a tribute paid by the community to merit or by the lover to his beloved if he had said a funeral memento to the dead his voice could not have been more lugubrious how interesting murmured cynthia strong even in those days the mental qualities were deemed superior to mere physical attractions i beg your pardon retorted the professor quite tartly order as used here means complete perfect according to our modern speech beautiful truth has also a secondary meaning a free but at the same time accurate translation would be beautiful constant chaste rick halmar was twisting the ring about in his strong deft hands i expect some beggar gave it to his wife he said cheerfully it must have been just as jolly then as now to have somebody to stick by you through thick and thin to have the dinner ready and not swear if you hadnt done what you ought to have done not brought in enough fish for the kids for instance though how they ever caught any with those bone hooks i cant think i couldnt you must remember the great incentive of hunger remarked the professor in the same tone besides in those days dexterity in the chase was the master key to a womans affections i say weeks old man why werent you born then cried rick happily unconscious of all complications never had any luck muttered the other except with the birds luck i like that you call it luck when you never miss i assure you miss strong he continued going up to where the despondent captain was standing and addressing the nearest lady i was out with him yesterday and he made me feel such a duffer the prettiest shooting and then he calls it luck cynthia strong looked from one to the other of those two vigorous young faces before her and then at the professors pale one a cold in the head is not becoming and she sighed rick with the ring still in his possession returned to lady maud isnt it quaint he said dont you wish i could find another why because it would be yours of course how small it looks i wonder if it would fit you miss macdonald found it too large for her remarked the professor still more gloomily but it would be interesting lady maud to try whether it points to any improvement or deteriorationphysical of coursein the race perhaps you ladies would not mind experimenting cinderella and the little glass slipper laughed eustace gordon what is to be the prize endorwickthe ring my dear sir gasped the professor horrified for once out of his gallantry its uniquepositively unique ill tell you what put in rick eagerly if the professor will lend it to me for a couple of days ill copy it in silver a florin would make it and the inscriptions only scratched on so now then ladies if you please weeks you do herald lady maud may we use the banner screen as a tabard what a boy that is said fat lady liddell to her nextdoor neighbour ive been here a fortnight and never saw him out of temper or out of spirits so different from most young people nowadays who wont take the trouble to enjoy themselves i knew it wouldnt go on anybodys finger but yours said rick with joyous confidence to his goddess when the competition was over perhaps it wasnt quite fair because id seen aunt will try it on so often and her hands are tiny lady maud shook her head gravely im afraid it wasnt quite fair but you must make me the ring for all that of course ill make it she put her hand on his suddenly dont rick dont i meanshe paused looking at him curiouslyyou may make it if you like rick but i wont promise to wear italways vi we ought to have gone over today said eustace gordon looking out to where the low sandy line of eileanafaash lay like a golden clasp between the two headlands the northern one bold rocky heathery the southern a mere spit of bentcovered shingle curving hornlike from the great sweep of the grada sands beyond it was sunseta cloudless sunset sky and sea and sand bathed in a golden flood of light only the shallow stretches of water left behind by the retreating tide glowing iridescent here and there like jewels far away almost beyond sight an edge of foam keeping time to a whispering cadence told where the atlantic was hushing the shore to sleep yes he went on lazily we ought but we didnt that fellow weeks is always on the slay they were seated a party of fivefor the professor still lingered in the grip of coldon the base of the northern headland there amongst the rocks and heather lady maud and cynthia strong had been making tea for the shooters a brace of setters lay panting beside the gamebags a faint whiff of smoke from behind a boulder told that the ghillies were enjoying themselves on their masters tobaccosure sign of a good days sport gorgeous weather continued the same contented voice a whole week of it simply idyllic ever since mr wilson and the others left assented rick halmar pity they went isnt it mr wilson had to go put in lady maud the telegram from the works was urgent and then the collinghams yacht happening to come in the same day made it so convenient quite a coincidence one of those things no one could have foreseen she spoke impatiently almost in an aggrieved tone and eustace as he lay on his back staring up into the sky smiled to himself it is very curious how such things happen remarked cynthia strong but that they are comparatively common is indubitable the very proverbs in our language prove it in the professors absence she was apt to assume the mantle of his manner in order to annihilate poor captain weeks in which object she generally succeeded on this occasion however emboldened by a recent reception of some golden plovers wings for which her new tweed hat had been waiting he ventured to put in his oar the wish is father to the thought for instance nothing of the kind began miss strong scornfully but lady maud rose hastily and standing a little apart looked at eileanafaash her hand shading her eyes let us settle to go there tomorrow without fail she said as if to change the subject not tomorrow please broke in rick eagerly tomorrow is fast day and none of the ghillies will do a hands turn besides i have to drive aunt will to the preaching as uncle wont put it off till the next day lady maud to begin with its my birthday and then the tides are full spring so we could come back by the sea ford it is worth doing nearly two miles with quicksands on either side especially to the south very well the day after tomorrow that is friday certain or some other coincidence will be carrying off the rest of my party still with her hand shading her eyes she remained looking seawards much in the same attitude as she had stood at the window a month before this time her slight figure showed against the gold of sea and sky what is that she asked like a mastyonder and from the headland rick busy as usual with his knife did not pause to look it is a mast lady maud there is a wreck just to the south went ashore ever so long ago but it is useful still as a signpost up to that spar the sand is pretty safemost times beyond thatby george you should see it when the tide is coming in oh i dont mean the spar close inyonder far away he came and stood by her a yacht i think making i should say for carbost come to carry some of us away maybe if its for me remarked eustace joining them i dont intend to go this is too good a time to be cut short i havent had such a good one since those old days at lynmouth maud and you too why you are looking twice as well as you dida week ago there was meaning in his words more in his eyes fine weather always agrees with me she replied hastily come rick let us pick up the tea things and start home yet in her heart of hearts she knew that eustace was right that past week had been a paradise of relief and now it came perilously near to the time when the problem of her life must be faced she had driven round it so far had turned back deliberately when she found it barring the road had claimed time to understand the position what had she done towards a decision nothing nothing save bask in the immediate freedom rejoice like any child in the fine weather in ricks open adoration in her cousins constant companionship as she and the boy walked homewards together these thoughts came again and again whilst her nervous fingers busied themselves mechanically with the silver ring which he had made for her a growing habit of which she was not aware does it hurt you he asked tenderly i can easily alter it if it does she shook her head with a faint smile but i have seen you do that so often lately he persisted perhaps the inside is not quite smooth give it me please and i will set it right by friday dont trouble if it hurts i can always take it off cant i dear there was a sudden passion in her tone a kind of pitiful reproach in her eyes rick looked at her perturbed but if it hurts he began she put out her pretty hand and laid it on his almost with a protecting gesture nothing you could do would hurt me rick you said so the first time we met and it is true if it hurts it is my own fault that doesnt make any difference he replied stoutly let me have it please not todayon friday perhaps if it hurts they were standing where the crosspath branched to eval waiting for the others to come up for ricks way lay across the moor and she would be left alone i believe it does hurt now he said still dissatisfied and i know i could set it right do let me try how serious you are she cried with a sudden change of mood see i promise to give it back on friday if it hurts it shall be my birthday present there all right ill keep it for yours then we shall be quits he said laughing when he had left them eustace took his place and cynthia strong and captain weeks were certainly the happier for the change lady maud likewise to judge by her light laughter fast day rose brilliantly the clear crisp sunshine poured in through the diningroom windows when coming down to breakfast she found her cousin there alone another lovely day she said gaily the last for me he replied that was the yacht yesterday it has anchored below the sands and the captain has strict orders from louisa to bring me off dead or alive tonight he laughed but there was a bitter look on his face as he tossed a crumpled letter towards her catch thats my warrant of execution not a very nice letter but a reasonable one in its way the weather was to blame of course still she had asked him to join her many times and he had not joined her he had been a month and more at roederay and now the equinoctial gales were over she meant to be off southwards if he could not make use of the yacht he must send it round to cowes and make his own arrangements for her part she intended to start for the mediterranean in ten days not the sort of letter to be disregarded by a husband dependent on the writer for all save a very moderate settlement ive told them to have the boat ready at the grada point at five this afternoon to take me on board perhaps it is better so this sort of thing couldnt have gone on much longer she was silent and the professor bursting in ended the teteatete what a land or perhaps i should say sea of surprises this is to be sure he exclaimed the clansman i am informed by the factor whom i met on his way to preaching will anticipate her time by three whole days owing to this fast and some local market she takes carbost on the out instead of the in trip and is due tonight some time between seven and two in the morning so i am afraid my dear lady that my delightful visit must come to a somewhat abrupt conclusion i propose therefore going over to eval house suggested eustace noo to the hotel at dusk so as to be on the spot lady maud paled visibly and cynthia of course she and captain weeks will go too ah what a sudden breakup of our pleasant party you had better come with us dear lady and so reduce our regrets to a minimum cried the professor gallantly but the compliment fell flat that was the fate of most remarks during breakfast so that conversation dwindled to excerpts from bradshaws guide captain weeks who was generally a standby of placid good nature was peculiarly low he had made up his mind come what might to try his fate with cynthia strong before leaving and now though still determined he felt hustled she in her turn knew she had shillyshallied in a way unworthy of a girton girl until her opportunities of bringing the professor to book had dwindled to three days two of them to be spent at sea where she could not be sure of herself or him as for eustace and maud their role in the comedy of life had been touched with tragedy for some time past they felt dimly that the crisis had come we have never been to eileanafaash after all said cynthia pausing at the window on her way to pack and looking regretfully to where the island lay out in the blue sea i thought we shouldnt murmured lady maud in a low voice the island of rest is not for us it has been within reach all the time it is so still replied eustace in the same tone we might have gone this morning if it hadnt been fast day continued cynthia aggrieved couldnt we bribe somebody i want to go awfully and so does the professor my failure to do so will be the only regret which can possibly mingle with my memories of roederay cant think why you all want to see it remarked the captain frowning at the professors complimentary bows i went over one dayyes i did miss strongto shoot seals didnt get anyworse luck but it wasnt a bit pretty sand and bones and a stone coffin or two the ghillie told me too that sometimes after a north wind it was awfully grim the sand blows off dont you know and leaves skeletons and things not at all the place for ladies dont you know im sorry to be obliged to differ retorted cynthia sharply in my opinion there are no places where a woman should not be nihil continget quod non ornavit paraphrased the professor the captains head held itself very high perhaps i am wrong but i dont think so however as you wish to see it miss strong i shall be delighted to row you over in the small boat only we must start at slack tide that is about three in the afternoon too late im afraid replied the young lady disconsolately we ought to be starting for the hotel before six oughtnt we maud oh we could manage it he went on seeing in this plan the chance of the teteatete on which his mind was set if the wagonette were to pick us up at the crossroads we should have heaps of time it would only be starting two hours earlierbefore the others i mean what do you say professor asked cynthia sweetly arthur weeks ground his teeth and turned away with a murmur about the boat being heavy but the professor will row of course every one rows at oxford indeed i for one think the oxford style is the best in the world then perhaps you will not require my aid i only learnt off the coast of cornwall cynthia looked at her usually docile adorer in amaze she did not understand that the big man had for once thought it worth while to make up his mind but we couldnt go without you she pleaded quite meekly you see you have been there before ah no we couldnt go without you if i can be of any use said the captain magnificently and the sight of his aggrieved but courteous dignity gave cynthia quite a pang so it was arranged that about slack tide he and the professor should row to eileanafaash from the boathouse on the north headland and afterwards taking advantage of the full tide and southerly current slip down the coast across the sands to meet the wagonette eustace and maud proposed to start about the same time for eval house so that he might say goodbye to miss willina before joining the yachts boat at grada point whence the carriage on its return journey would take lady maud back to roederay a sombre silence had lain between these two all day and even when they were left alone on the terrace watching the others disappear shorewards they said nothing for a time a great stillness seemed to be in the very air not a breath on the water not a sound on the moor not a cloud on the sky the very house seemed asleep most of the servants away for edification or amusement at the preaching miles to the south amongst the peat bogs and heather singing psalms and eating peppermint drops praising the creator and flirting with the creature the silence must have reminded eustace of this fact for at last he turned to his companion hastily they wont be at eval so there is no use going come maud it is the last time we shall be together i suppose come it was not much to grant she thought when she might never see him again so they went out together over the moors down by the little pools where the water showed their shadows blended one into the other upon the cairns where they sate together looking out over the sea together always together eustace and she as it had been at the beginning and this was the end the very end meanwhile the trio in the boat set forth gaily the professor very straight in the back and with no little style giving the stroke whilst arthur weeks gloomily polite paddled in the bows debarred from even a fair sight of his beloved the full floodtide lapped at the furthermost scallop of seaweed on the shingly shore and touched the seapinks cresting the rocks couldnt you pull a leetle harder suggested the captain drily when the professor paused in a long sentence to take breath i dont want to hustle anybody but we have only just got time to manage it we are making a good deal of leeway and the channel north is a bit dangerous cynthia glanced nervously towards the pole oh yes please mr endorwick pull harder we can talk when we get to the island easier said than done the perspiration poured down the professors face and bow kept her head straight as a die yet still the boat failed to respond as they crept along slowly the channel between the headlands and the island began to open up showing the still oily water which tells of swift current we are too far north said the captain resting on his oar a moment the tide cant have been quite slack when we started however it doesnt matter for the current here will take us south in no time the professor pausing too they drifted idly thats the landingplace miss strong went on the speaker yonder where the bents almost touch the water and that square thing behind is a stone cof he paused abruptly why what the devil were drifting northdue north by george we are though in good sooth they weredrifting north like a feather north impossiblethe current runs south at flood stayby heaven i rememberronald said something about a change at the equinox quick man alive pull pull hard once she gets beyond those rocks we will have the dickens and all to keep her out of the eddy it runs like a racehigher upamongst sunkenrocks the last words came in jerks as he set all his strength to the oar the boat spun round with the point of the professors oar as axis spun round drifting as it span damn it all shouted the man of war busy on the rowlocks i beg your pardon miss strong here man quick give me the oargo forwardlie down in the bows and keep her keel stiff now then cynthia dont scream theres a good girltheres no danger as yet lie down toothen you wont see anything she did lie down ignominiously right down at his feet feeling that she would be content to enter paradise clinging to this mans coattails if only that entry was not premature the whole world to her lay in the strength of those arms and when meeting her piteous eyes his face relaxed to something like a smile and he gasped all rightgetting alongnicely she felt once and for all that she loved his little finger better than the whole of that abject figure in the bows so she crouched lost in a sort of terrified reliance on him till with a queer little sound half sob half laugh he slackened and without a pause proceeded to retransfer a pair of rowlocks to the bows now thenprofessorif you pleasesorry to havebeen so abruptbutone manages better scullingwhen theres no rudder the breaks were caused by his being out of breath otherwise he was full of dignity and cynthia strong broke down suddenly into subdued tears you had better lie still he said seeheres my coat he fumbled it into a pillow with his left hand as he went on rowing with his right raise your head please so and as he bent over her he whispered dont cry dear its all over now what cynthia strong did to the hand so near her lips is a dead secret between those two the captains fine flush was doubtless due to his previous exertions but why a pillow should have caused a rush of blood to cynthias terrorblanched face remains a mystery dont work so hard professor cried the former gaily you are pulling me round and we have to get our head towards home eileanafaash is out of the question besides miss strong will be all the better for a cup of tea this sort of thing isnt fit for women and nobody denied it vii a man and a woman looking seawards from grada point to the north the long curve of sands hidden by the floodtide a curve ending in the low line of eileanafaash which viewed from here seemed as if it were joined to the mainland beyond the northern headland whence roederay lodge stood out against the sky to the south a coast broken into little points and bays with the slender masts of a yacht standing above a near promontory to the west a spit of rocks running out into the atlantic which once more lay like a golden garment stretching far as the eye could reach on either hand at their feet a little boat swaying gently against a bare ledge of rock for the tide was at the full do come said the man you havent really seen the yacht and we cant possibly miss the returning wagonette ill send a man to watch if you like then there can be no mistake he did not look at her but his voice was instinct with passionate entreaty but the men may not be here till late lady maud did not look at him either yet the same repressed emotion rang in her tone i can row you we have only to paddle round those rocks and the current will take us right on to the yacht but the men lazy beggars let them swim besides they should have been here long ago it is past five halfpast they have been here and put the stores in the boat it is we who are late he moved a step closer impatiently what have the men to do with it maud dontdont be childish what are you afraid ofnot of me surely there was a pause i am afraid of nothing she said lightly come it will be pleasant out on that sunny sea at any rate he steadied the boat for her and she stepped in where to he asked half in jest when a stroke or two had taken them from the shadow of the rock into the glitter of the sinking sun where they lay bathed in light the water dripping from the lifted oars like drops of molten gold why shouldnt we leave everything behind and set sail for nowhereanywhere with his arms resting on the oars he leant forwards fixing his dark eyes on her face they were full of pity and a great tenderness you look so nice there maud take off your hat dear and let the sun shine on your hair as it used to do when you were a girl if i had my will maud you should always be in the sunlight you know that dont you the oars fell into the water softly as he rowed on whilst she sate silent trailing one hand in the water and watching the great big medusae come pulsating past how pleasant it must be to driftlike that she said half to herself and once again the drip drip drip of those golden tears filled up the silence as the boat swayed idly on the breathing of the sea why shouldnt we drift there is plenty of time and god knows ties enough as a rule grapnels fore and aft and a mud bank under all to stick upon dont talk of that now eustace she broke in hurriedly let us forget it for this last half hour isnt it enough to be heretogether enough for now he replied unsteadily but for afterwards there may be no afterwards he shook his head a man never thinks of that he cant live on moonshine or sunshine either he wants something real and so do you maud what will you do when you go back to him she put out her hand in entreaty with a little cry oh eustace can you not let me be happy for one short half hour happy when we are going to part happy when i know what your future will be when i know it will be torture to you why did you send him away if it was not because the strain was too great for you to bear ii did not send him away she faltered pshaw hooper told me about itthe fool was afraid then the wire came of course and there was no need for the other but you meant it maud ah my darling dont think i am blaming youblame how could i blame you save for too much patience maud let us cut the knot we have made a mistake both of us for you are miserable and ii will not bear it comethe yacht is there let us go into the sunshine come my darlingsee how fate points the way we are drifting driftinga little more and the current will take us why should you go back to the empty house the empty life maud maud what does a man say to a woman when he has forgotten everything in the world save his mad desire to keep her for his own all that could be said in all its tenderness its passion and its selfishness was hers as the boat drifted and drifted i am cold she said suddenly giving a little shudder yet drawing closer to him we shall be too late too late to return he answered joyously oh maud trust me this oncesee the yacht is close he turned and gave a quick exclamation of surprise where were they not as he expected within a stones throw of the coast drifting surely southwards here was nothing save sea and rising slowly from it on all sides a thin mist golden in the sunlight through which in the far distance a shadow or two loomed faint unrecognized above them the sky clear as ever below them the sea bright pellucid but between them a gathering curtain which even as he looked faded from gold to white from white to grey as the unseen sun sank beneath the unseen horizon it is a seahaugh he said lightly the wind must have changed to the north and the cold condenses the vapour i have seen them often after hot weather but it is all right we must be close to the yacht for we were well in the current when i stopped rowing and it runs inshore due south if i whistle they must hear and answer but none came and the sound seemed to return resonant from the mist showing that it had not travelled far so whistling shouting and rowing they spent some time in vain till fear began to invade her courage what if they had drifted past what if they were drifting out to sea further and further from safety he tried to scoff at her alarm though his own anxiety grew fast as the mist settled thicker and thicker till he could not see a yard beyond the bows suddenly with a grating shock the boat stopped abruptly almost throwing them into each others arms his heart seemed to stop also as he remembered having heard of sunken rocks in mid channel we are agroundstay still i will see he stepped cautiously over the side one foot into six inches of water and a shelving bottom the other into three then on to firm dry warm sand his laugh of relief was genuine the adventure is over maud come let me help you out this must be the mainland but where i cant say a difficult question indeed to decide with that grey mist curtain closing in and shutting out all save a patch or two of bent at their feet stay here a bit he continued and i will explore take the whistle i wont go beyond its reach or be away long the road must be close by it was not however and he returned after a time with a clouded face i dont understand it the sea seems to surround us except in one direction and that is all sand and bent i dont remember any such point below grada perhaps we are above it suggested his companion quite impossible the current runs south a sort of back eddy from the big stream that is what brings all the drift to grada sands the question however is what we are to do take to the boat again and punt along the shore till we find a landmark i should say best not to desert our ships but this again brought a disappointment and half an hours rowing punting and towing resulted in nothing by this time it was almost dark the mist gathered denser than ever and with the approach of night the north wind rose steadily the sooner we settle ourselves the better if we have to camp out and it looks like it said he at last still if we light a fire some one may see it anyhow there are stores and a sail in the boat so we shall manage cheer up maud imagine we are children again how often havent we pretended to be cast away on a desert island together and how happy we were true enough yet as she helped him to gather driftwood for the fire her thoughts were on the difference between those days and these and there was more to them in this mischance than there would have been to others what had she meant to do when she stepped into the boat she could not tell only this she knew that fate seemed to have decided for her if the fire brought some onewell and good if not why then eustace and she had gone adrift that question was settled forever she sate feeding the fire whilst he foraged for eatables in the boat and each stick seemed to her another doubt dispelled how they flamed and crackled and sparkled as driftwood does out of sheer joy in burning yet no one cameno one later on with the tenderness which was a fierce delight to her he found her what shelter he could on that bare waste of bent and shingle though it was only a nook backed on the windy side by a rough slab of rock half embedded in the sand still it was dry and warm and with the boats sail wrapped round her and her feet towards a freshly built fire she could lean back comfortably and defy some of the growing cold and rising wind she sate watching him silently as he sate by the fire turning every now and again to assure himself of her comfort or tuck the sail loosened by the wind round her more closely suddenly during one of these ministrations her eye caught the sparkle of dewdrops on his coat and she stretched out her delicate hand to touch his sleeve it was quite wet there is plenty of room for you here eustace she said quietly and the sail will cover us if we sit close together ii must not begin by being selfish then her calm gave way oh eustace eustace we must love each other very dearly or i shall die of shame something in the almost despairing surrender to fate roused the best part in his nature he drew her head on to his shoulder and kissed her gently goodnight dear go to sleep if you can ill watch the fire she gave a little shivering sob and clung to him all was settled now she had taken her life into her own hands the struggle was over and he was a haven of resta haven of rest her thoughts went no further than that for she was utterly wearied out but as he sate beside her his mind went far afield into the afterwards which he had claimed as his right and more than once as she stirred in the uneasy sleep into which she had fallen he bent over her again and kissed her she was his the past was at an end scruples must come later if they came at all he had foreseen this ending from the beginning perhaps he had tried to escape from it perhaps he had not this much was certainthe stars had fought for him and she was his the wind swept steadily round them but safe sheltered as she was he feared no harm and when the dawn came their troubles would all be overforever so sheltering her as morning approached he too fell into a doze and the fire deprived of fuel sank by degrees to a heap of smouldering ashes then the chill which comes before the day sought them out even in each others arms and brought to both a vague surprised consciousness of their surroundings where were they what had happened with eyes still full of sleep and dreams she saw the grey mist hanging round themthe ashes of the fire which had burnt so bravely last night last night great god how came she there eustace she cried starting up wildly one hand finding aid from the slab of rock behind her her pretty hair was damp with dew her face flushed where it had rested on his shoulder for answer he caught her to him and covered her face with passionate kisses he too was fresh from sleep and dreamsdreams of the hereafter and now the day had come and yonder where the mist showed lightest the sun was rising oh no no she panted struggling to escape maudhis tone was full of surprised reproach as he fell back a stepwhat is it what have i done what have i done she echoed swiftly i cant remember oh god whats that her voice rose to a shriek she clung to him convulsively with one hand while her eyes fixed themselves on the stone slab which had sheltered herand him the north wind had done work during the night and the embedded slab was clear now more than clear it formed part of a stone coffin whence the wind had driven the sand leaving the contents exposed to view only a few bones but backed by the drifted sand they still kept the semblance of a skeleton sitting staring out into the mist eustace gordon recoiledthe best of men would have done so much in such a situation then memory aided him it is eileanafaash maudeileanavaraiyou remember we must have drifted north somehow dont look so scared my darling it is only eileanafaashthe island of restthat is all she did not heed him her eyes full of an almost insane terror were fastened on the fleshless hand which lay so nearoh god in heavenso near her own as it clutched the side of the coffin the ring she whispered look lookthe ring my ring my ring yes on the dead as on the living hand he saw the ring with its legend beautiful constant chaste a chill came over even his passion yet he turned to her with sudden petulance well what thenyou know whence it must have come what it must have been from the beginning i suppose come let us leave these horrors let us leave the past and be sensible come maud she gave him one looka look he never forgotand with a cry of ricks ring ricks ring broke from him and disappeared into the mist maud maud dont be silly maud where are you going for gods sake maud come back the mistthe seaare you mad maud maud then he too was blotted out and the growing light of day found nothing human there save the bones of a woman who had been loved nothing but that and the ashes of a fire which had gone out maud maud the cry hit on the mist and came echoing back to him as following her faint footsteps he pursued her once looming through the fog he thought he saw her pausing as for breath but his passionate entreaty for her to wait for him his eager reminder that he was eustaceeustace her loverbrought no response did he imagine a faint cry as if she started off in renewed alarm or was it only some seabird hidden in the mist uttering its plaintive note he brought himself up suddenly with a gasp of horrid fears as his feet gave way beneath himdeeper deeper no that was right firm ground once more but where was he where were those faint footmarks leading him maud come back it is not safe still he went on not safe indeed he floundered desperately for a moment and then stood with laboured breath and a dew of deadly fear on his face looking round him the sun rising steadily had by this time turned the mist into a golden haze through which he could see that a few seaweedhung boulders had been gathered to a heap whence sprang a crossshaped post it must be a fordthe sea ford to eileanafaash that way then lay safety for a few hours but which way had she gone he stooped to see with fear for her and for himself fighting with his love then he stood up pale as death maud come back maud i will not hurt you surely surely there was an answering cry the relief seemed to blind him deafen him here here where are you it is i the next instant rick halmar was beside him fiercely imperative where is she where is she eustace gordon looked at the eager boyish face stupidly and faltered she was afraidshe ran away i dont know why call her she might come to you call her those bright blue eyes seemed to pierce him through and through before they sought the ground there was not much to be seen only the print of a womans foot in the sand a foot going south due south coward the word rang out clear from the golden mist like a voice from heaven and eustace gordon was left standing alone beside the cross pointing towards safety rick halmar had gone south due south viii then a new cry beat itself upon the curtain of mist lady maud lady maud it is irick rick halmar and the boys voice reached further than the mans as moment by moment the seahaugh lightened softened rose until it seemed no more than a golden halo round the climbing sun it is irick rick halmar his hands clenched tighter and tighter as he ran to eustace the danger had been uncertain unreal but rick knew every inch of the ground and knew that each step left hope further behind already his accustomed ear had caught the curious whispering hush with which the land gives way before the sea and he knew what that meant on grada sands firm foothold for a second and then a shivering and murmuring sliding gulf oh horrible most horrible to think of her lady maud it is irick only rick the thought came to him suddenly that it was his birthday she had promised to give him something ah fate could not be so cruel on his birthday of all days in the year foolish irrational thought which somehow brought him comfort as his keen eyes sought a sign and found nothing but those shining footsteps whence the water filtered even as he sped past them thank heaven for so much since it showed that the tide was still far off that as yet there was time lighter and lighter too soon he might be able to see her ghostlike through the mist or at least judge the distance of that creeping line of foam which still unseen and still he hoped fiercely far far off yet seemed to occupy his every thought to fill his memory tortuous like a snake with the snakes low hiss as it curled along the quivering sand suddenly his heart stood still for there out of the golden mist grew the tall black spar of the old wreck with its message of warning pretty safe so far most times beyond that the recollection of his own careless words prompted another cry my ladymy dearest lady it is i rickonly rick what was that on the sandblotting the yellow sand just below the spar a stone seaweed nothat was a womans dress she was there face downwards on the sand fallen insensible perhapsbut saved thank god saved he stumbled in his mad haste to reach her was it a stumble or had his foot broken through the firmer crust again this time both feet could he have come so far so close only to fail impossible then beneath him he felt a tremor the first slight tremor heralding the dissolution of dry land with the sudden resolve which in time of danger separates one man from his fellow decisively absolutely to the utter annihilation of all cant about equality he put all his strength into one bold leap forward the next instant he was clinging to the spar like a monkey or a sailor the tremor passed the sand settled once more with a low gurgling murmur proclaiming the back draw of the wave still hidden by the haze cautiously he tried one foot beyond the single plank between him and destruction hopeless even if he stood still and to reach her he must take a step or two again the tremor camethe shifting sliding sparkle of the sandgrains as they partedand the figure lying with its face hidden resting on the right arm sank a little only a very little yet still it sank he had come prepared for danger with a rope wound about his waist and almost with his first foothold on the wreck his hands had been busy with the coil even while his thoughts and eyes were elsewhere a bight here a bend there and it was fast as sailors lore could make it to the spars and to his body no not there for it had to be doubled to bear the strain and he could not afford to lose an inch so tight over one shoulder with a treble twist round his outstretched arm that would not give way unless it tore the arm from its socket and then the rope being high up on the spar would give him greater purchase when the time came for strength how long these thoughts these actions seemed to take yet he could not spare one of them even though with a soft swishing rush the hidden enemy made another sally this time lingering half a moment round that figure on the sand as if to gain a firmer hold upon it perhaps but not so firm as his would be now he was ready with a swing backwards and forwards to gain additional impetus the rope coiled loosely so as not to drag he leapt clear of the wreck towards her an instants doubt and he had her by the hand the left hand which lay stretched on the sand as she had fallen how cold it was could she be dead but the horror of the thought was forgotten in fight for now with the same chuckling sound as if the devils below were laughing at him came the back draw not an inch not a quarter to be yielded come what might the rope despite his bitter clench upon its strands cut deep into his arm it seemed as if a redhot iron pierced his shoulder as the sinews strained to their uttermost ah that was a relief but her weight was heavier surely and that meant less stable support hanging as he was by one armthe other outstretched to keep his hold on herhe could see nothing save the unsteady sand closing round him he seemed to feel nothing save the little cold hand in his it was now or never grasping the rope as high as he could reach he put out his whole strength hoping to move her but an inch nearer to him hopeless and the back draw coming on him unawares found him as it were on the rack and seized its opportunity he set his teeth and endured how he never knew but when the agony passed a dew like that of death was on his face and he hung nerveless helpless save for the desperate resolve to keep his holdto keep her hand in his the wave again little bubbles this time as if some one was drowning close by ah if he could only see her even though it was to see her gripped in that pulsating horror maud it is ionly rick the cry came from him as he hung on the rack once more perhaps if he could keep his hold the coming tide would slacken that gripit mightit must how far had she sunkalready had the golden head disappeared was there nothing left save the little cold hand where he could feel the ringhis ringslipping under his clasp ah there was the wave againsurging in his ears whispering whispering whispering surely of some faroff country of a great rest and peace and forgetfulness rick halmar hung limp upon the rope nature had stepped in her patience was exhausted she would have no more heroism no more delay those two hands had held each other long enough the time had come for them to part quietly peacefully not in a moment but gradually as if even in unconsciousness the spirit strove against the flesh those slender fingers slipped through the strong ones slipped and slipped till with a little jerk ricks hand closed upon itself and fell back inert while the other still stretched in mute appeal sank slowly into the sand the sun having escaped from its halo saw the deed done and smiled down upon the sight cheerfully only a boy with a birthday present in his hand only one more woman loved and lost what was that to weep over a wheeling gull sweeping by on broad white wings suggested sympathy but in reality it came to see if the deed portended food for its young ones there were no other spectators had there been they would have been so occupied by vain attempts to aid that the essence of it all would have escaped them such things are better told than witnessed so thought miss willina when three weeks afterwards rick with his left arm still in a sling tried to make her understand it was not his fault he wore the silver ring on his right hand they had found it there tight clasped when set on the track by eustace gordon they came in a boat to the rescue just too late to do more than release rick from a torture none the less painful afterwards because it was unfelt at the time perhaps with her older eyes miss willina saw further into the blame than he did but she said nothing so rick kept the ring with its legend beautiful constant chaste as his birthday present he did not even give it to his wife it belonged he said to the most perfect woman he had ever seen and when people suggested the propriety of this being a euphonism for the one he had chosen as his lifecompanion he shook his head with a smile nevertheless miss willina was not silent of blame she poured vials of it on her own head for having neglected a clear duty if she had only insisted on the other devil being burnt as well this terrible thing might not have come to pass anyhow she would go over to the deserted lodge without delay and destroy the wicked idol lest it should do more harm let me come too said rick in a low voice this time miss willina did not meet his request with the query was she so pretty as all that dear indeed the memory of those words choked her so rick went for the first time into the little sanctum where lady maud had stood adrift at the window the image was still on the mantelpiece and he started at the sight of it aunt will he cried in quick halfalarmed tones i never made thatit is not my work it was not the professor had been right for once when he called it a genuine savage conception of fate brought thither by the gulf stream rick took it up in his hands and looked at it curiously i wonder he said half to himself if things would have been different then with a sort of appeal he turned to miss willina aunt willyou dont really believeall that rubbishdo you her answer was decisive she took the image from him and marched off with it to kirstys peat fire so that was an end of the tragic comedy of roederay when rick set off to sail the seas all the actors in it had disappeared save miss willina in the windblown noahs ark at eval will lockhart came back the next summer and painted a picture of eileanafaash with a golden seahaugh hanging over drifted sand and the skeleton of a hand showing from a stone coffin it was gruesome and morbid so it was much admired by the gulf stream of society in the royal academy miss willina however still refused to find entertainment in a magic lantern the past was sacred she said and no good ever came in disbelieving in it besides what would become of her animals he came again the next summer bringing with him a tale about the flusteration midst the bastes of all creation which followed on the introduction of the spirit of fell denial into the ark whereat they both laughed and that year he sent a picture to the royal academy which a few critics admired but then it was only the portrait of a middleaged woman with a sick gosling on her lap and half a dozen zoological specimens grouped around her yet you could almost feel the northwest wind which was ruffling the coils of hair and smell the fresh salt wholesome breeze which had swept the sand from those dead fingers at eileanafaash it was the other side of the picture but it did not suit the public taste so well chacun a son gout
