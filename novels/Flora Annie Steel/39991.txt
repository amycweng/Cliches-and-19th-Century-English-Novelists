you dont i dont though ive been here two years and whats more i dont want to retorted a rather undersized englishman whose white drill suit made him look like a stem to the huge mushroom of a pith hat which he wore despite this protection his face was brown exceedingly and faintly wrinkled through sheer exposure to sunbright sundried air the fact enhanced the monkey type of his features and made his clear lightblue eyesso set that they were shadowless below and cavernous abovelook quite aggressively cool inquisitive intelligent so long as we dont understand them he went on and they dont understand us we jog along the same path amicably likewell like the pilgrims to the cradle of the gods and the telegraphposts to the adjutant generals office up the road yonderand ill trouble you to cram more space than that between two earthly poles no it is when we begin to have glimmerings that the deuce and all comes in he paused in the molten gold of sunlight which made the yellow sand the corncoloured tussocks of tigergrass still yellower and still more corncoloured to glance round as if measuring the distance between the long low line of mud enclosure they had left but a few hundred yards behindyet which already was losing itself in an illimitable sand stretch beyondand a bigger tuft in the sand stretch ahead a tuft of spearpoints and horses bayonets and men waiting beside the first faint semblance of a reedpaved road then he took out his watch apparently he found leisure at his disposal for he walked on theres a nursery rhyme they taught me he continued when my moral nature was at the mercy of any fool who chose to take an interest in itbut if poor pussy understood shed be indeed a naughty creature it didnt run so consecutively of course in fact creature rhymed to teach herbut i learnt it that way children do that sort of thing a sight deal oftener than their elders think the younger of the two men in uniform with whom he was walking laughedthe honest elated conscious laugh of one who has not many good stories about himself and happens on an opportunity for telling one of them i used to say six days shalt thy neighbour do all that thou hast to do and the seventh day shalt thou do no manner shut up lance interrupted his elder companion with a laugh it is a ripping excuse for your intolerable laziness but i dont believe fact i assure you protested lance carlyon aggrievedly and considering i really thought that was the proper version for ten years of my life i dr george dillon took off his mushroom hat suddenly and wiped his forehead as if to smooth away the wrinkles which his smiles had brought to it lordy its a queer world he put in there is really no good in understanding most things as for this place great scott what would happen if my fifteen hundred scoundrels whom you saw digging like babes in the open just now were to understand that ione englishman in chargehad virtually no force majeure dont insult us dillon remonstrated captain vincent dering a certain swagger underlying his jest eshwara is a garrison town remember now im commandant and carlyons staff he had in fact ridden that morning as far as dr dillons house in charge of a troop of native cavalry and some sikh pioneers who had gone on under a native officer to take up their temporary quarters in the halfruined fort just beyond the old town of eshwara and now having thus secured their breakfasts he and his lieutenant were on their way towards the horses and escort they had bidden await them at the boat bridge which lay between them and their destination for george dillon was in control of a large industrial gaol whose inmates had for months been digging the head works of a canal which was to take off just below the town on the farther side of the river are you replied the doctor with a look of pity then i hope youll both forget the fact weve got on all right without you hitherto so if youll stick to marking out the viceroys camp and generally preparing the way of the lordsahib ill be obliged to you by the way is he coming to open the canal on the th really so they say that is if you are ready for the show by then i believe he could put it off till the th or th dashwood said something to that effect then dashwoods an ass the th is bad enough the place will be filling up even then filling up how pilgrims but on the th and th by george you should see them the assyrians came down like a wolf on the fold is nothing to it only these are the hosts of the lord i suppose and so dashwood suggested the th or ththe vaisakh festival did he well he is an ass but thats always the way we try to understand feelings instead of trying to know facts however we shall be ready for the opening never fear smith expects his c s i over it he says and thats enough guarantee you know smith dont you dering walsall smithi think his wife said she knew you yes he interrupted with rather unnecessary decision mrs walsall smith is a great friend of mine a very great friend jolly for you having friends in eshwara assented lance in uneasy haste i suppose they are about the only people here eh doctor he went on changing the subject but the latters clear eyes and brain were occupied for a moment in taking stock of captain derings singular if a trifle voyant personal attractions one of the most noticeable of which was the perfect curve of his throat and cheek i beg your pardonpeople did you say asked dr dillon after the pause plenty of people if you count padresthe place swarms with missions you know but if you mean polo he shook his head lance carlyons honest young face clouded then grew cheerful again well there must be a lot of black partridge and i expect theres fish in the river besides its an awfully picturesque placeby jove it is dering isnt it they had reached the tuft of spearpoints and horses men and bayonets and before them lay eshwara sunsaturate shadowless in the april noon so seen across the still lagoon of water formed by the junction of the two streams the hara and the hari which edged the lowlying triangular spit from which its fortified templeset walls rose eshwara seemed at the very foot of the blue barrier of hill behind it whose serrated edge paler than the blue sky above it claimed threequarters of all things visible for this world that indeed was the noticeable point in the picture presented to the eye as a rule heaven claims the larger half of all perspectives here the three elements earth air water lay across the view in three broad bands of blue curiously similar in tint for the sky was pale with excess of light the hills with excess of heat and the water paler than either by reason of a white silt which it brought with it from the snows a white silt which a recent flood had left in a fine film upon the sand stretches that showed here and there in the broad basin it is a gypsum detritus explained the doctorfrom the cradle of the godsthe cave you know where the rivers rise the pilgrims go in fact for this very stuff find it in the ice crannies call it the clay of immortality smear themselves with it and then die happy in hundreds of pneumonia those are the facts i dont profess to understand them and as i told you i dont want to its dangerous as that cracked old jesuit father narayan admitted with that unfathomable smile of his when all the other parsons were at me for refusing to allow them access to a postulate or a catechumen or someone of that sort who was sent to my jail the church has always admitted the value of invincible ignorance father narayan interrupted lance carlyon eagerly i suppose thats the father ninian bruce who has lived here fifty years and has a sort of begum in tow a descendant of general bonaventuras who was the nawabs favourite i want to see that old chap he must be a character my grandmother old lady carewe used to tell me about him long yarns though she hadnt met him since she was in her teens in a convent at rome and he was father confessor i supposeshes a holy roman you know and was a desperate flirt too so am i said vincent dering quickly i mean a catholicat least my people are so i can tell you one thing dillon father ninian isnt a jesuit i was talking about him at the club when i knew i was coming here and father delamere was indignant at the ideasaid he was a disgrace to his cloth george dillons dry face grew dryer did he indeed i quite agree that he is but i didnt think delamere would have admitted the fact himself as for pidar narayan as the natives call him hehe here the dry face melted bless the man he continued and the dry voice grew soft he thinks he knows more about doctoring than i do and the worst of it is here a perfectly charming smile took possession of every wrinklehe does in a way for the natives believe in him and the saffron bag is the best of all remedies you see when he was younger he used often to go with the pilgrims and try to pull some of the poor devils out of the fireor rather out of the snowfor the cradle of the gods lies yonder he pointed to where faint and far a peak showed paler than the rest why dont they smear themselves here asked lance stolidly why because they dont besides there isnt much to come and go upon for a robe of righteousness here look the breeze is blowing it away already in truth the sun which with the other three elements of earth and air and water give us in all religions the whole spiritual life of manthe world of his probation the heaven of his hopes the means of his purification and the fire of his retributionhad scorched the fine film to dust and the wind blowing where it listed was sweeping it away leaving the sand stretches unregenerate as ever an extra touch of pipeclay laughed vincent dering dusting his knee as he settled himself in his saddle well goodby old chap i shall see you again soon for i shall be coming over to the smiths pretty often and i suppose your regiment of ruffians leaves you off duty sometimes carlyon make dillon an honourary member of the headquarters mess george dillon leaning with his hands in his pockets against the rail of the first pontoon watching the little cavalcade start nodded thanks im over pretty often at the palace pidar narayan plays the fiddle and the begumas you call hermiss laila bonaventura has a voice besides babyloni mean eshwaraamuses me why babylon asked captain dering stooping to straighten his stirrup the doctor laughed as his lounge changed to a start homeward means the same thing eshdwarraor in another tongue babylonis the gate of god though babylon stands for something else nowadays doesnt it thats why i say its never any use to find out the meanings of things they change so stick to facts they dont well tata ill see you tomorrow most likely at the palace they have a sort of concertpracticeafternoon on wednesdayssome of the mission ladies sing jollily in partsand the old man is sure to ask you he sets great store on his wards position besides i told him you were a nailer at the piano vincent dering made a wry face the deuce you did my dear fellow i couldnt play hymn tunes to save my life i shall refuse pity replied dr dillon over his shoulder as he swung off in strides which emphasized the undue shortness of his trousers for i heard mrs smith say they wanted a good accompanist she sings altorather well oh does she said captain dering in a different tone as they set their faces different ways there was a smile on both but the doctors was scarcely a pleasant one it would in fact have been wholly sardonic but for the touch of impatient weariness it brought with it so through the sunbright sundried air while george dillon walked back to his fifteen hundred malefactors the little trail of spearpoints and bayonets men and horses drifted at a footpace across the frail bridge towards the town drifted unsteadily the yielding boats swaying the wooden girders giving and groaning over their burden seen so with but a plank between it and the milky water creased by the faint current there was something unreal in the gay troop of colour and glitter making its way to the quaint storeyed town ablaze in the sunlight which turned each golden templespike to a star a cool breeze fluttered the lancepennants and brought that faint film of white to horse and man warm flesh and cold steel and far away on that pale peak a little white cloud had rested hiding the cradle of the gods there must be fish here remarked lance dogmatically ill get out my rods tomorrow and try for a mahseer and the earnestness of his face as he lifted his eyes skyward to watch a couple of cormorants would have suited a knighterrant of old on the quest of the holy grail it wont be half bad i expectfor a time at anyrate assented vincent dering still with that content upon his face we will get up some fun while the camp is here of course and after that he paused and the content became greaterwell manage for the month or so we have to stop at least i shall his voice was soft he might have been another knighterrant of old riding across to the enchanted castle of his beloved i beg pardon sir said a voice behind him a voice with a strong native accent yet with a curiously english phrasing in it but by dismounting here you will reach the fort in a few minutes on foot the road is longer captain dering turned as if surprised to the speaker a native officer who sat his horse at the salute then smiled and with a clatter of accoutrements slipped to the ground come along carlyon i was forgetting that roshan khan is up to the ropes here you belong to eshwara dont you risaldar sahib the man to whom he spoke had slipped from his saddle also and stood smart as uniform could make him still as discipline could hold him he was a goodlooking young mahomedan of about thirty curiously english in his movements curiously native in his exaggeration of martial airs huzoor he assented we are connected with the late nawabs house he spoke with absolute indifference but captain dering as they left the bazaar which led from the bridge for a short flight of steps and a narrow alley cleaving its way through crowded shouldering houses remarked aside i believe that means he is about the nearest relation left the colonel i know wasnt sure about the wisdom of his coming here but then the colonel is that sort so i insisted one wants somebody who can tell you things in a new place whats that in there roshan they had come to a long high wall with trees showing above it which stretched away on their right hand for two or three hundred yards until it ended in an arched tunnel through a massive block of buildings at right angles to it the palace garden sir and that is the palace there is no entrance this side the womens apartments i suppose huzoor assented roshan khan once more the miss sahib lives there now and the padre has his chapel there too the river runs along the side and it is pleasant pleasant and cool echoed lance as the shadow of the tunnel closed in on them id no idea it was so hot outside by jove what a quaint place they were emerging on a wide square courtyard of which the palace formed one side the fort another a flight of steps leading down to the river a third while the fourth was apparently a wing of the palace all three walls were absolutely blank save for a low door at each of the four corners and these were so to speak connected with each other by pathways raised two steps above the rest of the courtyard a similar footpath crossed it in the middle and so completed the resemblance to a unionjack for the pathways were of white marble and red agra stone the courtyard of purpleblue brick these paths met in a round platform in the centre where on a stone carriage stood an old cannon thats a big gun said vincent dering when with a quickened clink of his spurred steps he had reached it so laying his hand lightly on the cylinder he vaulted to it as on to a horse and stooped to read an inscription on the riveted band about the breech sanskrit he saidthat stumps me its so confounded straight ah here it is in persian toothats better there was a faint clash of steel on stone for as he read the motto aloud roshans hand stiffening on his swordhilt made ground and scabbard meet captain dering slipped to his feet again with a laugh teacher of religion and instructor of souls thats about a correct translation isnt it risaldar sahib well id back a maxim against old blunderbore as a missionary agent nowadays hullo they worship it still do they he pointed to a faded chaplet of marigolds around the muzzle and a red hand printed on the marble below the mahomedans face took on the expression of his race and creed all unconsciously too he reverted to his own language the idolators do that when they come to bathe and they give alms to the saint when he is inside inside echoed captain dering what inside the gun here lance who had promptly peered down the muzzle came up from it excitedly asserting that the saint was there now he could see the brutes fuzzy head half way down so he must have crawled in feet foremostone of those naked brutes who smeared themselves with ashes to judge by his chignon make a ripping mop laughed vincent dering after glancing down in his turn clean the gun nicelythen the insouciance of his face disappeared its curves hardenedand by god ill make him im not going to have my guns worshipped eh roshan huzoor assented the mahomedan once more this time joyfully asa decorous two paces behindhis spurs jingled in harmony with his captains across the raised unionjack towards the riverend of the courtyard where in a projecting bastion right upon the bathing steps the low arched door stood which gave access to the fort in order to reach it they had to pass the solitary visible occupant of the wide sunlit courtyard this was a manof what rank education occupation none could tellwho having raised a square of twoinchhigh mud wall between his twiceborn purity and the world was preparing his daily food naked save for his waistcloth and the thread of the twiceborn over his left shoulder he was isolated even from his kindred alone with himself and his god before him in the mudplastered square as he sat immovable was the mud fireplace on which his wheaten doughcake was cooking beside him was a leafplatter of curds a brass vessel of milk a sight to be seen a hundred times a day in india one which should never be forgotten the noon was almost shadowless yet even so as he led the way captain dering from sheer habit swerved to step further from the sacred square doing so his foot slipped an instant on the lower step he gave an impatient exclamation and passed on a minute later the door of the fort clanged behind the little party cutting short an english laugh then not till then the man in that square of purity showed signs of life he rose quietly almost unconcernedly took the halfbaked cake from the embers the leafplatter of curds the vessel of milk and going down to the rivers edge flung his dinner into it to feed the fishes in that stumble the plumelike fringe of vincent derings high peaked turban had sent a shadow to overtop the twoinch barrier between one man and his fellows chapter ii he shall feed his flock like a shepherd the garden of the old palace at eshwara had been rightly described by roshan khan as a pleasant place longer than it was broad its shady walks and orange groves clung to the river raised above it by a balconied wall against which the current ran dimpling on two of the remaining sides a twentyfeet high barrier of sheer masonry buttressed and bastioned blocked out all curious eyes on the third separating it from the courtyard where the big gun stood rose the palace seen thus intimately from within the latter had changed its character no longer severe stern giving a blank stare at the world from the narrow slits of infrequent windows it had grown fanciful almost fantastic full of canopied turrets and inconsequent little latticed retreats at least in the two upper storeys for the lower one was more solid its chief feature being a wide aisled passage leading right through it to a door which gave on the courtyard being exactly opposite the one in the corner of the fort bastion on the other side this door opened as the latter did on one of the slantwise limbs of the quaint unionjack of raised paths which centred in the cannon it was not necessary however to go round by this in crossing from one door to the other as by keeping to the river steps you could do so on the same level in old times the guardians of the frail beauties for whose delectation the garden had been made had lived in the cryptlike vaulted rooms which opened out from this aisled passage so keeping the gate against illegal wanderings since the only other exit from the garden save by boat was through the second storey of the womens apartments and as this was by a door leading directly into the royal rooms which were on the other side of the tunnel that gave access to the courtyard and also divided the palace into two portionsmale and female the butterfly prisoners had had no chance of fluttering to strange honey in those days therefore the door had always been bolted and barred it stood wide open however showing a vista of green at the farther end of the passage when captain dering and lance carlyon came over to it in reply to the intimation that miss laila bonaventura was at home for music on wednesday afternoons which had been brought to the fort overnight by an old pantaloon a very old pantaloon with a wizened face a few sparse hairsdyed flaming redstanding at right angles to his cheeks and a marvellous livery consisting for the most part of yards upon yards of tarnished tinsel cloth twisted and twined about head and waist like saturns rings the oldest of old pantaloons with a back curved by a lifetime of obeisances a toothless mouth still full of sonorous titles and a wicked old eye watchful for the least want of the master be it good or evil a pantaloon with heaven knows what history of unutterable things hidden in his old brain such as is to be seen even in these days lingering round the ruins of a native court a figure despicable enough yet real so in a way pathetic by reason of its absolute lack of real interest in things as they are and now as the two englishmen pausedpartly because the swift change from the glare without to the gloom within was startlingthis same pantaloon with a white muslin robe superadded to the livery as a badge of his dignity as doorkeeper precipitated himself upon them from the shadows with ancient skips of alacrity and looplike salaams then with crablike sidlings led the way the young men following i must have that old chap on paper before i leave said vincent dering hes too good to be lost so their steps echoing cheerfully with their laughter they went on until towards the middle of the passage the aisle to their left widened and through a maze of pillars and arches a glimpse or two of air and sunlight showed sharply lance took a curious step towards them opens on to the river i expect jolly cool it must be in the hot weather by jove those old sinners knew how to be comfortable hullohe paused in a sort of horrori say dering i believe its a chapel yes it is he took off his cap instinctively and moved another step forward to see better but captain dering called impatiently oh come along do carlyon i didnt promise to go to church hymns are bad enough in all conscience lance however stood rooted to the spot cap in hand hush he said in a low voice i believe they are having service as he spoke a robed figure showed between the arches against the sunlight beyond them showed with something in its lifted hands then passed to some unseen altar oh come along do theres a good chap and lets get out of the way repeated captain dering sharply its father narayan i supposehes as mad as a hatter and boshes the whole businessat least so delamere said i told you we were a bit early but you would start still its too bad of the old man to have his chapel in the front hall come along and let us wait in the gardenit looks an awfully jolly oneawfully he paused perhaps at the change this time from gloom to glare perhaps at the sudden sense of anticipation the sudden quickening of the pulse of life which made him draw a long breath involuntarily it was not unfamiliar to him that sudden stir of vitality of expectation and with a curious smile on his face he crossed to the edge of the marble plinth on which the passage opened and leaning over the balustrade looked down to a terrace below and so on to the garden itself a perfect wilderness of common flowers sown broadcast lay at his feet hemming in a shallow marble tank which was nearly covered with the dewy leafcups of the lotus and set round with mosaic arabesques from this tank two aqueducts led to the edge of the terrace and ended in steep slopes of fretted marble where cascades had once wimpled and dimpled down to the watermaze which lay belowa shiny lake cobwebbed over by narrow marble paths just wide enough for the bare flying feet of a laughing girl beyond was scented shade with glints of watercourses gleaming here and there while here and there came a peep of a latticed balcony overhanging the river a balcony just large enough for a laughing girl and her lover yet there was not even a butterfly to be seen hovering over the flowers all was still all was silent until vincent derings careless laugh echoed through the stillness the silence cant you imagine itall lit upthey used to put coloured lamps behind the cascades im told and play catch who can up and down and all around the place on the whole i expect they enjoyed themselvesbetter than the typewriting girls of today do for instance got beastly sick of enjoying themselves before they had done with it i expect replied lance succinctly especially if there was always such a confounded strong smell of orange blossoms bah id prefer a polecat but he gave a distasteful glance at his companion i believe you like strong scents why not laughed vincent dering drawing out a handkerchief deluged with whiterose and sniffing at it its a harmless taste here his jest passed to earnest and his eyes took a half soft half cynical expressionsos the other in a way it isnt altogether despicable to let yourself loose in paradise without an arriere pensee of flaming swords especially if you can give pleasure to someone else thereby one could act romeo and juliet nicely in this garden and have your choice of balconies too he continued returning to jest even if the young woman he glanced back as if to verify his remark from the facade of the palace but what he saw behind him brought a sudden straightening of his lounge and rather an elaborate doffing of his sailor hat for he was always a trifle ornate in his courtesy towards women and the girl who stood within a pace or two of him was distinctly attractive ifeven at the first glancea little too breadandbuttery for his taste too young too clumsy as to waist too massive in the contours of face and figure for captain vincent derings taste had remained constant for the last three years to a different type of beauty a type which for the first time in his life had made him sentimental romantic more or less unselfish still the girl was handsome even in that babyish frock of starched white muslin girt about with a yellow silk sash the dress he told himselffor he was a connoisseur in chiffons and had a pretty turn for painting in additionwould have been better soft and creamy but thank heaven the sash was not blue like the marker of the missal she carried in her hand it might have been for it was impossible to fathom the lack of all sense of fitness in some women yet the result would have been to take all the ivory tints from this girls complexion and leave it jaundiced and the ivory was charming i am miss bonaventura she began in a set way which convinced captain dering that she had been sent to say those very words and none other my guardian father ninian bruce will be here directly wont you come upstairs to the drawingroom i am sorry we did not know it was so late it is our fault we are disgracefully early put in captain dering i told carlyon then he paused feeling curiously at a loss before the girls look of stolid gravity perhaps your watch is too fast she suggested and then my guardian likes to go by the sun he says it never needs winding up but i think it is inconvenient when everybody else has a watch it is always better to do as other people do her voice was very sweet and full but a countrybred accent spoilt its beauty and brought a grimace to captain derings face as he and his companion dutifully followed the speaker up one of the curved flights of steps which led from the plinth to a wide loggia on the second storey like the room seen through its arches this was lavishly decorated with fragments of lookingglass fashioned into flowing designs with gilt stucco the afternoon sun at this height shining full into the loggia made it a veritable star chamber what a charming place went on captain dering in his best manner doesnt it remind you of the arabian nights carlyon a sudden vague surprise and interest came to the girls face lightening it infinitely have you read the alif laila she asked my moonshi brought iti have to learn urdu you know because my guardian thinks i ought to be able to speak to the people as he doesand i wanted to read it because it is my name you seelailait means night i believebut my guardian did not wish it he gave me the mirror of virtue instead it is a very very long her almost childish garrulity ceased in a faint flush over the ivory of her face and she reverted to her lesson and her indifferencethe other people will be here directly but they will come from the city across the tunnel and go straight into the drawingroom would you like to come in there or stay here oh stay here please said vincent desperately the young woman was getting on his nerves then perhaps you would like to try the piano persisted miss bonaventura my guardian has it brought out here on wednesday afternoons because it sounds well among the arches will you try it her handit was ivory also vincent observed and had long filbertshaped nailsheld the cover of the keyboard open stolidly and lance carlyon feeling a bit desperate also said appealingly do dering he is a nailer at the piano i assure you miss bonaventura and he sings too so my guardian she began when vincents patience gave way and with a perfect devil of exasperation roused in him he sat down on the musicstool and with a crash burst into a naughty little love song he had picked up at brindisi on the way out he did it simply to soothe himself so to do him justice he nearly fell off the musicstool in horror when at the refrain of the second verse a very full round mezzosoprano joined in it with a verve and abandon far exceeding his own he scarcely knew whether to apologize or go on but miss bonaventura apparently had no doubts she finished with a gay little staccato note which would have made her fortune at a music hall and then turned to the accompanist with a smile which showed an absolutely flawless set of teeth what funny words but i like them and the tune too what is it called i should like to get it and sing it to my guardian vincent who had begun a stammering regret that he had not remembered her nationality altered his phrase with a sense of relief to you know italian very well i suppose miss bonaventura she returned to her indifference immediately my guardian and i speak it he loves italy and the italians he knew my grandmother there she was a princess but he never speaks of her so i dont know very much about it only mother at the convent said that my guardian she was off gaily on the childishly confidential tack again when the sight of someone coming up the stairs made her veer towards dignity once more there is my guardian she said he is very sorry to have kept you waiting evidently this was the last bit of her lesson for she closed the piano with great decision the figure which came slowly towards them was that of a very old man yet one older by many years than his looks for he was still straight save for a slight stoop in the neck but this by the backward poise of the head thus made necessary to enable his brown eyes to meet all things after their habit squarely if softly gave him an air of alertness he was dressed in an ordinary black soutane but wore a fine white embroidered muslin skullcap such as natives wear instead of a black one his grey hair showed still luxuriant beneath it and the wide sash of faded lilac silk with tasselled ends which was tied in a bow about his waist set off his still slim and still graceful figure i hope my little girl has been doing the honours properly he began pausing a pace or two from the young men and not offering to shake hands but his voice was a welcome in itself and had that nameless cachet of absolute good breeding which makes offence impossible there was a slight hesitancy in it too now and again which was overcome by a look that took the listener into its confidence and appealed for friendly forbearancebut she is only just back from school at calcutta and the good nuns did not see much company did they laila then in an undertone of solicitude he added in italian didst tell them cara miadidst remember it all laila bonaventura looked at him with a faint resentment i think so guardian she replied in english didnt i the last came with such swift almost savage challenge of voice and eyes that vincent dering the recipient felt glad of the diversion caused by the arrival through the drawingroom of some more guests to claim the attention of the host and hostess and so leave him in peace i say that girl has got splendid hair hasnt she he said in an undertone to lance as they stood a little apart watching the new comers that tall one you meandont admire it puts me in mind of that devil of a chestnut who nearly killed me at polo a chestnut with white stockings awfully handy but he paused as father ninian came up to them you can scarcely know any of your neighbours as yet captain dering began the old man with the ceremony of a past age so perhaps you will give me the privilege of presenting you to some of our good mission ladies thanks replied vincent hastily but i see my old friend mrs walsall smith coming in i must just go and shake hands but im sure carlyon lance shot a perfectly pathetic glance after his captain who moved off to meet a delicatelooking fair woman who at that moment came in with dr dillon the latter taken possession of and monopolized by an exceedingly pretty child of five who had evidently inherited her mothers fragility delighted im sure murmured lance following his leader dejectedly miss erda shepherd mr lanceloti am right am i notcarlyon it was the tall girl with the redbrown hair of course she had bronze eyebrows too and bronze eyesnice ones he saw so much as he made his bow while father ninian stood looking first at the girl then at the young man and as he looked his fine old hands were clasped as if they held something very precious it was a habit of his i hope you will like each other he said in his kind old voice and then ere he moved away his hands fell apart for an instant as if giving something peace go with you my children he said with a smile lance felt a queer unaccustomed thrill travel from the nape of his neck to his boots pausing by the way at his heart it was an unusual method of introduction certainly yet somehow it relieved the shyness which generally beset him at such functions he found himself looking frankly into the bronze eyes and something in them made him say almost involuntarily that was rather a jolly way of beginning to be friends i mean the shyness came back with a rush he blundered horribly very put in the girl interrupting him quite simply i hope it will be peace i always hope that you know i am a missionary oh he replied blankly yes there are a lot of youi meanof them in eshwara arent there her face set suddenly her mouth grew almost stern not enough mr carlyon not half enough she replied and the militant ring of her voice belying the peaceful professions of the previous moment made him look at her curiously recognizing that he had touched some quivering nerve of mind if you knew eshwara as i know it she went on passionately you would say so too im sure you would the bronze eyes meeting his blue ones though they gave nothing back but kindly almost boyish surprise seemed satisfied she turned suddenly and stretched her right hand over the river which slipped oilily past the wall below as they stood beside the balustrade of the loggia look she said impulsively do you see that straight white thing floating down the curve of the current yonder it isnt a log those others are plenty of logs come down the rivers from the forests in the hills for they dont catch all you know at the government woodstation and so the people here catch the runaways in the backwater and get paid for them but that she paused and her other hand gripped the balustrade hard then she turned back to him with a faint apology why should i bother you let us talk of something else there is no reason why i should talk of these things to you so soon or indeed at all id rather you did he put in quickly it was the truth a sudden curiosity had come to him a sudden desire to know more to think more he was less of a boy than he had been five minutes before ii hope you will he added really i doii he felt his manhood as he had never felt it before and yet in a way he was more forgetful of it the girl opposite him was womanhood incarnate to him and yet in some mysterious way beyond it above it you and i must be about the same age i expect he said with a halfperplexed frown but you have seen a lot more than i have i wish youd tell me please the straight white glint in the water was just disappearing behind one of those balconies overhanging the river where there was only room for a pair of lovers it is a dead girl mr carlyon she said in a low voice she was in my school her people were very bigotedbrahmins in a templebut they let her be taught to read because she was betrothed to an educated man last year she was marriedshe was but a child stilland i have only seen her once or twice since thenthe voice paused a second she was very frightened poor little premi at what was coming i shall die misssahib i shall

little premi and her babyoh she broke off with an infinite pain in her voiceit is so hardso hard for both her face set riverwards was soft yet stern full of fight yet full of pity and lance thought of a virgin martyr in the illustrated lives of the saints with which his grandmother lady carewe had been wont to still his boyish unrest on sunday afternoons yet there was something beyond that selfconcentrated devotion in this face something that took him back further still to the days when he had sobbed out his childish hurts in his mothers arms she was ill all yesterday and the day beforethey told me there was no hope of eitherthey just let them die and they always put them in the riverthey have iron rings round their wrists and ankles to prevent them coming back to harm the men she paused and turned to lance swiftly isnt it true that there are not enough of usthat we want more women to teach them what but i does came a high childish treble forcing itself irresistibly even on the attention of these two i ikes oo twenty fowsand times better than dad an i ikes captain dering ten fowsand times better too an so does mumdont oo mummie it was little gladys smith who clasping both dr dillons hands in hers had swung herself back from him so as to toss her fair curls from her laughing face as she looked up at him mutinously there was an instants awkward pause during which the eyes of a man and woman met for a second met and parted hastily but not before the girl with the yellow silk sash who stood between them had looked from one to the other with a dim surprise unclosing her red lips and showing the gleam of her white teeth between them then dr dillon said carelessly and you like akbar khan better than any of us you young sinner because he gives you sweeties here akbar khan bring the missybaba some cream toffee the old pantaloon who with his loose coatee removed and a white duster tucked into saturns waistring was now helping to hand round coffee and cake capered up with a voluble but toothless gerreebpunwaz protector of the poor gladys helped herself discriminately staring at the old servitor the while but i dont ike akbar khan do i son of an owl she continued superbly in the accurate urdu which comes so daintily from lisping english babies did i not say i would hate thee because thou wouldst not tell me why thou didst prostrate thyself before the soldier in the courtyard and the ayah laughed the baseborn she knew also and would not say and so did the soldier so i hate you all she stamped her little foot and shook her curls defiantly gladys cried her mother reproachfully hullo whats all this about laughed captain dering catching the child up in his arms one of my soldiers insulting you who was it he turned with the absolute command of his race to the beringed one who stood full of deprecatory mumblings and salaamings his hands holding the tray of sweets trembling visibly who was it khanjee asked father ninian in a curiously even tone one which nevertheless seemed a compelling one for a murmured name came rapidly followed by eager explanations father ninian frowned and deliberately put on the gold pincenez which always hung around his neck he seldom used it however being he would say playfully in his native scotch too well acquaint with eshwara and all in it to need such help after fifty years experience so it had come to be an unfailing sign that he was face to face with something unexpected something new naturally therefore it changed the character of his face bringing back to it a strange look of youth of hope and energythe look of choice which age has not roshan khan he echoed why comes he here then in sudden recollection he turned to vincent dering of course he comes with you i knew he was in your regiment but i did not think captain dering put down the child gently is there any reason sir he asked decisively why he should not be here if so father ninian took off his eyeglasses slowly he was back on familiar ground no he said with a smile and a shrug of the shoulders none he is welcome to come if he likes he is a fine soldier captain dering and a good fencer the best i have ever come across put in lance carlyon father ninian laughed a satisfied vainglorious little laugh and bowed with his hand on his heart in foreign fashion it seemed almost as if something had brought back the manners of a different life his master thanks you he said gaily i taught him but as esmond said of the botte de jesuitnot all we craftsmen keep something up our sleeve for our own use lance carlyons face grew eager he had heard of father ninians art with the foils and took his opportunity thats what roshan does to me i took lessons from him but he licks my head off with tricks perhaps some day sir father ninians right hand and wrist despite their age flourished themselves with marvellous suppleness of a surety of a surety he interrupted still in that gay almost reckless voice and i will teach you laddio del marito i never taught that to roshanit does not do for savage natures the husbands goodby what a funny name echoed laila curiously why is it called that guardian the gaiety left the old mans face because the thrust is used cara mia he replied in italian and his answer came dreamily half to himself when even those who have that greatest tie to life prefer to say goodby to it he paused then went on cheerfully but come music music we lose time horribly laila tis your part to begin the girl walked stolidly to the piano what shall i sing guardian she asked sing he repeated reverting once more to italian and his voice had the dreamy tone in it again sing my favourite child something hath taken me back to the old daysand sing it well something in the pose of the girl something in the faint defiance of her face as she stood turning over the leaves of the music attracted vincent derings fancy he moved over to her and asked if he should play her accompaniment if you can she said ungraciously he smiled what is it ohhandel he shrugged his shoulders yes i fancy i can play himhe is not very complex the next instant he had embarked with a certain sense of pique lending perfection to his phrasing on the prelude but perfect as his tone was it seemed to fall dull and dead before the voice which rose and echoed into the arches he shall feed his flock like a shepherd pure peaceful free from every touch of passion absolutely utterly beyond this world and its works it rose and filled the garden the orangescented garden with its fretted marble cascades and watermaze where the feet of laughing girls had chased each other the latticed balconies where lovers had sat and he shall gather the lambs in his arms it floated out over the river where the dead girl had drifted making a light come to a pair of bronze eyes come unto him all ye that labor out beyond the garden into the city a faint far echo of the call made men and women pause in the struggle for life and say they are singing in the palace and ye shall find rest unto your souls the promise of all religions the cry which makes all creeds one rose and fell as the afternoon sun shining into the loggia put a canopy of stars above the head of the singer some of the audience said thank you politely when she ended vincent dering did not he stood on one side and being musical to the hearts core gave himself the luxury of silence only when father ninian ever mindful of ceremonies and courtesies crossed to acknowledge the services of the accompanist he said briefly who taught her that the old man looked at him almost wistfully i heard her grandmother sing it nearly sixty years ago i have never forgotten it i do not wonder said vincent dering and his eyes forgetful of others followed the girl whose dress ought to have been creamy and soft instead of white and starched chapter iii driftwood the river hara after skirting the fort the bathingsteps below the courtyard the palace and the palace garden continued its course still hemmed in to swift current by a high bank on the opposite side and on the near one by a wall set with spiked temples sacred to siva for hara is one of his many names but on reaching the apex of the triangle formed by the city the banks fell away the river spread itself out to greater rest until at the uttermost end of a long spit of sandbank and tamarisk it met the waters of its twin river the hari in the broad placid lagoon which lay between eshwara and the south that is the dry stretch of desert against whose barrenness western ingenuityaided by dr dillons horde of fifteen hundred ruffianshad been digging defiance for months from the spit of sand you could see the result a broad seam on the face of patient mother earth a first wrinkle telling of millions to come from the ploughshares of men as yet however the canal was as dry as the desert around it and was to remain so until the great lordsahib came in state on his way to the hills to open the sluices there was to be a big camp a big function on the occasion and even sleepy eshwara felt a vague excitement regarding it for the older men remembered the days when the hosts of the lordsahibs had regularly passed through the city and had tales to tell about them a fact which prevented the coming event from being too strange even to be thought about then the opening of the canal was another disturber of primeval calm true the idea of it had been with eshwara ever since the first sod had been turned two years before but now the thing stared it in the face within a few days the waters of the sacred rivers would have to lie in a new bed would they like it would the gods like it would men like it those were the questions being asked from one end of eshwara to another even outside it on the long narrow spit of sandbank set with sparse tussocks of grass and tamarisk which reached beyond the citys triangle into the riversand where after a flood the white gypsum silt lay like a robe of righteousnessthey were being discussed for the strange race who lived on it shifting their wigwams of grass to the lowlying land opposite when the waters rose lived by the river by the fish in it and the logs of wood which came floating down it so this question of the canal was in the mind of the naked man attired in the complete suit of blue beads which marks an aboriginal race who in the dawn following squatted on the highest curve of the spit he was small swart to positive inkiness and his thin legs and arms shewed grey lights on their tense muscles as if these were truly iron behind him rose a wigwam of reeds at the entrance to which a spear was stuck in the sand in order to display the head of a bottlenosed alligator impaled on its point at his right hand was a reed basket a rude net of reed twine in front of him lay one of those small sharklike scaleless fishes which the learned call silurian and tell us are relics of a creation older than ours so might the man have been so might have been the background of sand and reed spear and wigwam the foreground of net and fish yet the fisher was not all uncivilized this little survival of an aboriginal race shifting about in the shifting riverbed had always had an attraction for the missionaries who as a rule find the inferior races easiest to deal with gugu thereforehis name being as primitive as his appearance since it is the first effort of infant tonguesbelied his looks he had at any rate a civilized eye to business a civilized notion of the relations between supply and demand for he shook his head at the customer opposite him not a cowrie less khanjee tis the only one in the market see you besides on this day the missen miss comes to us folk and she never haggles she will pay the five annas gladly to be let read her book to my women the mumbleapparently a pious aspiration that the most high would smite infidels hip and thighwas the only recognizable point in the figure on the other side of the fish for akbar khan doorkeeper messenger assistant waiter had not only discarded saturns ringsthe loss of which about his head made his baldness something of a shockbut also every article of clothing except his waistcloth the reason for this was in a way like many another thing about the old sinner pathetic briefly he liked to dissociate his inner self from occupations which he considered were beneath the dignity of the akbar khan of the past therefore being for the nonce a bazaar coolie in search of fish for his masters breakfast he got up for the part so finding it at once easier to forget and to remember that past he mumbled of it as he strenuously opposed the price everything grows dearer every day yawned the aboriginal gugu even women as thou shouldst know akbar khan clucked a pious denial we spread no nets for that game in the palace nowadays those evil times are gone we live sober and virtuous the piety held a distinct flavour of regret and as for fish continued gugu they will be dearer ere they are cheaper when the deep water begins to run canalwards the fish will run too then goodby to our trade since the huzoors allow us nothing in their waters without payment he whined however to the wrong quarter for sympathy the old retainers views on preserving being absolutely those of a shropshire squire who is also a j p neither did we he replied indifferently thy like gugu would have had to bring thy fish to the palace and be satisfied with our leavings out on thee for an upstart take thy four annas and be thankfulslave gugus illtempered face became aggressive not ithe miss will give it nay six mayhap since the child is sick and she will be wanting leave to dose it sohands offeunuch the title once dignified was opprobrious now and old akbar rose in a perfect fury his bald head wobbling the flaming fringe of red hairs about his face giving him a ludicrous resemblance to a toothless old maneating tiger face to face with his lawful prey yet unable to injure it oh for the bastinado he stuttered impotently oh for the cutting off of bodily members oh even for the tying up of heels and roastings and duckings but the huzoors have taken them from us and gifted them to the police who know not the proper methods yah gugu had i but had thee fifty years ago his anger lessened with sheer wistful regret fifty years ago when the nawab gifted me as bodyservant to the new wazeer bunavatarsahib because he brought him a bird that would sing of itself from italy wilayat but all birds do that cavilled gugu feeling nevertheless a reverent curiosity about those legendary days akbar gave a crackling contemptuous laugh not palace birds they have to be wound up and bunavatarsahib sent for this across the black water so he kept favour with the nawab birds that sing and flowers that smell and boxes that make music and dolls that dance when you wind them lo these gugu are the pleasures of palaces but how canst thou know who hast not lived in them even as i the sense of his own superiority soothed him still more he squatted down again and hubblebubbled for a space at the hookah which was an integral part of all his impersonations yea those were times he mumbled half to himself even pidar narayanmay heaven protect himcould not say please god to every mouthful as he does nowas we all do now and rightly seeing that we have grown old once more the piety smacked of pity and the old man finding a listener went on with a certain gusto look you he had to walk like the tongue among thirtytwo teeth in those days with bunavatarsahib my master like two peas in one pod with the nawah except for women pidar narayan took his way theremostly the interrupting gurgle of the hookah gave time for an elaborate wink of a wicked old eye possibly this was due to the smoke for the old voice went on as before almost dolorously he had the moneybags you see and looked after the rents but my master bunavatarlo thou shouldst have seen him when he came firstthe picture of a manthey say he was a prince in his own country but fell into trouble so came to make his fortune here with pidar narayanwas called wazeer and let me tell thee gugu it means something to be bodyservant to a wazeer lo to think i might have been it still but for that jade anari begum despite the epithet he smiled and his pipe this time gave out quite a chuckling sound as ill to keep within walls as a butterfly he muttered up and down the garden in and out the balconies and the nawab in two minds to use force or put her in a sack for she flouted him the prettiest ones play that game for power always and she was walidad her brothers last hope of favour walidad kanjara who had been kings caterer for years before my master bunavatarsahib came to make all the court cry sour buttermilk walidad who had once stood so high that in a drunken bout the nawab promised him his halfsister to wife and he got her too she wept on her wedding day but we in the lower storey heeded not tears in the upper for see you mine uncle was chief eunuchwe kept the honour thus in the family from generation to generationso i was in and out seeing what went on until somehow mine uncle with the bowstring round his neckas was right honest manswore he knew not how bunavatarsahib caught a sight of her some say it was a plot from beginning to end of walidads others that his enemies feared lest anari should succeed there be balls within balls even in a plaything if the workmen are cunning anyhow he saw her and i his bodyservant was able to come and go where pidar narayan hath made his church nowadays but there what matters it tis all one love and the faith are in and out of mens minds like a shelldrake in weedy water a body cannot tell which way its head may be and which its tail nevertheless i felt a choke at my throat gugu many a time as i waited for him in the boat below the balcony yet in the end it was not my throat but mine uncles he died in the faith gugu cursing women his head was that way at the lasttis mostly sohehe the chuckle of his pipe was fiendish yet his wizened face was wistful still god knows one could scarce look on at such a wooing and not beat the drum in time as musicians to a dancer and it runs in our blood see you to watch and beat the drum that is our profession and by mine ancestors i deemed it enough for mortal man but bunavatarsahib see you was not of our race he was of italy wilayat and a prince so one day my liver dissolved hearing that the butterfly was over the walls but as i said it was mine uncles neck not mine yet the game ended for me when bunavatarsahib died they poisoned him folk say ist true asked gugu it was a point in the ofttold tale which was still discussed by eshwara gossips that is other folks news not mine replied akbar discreetly may be may be not the huzoors anyhow sent the nawab to die in calcutta on a pinson for it but they have ever an excuse to take land pidar narayan had a hard fight to keep bunavatarsahibs grantsthe nawab was ever generous to his favourites look youfor anari begums baby ay though he showed a writing of marriage and had made the infant christian after their habit still he got them land and palace and all so i stayed on serving my masters child and when she died her child the missbaba even to the haggling for fish lo slave it grows late give it to me and have done with itthou wilt not oh for the devil that was in her grandmother anar to be in this missbaba and for her to come to bunavatarsahibs rights as wazeerthen would there be loppings and or if roshan khan should come to his sneered gugu the canal sahibs ayah was telling me thou didst prostrate thyself in the dust as if he were indeed nawab have a care eunuchjee the police are agog nowadays to find disloyalty even in newspapers may her gossiping tongue be slit stuttered the old retainer can a body not do obeisance to his masters for look you roshan is true grandnephew to the nawab through his grandmother walidads wifeay and for that matter cousin to the miss through anari begum walidads sister i did but welcome him i did but my dutyi did but show my mannersi did but what we have done from generation to generation he moved away muttering full of virtuous resentment that a suspicion of anything save sheer servility should have been imputed to him after a lifetime of trucklings and bootblackings to be credited with higher motives was too bad to prove his innocence he would that very evening he told himself seek out roshan not at the fortthat might be misunderstoodbut at his grandmothers his grandmother who though she had been upstart walidads wife was still the late nawabs halfsister his sister what could be nearer than that and he would prostrate himself again and assure the family of his services that was his birthright meanwhile gugu looked after him and laughed he was a clever fellow was gugu and in a previous generation of scholars had been pet pupil in a little school started by another miss from another missen he had got pennies for attending it which had come in useful before he was big enough to face the river but now he was the best man on either the hara or the hari save one and he gugus beady black eyes watching the curve of the current mechanically gave a sudden flash he was on his feet in a second there was something dipping diving sidling drifting out yonder which might be secured for his wigwam before anyone else saw it but as silently like a seals his black head came up from his first forge under water which was to give him a fair start from the shore without even a splash to attract notice another black head showed to the right of him a yard or two behind but it was his head ammas head amma the froglike amma whose wide hands and feet looked as if webbed in the water amma the only man who could touch him he set his teeth gave up silence and surged ahead with an overhand stroke his hand seeming to clutch and hold the water it was a faster stroke than ammas for a time the swifter then with a backward glance he drew a quick breath knowing it would be a race indeed for the black head had gone and only a faint wale on the smooth water told where his rival avoiding the slight resistance of the air swam like a fish dangerous tactics for most men ending often in a sudden collapse bleedings from nose and ears or at least time lost in coming to the surface but amma was not as other men halfwitted except in river lore uncouth misshapen he was practically amphibious gugu ground his teeth impotently as the faint wale crept up and up the man must have air in his stomach like a fish ah if the river had been in flood if this had been a race with air bladders indeedone black head of inflated skin under each arm and your own in the middlethe issue would have been certain for no one in the whole tribe knew the backward rip of a knife from below which would leave a rival helpless lopsided bound to seek safety on shore so well as gugu but it was not flood time so he must risk all like a porpoise at play the curve of his dark back disappeared and now there were two wales upon the water side by side and ahead sidling dipping diving to the current was a deodar log with the broad arrow of government on it now visible now out of sight it was a question of steering steering without eyes steering by instinct steering by sheer experience of logs and their ways of the meeting currents of the two rivers and their ways and over against them to the right across the broad lagoon were low brick buildings and a horde of fifteen hundred ruffians with fascines and earthbaskets finishing a dam that was to alter the currents and protect the canal they looked like swarming ants in the sunshine the wales were neck and neck now side by side straight as a die on the log then suddenly the righthand one swerved outward only a yard or two a yard or two nearer to the ants in the sunshine a second after the log swerved alsoswerved to the right the next two black heads rose silently but one of them was two yards to the left of that dancing dipping prize gugu breathless as he was gave an inarticulate cry of rage and shook his fist at the swarming ants already their work was altering the currents he had known for so long that it was possible to allow for this as amma had done did not comfort him he swam back sulkily his wrath increased by the knowledge one glance had given him that the log on which his rival was paddling to shore triumphantly bore its broad arrow so lightly and so near its end that a little dexterous manipulation would have left the runaway unmarked and so given its captor the right not merely of ransom but of sale truly it was an ill world for the poor but lance carlyon laughed as he lounged over his early tea and watched the river through his fieldglass in a balcony of the fort dressed in a gorgeous ringstreaked sleeping suit which he could only wear when on outpost duty as the regiment had tabooed it in truth it made him not unlike tom sawyers royal nonsuch the little uns got it i say dering i believe i shall like eshwara itsitsnewdont you know his eyes rested as he spoke on the low bastioned building all hemmed in by temple spires at the very point of the citys triangle which erda shepherd had told him was the mission house truly he thought she was in the thick of it new echoed vincent dering captiously i should have called it old i thought that sort of thing had died with the pagoda tree what sort of thing vincent nodded towards the palace with an odd cynical laugh that its ghostly doesnt belong to the nineteenth century lance turned curiously i said that toto pidar narayani cant call him anything else somehowwhen he was showing me over yesterday andyou know that inscrutable smile of hishe just pointed up to the telegraph wiresthey go right across the garden you knowand said there is half the news of half the world over our heads anyhow it knocked me over i tell you to think of it and by jove dering next week when the lordsahib comes vincent dering laughed boisterously therell be the millennium of course come along lance its time we were off to prepare his way dashwood wants it done a they are going to lay on electric light and all that by the way mrs smith told me to tell you she expected you to breakfast ten minutes afterwards they were riding over the boat bridge to superintend the laying out of the viceregal camp against the coming of the lordsahib and his hosts chapter iv undercurrents mumtaza mahal roshan khans grandmother lived in a queer little backwater of a house which had eddied itself away from the main stream of the town and jammed itself against a wall of the palace as if seeking dignity thereby for all that it belonged irredeemably to the city and to its evilsmelling lanes the word house however is misleading to western ears since this was simply a welllike courtyard with a great wooden bed set in the centre under a miserable attempt at a tree which was used as a clothespeg a rack for saucepans and a variety of other domestic purposes it fulfilled them to the perfect satisfaction of its proprietress a roundabout old lady plump as a buttonquail who when she was not asleep inside the arcaded slip of a room on one side passed her time on the bed in the scanty shade keeping company with a sausageroll of a pillow and a quilt both covered in faded greasy silk as a rule she did nothing save eat pan though sometimes as a favour to erda shepherd who came to read to her once a week she would give a few more stitches to a knitted comforter which never seemed to get any longer it had been begun indeed under the auspices of another miss who had returned to england only to die as so many do from exposure and overwork and homesickness for the rest mumtaza was an arrogant yet goodnatured old soul who despite those tears on her weddingday had kept dissolute walidad under her thumb and his son also therefore it was one of her pet grievancesand she had manythat roshan her grandson should have defied her authority and entered the army the great standing grievance however was that the pinson she received from government because her husband had been deported with the nawab to calcutta was not so large as one received by a neighbour and gossip whose husband had been hanged in the mutiny the two old ladies came to loggerheads over their respective claims once a month regularly when payday came round mumtaza asserting shrilly that to die in a strange country was more painful than hanging ashrafunnissa contending roundly that if walidad had had as much respectful affection for his widow as her husband had had for his he could easily have caused himself to be hanged since he had certainly deserved it whereat there would be war until some one in the alley or round the corner did something outrageousthrew slops over some one or had twins or imported a new motherinlaw then friendly discussion becoming a necessity of life the big wooden bed would once more hold two old ladies two rolypoly bolsters two quiltsalso two tongues but these confined themselves for a time to lesser grievances such as the general decadence of the age manifested by the reluctance of young people to obey the old there was however no sign of displeasure in the reception prepared for roshan when one afternoon immediately after his arrival at eshwara he appeared to prostrate himself at the feet of age at least so he had said in his letter of intimation mumtaza mahal knew her duty towards menfolk better than to show temper at once knew also the suffocating effect of ceremonials so the tarnished treasures of past state had been dug out of the mounds of litter heaped up in all four corners of the arcaded room and set about the courtyard an old elephanthousing covered the wooden bed and to it roshan was conducted his grandmother despite her best green satin trousers squatting below on a mat the young soldier felt and looked thoroughly uncomfortable out of sheer funk of the old ladys remarks if he had appeared in his usual mufti of english tweed and a closefitting turban he had reverted to the airy muslins and embroidered smokingcaps of his forbears he felt chilly barely decent in them and indeed the whole environment was absolutely repugnant to him his grandmothers tramways could scarcely be otherwise to one who had gone ahead by express train like roshan khan thoroughly welleducated he knew himself to be considered one of the smartest native officers in the army a firstclass polo player a fair cricketer able to handle cue and racket and without equal at the foils he had for years met englishmen on equal terms in sporting matters what wonder then that he sat looking inexpressibly bored beside the hookah which was the pride of his grandmammas heart in that it had belonged to many dead and gone nawabs he was simply longing for the solace of a smoke yet he did not dare to use the silver cigarette case with his initials rk on it which lance carlyon had given him at christmas in return for the fencing lessons fortunately however boredom and yawns are correct during visits of ceremony so mumtaza mahal crossed her little fat hands over her little fat greentrousered legs and told herself the lad was improved in both manners and looks was distinctly more like her brother the late and sainted nawab the fact emphasized her regret that after a brilliant career in a mission school a career which must have led to a minor clerkship her grandson should have taken the unheardof course of entering the army if he could even have gone as the nawabs grandnephew with a dozen troopers or so as following it might have been bearable but as walidads extraction barred all claim to noble descent enlistment meant something very different the old lady accustomed to obedience all round when the dreadful defiance had occurred ten years before had called the stars to witness that it was allthat everything waspidar narayans fault and then she had fallen awhimpering knowing right well that but for the latters intercession she herself would have had no pinson since government bars those who can be proved to be personally implicated in evil doings and now as she sat looking at her grandson the same conflicting estimates made her irritable why had pidar narayan ever put his finger in the eshwara pie yet without him where would they all have been still he need not have taught the lad to fence and so turned him into a mean common soldier now whether this was true whether his skill with the foils had turned roshans thoughts towards a fighting life or whether it was simply the result of natural aptitudes that way the choice of professions had been wise his colonelof the old school though he washad admitted when pressed that the young mahomedan given practice might be able to lead the regiment as well as a freshjoined english subaltern the newer school again playing the krieg spiel against him at simla and finding itself in grips with a genuine gift for tactics had shaken its head and confessed the hardship of such a talent being barred from finding its proper level still it was impossible to legislate for exceptions without upsetting the everyday army applecart roshan himself being sensibleabove all being of a nation which accepts limitations as a law of godwas as a rule satisfied with his future risaldar majorship and if he was lucky aidedecamp to the queen and a few other titles tacked on to it like all natives of india he lived largely on the approbation of his immediate superiors and this he had without stint besides his whole line of thought had become too military for any subversion of rule and discipline to seem desirable yet the curb made itself felt sometimes never more keenly than at his grandmothers scornful look when in reply to her catechising he named his income only that bah tis the pay of a coolie tis the pay of my rank anyhow he replied sulkily and i cannot expect promotion yet the rules she waggled her beveiled bejewelled head cunningly rules what have rules to do with favour either for men or women lo thy granduncle the nawab gave twice that to a coachman who had one eye black and the other blue because he fancied him so if thou art in favour as thou sayest ask for more the huzoors will give it sooner than lose thee roshan did not attempt explanation he simply evaded the point by asserting that the pay was sufficient for his wants in a way it was an unfortunate remark since it precipitated the lecture lurking in the old ladys mind and for the wifes that is to come she asked not without dignitythe dignity of age reminding youth that its turn for duty has come and for the sons that has yet to be born why are these old arms still empty of thy children roshan he had his answer ready one that had hitherto baulked even the matrimonial desires of his mother who having gone to live with her own people was backed up by sisters and sistersinlaw because the most high decreed freedom for wife and son it was true the wife found for him as a boy had died in childbirth but mumtaza had made up her mind to refuse this excuse any longer matters were getting desperate here was roshan past thirty and never a childs voice to soothe the passion which seems to come back vicariously to indian women in their old age she had been brooding over an appeal ever since she had heard that after ten years absence the lad was once more to be within reach of her tongue so she edged closer to him an almost pathetic authority in her face that is but the skin of the orange roshan i take not that as a gift there be more wives than one if the one die even for the huzoors whom thou apest nay light of the house frown not she continued in sudden alarm at his look i did but mean that thou wert different from thy fathers how canst help it think not the old woman cannot understand was i not young once was i not wedded with tears to thy grandfatheron whom be peace so i know the heart hath fancies and thinelisten while i whisper itisis for a wife like a mem wherefore not thou hast seen and talked with themthey have seemed better to thee than a cow of a black girl what then have not mems married our people ere now and with theeshe looked round quickly to be certain of privacy then leant closer stillwith thee it would be easyfor there is thy cousin my cousin he echoed stupidly yea thy cousin when all is said and done she repeated with faint scorn is not the miss at the palace anari begums granddaughter was not anari begum thy grandfathers sister if that is not cousin what is it he had known these facts before of course but they had never presented themselves to him in this connection yet they came instantly accredited by custom his cousin if so his wife if he chose almost by right and yet from custom also hetoo sensible not to have gauged the vast difference between his position as regards englishmen and his position as regarded their wives sisters motherswas conscious of distinct revolt thou shouldst not say such things he exclaimed almost angrily the misssahib misssahib indeed interrupted mumtaza with a forced giggle who knows she is that not even pidar narayan wherefore asked roshan coldly her mother was bonaventurasahibs child and heir that is certain else the government would not have continued the grants given to him by the nawab an expression of infinite cunning crossed the old ladys face she tucked another budget of pan into her cheek preparatory to a lengthy explanation not if it was payment for evidence given by which government could find excuse for seizing the rest and sending innocent people to die in calcutta thou knowest the tale roshan how pidar narayan said no word when everyone was searching after bunavatars death for anari begum who had disappeared and how when the land was being taken he appeared with a baby a baptized baby and swore it was bunavatars lawful heirthat he himself had married them mayhap he did but look you anari was in the palace zenana ere she disappeared who is to say she is not thy cousin twice over i say not that she is look you but who can tell yet this is certain roshan she hath anari begums eyes for i have seen her but a month ago the miss who reads brought her not knowing of these tales for pidar narayan keeps a silent tongue her name is laila and thine roshan is not that a fate and she hath thy grandaunts eyes ay and thy grandfathers land too for would it not have been walidads if bunavatar had not ousted him from the wazeership with singing birds roshan khan stood up feeling as if he was being suffocated it was ten years since he had had experience of the finedrawn meshes of vague almost useless conspiracy for which indian women have such vast capability it was ten years since with eyes open to his own advantage he had cast in his lot loyally with the government he served in that time there had not been wantingthere never is in indiaothers less scrupulous ready to trade on his connection with a dispossessed family and his possible sense of injustice he had known how to treat them but this idea bit shrewdly at a feeling which men of his stamp have inevitablythe desire for a wife more suitable to their own culture than they can hope to find among their own people he gave an uneasy laugh these be dreams indeed grandmother to begin with pidar narayan pidar narayan pidar narayan echoed the old diplomatist tartly art turned hindoo that thou dost count narayan the creator of all then she suddenly clapped her hands together in absolute impatience and anger yet is it true he is the cause of all but for him bunavatar would have been as an overfried fritter a burst bladder a drum on a hens back but for his teaching thee to fence a quick frown came to her hearers face teaching ay but only enough to make me fit for his skill to play with i know that now well let him try it again roshans sudden fierceness died down to sombre discontentbut that is fools talk he is too old i could not meet him on equal terms he drew himself up proudly yet he felt a vague regret at his own acquired sense of fair play below it lay a savagery that could rejoice in revenge at any price and mumtaza mahal watching him thought him still more like his ancestors and nodded approvingly think of it at least roshan she said and remember that it is not as if the girl were a real mem pidar narayan for all he is so clever was put to it to find a husband for the mother the baptized baby he took a poor creature from martins school at lucknow at last who could not even speak english like a huzoor because he was italian and a catholic put in roshan then shrugged his shoulders impatiently but thou canst not understand tis impossible dreams grandmother dreams dreams come true even when forgotten and torchbearers never see their own way retorted the old lady ending the discussion with proverbial wisdom as a clincher so think of it since thoughts cost nothing and tell no tales roshan felt as if they did the former at any rate as he strode back toward the fort telling himself he would feel better when he had on his uniform once more this was his metier not marriage the best soldiers the really great soldiershe paused the knowledge that he could never rise to real greatness coming to make him clinch his right hand as if on his swordhilt the tempest of revolt which swept through him left him dazed for he had reasoned the matter out with himself thoroughly and thought he had accepted the situation thought that he had realized that his dignity in the regiment under the present system went side by side and not behind that of the english officers yet here he was at the mercy of something too strong for acquired wisdom he walked on faster to escape into a more wholesome environment and by sheer force of will succeeded in driving away all thought of the past interview save a triviality that was the remembrance that her name was laila his roshan light and darkness day and night a fate indeed as he passed into the courtyard however on his way to the door in the river bastion a group in its centre round the old gun brought his attention back to realities and he went towards it his slippershod feet making no martial clank this time on the unionjack of raised paths the group consisted of half a dozen or so of men listening to something which was being declaimed with much gesticulation by an ashsmeared jogi whose widepierced ears distended by conchshell rings and transverse bar of white on his forehead showed him to belong to the sect which claims to have transcendental powers apparently he had been making the claim for a young man whose costume smacked of western culture and whose face was acute litigious interrupted him impatiently yea yea possibly thou couldst come over the obstruction gorakhnathjee but the question is whether the obstruction be legal is it not so lala ramanund lala ramanund whose dress was even more western and who had a certain air of distinction due evidently to position assented adding as a rider and with some contempt that at present they had only jogi gorakhnaths word that any interference was intended gorakhnath a tall muscular man naked save for his grassrope girdle his wild hair twined and twisted to a tiara his wild halfinsane eyes telling of drugs shot a glance of absolute defiance at ramanund thy name punditjee is not likely to give friendly witness to mine he began alluding to the fact that they were respectively called after the founders of their absolutely antagonistic sects and yet methinks thou couldst seeing here dya ram the first speaker alarmed in his lawyers soul at the militant tone of the jogi suggested hastily that they might inquire say at the gate or stay there was the risaldar coming he must know once more as he listened to the question put to him the expression of his race and creed came to roshans face hiding its culture of a certainty he replied haughtily the gun belongs to the fort it is not to be used as a shelter forfor saints his contempt was palpable i deny your premise put in dya ram eagerly the gun is the peoples by prescriptive right i can use it if i choose the government professes neutrality therefore no one has a right to interfere with my religion roshans face was a study lo dya ram for thou art my old classfellow surely hast gone back to the old beliefs since the days when thou didst sign thyself at the end of thy essays and in thy books dya ram agnostic dya ram gave an uneasy cough it is a question of legality he began and of money also put in a new voice cringingly the pilgrims come hither to see the saint and then bathe but if there is no saint many will not come and i who have my right on the steps as marker of the caste marks right echoed the mahomedan curtly have a care castemarker lest we do not claim the courtyard also here ramanund who had hitherto listened indifferently took up the cudgels that can scarcely be risaldarsahib he said our pious folk have come hither to perform their offices since time began gorakhnath turned on him at once not so vaishnava he said thou and thine know naught of the beginning of things come to us and holy shivjee for that thou art as far from the great wisdom as hehere he pointed wildly to roshanyea further despite thy pretence of purity despite thy hunger yesterday when returning to thy lost faith thou didst come here to eat as the twiceborn should and a shadow fell upon thy food despite thy deafness to this world just nowhere he laughed jeeringlywhich kept thee back from bearing witness to my truth to the truth of shivjees servant dya ram looked at him then at ramanund perplexedly what means he he said aside didst thou really come hither my wife was dying replied ramanund in a low rapid undertone and iyou understandtherethere is nothing certain you seeand any chanceone goes back at such times he broke off almost desperately in his confession dya ram who had signed himself agnostic nodded he understood what it was to be rudderless in a familiar current and came to the rescue of his friends consistency by asserting that any such decision regarding the gun if one had been made would certainly be disputed that he and histhough they demurred to its being counted against them for faith in the worshipping of mere matterwould if necessary carry the case to the high court carry it to the court of thy god indra if need be dya ram retorted roshan and as he strode off he spat deliberately in the dust that also surprised him faintly for he had thought he had learnt tolerance of the huzoors so with a frown and yet with relief he put his hand on the latch which would open the way back to a less disturbing environment as he did so another hand was on it also the door opened from within and father ninian stood on the threshold barring it but barring it with smiles ah my pupil he said in english i have been listening to your praises from captain dering and from mr carlyon too he says you are the best fencer in the army you and i must cross foils again sometime eh my pupil roshan as he stepped aside elaborately to let the old man pass drew himself up and saluted if you please sir but i have learnt new things sincesince those days his tone made father ninian pause to look at him for an instant then he replied and i have not forgotten the old that makes us equal roshan gave a little hard laugh as he went in if the old man liked to think so let him but father ninians face as he passeda black shadow in the sunshineacross the level steps leading down to the river wore a wistful smile old and new he thought new and old senseless useless words fit only for humanity to juggle dreams from since no man knew the unseen beginning knew the unseen end knew even his own birth and death in the endless band of life naught came first naught last and the things of today might be old the things of yesterday might be new margherita the name came soundless to the priests lips and a quick flush of youth and hope and joy seemed to smooth away the wrinkles of his face a faint laugh a happy laugh went further towards a hearing than the name it was sixty years ago nearly since he had left her an old story indeed and yet how new the new wine of it ran in his old veins thrilled to his old brain and took him back absolutely to a palazzo on the outskirts of rome with the pale flood of the tiber flowing beneath a marble loggia he had never looked on running water since without remembrance and nowhis feet having led him unconsciously to the rivers edgehe stood smiling at the pale flood of the hari for he knew that he had fought a good fight that he had kept the promise he had made in order to still her soul that he had kept her boy pietro bonaventura so far as he could from harm and his child and his childs child gathering them as lambs into the arms of holy church and then something in the last thought drove the tender human smile from his face he murmured a mea culpa mea maxima culpa bent to the stream and dipping his fingers in it crossed himself may shivjees blessing go with his holy water babajee said a voice behind him it was gorakhnath the jogi who his sympathizers having departed had come to fill his gourd father ninian turned so for a space they stood face to face representatives of the two great supernaturalisms of the world the one which has held the west the one which has held the east the old mans face at first returned to kindly human tolerance for his fifty years of eshwara had widened his sympathies but as he stood before the jogi it hardened and the priestly arrogance of the naked ashsmeared figure stretching a right hand in claim over the sanctifying power of the river was reflected in father ninians as he spread his left hand upwards and turned on his heel with the words vade retro satanas chapter v the deepukrag you are tired to death as it iswhy should you fuss any more over a pack ssh sir dont talk rubbish i am all right and eugene is so anxious everything should be a success that i must besides ii like it mrs walsall smith sent the hostess gathering smile round her long luncheon table and rose so did vincent dering who had sat at her right handa position due to his rank as commandant of eshwaraand as he did he drew his chair aside to let the girl on his left pass with his usual somewhat voyant courtesy though it was only laila bonaventura he had met her several times during the past few days and the effect which her singing had made on him had vanished before her general failure to interest him in the least and today she actually wore a blue sash in addition she had filled up the time between her monosyllables in methodically crumbling her bread and ranging the results in a pattern until the inanity of it had got on his nerves and he had felt inclined to beg her to desist and yet as in passing her black eyes looked into his with one curious yet comprehensive flash a memory of the extreme regularity of the curves and lines which had annoyed him made himquite irrelevantlywonder hastily if he could have said anything to muriel which he broke off in his own thought impatiently and gave an apologetic glance after mrs walsall smiths fragile figure there never was anything never never a word said never a deed done which all the worldeven eugene smith himselfmight not hear and know vincent dering felt a pulse of sheer virtue as he looked down the long table at his host with the vague irritation which the possessors of women often arouse in those who are not their possessors for muriel smiths halfplayful halfwistful rejection of sympathy had held that faint hint of dutiful martyrdom which seems so purely angelic to selfish manunless he happens to be the wretch who inflicts it curious he thought eugene wasnt much of a gentleman but he wasnt a bad sort and he was fond of his wife in a way yet he was blind to the fact that muriel was not fit to go trapesing about his blessed old canal works with the pack of padres and people he had got together to do honour to his skill she would do it of course and get through with it too here he helped himself to a glass of sherry and felt incoherently that she was the dearest and best woman in the worldthe one woman in the world so far as he was concerned as he sat between those two empty chairs where those two women so absolutely unlike had fenced him in on either side a faint wonder tinged his virtue in comparing the last three years with the time before it if anyone had told him then that he would write every day to a woman and expect her to write to him without a word or a deed please deringdarlin said an imperious small voice mum wants oo tos pupll go off she says wis all a gemplemen an she wants oo to go off wis a ladies all right little un he laughed gladly finishing his sherry at a gulp and ere catching the little mite in his arms giving himself that smartening pull together which was so characteristic of the man he looked very handsome very happy as he came up with gladys shaking her curls at him in outrageous flirtation how kind said muriel i dont know what i should do without you that was all but it sent him off in absolute content to tackle the stoutest lady in the room if you make the move mrs campbell he said diplomatically everyone will follow and i know mrs smith is anxious we should start as it will take some time to go round ay that it will assented the good lady in a mournful scotch accent deed if it were not for dr james she glanced fearfully at a tall man in a black frock coata man whose patriarchal beard had once been red and was now the colour of a carpet whiskwho was buttonholing father ninian the latter with his straight slenderness looking almost youthful beside the others burly bulk i wouldnt go if i didnt want to put in a sharpfeatured lady who belonged to another black frock coata small one you spoil the doctor mrs campbell as i tell my husband i yield to him in spiritual mattersthe mission you know and all that but when it comes to realitiesthe housekeeping and what we are to eat and do and that sort of thingthat is my province mrs campbell turned her fat goodnatured face on her neighbours placidly ay my dear but ye didnt promise to be a wife to dr james an i did so captain dering if you can find my niece miss shepherd is quite safe mrs campbell carlyons looking after her interrupted vincent feeling another spasm of sheer virtue he had seen the two sitting together at lunch apparently interested in each other and he had noticed how lance on entering the drawingroom had made his way straight to those coils of redbronze hair which had a trick of being the most conspicuous point in any group of which they formed part so lance would enjoy himself simply he would not have to gain pleasure in complex fashion by dragging about a posse of uninteresting old ladies for the sake of a lady who was neither vincents face had a bored look as he began his task by piloting his charge into the verandah and so on into the open it was hot work crossing the stretch of sand which lay between the bungalow and the red brick abutments of the canal head but once there with the broad still basin of the united rivers before you a cool breeze blew pleasantly from that blue barrier of hills with the goldspiked temples of eshwara enamelled against it and a soft white mist hiding the feet of the fardistant snows so hiding the cradle of the gods the floods had gone however and so had the robe of righteousness the sandbanks lay bare of the earth earthy the logs too were no longer dipping and dancing in the currents some were piled crisscross on the spit awaiting ransomers and a few lay like straight shadows half in half out of the receding water a log not a bit of it said someone stooping for a stone look the missile fell far short of the low streak of sand and shadow but did its work the shadow disappeared as a bottlenosed alligator slipped silently into the stream most eyes watched it but lance carlyons turned to erda shepherd he had only met her once casually when he was out fishing on the spit since the day when father ninian had introduced them and they had seen something else in the river that was also not a log do you remember he began impulsively the first time we met a shadow slipped into her limpid bronze eyes also certainly she interrupted coldly it is not so very long agois it she had fenced with his assumption of friendliness more than once already feeling vexed with herself the while that she should do so since what did it matter however much she might regretand she had regretted with foolish unseen blushes as she had lain awake at night wondering what had possessed herthe almost indecent unveiling of realities in that first five minutes she could not undo it besides she had told herself he had in all probability forgotten it in polo and partridgeshooting fishing and such things but he had not apparently and he parried her fence with a still more friendly laugh i didnt mean that of course but we wont talk of it if youd rather not it isnt a very mark tapleyish subject is it for an afternoon party the blush was to be seen this time so i have been thinking myself mr carlyon ever since last wednesday she began still more coldly and i am sorry he interrupted her quite cavalierly i didnt mean that either and you know i didnt however well leave it alone so youre not coming to the ball do you know i think its an awful pity im sure youd dance beautifully she felt outraged in a way and yet she smiled he seemed so much younger than she was younger but stronger and more vital that calm assertion too that she knew she was playing feminine tricks with him had been manly and dignified to quite a crushing degree she could not help being at once meek and indulgent i dont dance mr carlyon she said quietly adding as a rider and salve to her conscience ii think it wrong i thought you might he returned evidently pleased at his own acumen but i dont see it that way of course ifif you go in for those ideas you know you can make it seemwellawful low but i he paused before even a possible sounding of his own trumpetyou see i think its awfully jolly besides its such ripping good exercise and i have to be careful i tell you not to put on flesh i ride thirteenfour as it is his face grew grave over the confession is that much she said her eyes caught and held by the splendid figure beside her you are very tall surely there was almost a pride in her tone certainly a tenderness he shook his head not so tall as my people are generally we carlyons run to size my uncle sir lancelots sixthree and his son is sixfour but hes a bit weedy so when youre only sixone and a half you cant afford to wax fat youve got to keep the body in subjection thats right isnt it his pride in his scriptural knowledge made it impossible for her to be stern though she felt she ought to be quite right mr carlyon she assented hurriedly but see the others have gone on and i dont want to missshe stumbled in her haste to end the teteatete on a loose brick and for an instant was overnear the edge of the abutment take care he said his hand on hers to give support a cool strong hand with an insistence in its clasp which seemed to single her out from the world to stand so hand fast in hand you were very nearly over that time he said smilingly as he released her now lets come on or as you say we shall be too late for the fair smiths going to show off his electric light in the tents you know perhaps it was the slip which had made her dizzy but she walked beside him feeling as if she were in a dream and in truth the scene which grew upon them as they went on had a strange unearthliness and unreality she paused and gave a little gasp of pleasure and surprise it seems impossible she said a week ago when i was here it was all sand sand and now her eyes met the wide flowerset walks the stately white palaces of the viceregal camp with absolute incredulity did you do all this she asked doubtfully why youve made a new world she felt inwardly as if he had somehow for her oh vincent did a lot of the decorations you know hes that sort wemy fellows i mean and dillons gaolbirdsdug and did the dirty work but it looks all right doesnt it it did indeedabsolutely and entirely all right so white so straight so disciplined even to the very twist on the tent ropes that pegs out of line said lance pausing suddenly here sergeant a following had gathered in their rear bringing up the little procession of englishmen and women with a knot of dark faces and from it a man in dustcoloured drill stepped and saluted two inches or say an inch and a half erda caught so much in the order given as she walked on two inches or say an inch and a half no more than that wrong in this dream city and over yonder her eyes travelled past the snowdrift of the camp rising against the blue background of wide water to eshwara rising against its background of blue hill i thought so a good inch and a half said lance exultantly coming up with measured strides it makes a lot of difference though she looked at him critically older by some months than he full of strong character almost overfull of strong convictions she was yetas women must be until experience of workaday life teaches them as it has taught men the value of subordinationcuriously undisciplined curiously lawless and this striving after uniformity impressed her i suppose you learn that sort of thing in the army she said with a new respect he laughed i should think so buttons and bootlaces all to pattern its an awful bore but it keeps things going now here we are now you can see properly they stood in the centre of the camp in front of the huge durbar tent that wandering throne of an empire fixed and immovable as the stars in front of them rising out of a wilderness of roses blossoming where nothing but sand had shown since the primeval sea receded from the hills was the flag of that empire its folds drooping round the mast and beyond it past the two brass guns pointing down the long vista was an avenue of palms bordered by green grass and beds of flowers and intersected by broad paths leading back to the solid white squares of the tents at the farther end a quarter of a mile or more from the flagstaff a triumphal arch at the entrance showed until the palmleaves cut it short a legend welcome to the lord and above it far at the feet of those distant snows lay that wreath of white mist hiding the cradle of the gods erdas eyes travelled to it and from it to the other vistas similar yet smaller stretching to the right and left of her then to the orderly rows on rows of tents looking like solid blocks of marble behind her the whole shut in from the world by a high white wall still silent empty waiting for the hosts of the lord a snowdrift facing that mistdrift on the hills and between them eshwara and all that eshwara held of evil and of good the dreaminess left her eyes startled at a band of dark figures which at this moment appeared rounding the corner of a tentfigures in scanty striped clothing with a broad arrow on it figures with shaven closecapped heads and leg irons clanking as their bare feet threaded through the flowers and behind them halfhidden as ever under his mushroom of a hat came george dillon he had noticed as he passed with the others that the roses were flagging a bit under the hot sun and had gone back to summon a fatigue party of his criminals to water them bring another go mate he ordered as the gang filing past the flagstaff emptied their earthen pots then go back to the road and be quick theres no time to lose the lordsahib comes tomorrow they obeyed with grins and dr dillon as he paused beside lance and erda looked after them approvingly they like this better than picking oakum and ive had to set some of em to do that now the diggings done i shall be glad when this shows over and we move on move where asked erda where there is work to be done miss shepherd satan finds mischief you know especially with his own hands he paused and smiled theyre a queer lot do you know some of them are in a blind funk because they think a percentage of them have to be sacrificed before the water will run he grew grave again poor devils he added in a softer toneas if they hadnt paid tribute already i lost over a hundred last year what with pneumonia and malaria but they dont seem to count thatthat is the will of the gods but i say hadnt you better be going into the tent if you want to see the lightup smith went off to his plant five minutes ago with his gang so its about time it was almost pitch dark in the huge tent and as they slipped in through the closed portieres vincent derings voice called to them be quick please and carlyon tell them to shut down the outer screens we want to have a real flashup and i believe we are all here now whether that was so or not erda could not tell the brief ray of light caused by their entrance had only shown her captain derings figure beside his hostess and given her a glimpse of laila bonaventuras white dress close by so it was eerie in a way to wait in the darkness knowing it to be full of people she knew yet to have consciousness of nothing save their voices since age sex position even race were alike awaiting this new light which was to make them manifest perhaps the eeriness struck her companions also for the voices came clearly not in a babel but answering each other in the listening waiting silence we are all full of sparks i assure you mrs campbell i am weel aware o it doctor dillon but its too much like a brand snatched frae the burning to my taste for doctor james will have it undoubtedly my dear ann it appears to me sir and i trust it will to you as a most interesting scientific fact calculated to confound those who scoff at the possibility of eternal punishment in a fire that is not quenched or to comfort those who believe in a cleansing onewho seek a place in the crown of stars about their mothers headwho feel the flame of immortality its faint hesitancy betrayed this voice as the dryness did the next if ive got to generate my own heaven or hell i prefer to pass but if one could turn on a fiftycandlepower reflecting lamp during a post mortem or a bacillus hunt it would be useful yes fancy being able to get up at night and see at once in all corners of the room if there were snakes this brought a laugh till a fragile voice said plaintively thats just the worst of it when one begins to see things too clearly they are so apt to be nasty that my dear madam has always appeared to me as an additional argument against those who contend that perfect wisdom could not wisely have produced so imperfect a being as man surely dr campbell interrupted a tart voice the necessity for something on which to exercise our faith proves that but then i am only a woman i confine myself to realities then what a bore it would be if there were no delusions by jove it would be dull who is it says the soul of man lies in his imagination captain derings voice could not be mistaken just soand nowhere else this came in an aside and was followed in the same tone by the eager hesitating voice scoffer when you men of science spend your lives in listeningto the things which cannot be heardlooking for the things that cannot be seen ah doctoryou cant impose on me i know youi have seen you the very darkness seemed abashed and there was silence till a new voice young fullthroated broke it but how can you tell if things are nasty till you have seen themthey may be nice ahhh it had come like a creation flooding all things with irresistible light a sort of sigh made itself heard a sigh of vague relief by jove said captain dering it will make a difference to the durbar as a rule you cant see the diamonds and jewels and they are half the show palpably there could be no fear of that to the uttermost corner of the vast tent the pattern of its lining of shawls was visible each boss on the parcelgilt poles glittered and shone the very legend round the arms of england above the viceregal chair stood out clear dieu et mon droit and the expression on the two groups of dark faces the one which had come by invitation to see the other which had crept in at the further end could not be mistaken in the one indifference struggled with curiosity in the other assent was mingled with awe what are they saying asked lance who having come late stood close to the latter group something about deepukrag whats that erda shook her head father ninian will knowhe knows all these thingsthat is why they call him pidar narayan and let him do anything sometimes i wonder if it isnt the best way the last spoken to herself was interrupted by father ninians echo the deepukrag why yesof course he turned to the dark faces in sheer delight yea brothers he said in hindustani ye are right it is the deepukragthe sign of kingship have i not told ye always that the lord is with usand with you then he turned back to his other hearers it means the song of lighta charma spell which the great men of old knew is it not so ramanund a halfreluctant voice from the invited replied the ignorant say so sir a faintly sarcastic smile came to the fine old face and they believe its possession marks the born ruler of menthe godsent guide since when it is sung the light comes from the stars to help the world on its wayto dispel the darkness ahhh it had gone and in the black night which settled blankly on speaker and audience a faint far cry came from outside more than one womans voice echoed it with a little startled gasp of suspense it is all right called vincent dering the thing is always popping in and outive seen it at eustonit will come back directly and then in response to something he alone had heard he whispered dont be alarmed eugene will set it right in a momentreally as he bent his head a scent of violetsthe scent she always usedassailed him and that halfheard appealoh what is it vincent seemed still in his ears even in the darkness he knew she must be close to him he felt the soft ruffle of the lace about her hand upon his wrist it trembled surely did it or was it only his own bounding pulse a sudden imperious desire to knowto be certainswept through him then with a sort of suffocating rush to heart and brain came the knowledge that his clasp was answered by that small handso small so clinging so trustfulso dearso absolutely dearso dearso very dear as he stood in the darkness he knew that every mooring was gone knew that thisthis thingwould changemust changethe whole position it was a light indeed a light showing the waya different way a sort of fierce exultation took possession of him he knew now that he had been dreaming till then that he had been blind ah what a relief that dreadful darkness was getting on my nerves said a calm voice coming to him from out of the flood of white light which seemed to have rent their hands asunder their handswhen she stood yonder he turned bewildered to find a pair of grave black eyes fixed critically on him iihe began it doesnt matter said laila bonaventura with stolid indifference you thought it was her hand of course i quite understand did she didcouldanyone even he himself god how contenthow happy he had beenhow certain dillon dillon for gods sake wheres dillon came an excited voice as eugene smith burst into the tent bringing the afternoon sunshine to war with that unearthly light come along man theres been an accident in the workshop i warned them not to touchonea mere boydid got startled i suppose and fell overonto the circular sawit was going his legive tried a tourniquet but i cant stop the remainder was inaudible the caller and the called followed by vincent glad of any interruption to the intolerableness of his confusion were already running as for dear life down the palmset avenue towards the canal workshop outside the walls that it was for death however not life dr dillon saw at a glance though without a pause he knelt down in the fateful irresistible tide of life blood which was ebbing and flowing with such awful insistency and set his teeth in fight yet once he gave an upward glance to the long low roof so full of driving bands and wheels and levers so full of mens power so empty of mens passion and then a straight one to the circle of ignorant awestricken dark faces closing in round him and as he did so he muttered to himself i wouldnt have had this happen for a thousand poundsand a highcaste man too undoubtedly the sacred thread showed on the shoulder under the broad arrowfor the twiceborn are twiceborn even in gaol lay him on mother earth to die ye of his caste said a voice from behind it was father ninians his haste had driven the colour from his face he stood breathless yet calm his right hand raised in the awestricken circle none stirred there was no sacred thread upon their shoulders give me a hand please dr dillon said the old man quietly he will not die easy there so between them they shifted the slight figure from the wooden platform on which it had fallen to the ground all sodden and stained with that tide of blood a faint content seemed to come to the halfconscious face the head nestled itself into the soft earth as if to rest the circle of dark and white faces fell back alike leaving the doctor and the priest alone with deaththe doctor with both hands detaining that ebbing tide of life the priest with the viaticum of another faith on his lips speeding it on its way lo whispered some of the circle hark to his ram ram he knowspidar narayan knows chapter vi alpha and omega amma was fishing breast deep in the water which in the early dawn stretched like a shining shield to meet the pale primrose vestments of the coming day his bodiless head and shoulders slid sedately over the surface like some strange kind of wildfowl for his hands clasped at the back of his curly frizz of hair held the apex of a conical reeddistended net shaped like a pair of wings his eyes were closed and despite all lack of visible movement the tenseness of every muscle the strained look of every curve showed that he was on the alert for something that something being the first hint of possible prey sent by his hidden feet as they felt like hands over the bottom felt lightly buoyantly with scarce more pressure than the water itself until at the first suspicion of a fish lying halfburied in the sand they would fling themselves airwards to change places with his head and that with the net twirled dexterously above it would go down like an extinguisher over the suspicious ridge or furrow sometimesmost often of coursethey proved to be nothing else but sometimes again there would be a pause during which the black legs would remain uppermost and then once more the black head would come airwards with a wriggling fish held if it happened to be a small one in its white teeth for amma had not been provided by nature with a pouch like the pelicans who were fishing hard by and being absolutely destitute of clothing and pockets had to sidle sedately to the bank with each prize before seeking another since both hands and feet were needed for its capture otherwise his method of fishing was little removed from the birdsthe net being considered as his beak if anything it was the more primitive of the two since the pelicans fished in companies drawing a serried line round each likely shallow whereas amma had all the distrust of his fellow which marks man in his earliest development for even amongst his kind amma was held to be barbarian though heaven knows the six or seven millions of wild tribes and forest races in india which go to make up its two hundred and eighty are primitive enough those six or seven millions frankly absolutely savage who as the census puts it are not to be specified remaining as they do untouched by either the civilizations or religions with which they have come in contact six or seven millions whose very superstitions are their own monopoly some there were among these fisher folk of eshwara who like gugu were faintly leavened with latterday learning faintly amenable to latterday standards but ammas dull brain was satisfied with what it had inherited which included amongst other things sight hearing touch keen almost beyond belief so he opened his eyes at a sound which to an ordinary person would have been as inaudible as the swift coming of sunlight in the sky and his sight told him immediately what it was in detail a canoe was coming down the lagoon with two men in it now there was only one canoe in eshwara and that belonged to pundit ramanund he had been over the black water and learnt amongst a number of other strange new things which were of no use how to paddle a canoehis own or anothers for what good was a canoe when you did not know the sandbanks and how could you know the sandbanks unless you swam over them and dived down to them then if you could do that what was the good of a canoe an airbag or even an earthen pot under the pit of your stomach on which you could lie was sufficient for all practical purposes therefore one of the men amma knew must be ramanund the other by his turban was a mahomedan did he know the sandbanks amma shaded his eyes with one hand and watched to see evidently not the canoe stuck here there everywhere yet still came on slowly but if the occupants wantedas everybody seemed to want nowadaysto cross over to the other sidethat other side where the red brick headworks of the canal showed like a plinthto those strange new white tents where the lord was expected then they would find the navigation more intricate amma being conservative inevitably smiled at the certainty closed his eyes and went on fishing till he opened them again at a shout which way he echoed his voice sounding hollow from its nearness to the water by the deep stream always and which is that fool came roshans voice angrily where there is most water returned amma calmly cease from paddling and the canoe will tell you without fail such things know of themselves they are wise but we want to get over to the camp as quickly as we can said ramanund interrupting an impatient retort of roshan khans with an aside to the effect that they had better not alienate their only hope the river was lower than he had expected or he would never have suggested crossing in the boat as quicker than the bridge yet there was not time to go back amma smiled cunningly none will get quicker than he can my masters that much is certain being pleased with his own wit he laughed and kicking up his heels ducked his head to come up again a few yards nearer in shallower water where he could stand and salaam the noble people he said gravely must surely follow the stream if they go in company but if they will quit comfort and wade carrying their boat here and there i amma will show them but it is annoyance without going with the stream there is always annoyance it is better than going back or sticking still anyhow remarked roshan khan to his companion adding in hindustanithen come quickthere is room for thee and thy net and we will pay thee amma shook his head there is weight enough for difficulties without me my masters and here or there is one to a fisher so saying he closed his net with one dexterous twist slipped his arms through it so that it hung behind his back and struck across the shallows yonder is our aim he said briefly pointing to a blue thread of smoke rising from the waters edge a good way down stream they burn a dead man there today it is ever a good guide to the living twill be the brahmin lad the huzoors killed by mistake with their deepukrag didst hear the tale asked ramanund why he would have been puzzled to tell since he had no definite desire to foster illfeeling or fear but it had been the talk of the town till those small hours which end gossip even in india and the talk had confirmed the theory which so many of his kind hold firmly if vaguely that the mass of the people feel the english rule to be unjust but amma was not of the people he was of the six million and odd barbarians he turned showing his broad white teeth in a grin ay twas well done now as in old days folk will know who is true leader there was no doubt no fear in his mind had not his tribe always of old chosen as its chief and god the man who could hold a torch in each hand at arms length one lighted the other unlit and bid the flame pass from one to the other seven times and as for a mans life was it not always expedient that one should die for the people upon occasions ramanund frowned perhaps because amma concluded by ordering the crew out of the boat and the water was cold it could scarcely have been anything else which brought annoyance since he like most of his kind prided himself on being truly a british subject so paddling and pushing wading and even carrying they crossed from shallow to shallow from sandbank to sandbank led by amma swimming and diving like a duck or walking on ahead unconcernedly his eyes fixed in keensighted approval on that group close to the waters edge towards which he steered yet it was a gruesome group in truth which circled round that solitary and still more gruesome figure in the centre a figure squatting like the rest since when wood is dear funeral piles must be restricted in full view yet mercifully obscured for the most part by the heavy column of smoke which rose straight to a level with the leaping flames then tilting sideways before the intermittent breeze of early dawn drifted westward to hide those white tents upon the horizon above or below fool called ramanund sharply as they neared the shore i am no dom like thou to choose my way among dead mens bones the allusion to the semiaboriginal tribe who earn their livelihood by streaking the dead brought a frown this time to ammas face i am no dom either he retorted and were i one thou wouldst be glad of my guidance to the fire some day punditjee roshan khan listened with the wholehearted contempt of his race and creed be quick either way he said scornfully we have bare time as it is yet he also swerved from that gruesome group which as the twodressed as europeans save for their turbansstepped ashore and hurried off in the direction of the camp stood up in a linked semicircle to salaam then squatted again with a clank of leg irons amma his task over had paused in the deeper water and was once more sidling sedately the sun had risen with the inconceivable swiftness with which it rises from a deadlevel treeless plain and shone reddishyellow like a fire on his wet skin the shadow of that dense column of smoke sidled sedately on the water also shifting with the shifting spirals of the reality had he spilt blood asked amma suddenly as that something halfhidden in the smoke seemed to dissolve sending a great fountain of sparks bright even in the sunlight up into the air one in the semicircle clucked denial a jogithey say of gorakhnaths monasteryhad him for disciple and there was dhatoora in the sweetmeats for sure whether he was strangler god knows perhaps yet such travellers deserved poison who but a fool trusts a strange hand a big man at the end of the semicircle who had a sinister face despite his good conduct badge looked round hastily to where a little distance off the two jailwarders in charge were dividing a smoke on the sly with swift mysterious bubblings then lowered his voice ay none but fools and he a nod towards that thing in the centre which was now dying down to red embers pointed his meaning is the first not the last i gopi gosain say so let fools wait and see wise men will not there was a clank of leg irons as if some stirred uneasily thou canst talk murmured a voice when thy tucket ticket of leavegod knows how gotis so nigh gopi smiled comfortably ay tomorrow and the next day and the next then once more purification in the pool of immortality once more sanctification at the cradle of the gods he cast his eyes upwards unctuously like an eastern chadband so rehearsing the part of piety he meant to play once more on his release amma nodded his bodiless head cheerfully there will be no pool of immortality for the pilgrims this year so gorakhnath says the canal will drain the spring but then he is angry at being turned out of his gun the people will not give so muchthat is it the gosains face lowered at the news turned out who hath done it ammas eyes were closed for his feet had found likely ground he paused a second tensely alert he who comes he said suddenly the master as he spoke the quick thud followed by a lingering reverberation of the first saluting gun told that the viceroy of india was entering his camp the lord hath come said the circle of prisoners in awed tones all save gopi the gosain he sneered the lordsahib ay he may be thatbut the masterno amma gave a contented little chuckle he killed that anyhow he said nodding again and he hath the deepukrag is not that enough for poor folk then his feet feeling something far out of sight in the still deep waters came airwards and his head went down when it came up again the gang of prisoners were being filed back to gaol leaving the still glowing embers of what had been a man to send a clear blue smoke into the clear blue sky they have the deepukragthat is enough murmured the fisher to himself as he slid with the stream chapter vii the worlds desire the viceroys camp was no longer a city of dreams its silence had gone lost in that indefinable sense of sound which seems to come from the heartbeats even of unseen humanity and the whiteness the purity of it was stained and smirched by the scarletassin coatees of the innumerable orderlies who bustled about from tent to tent with huge files of references or lingered at the tent doors extorting shoemoney from the native visitors who came in shoals to plead for patronage from one or another of the bigwigs belonging to the hosts of the lordsahib groups of these petitioners awaiting their turn for an interview were to be seen at most tents but they stood in crowds round one in which the commissioner of the division was making the final arrangements for the coming durbar in consultation with the under secretary to supreme government it was a difficult task involving as it did the classification of the aristocracy plutocracy and democracy of india in one generally satisfactory courtguide it cannt be done in this wurrld remarked the commissioner in one of those suave plastic cork brogues which might be made of cork butter from the softness and lack of friction they bring to the english language an whats more the archangel gabriel couldnt do it in heaven though hed have a better chance for the cherubim wouldnt be wanting seats at all we are bound to displease somebody so lets cast lots before the lord its scriptural annyhow the under secretary looked a trifle shocked being unacquainted with the commissioners methods but we musthe began the others keen face looked up from the lists for a second of course we mustwe govern india practically by canebottomed chairs ye remember old gunning nobefore your time i expect well he kept two hundred miles of northwest frontier as quiet as the grave for five years by the simple expedient of awarding thirteen seats in his divisional durbar to each of his districts and only taking twelve chairs with him into camp the maliks you see never could tell which would be chosen odd man out an the fear of it kept em like sucking doves indeed remarked the under secretary fidgeting with his lists resignedly for he was under the impression that time was being lost im afraid that sort of thing wouldnt answer nowadays the elder man looked at him gravely just one short glance as he dipped his pen in the ink and went on writing revising referring not a bit of it theyd send down to whiteway laidlaws and get austrian bentwood chairs by value payable parcel post the teuton sir is ruinin british prestige by cheapenin the seats of the mighty there thats doneblock as beautiful entirely now for block b whos your favourite and why are you backing him once more the junior appeared a trifle shocked with reference to roshan khan he began his excellency desired me to ask whether it might not be possible to give him a step for being as it were in his own division he belongs to eshwara i believe the very reason why he cannt get an inch more than his due but you can tell h e that ive settled it ive asked dering to put him on duty an when he is in uniform theres no mistaking his place and then well ask him in to the reception afterwards with the sahib logue whos your nextdya ram what the little pleaderwhy the blazes should he come to durbarattorneys dont go to st james mr cox the member of parliamentperhaps you may remember him a little redhaired fellow was he who wrote a book about india on the back of his twomonthly return ticket mr cox is a man of great influence with his party and he supports dya rams pestilential little fool interrupted the commissioner impartially impersonally it wouldnt be bad thoughstop his scurrilous tongue for a bit favour does you know but i cannt see my way to it old hodinuggur would be refusing his atta and pan again he did it once ye know when some lowcaste fellow was within sight of him said he didnt eat with sweepers and if crawfordhe was commissioner at the time yes said the under secretary still more resignedly he had not yet grasped the fact that his coadjutor talked while he worked hadnt been six foot four and broad in proportion went on his tormentor imperturbably so that thelet us call them the subsequent negotiationsdiplomatic negotiationsit sounds welldidnt reach the eye of his honour the lieutenantgovernor the thakoorone of our best men let me tell youwould have got into troublemored have been the pity yes assented the man of secretariats but about dya ram dya ram is it now could we put him in under the head benevolence think you did he ever vaccinate a baby or breed a horse or give anything to a female hospital no then the devil fly off with him for complicating the problem of british rule in india why should he want to come to durbar at all when people change their dress they should change their desires but the only effect our civilization has upon some men i know is to make them want to keep their hat and their boots on at the same time well thats done ive found a place for him where hodinuggur cant see the tail end of him unless he squints nowwhos your next while this sort of thing was going on inside the tent dya ram and the thakoor of hodinuggur were in full view of each other outside it the former having scorned the sinful scarlet coatees even to the point of refusing to have his patent leather shoes dusted was walking up and down in english fashion the latter in a wonderful parcelgilt coach was awaiting the effect of his tenrupee tip with perfect patience and serenity while his retinue which consisted of a dozen ragged retainers carrying lances festooned with tinsel and yaks tails stared contemptuously at the two sentries pacing up and down below the flagstaff whoto tell truthseemed so monotonously part of the general show as to suggest that they also were under the charge of the two yellowlegged policemen who stood on either side of the rosebed it was high noon and the various departmental gongs had begun to give their version of the meridian with that unbiased disregard for that of their neighbours which makes the time of day an absolute uncertainty in a big camp but it was calling time evidently for two superb redcoats blazoned with gold appeared in company with two big books and a silver inkstand and disappeared with them into the durbar tent and shortly afterwards an aidedecamp sloped over to it yawning both dya ram and the thakoor knew that this meant preparation for those who having the entree to the government house had the right to put down their names in those big books but the fact itself affected their two types very differently the old rajputs visit of ceremony was of another sort he obeying definite orders would come at a specified time and get his specified salute with his compeers but dya ram was like the wild tribes in one way he was unspecified he was neither fish nor fowl flesh nor good red herring so as he watched a young englishman drive up in a bamboo cart dash into the tent and dash out again as if the place belonged to him he felt aggrieved he even went so far as to formulate his grievance in mental words and then these appeared to him so apposite to a leading article that he took out a notebook and after some corrections stored away for future use the assertion that the time will come when the colour of the hand which holds the pen will be no bar to its writing its name in the book of he did not feel sure of the qualitative noun and after trying fate fame life and lord left a blank instead meanwhile carriages and dogcarts all of sorts had begun to drive up their occupants disappearing into the tent for a second or two then coming out with the smile of the elect on their faces father ninian was one of the first resplendent in a new soutane and sash with akbar khan in his orderlys getup oscillating between a palsy of delighted servility and a catalepsy of dignity the one for his superiors the other for his equals and after a while in one of those mysteriously nondescript fourwheeled vehicles that defy classification but may be said to come under the head phitton phaeton of which mission people seem to have a monopoly came good mrs campbell and her niece erda shepherd the former full of indignant yet meek alarm because dr james having come across an old friend further down the avenue had bidden her go on and write his name as well as her own i ken weel how it will be she asserted to her niece for i havena brought my specs an a body cannot but be nervous with a young man in a scarlet coat glowering at them i shall put the doctor into the wrong book for you see i canna write the two names ane after the ither like a marriage lines for there is one big bookie for the women and one for the menfolk like a puseyite chapel ay an for the matter o that like a divorce courtand i soud never hear the last ot if i evened the doctor to myself let me do all three auntie said erda with a laugh as she got out of the carriage really theres no need for you to comeill be back in a minute the blaze of sunshine blinded her for the darkness of the tent and she could scarcely tell whose hand it was which stretched itself frankly eagerly for hers as she entered yet even through her glove she knew the touch before lance carlyons voice said joyfully come to write your name ive just written mine funny our hitting off the same time isnt it the tone of his voice joined to that startling recognition of his touchwhich she could not conceal from herselfmade her shrink as if from actual intrusion i have to write my uncles and aunts first she said coldly there was no use in us all coming in she walked on as she spoke to where the two books lay on a sort of lectern while the aidedecamp seeing the visitor was a lady came forward politely to assist not that book mansfield remarked lance coolly miss shepherd wantsmiss shepherd will you allow me to introduce captain mansfieldto write her uncles name first she looked back at him almost angrily full of resentment at his persistence but even in the semiblindness which was still hers his face showed too kind for that and as at that moment another lady came in with a flutter of laces and ribbons to appropriate captain mansfields ready services erda had to allow lance to find her a pen thats right now for the other book he said the aidedecamp had by this time gone to see the laces and ribbons back to their carriage so the two were alone your aunts first you know there was a suspicion of friendly chaff in his tone this time but it was gone in a minute as he went on quicklyerdmuthis that your name whyit means earthmoodoror worlds desire doesnt it she felt herself flush i did not know that you were such a german scholar she replied sarcastically yes my name is erdmuth dorothea i was called so afterafter some one you most likely know nothing about countess zinzendorf she was famous enough though she paused feeling savagely desirous of snubbing himbut i daresay you never even happened to hear of jean ziska mr carlyon he smiled suddenly broadly jean ziska he echoed rather we had a pony called ziska at homea hungarianused to eat thistles like a donkey he stopped to laugh and she was about to turn and rend him when he continued half apologetically of course i haveonly the name you see brought back such jolly old times ziska was the beggar who had his skin made into a drum when he was dead i dont expect its true but its a fine tale the drum ecclesiastic with a vengeance and no mistake oh but it is interrupted the girl forgetting her annoyance in her eagerness my grandfatherwe are really moravians you see and our name should be schaeffersaw it when he was a child he used to tell me that people said if it was beaten everybody must but lances attention had wandered he was looking at her signature with a curious almost wistful smile erdmuth he repeated thoughtfully then turned to her i say you really ought to come to the ball with that namedo he was simply she told herself the most distractingly irrelevant yet at the same time the most appallingly direct person she had ever come across really mr carlyon she began with such heat that the aidedecamp returning stared until lance coolly asked him if he didnt think miss shepherd very unkind not to come to the bachelors ball whereupon he having by this time had enough of laces and ribbons and begun to recognize a distinct charm in the glistening coils of hair halfhidden by a wide hat promptly asked her for the pleasure of a dance erda looked from one to the other aghast and to her own intense surprise fell back upon the womans allembracing excuse ii really havent a dress it seemed the simplest and easiest oh anything does for a fancy ball persisted lance argumentatively as he followed her out a tailor in the bazaar would run you up a greek dress in no time and it would do awfully well all white dont you know his voice slackened and grew soft as if he saw what he described and the sight made him gladall straight folds with a little edge of redgold like he paused then went on boldlylike the sunshine on your hair and redgold bracelets high up on your armsand a redgold apple in your handthe worlds desire he stopped abruptly with a quick catch in his breath startled at his own words and she too held her breath before the vision for she saw it also saw herself as he had described her and the glamour of it the desire of it assailed her body and soul yet she made a desperate a passionately resentful effort to ignore them i didnt know you were so well up in chiffons mr carlyon she said with a forced laugh did you ever think of setting up a milliners shop one is badly needed in eshwara but the glamour of it had come to lance carlyon like a revelation and the blood was leaping in his veins i will if you he began she scarcely recognized his voice in one way in another she knew it must be his for all the vitality and strength the singlemindedness and simplicity which she had seen in him so often were crowded into it brought into it by fancy concentrated by a mere suggestionof herself the magic of this seemed to encompass her she sought shelter from it recklessly i she interrupted i dont go in for that sort of thing mr carlyon you seem to forget my workwork which i value abovemilliners try mrs smiththere she is coming in her victoria she is one of the bestdressed women i ever saw she could not certainly have looked better than she did as seeing lance carlyon she called to him as her carriage drove up do you know where captain dering is he promised here lance with guilty haste interrupted her he was just about to drive over and give her a message dering had had a touch of fever he had been over at the palace arranging about the chinese lanterns for the decorations till late the evening before and he might have sent a little sooner put in mrs smith i have been waiting he said he would drive me in his dogcart there was no vexation only an almost pathetic surprise in her voice and lance looked guiltier still im awfully sorryits all my faulti was late to begin with and then he glanced at erda involuntarilycompromisingly it seemed to her i am afraid i kept mr carlyon she said haughtily most unwillingly i assure you thanks so much but i can get in quite well by myself as she drove off however her head was in a whirl and as when pausing to pick up dr campbell the whole panorama of the camp the hills behind it the distant temples of eshwara the busy placeseekers in the foreground the scarletsinstains of the chuprassies coats against the dazzling whiteness of the tents lay before her one of those rare incomprehensible moods came upon her when the soul retreats into its spiritual body so that the sight grows clear the touch keen and you can feel the round world spin beneath your feet see the shadow of earth stretching far among the stars the worlds desire what was it brought up to believe that the heart of manthat mainspring of the spinning worldwas vile she had never asked herself why this was so she had read the story of adam and eve with unquestioning faith yet never sought to know what had changed the good to evil but now as her eyes rested on those fardistant peaks with that faint mist about their feet hiding the cradle of the gods and followed as far as the eye could follow in the nearer hills the climbing track worn by the weariness of that eternal search after righteousness she asked herself what it was which kept mankind so long upon the road asked herself for the first time what that first sin had been which had lost paradise no lack of desire after salvation surely generation on generation of eastern pilgrims had worn that path out of the sheer rock had agonized after good and remained evil a little shudder of memory ran through her at the thoughthow evil and now the west with its white tents its white face its white creed had come to show a newer a better way had it but what had it done for itself she had worked for two years in london ere coming out to india and another shudder of memory swept over her of what she had seen there the worlds desire lance carlyon had called her thata woman with a redgold apple in her hand the sound of angry dispute brought her back to realities they were passing out of the camp under the triumphal arch and one of its sentries was barring the entrance of an ashsmeared figure which was brandishing a stamped petition paper as if it had been a card of admission and yelling excitedly for justice justice it is that pernicious fellow gorakhnath remarked dr campbell sententiously he wishes no doubt to appeal against captain derings order of which i for one am heartily glad a christian government is bound to refuse sanction to the practice of a faith which it is impossible not to see is degrading in the extreme to those who hold it erdas eyes were still clear clear with what those who do not see call dreams yet it seeks what we dopeaceforgivenessthe cradle of the goodness the innocence it left behindsomehow dr james campbell turned to her in dignified amazed displeasure may i ask what has caused thats easy tellin interrupted mrs campbell comfortably its yon hat with feathers when she is accustomed to a pith one an she standin in the sun talkin to mr carlyon its just got to the lassies head i was the same myself when i was young erda but dr james thought it a duty and so i do now my dear put in her husband it is a distinct duty on the part of mission workers to take every precaution and if her head is erdas weak point i shall warn david mrs campbell nodded hers and smiled and almost winked oh davie will take care of her never fear he is not a ninny erda flushed scarlet all over her face and neck it seemed to her as if she had forgotten her cousin the reverend david campbell altogether and yet she was engaged to be married to him as soon as he returned from a wellearned holiday in england a swift remorse left her pale again davie who was so much in earnest who looked to her asas that vision of a woman with a redgold edging to her white robe and a redgold apple in her hand came to send the blood to her face once more chapter viii falling stars the long durbar tent was packed from end to end with the canebottomed seats of the mighty and in each sat its appointed occupantpatient grave silent but in the two rows behind the viceroys still empty chair of state the englishmen in political dress or uniform who sat in the front and the englishwomen in the latest paris fashions who sat behind were talking and laughing in a perfectly wellbred way yet to the majority of those silent spectators at the expense of decency since a durbar is like a west indian ball not for talkee there was however no disapproval on those indifferent dark faces such things were part and parcel of that general eccentricity of the huzoors before which it behoved calmness to remain calm yet those same faces would have been quick to notice and resent the faintest breach of etiquette in regard to their own treatment or position those being correct the rest was immaterial and now the sudden strains from without of god save the queen sent those talking laughing rows to their feet silently with the proud alacrity so noticeable in india when the act is a confession of faith indeed but the mass beyond followed suit obediently with a starry shiver of diamondflash a milky way of pearlshine for eugene smiths electric light was working full power finally as if wafted on the full chords came a small man with that inevitable look of coming into church which englishmen consider dignity possibly because public worship is really the only function in which they are not inwardly ashamed of taking part the great gold chair the great gold footstool seemed all too large for everything about their occupant save the diamond star the ribbon on his breast yet in a way the scene gained by his inadequacy when after a decent pause a decent silence he rose small insignificant to give voice to empirein a strong scotch accent it must be admitted which equalled the commissioners irish one when its proper exponent the secretary having a cold he read a translation of the viceroys speech and his soft brogue ran riot among the clamorous persian vowels ai maharajahan rajahan nawaban wa sahiban alishan the diamonds and pearls sat too still for play so the electric light contented itself with the white teeth of englishwomen as they yawned but even these failed it when the speech ending that front row began its file past the civilians first the soldiers next a quick file a formal bow as a rule but every now and again a pause would come in the monotonous string of names for a few words from the viceroy and another bow ere the recipient passed on muriel smith who sat behindthe best dressed woman there as erda shepherd had judged herwatched her husbands tall gaunt figure approaching and wondered if that pause would come to him her heart beat so when it did that she could hear nothing except graciously pleased eminent services distinguished order but a whisper from her neighbor all right c s i not c i e left her sick and faint with relief even so her eyes instinctively sought vincent derings sympathy but he to her surprise was looking at the tall gaunt man whose face was a nunc dimittis in itself as he made his way back to his seat forgetful even of his wife but he had forgotten her amid a host of other things for three whole years forgotten them in a ceaseless effort an untiring energy and now that the necessity for this was over sleep and rest were his first thoughts he took both apparently in his chair while the commissioner causing this time a fresh flashing of jewels began on a fresh string of titles sri rajairajan furzundikhasmunsoorizamanmaharajdhirajrasakh and as they rolled on the atom of humanity belonging to themsomeone in faded brocade with ropes of illshaped pearls and uncut stones wound about him or a jauntier figure fresh and glittering from a calcutta jewellers shopwould be singled out by its political in charge like a sheep from a flock and guided dexterously to the exactly proper spot in the whole round world wherein obeisance and offering could be made with dignity to itself and the recipient then it would be swept on regardless of an invariable desire to break back in an endless circle to its seat while fresh titles rolled out and a fresh owner was hemmed in and swept forward for two whole mortal hours this and nothing but this with every now and again that pause for a few words translated now into irishurdu producing an expression as of a cat licking cream on a face as it was was hustled back blindly obedient as sheep are with a collie they know and trust so at last long after everyone even dya ramwho looked terribly disjointed between his frock coat white tie grey trousers and the gold mohur which he persisted in holding after native custom in his gloved right handhad passed the politicals gathered in a knot like churchwardens for the offertory plates and the distribution of atta and pan that sacrament of servitude and sovereignty began it too was exactly like an offertory that is a languid passing round of a plate by an official and yawns for the rest of the congregation finally with a vigour savouringlike a voluntaryof relief the band attacked god save the queen once more the viceroy retired the durbarees trooped out still calm and silent yet satisfied and the commissioner sinking into a vacant seat said thank the lord thats over without a hitch so indias safe for another six months at the cost of a trumpery title or two i dont see on what ground began the under secretary laboriously then ye dont read your bible didnt adam when he was given dominion over the lower animals begin by bestowing names on them ah my dear mrs smith i didnt know ye were so close a thousand congratulations my dear lady you dont mean it sir she interrupted laughing do you think i have forgotten the consolatory verses you wrote me last year when eugene didnt get anything you are a fraud not a bit of it only an irishman put in father ninian with an almost tender smile for the keen whimsical face which had been friend to him and foe to him for many a long year let us have the verses mrs smith say ye dont remember them theres a kind soul urged the commissioner persuasively but i do i dreamt and lo the stars fell from the sky to blaze upon the breasts of naughty men and as i wondered came this swift reply each star is some souls inmost aim and when the angels dont approve it is returned to feed the baseborn flame by which it burned the nice they keep untillifes struggle striven the owners find them at the gates of heaven strivenheaven groaned the commissioner amid the clapping of hands my dear madam did i commit such a crimei mean rhyme but the poets right ye cant go wide of the mark annyhow even in a song but youre sure to find the fact again in the heart of a friend so with that curiously lighthearted almost reckless frivolity of indian societya not unnatural recoil perhaps from the perpetual presence of the greatest social problem the world has ever seen or is likely to see that is the mutual assimilation of east and west without injury to eitherthe little company of english men and women empire makers and breakers drifted out into the sunshine and so on to the viceroys private enclosure where the band weary of national anthems was already at work on a selection of street tunes beginning with tommy make room for your uncle so the pageant of power passed into a gardenparty and nothing remained to show the handgrip which had made that garden out of a wilderness to tell of the tireless effort to solve the problem the ceaseless striving to be just which underlay all the quips and cranks the foibles and follies of the great camp save the premature baldness of a few heads as their owners fought desperately at badminton fought to prevent a childs shuttlecock from falling in the wrong court a fight which was watched with blank courtesy as a further exhibition of sheer eccentricity by those of the jewelled and brocaded owners of titles who had the entree to this holy of holies roshan khan howeverwho looked splendid in his uniformfought with the best and won too though laila bonaventura who played on his side stood still taking it is true the shots which came within reach dexterously enough but never stirring an inch for one beyond and as he played the curious chance which had brought him into her company made his blood run fast captain dering had bidden him join the set bidden him curtly almost savagely as the best player available in answer to a challenge from muriel smith to play her her husband and the commissioner and this challenge had come curtly also because captain dering was standing beside laila bonaventura to whom he had been giving a cup of coffee not because it gave him pleasure but from sheer determination not to let his mistake in the darkness count for anything yet as the girls hand took the cup from his he had remembered with a thrill the gladness the content it had brought him though he refused to acknowledge the fact the puzzle of this mistake had been his chief thought ever since it occurred and a smouldering resentment regarding his past relationship with one who was still to him the best and dearest of women was the result he felt vaguely that she as well as he ought to have known that their sentiment their monopoly as it were of friendship could only meanwhat it had meant to him during those few moments of blindness which had paradoxically opened his eyes so he had felt bitter and she had known it instinctively if she had ever faced facts this alone might have opened her eyes also but she was too good a woman too helplessly bound by her womans cult of love to disassociate it from friendship so without bringing a doubt even the jealous desire of appropriation which draws a line clear and clean as a swordcut between the two had risen up in her from the absence of the sympathetic look she had expected from vincent dering so she had challenged him and so it came to pass that roshan khan played badminton with laila bonaventura she took no notice of him beyond a casual inspection of his uniform still the mere fact of being her equal within the white lines which separated their badminton court from the realities of life seemed a fate when the game was over his eyes followed her closely and he himself at a respectful distance and as he followed her his desire to speak to her grew as he pondered on his right to do so after all as his grandmother had said she was his cousin and fate was on his side once more a wellbred crowding round a table where some photographs of the camp were being shown brought him so near her that she caught sight of his yellow silverlaced uniform behind her and turned quickly turned with a look in her big black eyes which dazzled him it vanished however in a second yet her words spoken with a faint resentment made the memory of the look give rise to a swift pulse of angry suspicion i thought you were captain dering she said why do you wear the same uniform i thought natives couldnt be officers the assumption in his present state of mind made all his fierce temper flash to his face but ere he could choose english words to express it she laughed and after her fashion when amused became confidential you are angry at being called a native but you are one arent you then it is so foolish you are like my guardian he cant bear the bazaar people to call me begumsahiba but they do sometimes you know because i own a lot of their houses and lands and my grandmother was a native princess i know that though my guardian never speaks about it he is ashamed i thinklike you are im not i didnt choose my grandmother why should one fuss about such things if theyre true it cant be helped and if theyre not what does it matter besides it must be rather nice to be a real begum you havent seen any of course they wouldnt let you would they that must be horrid how could you like people if you didnt see them besides she added with an access of demure pious conviction it would be wicked to marry them you know you should never marry anyone you dont love even the sisters told me that her voice had deepened broadened her eyes occupied with his uniform not his face had grown soft hitherto he had been too much at a loss before her sudden garrulity to interrupt now that vague suspicion recurred making him feel inclined to say brutally i am your cousin i claim you the very thought of her outraged face attracted him but english words were inadequate for such emotions so as he paused she went on as you are here i suppose youll be asked to the ball also it is to be in my palace you know because captain dering thinks it the best place he says the gardens will be beautiful all lit up she smiled as if at some secret mystery then continued of course i dont know yet i havent seen it but i think it will be lovely only i wish my dress was different i am beatricedantes beatriceand i think it stupid but my guardian chose it because she smiled again with the same secret amusementi dont know of course but i expect it is because my greatgrandmother went as beatrice to some ball long ago it is generally that i think he must have been in love with herisnt it funny laila came father ninians voice from behind i have been looking for you everywhere it is time to go his usually kind old face was stern he gave the curtest of recognitions to roshan khan and as he carried his ward off said sharply who introduced you to that native no one she replied indifferently i thought he was captain dering their uniforms she broke off to add with more animation i do like the gold and silver lace though of course the jewels like the rajahs wore look best he interrupted her in italian giving a quick gesture of dissent say not so cara mia they would look ill onon englishmen and listen child you should not speak to strangers and i would rather you did not speak to such natives at all theycannot understandquitefor they look on women differently from what we do lailas eyes narrowed sullenly very well guardian she said resignedly only i suppose they must know what their women are really likeandperhaps the native ladies prefer it the old man looked at her startled but said nothing when he had gone to find akbar khan and the carriage vincent dering seeing her alone came upso at least he told himselfout of sheer politeness to ask if she wanted anything yet something in her face sent him beyond mere courtesy at once something almost childishly apparent im afraid you havent been enjoying yourself he said kindly why not i thought it rather pleasant very pleasant she assented wearily only my guardian has been telling me not to do things and i dont know why but i always want to do them at oncedont you he could not actually deny the fact sometimes one has to pretend she raised her eyes to his blindingly he caught a glimpse in them of the lawless approval roshan khan had seen yet of something elsea lawless disdain why must one she asked i never mean to never if i want to do a thing ill do it i dont mean wicked things of course she returned here to demure almost plaintive pietyi dont want to do them and nothing can be wrong when it seems right to you and it is realever so real and you give yourself to it every bit of you without thinking andandask nothingnothing at all her vehemence her passionate assertion roused a quick response in him would you do that he asked his voice vibrating would youreally she smiled slowly of course i dont know she said i havent tried yet but i never pretend i dont even pretend to like my dress for the ball it is so stupid he felt annoyed at being led into a burst of emotion and then baulked you will look charming im sure he said in his worst manner and if you dont like it change to something jolly after supper lots of people do will mrs smith she asked quickly he flushed angrily i really dont know he began her eyes were on him curiously thats funny she said i thought peoplenot that it matters she went on for i cant i havent a dress do you know i never have anything i really likenever the girls voice was absolutely touching in its listless dull confidence and he could not help consolation youll have the ball im sure you will enjoy it awfully andand you mustnt forget that youve given me the second waltz and the first extra after supper she did not answer for a moment have i she asked i didnt know it but i will that will be nice and you are coming to decorate tomorrow arent you that will be nice too her tone lingered in his ears long after she had gone it was with him even when he was driving mrs smith home and of course making up their little misunderstanding by the way possibly because of this making up since for the first time the elaborate eclaircissement irked him it seemed so unnecessary unless the whole affair meant something which was quite out of the question for instance when driving lance carlyon back to the fort afterwards he did not desire an explanation of the latters moodiness when a chum was evildispositioned you waited calmly for him to come round that was friendship im sorry miss shepherd couldnt come said lance suddenly his eyes on that spit of sand with its hovels and logs below the town i wanted her to awfully if only because shes never seen a durbar buthe smiledi expect someone else wanted her instead by george dering you dont know how that girl works sometimes i feel its a shame and sometimes i think its splendidthough of course it dont matter a dash what i think and thatvincent dering asked himselfwas that love laila bonaventuras voice came back to make him certain of one thing that would not be her version of the old old story and the knowledge made him somehow more content with his world meanwhile another man in yellow and silver lace was being haunted by a girls voice which had spoken of things which no decent woman of his own race would have mentioned yet which had spoken to him with an equality which no englishwoman would have allowed herself and as for englishmen the recollection of father narayans face as he carried the girl off made roshan khan curse under his breath but the girl herself had been different he literally did not know what to think and the desire for someone elses opinion grew so strong that finally with a curious mixture of reluctance and triumph he forsook the straight road to the fort and turned his horses head towards his grandmothers house she was at least a woman she might understand and judge better than he his first sight of her however in unprepared toilette minus the green satin trousers which gave such dignity to her rotund little figure minus all pretence at pomp dirty untidy unkempt both in her surroundings and herself made him feel what a fool he was the more so when she began by resenting his summary visitation especially in uniform which she asserted made her feel even at her age as if she were committing the indiscretion of seeing a stranger what could a woman like that know yet having come he might as well go through with his errand so he cut short her upbraidings by saying without preamble i have seen my cousin i spoke to her andand she spoke back again mumtaza mahal looked at him for a moment incredulously then she cracked all her finger joints over his head or as nearly over it as her height would allow said i not so she asked prophetically and when will the wedding be wedding he echoed petulantly there is no talk of wedding i have but seen her but seen her echoed the old lady in her turn that came after in my time but god knows how things go nowadays then what didst speak about he had to give a bowdlerized version of what had passed yet even so mumtaza mahal looked shocked a bold hussy but thou wilt bit and bridle her he burst out angrilyfor his own recital had shown him the folly of castlebuilding on so slight a foundationi am a fool he said and so art thou for all thy years her little black eyes flashed angrily not i did she not say she would like to be a begum and if that means not and could i make her one he interrupted fiercely ia risaldar on a bare pittancewith no prospect of rising dost dream me nawab fool the old ladys face grew cunning in a second the instinctive love of intrigue roused by the mere suggestion she leant towards him eagerly and wherefore not roshan are all things fixed do rulers never change i live here in a corner nothing but a poor woman yet i hear more it seems than thou dost i hear of discontent of desires of things that call for change but today they spoke of men being killed to make light for these infidels and gorakhnath jogi hath sworn a miracle he turned on her with a bitter reckless laugh is that new is there not always talk the wise listen not a vast importance a real dignity came to her in an instant if the huzoors had listened to such talk in a thrill ran through him the thrill of secret curiosity almost of expectation regarding the great rebellion from which so many things date which young india always feels in the presence of their elders who passed through it thou dost know of course he said catching his breath thou canst remember ay she replied sternly and there was no more talk than there is now tis not a question of words it is fate something happens and thenthen the risaldar may be nawabas his fathers were she had gone too far and recalled him to himself then let us await the happening he said curtly wait echoed the old lady reverting to the main point thou canst not wait having gone so far the negotiations cannot drop thou must send the gift and see what comes of it a gift he repeated what gift and wherefore mumtaza mahal looked round as if for approval tucked a packet of pan into her cheek and chuckled she was on familiar ground now leave that to me i know what girls like i have them still ay a dress that her grandmother woregood as new being for a tall womanand jewels tis no harm at least see you since if they like it not the gift is returned he stood doubtful half pleased half shocked at the suggestion she could certainly send the things back and he had many a time seen english women wearing native jewelry ay and decorating their rooms with native dresses and he could write that they were from her cousin and servant that would be easier than telling chapter ix out of the past i feel as if i had this moment arrived said muriel smith as she looked down into the garden from a balcony which jutted out upon one side of the wide flight of marble steps that led upwards to the loggia of the palace yet i know ive been here for hours i wonder when the sheer beauty will cease toto take my breath away you understand dont you yes assented vincent dering half grudgingly he would rather not have understood more than others but he did that was the worst of it he was looking his best in the old cavalry uniform of grey and silver and cherry colour all laced embroidered and glittering with epaulettes sabretasche and high stockthe uniform of a hundred years ago when adventurers ruled half india and englishmen were demigods it seemed to have brought something of their pride and recklessness something of the dreams they dreamt into his whole bearing as he stood leaning over the balustrade gazing fixedly at the scene before him it was beautiful indeed beautiful with that unearthly stillness which only comes to illuminations in a windless indian night the lines on lines the curves on curves of tiny lights which outlined each pillar and arch each buttress and recess of the palace the battlemented wall of the garden and the turreted town rising above it were steady as the stars the fine fret of the acacia trees showing white against the purple of the sky was still as if carved in stone there was no flicker in the soft radiance which made the solid marble seem translucent illumined mysteriously from within the very shadows slept such scented shadows clinging to the burnished orange trees hidden in the wilderness of roses dreaming on the perfumed cushions of the quaint balconies and cupolas which overhung the river but it did not sleep it moved sliding on and on ceaselessly so did the water which dimpled and tinkledafter heaven only knew how many sad years of silence and decorumover the fretted marble waterslides how it laughed and babbled to the cunning coloured lights placed behind it and the fountains below rising out of the watermazewhere there was but room for the flying feet of a laughing girl on the marble ledges between the lotusleaveslaughed and tinkled also as they sent showers of diamonds back on the pale blossoms the jewel in the lotus indeed there was no colour to be seen anywhere only that soft steady white radiance those soft sleeping black shadows except in the drifting watermaze and the drifting men and women around it restless both of them going on and on whither and wherefore it was an idle question vincent told himself if the move brought as it did here fresh laughter fresh colour on such a night did young lorenzo quoted the commissioners brogue from the flight of steps where in the guise of a french cook he was fanning laila bonaventura with whom he had been dancing the latter sitting still and silent as the shadow in which she was half hidden a crackling laugh betrayed dr dillons whereabouts he was perched on a balustrade above his legs dangling his trousers as usual displaying his thin ankles for he was dressed in his ordinary evening suit and old lorenzo also he scoffed the disease is nonprotective contagious and marked by extraordinary vitality in the virus which after long years may spring to fresh life from a dress a bit of ribbon a lock of hair oh have done with such blasphemy interrupted the commissioner joyously and me racking me brains which of all the beauties of this hareem id better fall in love with dering youre a steward i believe turn that man out for obtruding the exigencies of everyday lifeincluding a swallowtail coatinto paradise ive objected already sir said vincent dering laughing but he declares he is a malarial bacillus a what remonstrated the brogue a malarial bacillus sir explained the doctor as i have failed hithertolike everybody elseto recognize the gentleman even through a microscope i am naturally at sea as to the proper costume and you will of course admit the universal rule when in doubt play a dress suit by jove ejaculated lance carlyon who mopping his face had joined the group what a ripping idea wish id thought of it instead of this kit he looked regretfully at his mailed limbs for he was dressed as lancelotdulac a costume which had been chosen for him two years before at simla by a grass widow who had aspired to the part of guinevere but who retiring before the young fellows absolute unconsciousness of her intention had left him saddled with an expensive fancy dress which he felt bound to wear out for all his spare cash was kept for guns and polo ponies im glad you didnt mr carlyon protested muriel smith consolingly you look very nice in it only those things on your legsi forget the proper namemust be difficult to dance in greavesthe wellgreaved greeks me dear madam put in the commissioner plural of grief ah ye should have seen him come to it just now with the generals wife your chance of promotions gone me dear boythe marble floor resounded well it isnt half so inconvenient as my husbands dress anyhow continued mrs smith persisting in her mission of sympathy when the laugh at lances expense had subsided thats all you know my dear remonstrated mr smith sleepily from a quiet nook in one corner i never said robinson crusoe was a good dancing dress but i claim it isnt bad to sleep in especially out of doors soft and furryand his voice sank into dreamful ease and it can claim solitude anyhow added the doctor mournfully think of the disgust of an old established microbe like myself when his swept and garnished home is invaded by a party of seven strange devils how rude you are exclaimed mrs smith besides we arent seven and i believe robinson crusoe discovered this island before you did i think the french cook takes the cake though said poor lance who had been following up his own grievance shirt sleeves must be an awful pull when you are dancing with a burra mem true for you assented the commissioner sympathetically thats the very reason i took to it me dear boy when me own merits and me advancing years doomed me to all the stout ladies in india besides me paper cap rids me of two of me reports anyhow ye see i always have to wear two caps one before and one after supper otherwise i find the contints get mixed and make me statements unreliable and then me enemies say its the champagne i feel it coming on me now but he sprang to his feet light as a boyby a merciful providence theres the band at the roast beef now are ye coming in to supper with me mrs smith or are you one of those who have to change their identity not i she declared taking his arm im quite content with myself thank you she might well be since her costume of waternymph could not have been improved upon it enabled her to show off her long rippling pale gold hair and the filmy green and white the feathery weeds the iridescent shells matched her delicate face which seemed almost overweighted by her waterlily crown besides undine can always do quickchange artist and assume a soul suggested the commissioner as he led her off adding in mock alarm me dear madam i apologize profoundly miss bonaventura captain derings waiting for you im sure laila who had risen also stood silent looking taller and slimmer than usual in her guise of beatrice it seemed to have brought out the fact that she had some of the best blood of italy in her veins vincent dering had recognized this factwhich father ninian had taken care to communicate to him as soon as the latter had found out that nominally at any rate the former was a roman catholic and therefore a possible loverwhen he had gone up to apologize to the girl for having missed that second dance owing to his duties as steward the recognition had him vaguely sorry for the girl sorry also for the old man who evidently dreamt such idle dreams he did not mean to marry a begum he crossed over to her now offering his arm but she refused it saying she did not want supper but you are enjoying yourself surely he said oh yes thank you she answered only it isnt real of course it doesnt mean anything dr dillon who was within hearing looked down at her sharply perhaps my dear young lady it is as well it doesnt so let us eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die she looked up at him quite shocked oh i didnt mean that of course that is wrong i only meant that things dont matchthe place and the people i mean except one or twothose for instance she pointed out roshan khan who dressed as himself was taking advantage of the emptiness of the garden during supper time to go round it with old akbar khan as guide the latter in the wildest antics of alacrity did you ever see such a funny figure continued the girl with an odd little laugh he is quite crazy with joy he told me today this was the first time for forty years that he had been himself that he has been bewitched i believe ive been bewitched too said vincent suddenly let us all go back forty years dr dillon swung his feet further over and dropped to the ground almost between them that would effectually annihilate two of the company and reduce me to cutting my teeth and i want the use of them at supper come along and have something solid miss bonaventura there is nothing so indigestible as fancy sweets but she was firm and moved away to where a small staircase led from the balcony to the upper storey she did not care for supper she repeated and she had to mend her dress someone had trodden on it and she would not be able to dance till it was mended dont forget oursthe first extra called vincent after her she turned where the narrow stair after climbing the outside wall against which it clung like a swallows nest ended in the shadow of an archway i shall be back in plenty of time she said vincent thought he had never seen her look so nice so young so fresh so smiling thats a queer girl remarked the doctor as he lounged off not half bad that is just it in fact she is a clear case of atavism and as her ancestors seem to have been either saints or sinners there you are for its the same tissue absolutely indeed theres precious little difference between the two when you come to analyze i never do interrupted vincent shortly the doctors cynicism bored him especially here where a man might at least be allowed to escape the brutal realities here where even the houses in the bazaar beyond the garden wallthose houses that were by the common light of day so squalid so unsavoury so full of mean miserable detailshowed like starpalaces against the sky a sudden comprehension came to him how blind of the girl to say all this meant nothing how crassly idiotic of himself to think of going back forty years to enjoy this this was the same yesterday today for ever it was the love of physical pleasure the desire to appropriate to have and to hold which had civilized the world and made man out of a monkey the cradle of the gods did you say my dear lady said a courteous old voice from the stairs breaking in on his solitude just sothe pilgrims go there every year it lieslet me seei think i can point it out to you ah captain dering continued father ninian finding the balcony into which he had stepped en passant occupied we dont disturb you i hope but mrs palmer was speaking about the cradle of the gods it must liedont you think soover there he pointed beyond the starpalaces i should fancy so sir replied vincent that is about due north then i am wrong smiled the old priest the cave is northwest and the passage to it is difficultalmost incredibly difficult yet you have been there several times havent you said mrs palmer father ninian shook his head never to the cave itself madam i am not quite sure whether i ever really meant to go so farand bow in the house of rimmon it would have been interesting no doubtbut he glanced down almost boyishly at his black soutanemy cloth my dear lady has to be considered as a matter of fact something always hindered me i went as a medicine man you see and so many fall by the wayside i wonder indeed how any reach it he paused and a wistful smile made his face look dreamy some say none do a jogigorakhnath captain deringhe whom you turned out of the gunclaims to be the only man who has ever seen the real cave the rest have seenillusion he paused again and his smile changed tis a claim madam made by more than gorakhnath who by the way promises to defy you captain dering padlock or no padlock he is to get in and out of the gun as he chooses while the pilgrims are here vincent laughed contemptuously i dont think miracles go down even in india nowadays sir the old priests face grew grave i cannot give my assent to that i who have seen the blood of a saint turn crimson and flow faith captain deringthat is the belief of man in a power beyond his ownis the same yesterday today and for ever vincent dering bowed politely and kept his shrug of the shoulders for the old mans back as he followed him upstairs to the supper room the same yesterday today for ever true in a way there were two stabilities amid the chances and changes of this mortal life the garden of the palace the cradle of the gods faith and lovefor it came to that in the end here the familiar sight of a ball supper in full swing ended his rare reflections and he slipped into a place beside a lively vivandiere who welcomed him with entreaties to join in a comic opera she was going to get up at simla the last new rage in london she had written home for the rights he was in a new atmosphere in a moment and straightway forgot the garden forgot everything but that the supper was excellent his companion gay even the commissioners high voice as he talked nonsense seemed far from the gravity even of conferring titles and it seemed incredible that the small man who sat surrounded by a host of departmental heads was really representing a whole empire when the band downstairs by beginning on strausss lovelong livelong day warned him of his engagement to laila he passed to it half reluctantly she would be sure to dance badly that make of girl always did so he was relieved to find the ball room and the wide loggia into which it opened almost empty only a couple or two were spinning slowly idly in and out of the resounding arches he went on therefore to the balcony beside the stairs if the girl was there it would be an excuse for sitting out if not he could always say he had waited for her either way he would have time for a cigarette as he went down towards it he met lance carlyon coming up and called to him suppers a sos the wine its going awfully well isnt it suppose so replied lance but im going to cut these togs are awful but if i go now ill have time to change and have a shoot down the river amma says the ducks sit like stones before dawn they wont miss me as a bachelor i suppose vincent looked at him compassionately a bachelor he echoed its about your last chance i take it however if you want to kill somethingits a common symptomgo i shall stop till the bitteror sweetend one doesnt get into a streak like this once in a blue moon i feel fit for anything as he sat down for a smoke in the corner vacated by robinson crusoe this feeling was strong upon him and sent the blood tingling to his fingertips the band had by this time ceased piping to unwilling dancers so the still warm scented air was left to the tinkling ripple of the water the rippling tinkle of distant voices for supper had almost emptied the garden also the better for its picturesque effect now the imagination could people itas laila bonaventura the girl had sense had phrased itwith figures that matched real figures a chiming silvery clash above him made him turn to look upwards to the archway where laila bonaventura had disappeared it would be a bore if she were returning to interrupt his cigarette though in truth she had been he remembered almost attractive almost he gave an exclamation and rose to his feet she was coming indeed but not as she had gone there is no dress in the world which is at once so dainty and so sensuous as the court dress of a mahomedan lady and laila bonaventura was wearing one as she came slowly down the stairs towards him a radiant white figure against the radiant white marble the folds of her long silvergauze skirtso cunningly fashioned that it trailed in rolling shimmercrested billows behind her yet left no beauty of her round limbs hiddenclipped her about the waist like a serpents skin so hiding yet revealing was the soft film of fine muslin over the scented ivorytinted corselet which fitted close to the full curves of her figure so was it with the silverstreaked veil through which the jewels in her dusky hair the bracelets on her fair arms shone undimmed so was it even with the chiming fringes of her silver anklets as they slid merrily to cover and uncover the small feet tucked so carelessly into the little silvertipped slippers to hide and to reveal that was the note of all as she came nearer too he saw that her lips were reddened her dark eyes darkened artificially and yet her face did not correspond to all this it was curiously grave dignified almost anxious do you like it she asked suddenly pausing a pace or two from him to stand still heaped round by those shimmercrested billows and so with one hand gather the straight folds of her veil to curves over her arm as she did so he saw with a curious throb at his heart that her wrists were fettered to each other by long trailing chains of scented jasmine flowers a dainty prisoning indeed the suggestion of it set his head whirling like ithis very admiration kept him silent it makes it feel more real she went on dont you think it does real or a dream he did not know which he felt a fool to stand so silent yet no wordsas she would phrase itcame to match none at least that he dare use to her unconscious dignity only i cant dance you see she continued bending to look at the billows about her feet besidesshe looked up suddenly her whole expression changed she flung her fettered hands forward almost into his face the strings on strings of scented flowers looping themselves in ever widening curves hung like a screen between him and her laughter im a prisoneryours i suppose he fell back for half a second then caught the hand in his and then in an instant it came back to himthe measureless glad content of that mistake in the dark he had told himself ever since that it had come then by mistakeincomprehensible it is true horrible to a certain extent but still in error but this was no mistake yesmy prisoner he said come and sit down and let us talk he wanted time to think she shook her head not here please no one is to see me but you only you that is why i waited till i saw you were alone i only put it on for you to see a sudden remembrance of something she had said to himwhen it is real and you give yourselfeverything and ask nothing the certainty that she was doing this now made him say quickly dont be afraidthey shall not see come let us go into the gardenthose balconies by the river she shook her head again they are not safe and my guardian would be so angry though it isnt really wrongshe added with her odd vein of piety but when somebody sent me the dress i thought it would be fun and i wanted you to see sent you the dress he echoed hotly who she looked at him vastly amused are you jealous but im not going to tell you that is just like the novels isnt it but what is the use of making people angry how do you know i should be angry he asked coldly she smiled like a sphinx might smile im certain come perhaps ill tell you when we get to a safe place theres one close by my guardian wouldnt have it lit up becausehe always has the same reason for everything you know and it is so dullbecause something happened there long ago as if it mattered as she spoke they had been passing down the marble steps her silver anklets chiming and now as they paused an instant on the edge of the watermaze they chimed still but to a new curiously provocative measure and her face her figure her very voice changed as if to keep time with it i used to run all over it in and out when i was little she chattered mischievously and old akbar used to run after me and tumble in i could do it now and you could chase me if i hadnt all this she gave a little mutinous kick at her sweeping skirt then suddenly she laughed poor old akbar id like him to see me but i dont see how it could be managed and nobody else mustbut you so comecome quick she drew him after her by one hand like a child at play across the marble plinth right to the wide arched passage in the lower storey and when having gained in the race he would from habit have gone straight on towards the courtyard she pulled him back with a peal of laughter not that way stupid hereits a dear little balcony all by itself with steps down to the river and a boat perfect he exclaimed with an answering laugh as he disappeared after her but in that instants pause two figures had passed into the other end of the long passage from the chapel two figures one of which halfdisdainfully halfregretfully had been going round the beauties of the palace the other gambolling sideways by reason of its curbing deference its urging servility engaged in garrulous tales of past glory yea gereebpunwaz it was saying bunavatar used to meet anari begum here she liked him best in uniform and she wore it was then that framed in the distant archway seen clear against the radiance of the garden that vision of a laughing girl a flashing uniform appeared old akbar khan gave a faint mumbling petition to be preserved and fell back his teeth chattering anaranarherself he muttered and hegod help us all why did they light up the garden but roshan khan knew better his eyes were younger and he had the keythe key of that shimmering silver dress fool he said sharply they are no ghosts twas deringsahib andand he gave a bitter laughone of his mems they do such things often but as he walked on his hands clenched themselves to the tune of the words which sang in his brain god smite his soul to hell god smite his soul to hell the two great stabilities love of god and love of woman had joined hands as they always do a formidable combination chapter x the pivots of life lance carlyon was not as a rule given either to loss of spirits or temper yet both were at vanishingpoint as he flung off the garb of his namesake of the lake swearing as he did so that he would never wear the blessed thing again it cramped him all over body and soul and thenfor he knew his tennyson well as one of his name could hardly fail to dohis memory raced swiftly over the loveloyal knights career until suddenly he laughed at a phrase which had always tickled him so groaned sir lancelotnot knowing he should die a holy man if he hadwhat would have been the result would he simply have refrained from remorseful pain or from the honour rooted in dishonour which caused it with a mighty stretch of his sound young muscles at the relief lance caught up his indian clubs and went elaborately conscientiously through his daily series of exercises before putting on his dustcoloured shootingsuit and swathing himself with the necessary plentitude of belts cartridgeboxes and gaiters the latterbeing after indian fashion simply a couple of bandages neatly twinedwere as a matter of fact much tighter than his discarded greaves but the clip of them about his calves was familiarly reminiscent of many a day spent out in the jungle alone or at most with some companion of ammas type a man whose only claim to be called one in these later days was his undoubted dominion over the birds of the air the fish of the sea the beasts of the field how jolly it had been and how the deuce could a fellow like vincent dering lance sorting cartridges systematically with an eye to a possible snipe whistled a tune which vincent was always asked to sing at the smiths sweet is true loveand sweet is death well he preferred the death so catching up his gun he made his way to the cryptlike flight of steps which half way down the straight riveredged wall of the fortbetween its northern bastion where the stream turned hillwards at a sharp angle and the southern one beside the bathingstepsled to a tiny landingstage here the canoe which he had hired for such excursions from ramanund whose last experience of boating had rather sickened him of its pleasures lay moored keeping the paddle ready for steering he let the stream which here clung swift and smooth to the wall take him with it partly because he had no wish to be seen by any revellers in the palace but the sight of the latter made him slip the paddleblade into the sliding water and send the canoe swerving out for a better view it was wondrously beautiful seen from the river with every line and curve of light reflected almost as clear as the reality the sight held his attention so that he was abreast of the bathingsteps ere he remembered his desire for secrecy and in his haste the canoeanswering to his swift strokealmost spun round bringing him in an instant within an ace of collision with the hard brick as it was he heard a faint grating sound by jove that was a near shave he muttered to himself out of the darkness of the courtyard for the unilluminated block of the palace rose between it and the white radiance came a voice ist thou hast brought the toolwe must get the job done ere dawn and the rest was inaudible as the river slid him on what were they up to he wondered idly taking advantage doubtless of the absolute desertion of the courtyard the entry to which had been blocked for the night the main entrance to the palace having been prepared for the reception of the guests were they meddling with the padlock dering had put on the tampion which stopped the muzzle of the old gun time to see to that in the morning he was now steering his way just on the edge of the shadow cast by the wall on the water and in front of him jutted out a balcony smaller than the rest and nearer the river those upper ones he knew were part of the chapel but this he looked at it narrowly wondering if he had ever noticed it before then let the paddle sink idly across the boat and sat staring at what he saw dering of course but the woman who on earth was she a native hardly and yet he did not remember seeing anyone at the ball whose dress was in the least like this even in the dark it glittered do you call that love came a voice echoing softly over the water i dont when i love i mean to give not to take and the more i give the more ill have to give because you see love will come backit must by all that was incomprehensible laila bonaventura and if there was any certainty in these shadows derings arm phew lance knew his shakespeare also had in fact a curiously ingenuous and human acquaintance with even the exact words of the great master so as he drifted on leaving those two in the balcony a line drifted with him she whom i love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow the other did not so he felt a righteous relief at the idea for he was eminently virtuous poor old vincent this was better than the otherhe paused doubtfullywell different people had different tastes he for instance had never admired mrs smith and then dering good chap as he was had everybody knew a touch of the tarbrush himself only a touch still it made a difference for one had to consider the children for instance when he marriedwhy a vision of a childs head he had once seen far away in the north covered with soft waving curls of sunbright redgold hair chestnutyes chestnut hair the very colour of that beast of a pony who boshed him at poloshould have come to him at that moment he did not know but he fled from it bashful as any girl over her first fancy and bending forward sent the canoe racing the foambubbles on the swifter current with all the strength of his young arms that was the mission house ending the long curve of the city the mission house where she sleptthe boat raced harder herewhere she lived in the thick of itgod bless her here the boat slackened partly because the spit was reached and in the darkness made visible by that soft white radiance behind him he must not miss ammas hut amma who had dominion over wild duck among other things in that munificent gift of the creator to his own image amma who must come out and show those who had fallen from their high estate through civilization how to lure the birds to their death sweet is true love though given in vain and sweet is death which puts an end to pain the refrain came back in this connection and lances voice as he sang it if not musical held a hint of something beyond the mere maudlin expressionstop of the ordinary songsinger he need not he told himself have feared to overlook ammas wigwam for there not far from the point of the spit it stood all lit up circled round closely with a row of little lights like those at the palace were the primitive folk down here aping their masters and having a ball of their own smiling at the thought he ran the canoe on shore and walked up to the reed hut then he saw that the circle of lights was broken by a dark patch it was amma himself squatting on his heels to one side of him firmly fixed in the sand was a freshlykilled crocodiles head its jaws ingeniously distended by a thin cane to which a string was attached by pulling this the dead mouth seemed to open and shut as the pliant rattan bent under the strain and sprang back again in his other hand he held a bloody spear despite these fearful preparations however the first glimpse of an approaching figure set him visibly trembling with fright until on its coming nearer the lights he sprang to his feet with a sudden blubbering shout of relief i thoughtthis fool this atom of dust thoughtthe huzoor was the devil he explained capering and chuckling to make much of the joke now that the fear of its being a reality was over the devil echoed lance what the dickens should the devil come here for amma looked halfgrave halfimportant did not the huzoor know he explained that when life was coming into the world all the demons in it wanted to get hold of the newborn thing hence the lights hence the crocodiles head and the spear also his own valiance hence also the impossibility of his accompanying the presence after duck if he the father of the thing to be born was not there to fight the demons what hope could there be for the sonand here this quaint broad ugly face grew wistfulfor it must be a son surely this time no he had no children the demons had taken them all every one though he had left nothing undone though he had sought out one medicineman after another what did it matter he asked pathetically if the charm were of one faith or another if it brought a child he had tried all his own and everybody elses but they all died the children girls and boys died when they were born the demon somehow slipped through the lights the charm was not strong enough that was all so this time when he had seen that the huzoors had the deepukrag the sign of kings that they were indeed lightbringers as his people had been of old he had sent for the misssahiba and she had come she was there in the hut even now fighting the demons lance gave a quick catch of his breath and stood silent right over the miserable reed hut clear against the violet of the moonless sky rose those palaces of stars lit up for pleasure it almost seemed to him that the slight breeze which was beginning to whisper of the dawn held in it the faint rhythm of a distant waltz and here at his feet was this hut lit up for pain he heard that also in a faint moan which sent a shiver through him the shiver of one who finds himself bare of accustomed covering out in the open far from any shelter from the cold sky of course you cant come amma he said moving off well i hope the misssahiba willwill keep the devil away iiexpect she will as he floated a little further down stream vaguely obeying the instructions which amma regretful for all his anxiety had shouted after him he told himself that if anybody could she would if a fellow married her for instance he drew the canoe on to the sandbank amma had spoken of somewhat sooner than his directions warranted in order to stifle thought by action and it needed every sense on the alert to tell in the darkness if one was keeping a fairly straight path that scarcely audible lip lip on the right meant that the water was close by running an inch or two below a sheer yet crumbling edge of earth that yielding softness on the left meant the ridge of dry sand his way was between the two every now and again a watchful quack a distant flutter told him that the ducks were not far off and in the east the faintest lightening of the purple warned him he was none too soon since the dawn in india comes quickly but this must be the place a sort of bunker right at the end of the bank here cuddling down almost luxuriously into loose dry sand still warm from yesterdays sun he waited for that hint of light in the far east to grow strong enough for him to see it is always an experience to sit and wait for daylight ignorant helpless till it comes of what lies close at hand lance carlyon crouching in that still warm sand felt a sudden forlornness a sense of having parted with something but almost on the heels of this came a sense of having found something of strange quick new yet familiar companionship it seemed to him as he watched that faint grey lightening in the far east that he did so not as lance carlyon but as an atom in the great round spinning world whose curved edge grew darker against the coming light he laid his gun beside him and kneeling in the soft still warm sand rested his arms on the edge of the bunker ears and eyes alert as any wild creatures he could hear the soft rustle of feathers in the dark the soft swish of the water as something stirred in it the soft sob with which an inch or two of that tiny unseen sandcliff gave way to the stream the softer gurgle as of laughter with which the water took its toll of earth so thinking not at all simply as a sand grain in the sand around him the mystery the certainty of dawn held him as it held all things the curved line of the world darkened the shadow of it deepened as the grey of the sky grew tender as the eye of a mother watching her child asleep but only for a space then the grey hardened and a trumpet call from a whistling teal told that the great fight of dawn had come so for another space the dark and the light faced each other waiting for that second trumpet call it came borne on a faint rustle of wind which crept over the edge of the world from the footsteps of the coming day the shiver of it swept through the shadows they broke into battalions to face the foe so into companies till as the red spearpoints of the sun showed over the horizon they rallied darkly desperately behind each hint of rising ground in each hint of sheltering hollow rallied in vain for below the spearpoints a glittering curve as of a golden helmet came resistless then lance carlyon stood up hastily gun in hand but he was too late the mystery of dawn had held him helpless as it had held the birds and now they too were freemen of the conquering day he fired a couple of shots after them more as a salute to the victor than in any hope of slaughter so with a laugh turned homeward the canoe shot against the stream gaily but as he neared the spit a sudden desire to go home by land assailed him amma could take the boat back there might be a chance of a snipe in that lowlying bit below the mission house and he blushed even in solitude at his own moral turpitude why not tell the truth to himself at least he found amma worn out by his nights anxiety with his head between his knees fast asleep leaving the crocodile at the agony point of an unending yawn in sole charge of the little circle of flickering lights some of them had gone out the rest looked trumpery in the growing blaze of day but what matter since half an hour before erda shepherd had come out of the wigwam with a living child wrapped quite daintily in an orthodox square of new flannel it is a son amma and i think it is very like you she had said with a laugh at the wrinkled wizened old face peering out at its new world but amma had grovelled on the ground with tears and cries of blubbering joy he had been right the huzoors were kings they knew the deepukrag they were the lightbringers the lifebringers he had never asked after his wife but when erda had gone inside again he sat and in his anxiety to keep the devil from those inside had twitched away at his string so fiercely that the crocodiles head lost its ferocity in what appeared to be a fit of laughter until sleep from sheer relief overtaking the puller the laugh had ended in that steady yawn amma was on his feet alert in a second however at lances touch like a wild beast tis all right huzoor he grinned broadly tis a son then once again the exuberance of his delight made him grovel in the sand at the feet of the master and the misssahiba hath she gone asked lance blushing once more now that his own selfdeception became impossible nay she remains inside asserted amma but a look which he gave in the hut proved him wrong she must have gone out the other way while he slept he confessed sheepishly but there was nothing wrong the devil had not won a way in both mother and son were dozing peacefully lance his hope of walking back with erda gone felt inclined to take to the canoe again then a savage desire to kill something at least suggested the possibility of a snipe in the little swampy bit below the city wall not far from the mission house so bidding amma take the canoe up at his leisure he walked off feeling for him in a very bad temper he forgot his quarrel with fate however in a second when the bit of swamp reached something buzzed up to fall slantwise like a stone something which on picking it up he found to be the rare sabine snipe painted absolutely beautiful in its delicate harmony of colour and the luck did not come singly for from behind a clump of tigergrass came erda shepherd a trifle alarmed at the possibility of being shot if she did not show herself lance walked up to her swiftly the dead bird in his hand you must be awfully tired being up all night he began he had a way of rushing things erda thought which was disconcerting when one was anxious to keep on the surface and you too mr carlyon she interrupted did you enjoy the ball she felt pleased at this able evasion whoioh dear me no he replied absently then he smiled i say wasnt amma pleased he slobbered and blubbered with joy all over my boots and yet he paused reflectively i dont think a little amma could be a very pleasing object for the life of her she could not help a smile it was not she confessed frankly in fact i think it was the ugliest baby i ever saw poor little thing she added in quick selfreproach anyhow it seemed beautiful to themit is the firstthe first that has lived i mean she pulled up short wondering what possessed her to be so confidential with this strange young man so amma told me said lance he called you the lifebringer it is a nice name she fought against the tenderness in his tone and you are the deathbringer she retorted lightly pointing to the painted beauty in his hand so you and i are at opposite poles mr carlyon he stood looking at her for a moment with a smile i dont know miss shepherd death and birth are the pivots of the wheel of life i remember reading that in sanskrit when i went up for my higher for ive passed it you know im really not bad at languages when i try it was the first time she had ever heard him claim credit for anything and the fact touched her more than she cared to own touched her so closely that she sought instantly for cover i wish i were she said moving on though as she had known he would he moved on also im afraid i shall find it a great trouble having to learn a new one a new one he echoed quickly in response to something in her voice are you going to leave eshwarasoon she paused for a moment ere replying sooner than i expected mr carlyon most likely in a day or two i dont know whether you have heard she continued looking him in the face but i am engaged to be married to my cousindr campbells sondavid campbell he is a missionaryas i amand she hesitated he is at homeor was we did not expect him back for two months but he has had a good offer of a splendid place where there is any amount of work to be done the letter telling us this came yesterdayby the same mail asas he did he is travelling up country now and then and then said lance quietly with his gun over his shoulder he looked what he was a soldier and since she began to speak he had insensibly pulled himself together and fallen into a disciplined ordered tread my aunt wants the wedding to be from the mission station in the low hills where they go every summer went on the girl she was trying not to look at her companion not out of pity but from dread of her own admiration so as davidshe felt better after the semiappropriation of the christian nameis in a hurry to start she thought of going there as soon as the camp leavesin a day or two sosowe shall not see very much more of each other mr carlyon shall we he gave her his first look of reproach being unable in his absolutely honest humility to conceive of the vague regret which forced her to the useless appeal ii hope you will be very happy he said quite simply take care please that bit is boggier than you think for the second time in their short acquaintance she felt his hand not as a friends but as a helper a protector this time the blood left her face pale i hope so mr carlyon she replied and her hands clasped themselves tightly as if to hold some resolve it is what i have always hoped for thought of then suddenly she smiled at him almost appealingly i am a bit of a soldier too you knowi love the fighting you are in the thick of it here anyhow he interrupted pausing they had climbed by a flight of steps through the city wall into the small courtyard on which the mission house which had once been an outpost of the fort opened on its inner side the outer with its wide overhanging verandah forming part of the actual city wall but the remainder of the courtyard was set round by a perfect congeries of small temples each rearing its upright stone spirethe stone of baal worshipabout the central tank which occupied the middle of the square it was quite a small tank and absolutely dry so that you could see the four or five worn stone steps which led down to the patch of earth not six feet square at the bottom a dozen or more children boys and girls of the streets were playing a sort of hopscotch on these steps and as lance looked one of them slipped and fell into that patch of earth in a second the others had quitted their game and fallen pellmell too struggling kicking shouting screaming with laughter is it a game he asked looking at his companion amused yes she said suddenly her face stern as he had seen it that first time he met her it is the game of life and death that is the pool of immortality mr carlyon the pilgrims come here to bathethere must be a secret siphon somewhere for the water only comes when it is wanted three years ago the barriers put up to prevent accidents gave wayit was no ones fault the crowd got ina man slippedandand when the police managed to clear the crushthethe tank was full up with dead bodies the children play at it now but they had spied more amusement and in another second were hanging round erdas skirts sing to us misssahibasing to us before you go in she looked apologetically at lance i generally do she began he raised his cap almost obediently with a brief certainly and passed on but as he left the court on his way to the fort the first note of her voice made him turn for a second to look she was seated on the top step of the tank the children grouped inquisitively round her and she held her head highalmost defiantly the son of god goes forth to war who follows in his train the words were distinctly audible following him as he passed on the gun on his shoulder the dead bird in his hand and something between blessing and cursing in his heart but above and through all he seemed to hear a neverceasing voice that said the pivots of life are birth and death death and birth chapter xi wheels within wheels half a minute dillon said the commissioner abruptly as the doctor ushered in by a scarletsinstain of an orderly entered the tent where the former was working i must attend to these gentlemen first these gentlemen were dya ram ramanund and a third very different sort of person obtrusively hindoo in face figure attire the commissioners manner as he returned to the business in hand changed from careless familiarity to an elaborate courtesy i quite understand punditsahib he said in english to ramanund that you are as you say actuated by no personal motive a man of your attainments and culture can scarcely feel a keen interest in jogi gorakhnathsthat is the name i thinkdomicile in a gun barrel the sarcasm was lost on the hearer who smiled satisfied quite so sir he replied it is merely as my friend dya ram postulates a question as to the legality the commissioner interrupted him suavely in that case it is a matter for the courts surely unless your honour should as magistrate act under section providing for emergencies began dya ram whereat the official sat back in his chair resignedly of course he answered his brogue running riot as it always did when he was contemptuous i have that power but do ye really think sir that this present matter is of such paramount importance to the stability of the british empire that i should be justified in running counter to the ordinary course of law and justice here the futility of his own sarcasm seemed to come home to him he paused to consult a file and when he looked up again he spoke in hindustanievidently for the benefit of the third party there is no record whatever he said briefly of any previous claim to the gun it has been worshipped of course but that is a different matter the military power has no intention of interfering with this habit i may add that a counter petition praying me not to allow appeal on the ground that this jogi is a man of ill fame and a public nuisance has been filed by the mohunt guardian of shrines at the pool of immortality the obtrusively hindoo figure which had remained standing though his companions were seated here folded his hands as if in prayer leant forward and began garrulously huzoor it is malicemalice of hereditary nature they hope to gain money exactly mohuntjee your money if the pilgrims havent the attraction of a live man in a gun close to your shrine your trade will suffer interrupted the commissioner with brutal truth i am afraid i can do nothing of course he continued reverting to english if you bring a suit to claim prescriptive right you may here his patience gave way finally but god bless my soul gentlemen surely men like you have something better to do than bolster up your countrymen in a preposterous business like this pardon me sir protested dya ram litigiously but if it is prescriptive right vested in citizens then then sir interrupted the stern high voice the british empire will have no choice but to allow jogi gorakhnath to be a sonofagun till the day of his death so goodmorning to you unless here the suavity returned in full forcethere is any other subject you wish to bring forward there was not apparently and as the trio were ushered out the commissioner sat still further back in his chair tilting it with his feet against the table and ran his fingers through his hair in an exasperated fashion pon my soul its inconceivable he said then reaching forward took up a newspaper that was lying on the table and began to read if we are asked what we the educated natives of india claim we reply boldly all things that englishmen of equal culture possess by right of birth we refuse flatly to be lumped in with the crass ignorance of our fellowcountrymen who have alas not yet risen to a pitch of desiring that liberty of which john stuart mill speaks in such glowing terms in his valuable pamphlet hark to that now he commented flinging the paper back thats mr dya rams last and it goes on as per usual to abuse they asked me to put a name to it and ive just been telling the confidential department that barring a horrible misuse of synonym theres no sedition no harm in it whatever and there isnt dillon the sonofagun business is ten times as dangerous derings within his rights but i wish to blazes hed left the brute alone or he might have put a blank cartridge in and fired a salute by mistake when gorakhnath was inside but ye cant keep the military in subjection the departments aimin at a fight and small blame to it im spoiling for one myself this instant moment so come along doctor an let me hear what your criminals have to say theres a pretty sheaf of complaints for ye ye hardhearted murderin slave driver he took up a bulky file of papers as he spoke and passed them to an orderly in exchange for his hat which the man held ready yes its pretty good assented the doctor placidly as keeping step the two passed out of the tent so down the palm avenue towards the gaol which the commissioner was going to inspect it comes of their being idle wait till i get them digging again ill work the mischief out of them when are we going on and where his companion shook his head cant get an answer out of the public works is there anything you would like done meanwhile dr dillon laughed sardonically pretty considerable rather only it would take months to get sanction but if you pass it smith says he could put a wire on from the fort easily in a day it would save sending by road if there was trouble and the great thing is to hit back as quick as you can the mutiny taught us that ay said the commissioner musingly thats the straight tip and thats why steam and electricity rule india one can be ready without letting people know if that had been the case in the mutiny he shrugged his shoulders then went onthese things come so easily a touch starts them but you mustnt show that you know it still if you thought there would be any difficultyi mean if you mightnt be able to hold your own till they came from the fortwe might make some excuse for quartering a troop closer dr dillon shook his head it isnt worth it i believe myself theyll settle down when that big brute gopi i told you about gets his ticket tomorrow if i didnt want to get rid of him id put him in cells for six weeks and theres a warder tooor perhaps more but theres no fear i could hold the whole biz myself till the brutes managed to get off their leg irons and as i keep every tool extra mural i dont believe theres a bit of iron within the wallsexcept the shackles themselves so i should have an hour or two anyhow now here you are he continued with pardonable pride as they passed under the mud archway which led into the gaol a long archway with a massive door at either end tunnelling a square block of flatroofed building youll find everything spick and span i can tell you for ive been making the beggars polish their own leg irons so as to keep em a bit busy it was indeed spick and span as only an indian gaol can be where everything including the prisoners beds is freshly mudplastered every week spick and span in a mere monotony of mud and lack of colour the prisoners fifteen hundred of them or more stood in four long straight rows naked save for their waistcloths and the eared caps on their shaven heads their blankets folded to a small square under their feet giving them a strangely wooden appearance as if they stood on stands like the figures in noahs ark a couple of policemen fell out and drew their truncheons to walk close behind the commissioner but dr dillon waved his pair back never show you expect anything he said laconically and as ive always refused a guard i cant take one now nor was there any apparent need for one some faces scowled at him but most were occupied with the commissioner who when a prisoner raised his hand paused to take the written petition which nine times out of ten was ready for presentation there must be a good many warders in it remarked the commissioner dryly and the doctor nodded now theres only the hospital said the latter when the solitary cells had been inspected the cook room interviewed and the dinner to come tasted it wont take you long there was only one case in this morning but as they entered the long open ward like a cloister mudplastered as all else but with iron beds looking strangely at variance with their surroundings two of these were occupied and at one a hospital dresser was standing looking somewhat scared dr dillon gave a hasty exclamation as he stepped up to the bed and looked at the sick man when did he come in he asked briefly ten minutes ago huzoor the baboo hath given him never mind what he hath given him interrupted the doctor holding up his hand in warning go on with it and tell the baboosahib to come to me for ordersat once now then sir thats alland a bit too much too he added in a lower voice as they passed out together for its a case of cholera the commissioner looked grave that will complicate matters wont it cant say you never can tell they may take it as a dispensation or there may never be another case that fellows done for anyhowhell be dead in an hour thats quick isnt it asked his companion calmly rather ive seen a man go out in ten minutes though the worst of it is he added with a frown if there really is some conspiracy at the bottom of the discontent it is as likely as not the devils who are working it may take advantage of thisi dont mean of this deaththat goes without saying but when cholera is about poison is hard to detect and even if i stamp out the disease which i mean to do they may simulate it he bit at his thumbnail viciously as he strode on thinking and muttering by god he murmured if i could catch em at it however he added aloud its no good fussing if the thing comes it comes and ive kept you here too long as it is sir do you know its close on halfpast ten be jabers exclaimed the commissioner only twenty minutes to bathe shave breakfast and put on me gold lace continuations well ta ta ill see you at the show of course dr dillon looked puzzled for an instant the puzzledom of a man whose thoughts are recalled from afar the show oh yes i was forgetting rather sir why it is as much my canal as smiths for weve done every inch of it together besides i have got to drive his wife down where the deuce is dering asked the commissioner quite ingenuously but george dillon flushed up it was visible even under his leatherlike tan i really cant say sir otherwise engaged i presume his elder turned to him surprised yet with instant apology im sorry i shouldnt have said it but i really meant nothing dr dillon gave a dry sardonic laugh oh it is all right sir i quite believe you didnt nobody does mean anything in that sort of connection its left for the doctors to face facts as they are really and then you call us brutal he turned back as he spoke to the hospital half an hour afterwards however having in the interim provided for every contingency he could foresee including the bare possibility of his carrying infection he appeared in mrs smiths drawingroom lookingfor himquite smart and spruce since as he had said this end to three years work was an event in his life also he found her dressed in her daintiest in a rockingchair and as he entered his quick trained ear took in the petulance of the recurring push of one daintily shod foot the room was darkened and full of the scent of flowers it was a familiar room to him yet he never entered it without a glad recognition of the extreme feminine refinement shown in its every detail for its mistress was one of those women whose fragility comes less from physical delicacy than from sensitiveness of mind she was leaning back in her chair listlessly yet the white ringed hands which clasped the fair curls on her forehead showed an almost passionate strain of muscle i believe youll have to go without me she said as he approached ive such a racking headache i dont believe i can face itim sure i cant he passed on to her side and laid his hand on one of hers for an instant while his quick eye took in the details around him a note had slipped from her lap to the floor it lay face up and the words dear mrs smith so sorry showed in vincent derings writing so not content with the message of excuse sent her by the offender through him she must have written that was a dangerous development of the situation he stood looking down at her indulgently as he might on a fractious child who did not understand and she did notpoor soul youre nervous he said let me give you half a whiskeyandsoda before we start itll make you all right nervous she echoed irritably her foot setting her chair aswing to match her tone im never nervousyou know that is not one of my failingsis it no he replied but you are a bundle of nerves for all that you wouldnt be the woman you are if you werent and you are nervous at this moment nervous despondent out of heart come make an effort she gave a petulant little giggle of impatience you speak as if i were a mrs dombey but im not that sort besides it killed her i am not coming it doesnt really matter you know nobody will miss meit will be all right george dillon watching her felt sorry for once at the correctness of his own diagnosis he knew her so well that it seemed imperative to give her a hint of the reality the danger of a final eclaircissement with captain dering seemed imminent and the shock of it might lead to anything if the knowledge of her own weakness came to her in the presence of the man she had cheated herself into calling a friend your husband would it is a great day for him he said laying his dexterous surgeons hand full on the raw as he expected the answer came passionately and gave him an opening he o he is quite happy as it is he wouldnt miss me a bit why should he i am not complaining mind youbut why should he he has interests enough without me dr dillon deliberately sought for the nearest chair drew it close and sat down beside his patient in professional fashion his eyes on her face his hands on his knees my dear lady he said dont talkexcuse merubbish try and remember what women are always forgettingthat they are women and that while eve swallowed her portion of the fatal apple his stuckthank god for itin adams throat she ceased her rocking to sit and stare at him with a growing resentment which belied the words that came at last almost sullenly i dont understand what you mean in the very least what has eves apple to do withmy headache a very great deal he answered coolly and with more than your headache which by the way is only a symptom not a cause the real evil isis something different if you do not understandthough i think you do a little she shook her headi can only repeat my advice about the whiskeyandsoda for i cannot explain to you crudely what i mean she interrupted him angrily you have no right to hint at things you dare not say her very indignation betrayed her and he smiled kindly perhaps not he said then he paused hesitated finally leant nearer with a look of resolve in his queer intelligent face but i will tell you what i can do i can sacrifice my selfrespect and tell you a bit of my personal history which i never meant you to know but which may help to cureyour headache his voice usually so dry had a softness in it though he went on without the faintest emotion mrs smith i have done myself the honour for nearly three years of considering you as near perfection as a woman can he allow me to finish please i have done more i have been as the phrase runs in love with my ideal of perfection but i think you will admit that i have never allowed my feelings to give you myself or anyone else ashall we say a nervous headache now after that dont you think we had better start he rose in quite a matteroffact way took up his hat and waited for her answer he had to wait some time while the petulance of her renewed rocking ceased gradually in a determined rhythm and he felt his courage going down to his boots it was heroic treatment but she was a healthy subject and her anger would pass anything was better than letting her perfection suffer the even creak of the rocker ended at last and she rose as he had risen calmly and faced him i quite understand now what you meant dr dillon she said freezingly and why you did not care to explain i shall of course never be able to forgive you for daring to dream such a thing possible but but he interrupted without a quiver you will take that half whiskeyandsoda here quihi whiskey sharab belatee pani lao juldi memsahiba jata hai bring whiskeyandsoda the mem is going perhaps the command of that assertion helped her to a decision at any rate she did not countermand it but spent the rather awkward pause which inevitably ensued in a perfect fieldday of her hatpins among her curls and veil whereat george dillon despite a certain bruised feeling smiled telling himself she was a true woman nevertheless when as she was stepping into the dogcart his friendly help came necessarily to the fore again she reverted to her dignified resentment i ought she said stiffly to have thanked you forfor your good opinion of me and your evident desire to be kind i do so now but i fear it will be quite impossible for me to forget or forgive the delusion that is quite a minor matter he put in gleefully now cheer up bacilla you brute or we shall be late bacilla being his term of abuse for a pony which required a little stick they were only just in time no more five minutes after they had joined the company gathered on the redbrick masonry of the canal head under a canopy of waving garlands and gay bunting with that inevitable british flag as the centre of all the small man with the big star on his breast took a step forward raised a handle and as the first drops of water trickled through a sluice declared in a violent scotch accent that the victoriakaiserihind canal was open so keeping time as it were slowly majestically to those also inevitable strains of god save the queen the outer floodgates swung back allowing the river to have permanent possession during good behaviour of the walled basin between them and the inner ones thus slowly with a gurgling of water seeking its level the surface rose till the halfopen sluices in the second gates were reached and a thin curve tipped over to fall with a splash and send a tiny scout of a stream to find out what this new straight road might mean only a tiny scout since the earthworks beyond had to be accustomed by degrees to their new tenant still the new way was open and the current of the river hesitated in the old one bravo smith cried george dillon coming round when the cheering and general congratulations were over to slap his colleague on the back metaphorically and actually weve done that and now perhaps old man youll have time for other things yes assented the tall gaunt man dreamily now i shall have time to settle that point about the searchlight the what searchlight theres been a correspondence in the engineer about it and as ive all the electric plant here lying useless now the shows overuntil its wanted for something else of coursei am going to see if i cant overcome their difficulty in concentrating all the power on a sufficiently narrow area i believe i know how to do it george dillon looked at him with fierce humorous exasperation believe he echoed i know you can you are the most intolerably circumscribed selfconcentrated narrowminded machine of a man i ever came across heaven help you as he drove mrs smith home again it was his turn to sit mumchance until womanlike she relented faintly and exaggerating her own powers trusted she had not been etc though of course etc not in the least thank you he replied i was only meditating if i should tell you that i think eugene has softening of the brain softening of the brain she echoed horrified oh doctor do you think its that well it isnt softening of the heart anyhow he said grimly but im not joking if someone doesnt get a hold on some portion of that mani dont care what it isheart brain stomach anythingand prevent him from killing himself with work india will lose her best engineer what he wants is someone toto give him a nervous headache we will leave that subject alone please she said loftily but when her husband joined them in the verandah she went over ostentatiously to him and pinned a carnation in his buttonhole hoping he would like it better than the rose she gave him the day before whichthis was in a louder tone for the doctors benefithe had forgotten to put in did i my dear replied her spouse oh yes i remember you put it in my minim glass because i was working in my shirtsleeves then i wanted the glass so it got withered and the head snapped off dr dillon laughedhis usual dry laugh that is one of the many tragedies which come from the delusion all women have that flowers cant be out of place chapter xii the church militant when roshan khan had joined those two great stabilities faith and love into one passionate desire for vincent derings damnation he had meant to follow the english etiquette on such occasions and keep his aspiration to himself but it had been impossible for him instantly to rejoin the society in which he found himself that is a society which shared that fundamental crimewhich more even than any definite jealousy had roused his anger against captain deringof being alien to his creed his customs his code of conduct towards women so he had wandered off into the garden again shadowed by old akbars incredulity curiosity and sympathy until partly from sheer impatience but mostly from sheer inherited habit of employing such as akbar khan in anything approaching an intrigue he had made a clean breast of the situation even the latter however had as it were shied at the extreme novelty of the idea when it was first mooted but by degrees its vast possibilities of advantage to faithful old retainers overpowered his abject terror at the bare idea of father narayan suspecting such a thing the old master he told himself was old indeed god only knew if he would last a year or a day therefore it would be well to ensure the favour of the new mistress and there could be no harm in sounding her as to what course that favour would follow one could never tell with a woman and his wicked experienced old eyes had caught many a hint of anari begum in lailas childhood perhaps she had changed since she went to calcutta he could but try so when on the morning after the ball laila in obedience to her pious resolve to do nothing really wrong had bidden himwith threats of vengeance if he betrayed the fact of their having come at allremove and return certain trays of clothes and jewels which had been smuggled by someone into her room he had fallen at her feet confessed falsely that he was the offender and besought her not to impose so unmerited a disgrace on his employer who had been actuated by the ordinary rules of native etiquette which prescribed some recognition of his cousin the head of his family naturally enough this brought the girls curiosity long restless to his aid and she sat listening to the many things he had to tell her with that faintly mysterious smile of hers and as she listened she watched a pigeon all jewelled about its bosom in rainbow hues and with a dainty little pair of silver jingles about its jasper feet which was coquetting and pirouetting to attract the attention of its neighbours on the wide marble sill of her latticed window for laila had a room in the upper storey all painted carved and set with little balconies which was worthy of any kings favourite and father ninian mindful lingeringly of the fine ladies boudoirs of his youth in rome had filled it against her return from school with all the prettiest spoils of the palace sevres vases rare old cabinets quaint carved tables which had been brought thither for the dead nawabs treasures that were also inevitably of the kingsfavourite typetherefore unlike the owner of the room as she sat in her white muslin frock heavyeyed almost sallow from the last nights dissipation so shemy grandmother you saywas a dancinggirla real dancinggirl even her surprise and curiosity were listless yet the next moment while akbar was protesting the superiority of anari begum over all the dancinggirls of his vast experience she had burst into a sudden laugh uncovered one of the trays with kicks which sent first one then the other of her bronze slippers flying seized on a pair of silver anklets and there she was centring a persian rug spread on the marble floor as if she had been born to it coquetting pirouetting with a challenging clash a halfimpudent jerk of the jingles for all the world like the pigeon on the windowsill like something else also so that old akbar felt a shiver run through him lest after all his first impression should prove right and this be no more than a simulacruma ghost a changeling come to possess the usually indifferent lazy missbaba yet when all of a sudden she raised her white muslin skirt high in both hands and began to sing at the top of her voice the wicked little love song which vincent dering had sung the first day she met him old akbars dread turned to sheer wonder this was not a ghost but a devil reckless unrestrained with a fling of white arms a kick of white feet all held to rhythm by the outrageous frivolity of the song until with that last staccato note she threw herself in a chair breathless gurgling with laughter and sheer mischief lo akbar she gasped my grandmother never danced like that did she i dont believe she was my grandmother i believe you are telling stories akbar looked wise and thrust out his folded hands in cringing protest the most noble says true anari begum never danced thus but there is the grandfather bunavatarsahib bahadur to be accounted for also laila frowned the reminder brought back the other side of the story to which she had listened so often from her guardians lips while her pretended indifference masked a real pride of her grandfathers gallantry his good looks his love of adventure and of someone else also who had always had a secret attraction for the girl that most beautiful woman in rome the companion of princes the divine singer the best the dearest lailas laughter failed her she rose and going over to the window looked out absently startling the pigeon into flight the sun turned its breast purple and green and gold as it fluttered down to renew its pirouetting on a cupola below just above the river and below that again was the roof of the balcony where she had sat with vincent the girls eyes grew soft she understood now that best that dearest that most beautiful must have loved her guardian that was the secret of his remembrance how could one ever forget that one had sat in a balcony hand in hand so content yet saying so littleonly feeling but he had said some things he had said she was beautiful that she ought always to wear that dress and she had told him she could notthat she must send it backthat he must learn to like her as much in her ordinary clothesthat he would never see her in that dress again but after all why notif she turned suddenly to the gobetween there is no need to take them back today she said sharply but thou canst tell the person who sent themhe who claims cousinshipthat i will not keep them that i know nothing of them that he must send and take them away akbar with an inward determination to do nothing so palpably foolish salaamed down to the ground the presence he said in doing this showed her dignity it was undoubtedly the right course to pursue but in the mean time would the begumsahibashe must excuse a tongue which could not always bear with the paltry present which remembered the facts of the past the possibilities of the futurenot temper her noble severity with the usual courtly favour her cousins grandmother a most virtuous princess sister to the late nawab was still alive her memory of bunavatarsahib was still so green that doubtless she would be able to tell the begumsahiba many things of which a mere mean slave could not be cognizant and this most virtuous most interesting one had long been anxious to return a visit which the begumsahiba had graciously paid her in company with a missenmiss what that funny old fat woman interrupted laila with a laugh that dirty old thing i remember she did claim to be a relation of the nawabs and when i asked her why she wore such dirty clothes she was angry and said she had beautiful ones all tied up in bundles i dont believe she had though the dress the begumsahiba wore last night is one of them interrupted akbar quietly it belonged to anari begum huzoor and there are plenty more like it and all are really the huzoors no one elses laila looked down on the trays with a new interest did it really belong toto her she asked and the jewels also the jewels also there are plenty of them and if anari begum was really the begumsahibas grandmother then the jewels are hers by right she can come if she wishes interrupted laila impatiently i see thy craft akbar but i care not for that yet it will be fun to receive her asas a begum and no harm either since the missen ladies receive her i know and her likewhen they will come it will be at night of course to ensure her privacy so pidar narayan need know nothing onlyshe paused a change swept over her face leaving it dimpled cunning full of mischief and cajolery i do naught for naught if i please thee thou must please me if thou art their messenger thou must be mine also or i tell pidar narayan akbarkhans wicked old eyes positively leered approval he waggled his head and chuckled wherefore not was there a better more careful messenger in the world than he or one more capable of deft arrangings i want none she put in with a quick distaste a shrinking from his manner tis but to take a note to deringsahib he must know somewhat before he comes with the other sahib logue this afternoon there is no arrangement needed no fuss how could there be she asked herself as after the old sinner had gone off charmed at this renewal of a once familiar occupation she sat on the windowsill looking down on the roof of the balcony where she had been so content for what could be simpler than to make it quite clear that you were real that you did not pretend that you were not even afraid that briefly you were not like mrs smith who took so muchone could not help seeing thatand gave so littleone could not help seeing that also for what was a thanks many captain dering in return for all the trouble he lavished on her so it came to pass that when vincent dering went to the palace that afternoon some words were haunting heart and brain as juliets words must have haunted romeos no more no less but they slid into and filled up the blanks between some words of his own which he had spoken carelessly not five minutes before he had first seen laila and which came back to his memory unbidden it isnt altogether despicable to let yourself loose in paradise without an arriere pensee of flaming swords especially if you can give pleasure to someone else thereby one could play romeo and juliet in this garden nicely well he had played it for an hour or two swept off his feet by chance whether he would continue to play it was unsettled till her note came that ended his vague reluctance and he went over to the palace eager as any lover could be for the interview she suggested in the old place when it grows dusk and the people will mostly have gone for those of the camp who were bound to follow the viceroys whim of riding by the old roadthe pilgrims roadwhile the big camp went round by the longer easier route had promised to look in on the palace on their way past it for a cup of tea a goodby since already the functions over the dreamcity had begun to melt away the hosts of the lordsahib were passing on glory be said the commissioner with heartfelt gratitude weve done our worst and leave you to take the consequences thats sound policy anyhow we are ahead of everybody on the road to heaven and the pilgrims will have to swallow the dust of our feet i wonder how theyll like it he was in wild spirits like a schoolboy escaped from school yet as he paused to shake hands with dr dillon he said aside any more cases two said the doctor laconically both dead it is a bad type his hearers face was unmovable as he turned to mrs smith who stood close by goodby my dear lady he said cheerfully remember me house is yours if you or the child want it doctor couldnt you conscientiously recommend change of air to the hills couldnt ye swear the close proximity to an open canal and a gaol is unwholesome if ye could youd oblige a grasswidower whose wife is at badenbadenor is it marienbadliving prodigally while he has to fill himself with husks which no selfrespecting swine would eat faith me dear madam id bless you if youd come and kill the cook its a womans work not a mans dr dillon with a quick look backed him up instantly certainly i told mrs smith a long time ago that she and gladys had had enough of eshwara indeed as her doctor she would be doing me a personal favour if muriel smith swept round on him sharply she was looking her very best in her very best gown white mystic wonderful with a faint gleam of silver embroidery about waist and hem and she had been obtrusively unnecessarily friendly with vincent dering all the afternoon even now she was standing with him attached to her apronstrings i dont think nervous headaches are dangerous she said eying dr dillon coolly but thanks all the same i should love to kill somebody even a cook perhaps i may by and by when all the nice people leave im so sorry youre going but we are still to be quite gay arent we captain dering and that reminds me we have to settle when that riding party is to come off goodbygoodby she waved her hand to the departing commissioner and carried vincent dering off with a defiant look at the doctor he knowing her smiled indulgently but father ninian who had come down to see his guest off looked after her with a wistful pain in his kind old face that is a mistake he said briefly then the wistfulness grew into a puzzled look and he added half to himself it need not be surely there is something wrong i cant understand dr dillon catching the end of the remark gave a cynical laugh and turned on his heel no one does he said as he went off he would not discuss her even with dear old pidar narayan for the rest though he was keen to get back to his jail he would wait till she tired of her game and then drive her home himself to her idiot of a husband who was too busy over his blessed searchlight to see things that were going on under his very eyes captain dering however was already impatient it was growing dusk the shadows were claiming the garden bit by bit and as the glint left the varnished leaves of the orange trees the white flowers stood out like little stars against the gloom and sent a bewildering perfume into the darkening air he could see no hint of laila anywhere laila in that detestable white muslin garment which made him long vainly to get rid of the surroundings which suited her so ill drive all that civilized crew from the garden and claim it as his ownand hers she must have gone to the balcony already she must be waiting for him and yet a softheartedness for this other woman with whom he had been friends whom for a few days he had imagined he loved it had come to this now forbade him from leaving her cavalierly so it was long past dusk and the short indian twilight was hovering on the edge of night ere he made his escape and full of anxiety lest laila should have lost patience or hope hurried down to the wide archway and so by the turn riverwards to the right into the balcony most girls he told himself would by this time have taken offence but she was there as he entered her figure showed dimly against the light beyond im afraid i am awfully late he began then paused for as she turned there was a faint clash of silver a faint gleam of it too his heart gave a great throb of glad recognition it was laila laila indeed the laila of that dream last night and she had risked this to please him are you she said i thought i was late for this took time but i wanted to be the samealways the same to you alwaysalways she stretched her hands to him but he set them aside took her in his arms and kissed her passionately yes laila always lailamy laila she gave him back his kisses joyfully i knew you would come she said love comes to love you know he called her juliet then and many another lovers name she took them all and gave them back again without reserve until as they stood there someone passing outward from the arched passage to the garden paused to listen at the halfheard sound of voices for father ninianwho had come down to his own rooms for a pair of foils wherewith to give lance carlyon a lesson in the addio del marito until captain dering should choose to come out of the recesses of the garden and allow of their going back to the fort togetherknew of none likely to use or even to be aware of the balcony so he turned thither curiously then stood arrested so that the clash of the foils on the stone as he purposely lowered their points came as a warning to those two that they were observed laila with a catlike noiselessness withdrew in a second she a yard or two away in deepest shadow stood leaning in a careless easy attitude over the balustrade her only possibility of escape lay she felt instinctively in showing no desire to do so vincent for his part turned to face the old priest prepared to brazen it out for his blood was running like wildfire in his veins yet scarcely so fast as the hearts blood had once leapt and was even now leaping in the old man who came forward facing him also came forward slowly shortsightedly a foil in each hand if he had held out one bade him take the button off and fight for his life vincent dering would scarcely have been surprised would almost have been pleased it would have raised him in his own selfesteem for he knew perfectly well he had no right to be there that as yet he was not sure of his own footing but pidar narayan did not he paused as he generally did a few paces away a slender straight shadow in black girt about with that pale sash on which and on his pale face such light as there was fell softly for there was no anger in the latter only an almost passionate regret and pity even so his words startled the young man who stood prepared for defiance oh captain dering he said courteously it is you is it you have found a pleasant place indeed but scarcely a very safe one for your companion he turned to that faint gleam of white and silver in the arched shadowthe air grows chill madam so close to the river he continued his voice taking a tone almost of command and you are lightly clad will you not be wise and leave us vincents surprise had passed by this time into a rush of vexation almost indignation for he had grasped the old mans mistake for an instant he felt bound to undeceive him then the impossibility of doing so held him silent feeling a coward indeed so desperately he could only join his voice to father ninians it seemed the only way out of the impasse perhaps you had better go laila did not need more already under cover of the shadow she had dexterously slipped off her silver jingles lest they should betray what really seemed to her her worst nay her only offencethe taking and wearing of roshan khans present and now wrapping her veil about her like a cloak gathering her trailing skirts to orthodox length with an appalling presence of mind she was off with just the little uneasy laugh which might well befit the situation she left her companion bewildered yet still facing the old man recklessly since he could not explain he did not mean to be hectored yet once again the old voice took him unawares memory plays strange tricks with us at times it said slowly but with a suggestion of the fateful hopeless rhythm of a greek chorus in it she has taken me back this evening nearly sixty long years the river before us is the yellow flood of the tiber the woman who has just left us is the woman i lovedsixty long years agoi had kissed her as you have kissed her i had told her i loved her as you have just told herand then like an echo from the river below where a boat was moored came to our ears the same words i love youthey were spoken captain dering by a boy barely in his teens to a waitingmaid the boy was her son she had been married as they marry them in italy almost before her girlhood and i the boys tutor was nearer her age than his fathera better man too captain dering but those wordsi love youparted us once and for all they mirrored the truth for usthe truth of the love which hides in balconiesin pleasure boats he took a step forward and his whole presence changed he raised his hand priest to its finger tips let it mirror the truth to you also my sonleave this poor lady to her duty as i vincent dering broke in on him haughtily his pride in arms impatience at the falseness of his position making him discourteous you dont understand you are absolutely mistakeni refuse to explain but i really must ask you not to interfere the old mans whole bearing changed again he drew himself up and foils in hand bowed as fencers do at the salute were i the ladys husband sir i would make you answer as a priest of god i must warn you that i will speak if vincent dering interrupted him again i cant prevent thatbut you will wrong usher at any ratethe best the kindest woman he paused for father ninian had come close laid a hand on his and the touch seemed to bring silence it is sixty long years captain dering he said and his eyes seemed to pierce through the darkness since i have laid my hand on my fellowmen save in the hope of healing it was a fancy of mine afterafter we kissed and parted but i touch you as a second self a fellowsinner for she too was the bestthe kindest his old voice failed despite his anger at the whole miserable mistake vincent was touched but despite his emotion his annoyance strengthened possibly he broke in but i must really refuse to discuss the matter further shall we end this sirunless he gave a reckless laugh and pointed to the foilsyou would like to fight it out once more father ninian bowed as fencers bow in the salute the priest the wise counsellor lost in an older entity than these in the highborn scotch student who for a while had forgotten his vocation to ruffle with the best blood in italy i have not the privilege of being the ladys protector he answered hotly if i werehe paused then said courteously shall we come upstairs i came down for these foils in order to teach mr carlyon the thrust we spoke of once laddio del marito they called it in my youthi doubt if the name has changed now he will be wondering what has become of me andand it as vincent followed him he felt a thrill at the savageness of the old mans tone and told himself that here was the church militant indeed he might have said so with still more reason ten minutes after when father ninian was left alone for the hour proved too late for lessons and lance carlyonwho had been out of sorts ever since his walk at dawn with erda shepherdwas obliged to give in to dinner grumbling the while that vincent was the worst chum he ever came across never to be found when he was wanted then turning up when dear old pidar narayan looked as if he could have licked creation possibly lance might have repeated this assertion also with greater fervour could he have been witness to father ninians actions when his last guest gone he went to put the foils back in the armoury next the chapel for he would have seen him with head bowed over the crossed foils he held repeating a mea culpa as he passed the altar but ere the second foil matched its fellow on the armoury wall he would have seen as pretty a bit of swordplay as could well be seen many a dexterous turn of wrist many a quick imaginary parry many a sharp riposte following each other accurately as if memory held each attack each defence of an unseen foe until finally swift as a flash would come a falter back as if from a blow then a thrust forward there was a little silver bellsuch as men put to a falcons hoodno bigger than a sixpence shaped like a mans heart upon the tassel of a resting lance beneath the solitary foil and the tassel swayed gently in the cool river breeze yet at each thrust the heartshaped bell chimed a feeble protest under the button of the foil making the church militant smile cheerfully chapter xiii at the gates the darkness which holds the dawn was as a rule silent as the grave in the sandstretches beyond the river where the wide cut of the canal the huge mudheap of the gaol with its scattered workshops and houses showed as mere spots and lines on the illimitable plain but on the night after the band had played god save the queen while the first drops of sacred water trickled over the chink of the sluice into the dry bed of the canal below its silence was broken by unfamiliar sounds first of all by the now ceaseless splash of the thin glassy curve of water on its way to find out this new road to the sea it had a sort of dreamy whisper in it as if it were telling its first impressions its hopes its fears to the river it was leaving behind and on this background of ceaseless sound came two others intermittently the firsta muffled hammering from the darkness which hid the viceroys camptold of departure letting the night know that another whitewinged tent was flitting and that the dawn must be prepared to find its place empty the dreamcity in ruins the hosts of the lordsahib gone the second told of arrival it was a strange cry soft almost musical harahariharahari then every now and again in a sort of chant ramramsitaram it was the pilgrims cry their call on the creator the destroyer their appeal to the godhead in man and woman for the forerunners of the great host to come were already nearing eshwara on their road to the cradle of the gods but there was a fourth sound inaudibleby reason of that ceaseless noise of water through the chink of the sluiceexcept to those close by it like george dillon as he stood on the handbridge above the closed gates looking down idly into the darkness which prevented him from seeing the cause of the sound he had been up all night on his returnlater than he had intended owing to his determination not to be defied by any womanhe had found that in his absence cholera had been hard at its work so he had buckled to his expecting one of those awful nights which live even in a doctors memory as a horror as a warning to those best fitted to stem the stream of death that they are but straws on its surface but he had been mistaken true for an hour or so cases had come in quicker than they could be attended to then suddenly they ceased to come in at all that had been eight hours ago too short a respite for certainty but dr dillon being no novice in such work had his hopes the more so because the disease from the very outset had become steadily less and less virulent even so seven dead bodies lay awaiting the first glint of dawn therefore as illluck would have it there would be seven columns of smoke on the rivers edge for all to see it was inevitable however nor could he do more to prevent others coming so he had been on his way back to his own house for a few hours rest when the dreamy splash of the water made him pause to lean over the handrail and listen to it as he finished his cigar in the open then it was that he heard a faint tap tapping as of a ghostly hand on a door what was it it was quite distinct though almost as low as the lip lipping of the water made restless by that glassy curve against the gates a curiosity to know seized on him there was already a glimmer of dawn in the east he might as well wait and see it was not long before a streak of something faintly white made him call himself a fool the cause was a log of wood he might have thought of that even that faint setting of a stream towards a new way must have drifted it here the thought made him frown for this fulfilment of the riverpeoples prophecy was annoying the more so from its absolute unlikelihood years might pass without such a chance coming again yet it had come the very first day it was too bad the stars in their courses were fighting against him in a pet he threw the remains of his cigar from him and was striding off when a faint glimmer as of a candle made him turn sharply and look down whence it came the lighted end of his cigar had fallen on something dry inflammable which had blazed up but it was only for a second the next found darkness save for that still faint glimmer of white but the brief gleam had told him it was not a log which had drifted astray it was a corpse that tap tapping he had heard had been from the dead feet seeking vainly to pass through the chink of the sluice swerving with the side current coming back again and again he stood grasping the rail staring down at the dim outline almost incredulously and feeling despite himself a trifle shivery then the remembrance that this was a thing which must be seen by none which somehow and as quickly as possible must be set on its right road again made him hurry back to where he knew some coils of rope which had been used for bunting at the ceremony were lying seizing onestill gaily decoratedhe tied a brick to one end and hurried back to the bridge by dropping this weighted rope over the dim white streak he was able to edge it gradually to one side until it lay moored against the wall of the basin kneeling down for a closer look he could see in the fastgrowing light that it was the corpse of a woman he could even guess the death she died and if proof was needed it could be found in the hands folded at full stretch down the body the thumbs pointing upward linked by an iron ring to this iron ring had been looped a little tuft of the tricoloured hank of cotton which plays so large a part in marriage ceremonial dr dillon stood up and swore under his breath the fates were indeed inexorable in their spite of all things unlucky for the changing stream to claim a corpse seeking union with mother ganges was the worst and of all corpses thisthe cursed one which had held two lives and could send one back to haunt menwas the worst he must get rid of it somehow if he could fastening the rope so strangely out of keeping all hung as it was with gay colours to the iron ring which showed about the ankles he proceeded to tow the body back along the basin past the first gates and so to the river itself thus far was simple but how was he to get it afloat on a current strong enough to sweep it beyond danger of its returning to tap at the gates once more the dawn was hastening with great leaps of light that shot in broad bars from the darkest spot in all the dark horizon the spot which would soon be the brightest ablaze with the sun himself already the broad shield of the river was changing its heraldrythe sable was turning to steel sign that the world would side with the light what was to be done he looked over the wide waste of sand and water with a perplexity which vanished suddenly in a smile as he caught sight of a round shadow like a mans head dipping and dancing on the surface he walked on to the last dry spot of land and shouted ai fisherman ai gugu amma anybody come and earn a gold mohur it was amma luckily perhaps since the idea of even towing a dead body such as this might have been too much for semicivilized gugu amma however had not ever borrowed his neighbours superstitions in fact ever since he the misssahiba and the deepukrag had bested the devil between them he had felt himself to be invulnerable so he assured dr dillon affably were the huzoors therefore he obeyed them consequently less than five minutes after the call with a vague wonder as to what sixteen rupees would feel like all at once in a mans palm he was heading hard to the nearest stream capable of carrying the thing he had in tow back to the path of purification this happened to be towards eshwara and beyond a sandy point set with tamarisks which jutted out above the canal head there was of course a certain stream against him and to save himself exertion and finish the jobas he had agreed to dobefore dawn he swam for the most part under water only coming up after his habit for air now it so happened also that gugu had thought fit to set nets for wildfowl and was even now dozing while he waited for the result in the same tamarisk jungle but the sound of something swishing through the water against the stream roused him in a second and even without the glimpse which the coming dawn gave him of a long streak parting the river with a curved ripple like the prow of a boat his experience told him what it was sure to be briefly someone of the river peopleamma for choice since who but amma had the luck of such thingshad happened on the chance of stealing a log from the piles about the canal workshops he was now after timehonoured precedent towing it to the stream where having set it adrift he would recapture it and of course claim his reward for so doing but two could play that game when secrecy made it necessary for a thief to swim for the most part under water it was easy to swim under water too across the track of the robber cut his prize adrift and put your weight on the rope instead then you could either choose revenge and let an enemy tow you homewhich was a sidesplitting trickor you might wait till your adversary came up breathless and dash after the prize yourself even if you could not secure the whole half profits were generally possible therefore slipping noiselessly into the stream like an alligator he was off across the track in a second swimming of course under water he came up once for air and smiled to see how far he had come so fearing lest the holder of the unseen towrope might chance to come up at the same time his black head went under once more when it came up again it was within a few yards of the long white streak he gave one look at it let loose a yell of abject terror and almost turning a somersault in his haste to escape his head went down again his feet went skywards and though his lungs nearly burst in the effort he came up no more till he felt certain he must have put a screen of tamarisk between him and the horror he had but his teeth chattered his eyes were half out of his head when he scrambled hands and knees on to the bank and lying face down on the dry sand moaned and shuddered what else could a man do who had seen a cursed corpse breasting the stream on its way back to eshwara to whose house that however was quite a secondary consideration to a man who was already as good as dead since what man had ever survived the sight of a churail the certainty of his own fate after a while made him absolutely recklessly calm he gathered up his nets wrung the necks of the few birds he had caught pitilessly and went with them as usual to the bazaars not only for profit however other men should taste of his fear other men should know that they too might have to die amma meanwhile having seen nothing when he came up wondering what the sound was which had filtered to his ears through the water had gone on his way unwitting found the stream cut the corpse adrift himself and gone back to his fishing it was not until he also went into the bazaar with his basket that he found it ringing with the direful portent yet for all that going its way buying and selling squabbling over the uttermost part of a farthing since portents are ever with an indian bazaar at first when called upon to verify gugus story amma remembering his promise of secrecy gave it stout denial but when the real truth of what had occurred dawned on his slow brain the opportunity for piling agony on to his rival was too strong for him and he burst into details all of which made gugus chance of escape still more remote the corpse had shot after him with a speed only equal to the fireboats in which the huzoors came across the black water it had sat up and beckoned and called gugu gugu but if thou hast seen all this thou too must die remarked the syrupseller round whose shop the talk was loudest amma laughed vaingloriously not i the devils are afraid of me see you i have taken the huzoors for my god i am on the strong side hark to him jeered another of his own tribe who was also selling fish he cannot balance his basket on his head he holds it so high since the woodsahib up the river hath bidden him guide their big raftas if he was a whit better than the rest of us amma smiled peacefully that is true brother i go for the raft this very day but i leave a son in my house if the luck goes against me that is the huzoors doing they have the deepukrag they are the lightbringers the birthbringers a tall man in curiously crumpled clothing who had just joined the group gave a hollow laugh birthbringers he echoed ay and deathbringers too they took seven in the gaol last night i have it from a sure hand that might well be seeing that he was none other than the gosain gopi who scarcely an hour agone had been given his ticketofleave and the clothes in which he had been convicted two years before they had since then been rolled up and ticketed with his name and number hence the creases the doctor cuts a hole in their heads he went on calmly takes out their brains and puts the bit back then tis cholera that is why they burn them in their clothing and their caps so that none may see but they say tis for the safety of the living as if that did not lie with the gods hark to him said approving voices yea hark to him the pious one the long bazaar lay flooded with sunshine and life the quails were calling from their hooded cages the sacred monkeys were chattering about the sweetmeatsellers shops men and women were going about eager on their own affairs and a group of schoolboys on their way to a mission school came along their books under their armsa quaint collection for the most part a copy of the gospels saadis gulistan and the hitopadesa certainly a treatise in english on the latest theories of mind and matter equally so selections from general literature probably with burkes speeches and addisons spectator possibly one or two of these boys paused in their school talk to listen as a voice said fearfully twill be for momai they want them folks say they are running short of power gopi shook his head that may be but these are to grease the slots of the canal sluice without it water will not run one brainhis that they killed with the lightopened it but one inch as all can see if they choose and these seven will not go far what matter there be plenty more where they came from the gossipers looked at each other yea that is so it opens but an inch and there are many prisoners they said with that curious faculty for giving heartwhole assent to the truthful foundations of a lie which makes the latter go so far in india the boys went on there was nothing about the dynamic and hydraulic power of a mans brain in their treatises but after all the statement was scarcely so strange to ignorance as many another held in the books under their arms the times are bad remarked someone chiefly to give a fresh fillip to the flagging horrors they say the pool of immortality will be dry tomorrow a trail of saffronrobed pilgrims who were passing under the charge of a priest looked at their guide doubtfully if this was to be so what was the use of having given him a rupee each to be admitted thereto at the most auspicious moment lo tis easy to father that falsehood cried the priest in charge venomously eyeing a similar figure to his own which was also followed patiently trustfully by a band of men and women and children all in their saffron robes when folks have had their own miracle stopped they would fain stop other folks also have no fear my children the sacred water will rise as ever and send your souls blameless to the cradle of the gods it would have been easy enough for his rival to throw doubts on the genuineness of the pool miracle had it been sound policy to do so but before those patient trustful faces desirous only to save their souls alive at any cost it was unwise to sap at the foundations of faith so the reply contented itself with assertions that there was no fear either for them tampion or no tampion jogi gorakhnath had promised to be inside the gun as ever and that would be a newer a better miracle than any other in eshwara here a fresh voice put in its word for the syrupsellers shop being at one corner of the central square or chowk of four bazaars no one who had any errand of any sort in eshwara could fail to pass it sooner or later therefore dya ram and some other pleaders on their way thus early in the morning to the tahsil court were bound to overhear the priests boast but most undesirable nevertheless expostulated dya ram quickly we have duly appealed against the order to the higher court and our legal course is to await the result the priest looked at him sullenly scornful for such as he are no favourites with the hereditary levites of india the jogi hath appealed to the gods he retorted and they will give judgment without the help of such as thou pleaderjee hark to the pious one murmured the crowd again admiringly responsive as ever to a hint of religious sentiment but it will confuse issuesit is irregularand i who drew up the petition object in toto began dya ram in angry protest when a friend interrupted him consolingly in english true as it has been said it is impossible to serve god and mammon yet seeing that miracles are as herbert spencer proves ipsi facto the ludicrous inadequacy of logic to the mental caliber of those around him struck one of the little party of progress keenly and he broke in as he passed on what is the use of combatting such ignorance it is for uswho represent the intellect of indiato pioneer the way the rest was lost as the little party went on discussing their own position mayhap twas to ramanunds house the churail was coming there was such a corpse went from it a week or two since and they return from far said an old man looking after the last speaker gopi the gosain laughed this one ill wager was sent back because of the canal mark my words mai gunga will return them all now tis the huzoors doing a curious shiver ran through the crowd of men to have your women against you to feel in your heart that they cannot help being revengeful that their blood is on your head is ever the greatest of dreads and so many lives held the possibility of this revenge amma philosophically seated on the outskirts of the group trying to sell his fish laughed vaingloriously again only for fools the misssahiba and the lights and i can defy devils here he stood up and with frightful grimaces of joy and uncouth salaams greeted the appearance of erda shepherd who in the missionladys uniform of blouse and skirt white pith hat green veil and bag of books came out of a neighbouring alley it was not a becoming dress lance carlyon told himself as on his way back from escort duty to some lingering bigwig of the camp he at the same moment came cantering up the bazaar towards the fort she could not say the same of his it was the first time she had seen him in uniform and the sight of the scarlet and gold the buttons the fallals generally took her breath away there are in fact few women whom they do not impress yet curiously enough her impulse was to pass on without speaking his to do what he did namely pull up dismount and shake hands and still more curiously the reason for both these impulses was the same the presence beside erda of a tall rather weedylooking man with a long black coat and a long red beard let me introduce my cousin the reverend david campbell said erda with great dignity somewhat marred by a fine blush i thought it must be rejoined lance coolly he might have said he was certain of it that a fellow could scarcely feel a desire to murder another fellow at an instants notice unless that fellow was your rival yet still more curiously again this notion of rivalry had come to lance in an instant also before he caught sight of erda and her fiance he would have sworn that though he had been a bit cut up at hearing the nicest girl he had ever met was already engaged he had never had the remotest idea of fighting against the fact but the first glance at the two walking together had changed all this here by gods grace was the one maid for him and another man had not a bad looking chap certainly better dressed too than most missionaries that was because he was fresh out from england any fool though could be that with an english tailor yes not a bad sort but not the sort for her youve been out on your rounds i suppose he said pointing to erdas books yes answered the reverend david with eager assent and the benevolent smile which includes the smilers own virtue in smiling and i have been privileged for the first time to see somewhat of the noble work englishwomen are doing for their indian sisters it is no easy task mr carlyon for delicate i like it put in erda with a faint frown at the missionaryreport style of her cousins enthusiasm so there is no use wasting your pity on me david pity he echoed in appropriating approval i did not even pity you when they called you evil names being of the new school of free church ministers he put all possible ill into evil like any ritualistic curate do they call you names asked lance sharply erda gave a vexed look at her cousin for the first time in her life the militant joy at persecution of the true proselytizer failed her sometimes not often she said quite apologetically they happened to do so today and david heard it there are so many strangers about you see who dont know me and what did you do lances eyes were on the reverend david this time do repeated the latter in faint surprise nothing of course we missionaries hear such things joyfullyforfor the works sake there was dignity in his tone and manner by jove said lance softly under his breath if id been there there would have been a row besides he added quite argumentatively if i believed in my work as you do id be hanged if i let anybody krab itor mefor its the same thing not at least without trying to make em answer for it all i know the reverend david campbell shook his head that is not our view erda the meeting is at nine and it is already the halfhour tomorrow you see mr carlyon is our fieldday and we have to arrange our forces once more the flavour of the missionary report made erda shrink but lance nodded a fieldday for most of us i expect to be in the saddle all day goodby miss shepherd but something in the girl rose up in revolt at parting with him thus when he had been out of sight she had faced the probability of never seeing him any more with equanimity now she felt that she must tell him she was leaving eshwara the very next day or the day after that she must make this a real goodby i have to see another old woman in an alley close by first david she said you had better go on and let me follow yet when he had gone after another joyously militant paean over the work she stood silent it seemed somehow too sunshiny for words then she looked up at lance and her heart sank for something in his face told her in an instant that she had been too long in letting him know of her engagement to her cousin the fact by rousing her indignationsince it was impossible to go about proclaiming that you were not available for idle people to fall in love withhelped her to be hard you need not have been so fierce just now she said with an unreal little laugh people wont have many more chances of calling me names in eshwara i told you didnt i that i was going but it will be sooner than i expectedtomorrow or next day then i shant see you again he grasped the meaning to him in an instant and the wondering pain in his voice awoke an echo in her heart i suppose so for mr campbells appointment will be at the other end of india unless indeed she could not withstand his lookmy aunt has asked a few friends in to tea this afternoon to say goodby if you or captain dering cared of course ill come he interrupted quietly now which way are you going for i am going too she looked at him helplessly but you cant she began oh yes i can ill finish the smoke you interrupted while you polish off the old lady theyre not going to have a chance ofof abusing the work again he had a most ingenious way of appealing to her sense of humour and though it was partly at her cousins expense she laughed as they set off togethera most incongruous couple he had little time for his smoke however for he had barely left off watching the point where she had disappeared for any hint of felonious calling of names when she reappeared in company with father ninian the latter looking almost popelike yet also curiously native in the white washing soutane and skullcap which he invariably wore in his visitations his face was rather stern and he had his spectacles on ah mr carlyon he said surprised in his turn i am glad will you take miss shepherd home i want to go over to dr dillon at once and i have advised her not to visit in this quarter today there are many lodging houses for the pilgrims and did they call names asked lance belligerent at once the old man looked at him sharply almost angrily no one ever called me names sir still less a lady who was with me but excuse mei am pressed for time now thats a man said lance enthusiastically as he looked after the hurrying white figure the comparison was too obvious father ninian is not a missionary she said coldly it is easy for him she paused turned to her companion and held out her hand goodby and thanks but i really can go home by myself mr carlyon goodby he echoed then holding her hand still a sudden resolve seemed to come to him buti should like to tell you something first please she felt her heart beating everywhere but in its proper place not that it matters but id like you to know it i had some news by the mail this morningbad news she felt her blood everywhere but in its normal course now in sheer shame at her own imaginations im sorry she murmured so am i he went on thoughtfully though it isnt bad in a way for me do you remember my telling you about my cousin a weedy chap sixfour well they sent him round the world for his health and he died two months ago it seems in australia and the shock was too much for my uncle he was an old man and this was his only son soso i am sir lancelot now it doesnt make any odds of course but i thought i should like you to know first she looked up at him as he stood beside her so tall so strong so young so kind and though she only said thanks sir lancelot it wont make any difference toto our friendship im sure she knew in her heart of hearts that it did though how she had not yet had time to discover chapter xiv miracle mongers roshan khan flung his cigarette away and walked up and down his quarters in the fort like an englishman he felt rather like one also in his vague distaste for something which refused to fit in with his previous experiences so she will see my grandmother he said at last that is a step certainly but he turned quickly to akbar khan it seems impossible the quondam chiefeunuch giggled like a girl nothing is impossible with women oh protector of the poor he said then with a jaunty air of selfsatisfaction went on and this dustlike one has experience she will see the female relation tonight after approved custom and since this is after the habits of the sahiblogue she would perhaps see thethe nawabsahib tomorrow roshan wheeled again in his walk at both the title and the suggestion half indignantly yet with a reluctant eagerness seesee me did she say aught of it a womans wishes for a lover go not near her tongue huzoor they keep to her heart replied akbar still with his jaunty craft but if this visit of the female relation be auspicious as god send it then there would be no hindrance to the asking and even if she said nay something in his hearers face warned the old sinner he had to do with some novel code of conduct and he paused while roshan continued his pacing he was disturbed beyond bounds the foolish dream of a foolish old woman had come to be so far a reality that the jealousy which had blazed up instinctively at the sight of laila in that dressso like a woman of his racealone with a strange man had come to be deliberate more than once he had felt inclined to tell pidar narayan what he had seen even to write an anonymous letter of warning he would have done so had he seen any subsequent hint of intimacy between these two but he saw none on the contrary they seemed to avoid each other in public and though this might be a blind on the other hand roshan had seen too much of some english womens ways not to know how trivial an offence against the proprieties it was to sit out dances in a balcony undoubtedly however this girl who had taken his presents on the sly who would receive his ambassadress on the sly was not one whom it was necessary to treat with great ceremony she was what the english language called a flirt his own a stronger term not that it mattered since no wife of his would have a chance of amusing herself so after a while he paused to saywith a scowl for the toothless grinning survival of a past societyi would i knew if it were wise to trust thee why shouldst thou take the trouble thou dost what is the affair to thee akbars face was a study in sheer dignity tis but my duty cherisher of the poor he said almost pathetically for what other service were such as i am created the hateful tragedy of this confession of degradation passed roshan by he saw nothing in it but an appeal to facts which gave him confidence yea he said i was forgetting such arrangings are meat and drink to thy sort so take thy price it shall be trebled if she bids me see her tomorrow but here he laughed half at himselfthou must needs work miracles for such favour to come so soon akbar as he capered off the rupees jingling in his pocket to more legitimate and less lucrative pursuits winked and leered to himself over his own surpassing wickedness and wisdom miracles ay but it was nature worked them not he given youth proximity a touch of surprise a flavour of the forbidden and the result in his evil experience was sure in the meantime his part was to keep the ball from falling until the players took to playing the game for themselves then the fun was over for the true gobetween he had to take a back seat and watchhe he hethe miracle a pretty miracle indeed the idea tickled him so that he could not keep it to himself and as he passed through the bazaar doing his daily marketing he used his new avocation of miraclemonger as a reason for good bargains the shopkeepers however shook their heads miracles paid the priests and might suit such as he but for their part they considered that there were too many miracles in eshwara what was the good of the pilgrims coming at all if all their money went to the temples and they had not a pice left for a relic or even a toy to take home to the toddlers whose feet were not yet strong enough for pilgrimage whereupon they would look discontentedly round the baskets of brummagen brass gods the belgianmade rosaries the patent swedish selflighting joss sticks the machinecut oblation cups with which almost every other shop sought to attract custom baskets where a pious pilgrim could purchase a whole pantheon and secure a modicum of divine favourall duly trademarked by christiansfor a few farthings tis not our fault brother suggested a decrepit old brahmin with a wrinkled forehead all seamed with white markings whosquatted in the gutterwas extolling the virtue of the sacred salig ramas made unblushingly out of the ball stoppers of sodawater bottles which lay exposed for sale on a handkerchief in front of him a manchestermade handkerchief printed in the best style with the loves of krishna we get no more than in the old days nay less for see you the thirdclass ticket takes so much and that is the huzoors fee they send it all over the black water to make a mountain of silver in the streets of their big city london oh pious ones buy buy a sacred sinexpeller the monotonous cry was caused by the appearance of a priestled band of pilgrims for as yet the great throng was not when the whole narrow street would be a sea of heads when even the saffron robes would be lost to sight and the only thing visible would be the patient anxious faces seeking redemption that would come on the morrowthe great day meanwhile reverent eyes turned to the bottlestoppers and one or two hands wandered to the little hoard set aside for regeneration which was diminishing so rapidly under the claims of chaplets lights castemarkings sprinkling and miracles there be too many i say reiterated a radical seller of drugs if the sirkar puts a tax on my medicine for the body why not on thine for the soul nay pinsarijee chuckled the privileged wit and gossip of the bazaar a cobbler who satby reason of his low casteat a decent distance even from the crowd of customers which was awaiting a patch on the coverings of feet already worn and weary with their search after righteousness tis a miracle when folk buy of you and that comes not too often even the pilgrims laughed for laughter at a ready gibe comes easily in india yet they too felt inclined to agree with the drugseller one can get blase even in miracles therefore naturally enough when there was a choice they chose the newest ones and the newest of all was jogi gorakhnaths promise of defying tampions and locks and chains and as in other years blessing the crowd of worshippers from his selfinflicted penitentiary inside the teacher of religion and what was more he had kept his promise that very dawn as a kind of walk over the course he had performed the miracle before a select band of pilgrims mostly jogies of his own sect who were now engaged in telling the tale to all and sundry in the city what had occurred was briefly this he had received his followers squatted on the stone steps in front of the gun and had treated them to a dissertation on the mysteries of yoga other less eminent practitioners in the art of miracles he said might have found it necessary to withhold the sight of the sacred person from devoted eyes he however meant to show them his absolute independence of the body he would leave it lying there dead while his soul went inside the gun and blessed the pious ones accordingly his jaw had dropped he had become rigid callous apparently to the prickings of pins with which his assistants strove to make him wince and just as one of them withdrew a dagger covered of course with gore from his very heart a muffled voice of blessing had come from the very bowels of the gun if that was not a miracle what was anyhow it caught on so that as the day grew the growing tide of pilgrims passed by the sideshows run in connection with the pool of immortality by its priests and drifted off to the opposition show leaving the impresarios behind them in a state of rage and despair rage for if this sort of thing continued on the morrow they would lose their years harvest since the host of godseekers were ever the natural prey of priests despair because exposure of what experience told them must be a fraud would only result in counter exposure there must be honour among thieves to make the profession a lucrative one so they met in conclave each with his miserable earnings in his hand to point the dire urgency of action and agreed on the wisdom of finding a catspaw to filch their chestnuts from the fire thus it happened that vincent dering came over to lance carlyons quarters half an hour before the time they had settled to start for the mission house and asked him to look sharp and send round to roshan khan to come along also as he had private informationhere with a laugh he threw a letter on the tablethat miracles were being illegally performed in cantonments and he expected some fun lance laughed also as he read the following to the major general commanding this is to give notice to all concerned that illegible miracles is now being performed by bare men in belly of great gun contrary to astringent orders issued by my lord god therefore your petitioners pray for correct diagnosis of same and removal from cantonment boundaries with exhibitions not to miracle any more by jove he said our petitioner is a medical manhospital dresser i expect not to miracle any morehm his tone changed his honest blue eyes clouded for ever since erda shepherd had told him what her future life was to be the young fellow had been painfully aware that eshwara had wrought a miracle on him that he was no longer content to take life as he found it that already he had begun to look forward and think of what life would be by and by i expect that would be a difficulty in eshwara he went on its an awful place for upsetting the proper odds seems to me impossible toto make a safe book on anything vincent dering shrugged his shoulders he had been in the highest spirits for the last few days a safe book the dullest thing in creation thats why i like eshwara as i remember telling you one cant count upon anything in the topsyturvy placenot even ones self they talk of the mystery of the east by george one is in grips with it here so come along lance and remove miracles from cantonment boundaries at any rate they found the unionjack of paths obliterated by an orderly crowd for every hour almost every minute of the day had brought fresh units to that wearyfooted eagereyed host of pilgrims here and there amongst them was to be seen the hightwined badgeset turban of a policeman ready truncheon in hand to assert the rights of law but not many since the rush of bathers had not yet come and there was small danger to be feared from anything save that keen desire to be cleansed which showed on almost every face as the two englishmen entered however followed by roshan khan on whose features that fierce intolerance of his race for idolaters was written clearly a murmur of tense anticipation ran through the packed courtyard the miracle turn was evidently on it was jogi gorakhnath lay as if dead on the raised stone platform in front of the gun and two assistants were prodding him with pins ive seen that in london said vincent forcing his way rapidly through the yielding crowd so i can hardly object to it here but if there is hankypanky with my gun at that instant a bloody dagger fresh apparently from the jogis heart was held up and a curious hush fell on the courtyard it was broken by a muffled voice unmistakably from within the gun and that was lost in a great roar of applause a miracle a miracle of the gods captain dering who with the others had now reached the centre waited for the roar to subside a little and then his voice rose and seemed to crush it risaldarsahib you have the key of the padlock take out the tampion and see who is inside as he spoke his eyes were on the assistants and something in their defiant assurance warned him that he was on the wrong tack and made him cover possible discomfiture with the wordsif there is no one then someone here has the art of throwing his voice where he will as if in assent the muffled blessing came louder this time from the now untampioned gun so that roshans face showed somewhat scared as with a salute he announced as the result of his inspection there is no one sir i can see clear down the metal butbut the voice is there a sound of such fierce approval ran through the crowd who were within hearing that captain dering saw instantly that it would not be wise to court another failure close up the gun again he said loudly so long as my orders are not disobeyed and people keep their bodies out of my gun their voices are welcome to it come along carlyon he added in english its ventriloquism of course and id dearly like to catch the beast who does it but we had better leave it alone for the present lance who in sudden remembrance of the sound he had heard as he drifted past the bathingsteps in his canoe on the night of the dance had been vainly overhauling the padlock and chain for signs of their having been tampered with nodded his head and let the chain swing back on its staple the sudden jerk threw a new light on the matter for the staple came out disclosing the fact that it had been neatly filed through at the shank and then replaced by means of a drilled hole and a pin the proof of tampering was clear but nothing else i have it said lance suddenly coming up with a red but triumphant face from a prolonged inspection down the huge muzzle theyve shoved in a false end and theres someone behind roshan go back and fetch me my long gaff and roshanmy cleaning rod and tell the guard to come out at once added captain dering heedful of the rising note of movement amongst the crowd sign that it was growing restless stay ive got a ripping idea cried lance again his face all abeam with delightdelight so catching that the crowd stilled as he turned to it look here he said confidentially in hindustani theres a boy in this gun it must be a boy and rather a small one for there isnt room for anything big now isnt there a boy anywhere about the same size whod like to come and draw him he will be heads this way and you will be able to get a good grip of his hair and he will get a grip of yours andand it will bebe jolly the untranslatable word needed no translation that something in the perfection of careless youth which touches the hearts of all mankind put lance and his audience in touch instantly a group of tall graveeyed sikhs laughed uproariously and nudged a lad beside them go on brotherling they said thou art the best wrestler of the school go show the huzoor how thou canst hold thine own it needed no more yea try thy luck brotherling said a dozen voices and if thou canst not we will find a champion that settled it five minutes afterwards lance carlyon found himself arranging the conditions of the draw surrounded by half a dozen lads each backed by eager supporters by this time roshan had returned and with the aid of the gaff and one of the smallest of the guard lances guess had been proved to be true a neatly fitting disc of metal cupshaped to increase the resemblance to the end of the barrel had been withdrawn leaving a head visible it is beautifully tousled and youll get a good grip said lance regretfully as he helped the sikh champion into the gun but it is bigger than i thought for and youll have your work cut out for you then ensued the quaintest scene imaginable the whole crowd but five minutes before ready almost to fight for the truth of their miracle were swaying breathless excited in sheer childish delight over the tussle to expose it lo he comesi see his toesbravo gurdit nay the other hath strength left sho sonling let not go for thy life that is well donebravo bravo so backwards and forwards like a terrier and a badger the draw wavered lance watch in hand calling time half a minute more go it gurdit he shouted the encouragement had its effect gurdits toes his ankles his calves showed beyond the gun only his knees remained giving him grip still wait for his knees wait till he loses grip shouted lancetwenty seconds morefifteen tenfthere you are thats it fair fair it was the knees pressing outwards steadily every bronze muscle of them showing the strength of the drag lost grip and with a great yell of delight halfadozen bearded sikhs had hold of gurdits feet with such a vigorous pull that lance had to shove his knee forward in a hurry to prevent the boy from falling on his face since both his hands were locked desperately in the tangled hair of a disciple so big that he came out of the gun with a cloop like a cork it was the most sporting draw ive seen for years said lance enthusiastically when after much laughter and congratulation the crowd parted with smiles to let the englishmen pass and im glad you let the beggar off dering it wasnt his fault and he must have been beastly uncomfortable now if you could have quodded the jogi i hope to do that by and by replied vincent significantly but it was just as well the crowd should laugh today these religious gatherings are always a bit riskyand as you know dillon is having trouble over at the gaol pon my soul i dont know which is worst to managefifteen hundred scoundrels or a hundred and fifty thousand saints a hundred and fifty echoed lance will there be as many as that quite so it is as well they should laugh for even with the extra contingent of police we should find it a bit hard to manage them if they didnt true but unfortunately the laughter of the many involves the discomfiture of the few and in this case these were the most unscrupulous men in eshwara chapter xv oh dem golden slippers if i were a mani would fight the words were spoken by erda shepherd as the two young men entered the drawingroom of the mission house let me fight for you said captain dering in his most ornate style as in the pause following on the interruption of their arrival he went forward to shake hands my sword is always at the service of the ladies then a certain feeling as of electricity in the air a certain look on the faces round himfor most of the mission workers had already arrivedwarned him that this was no jesting matter and he continued in better taste i trust there is nothing wrong wrong echoed erda who in a mechanical absolutely indifferent manner was shaking hands with lance yes grievously wrongher voice was almost strident in its decisionhideously wrong here dr james campbell who had been laying down the law to a group of other black coats came up and put the telegram he was holding into captain derings hand perhaps you can explain this he said severely we generally have to thank the military authorities for such interference not in this case so far as i am concerned replied vincent after a glance at the first sentence then he read on everyone else in the room silent expectant it was from the commissioner saying that from private information given him he regretted that in the interests of peace he must as magistrate forbid any street preaching or public profession of faith during the next two days feeling was running high in many ways and it was necessary to be extremely cautious i can assure you sir said vincent handing back the telegram i am not the informant at the same timehere he faced about to the room generallyi think the commissioner is right our government is neutral neutral interrupted the reverend david campbell whose blonde face was flushed with excitement if it were neutral we would not complain but does this prohibition extend to the priests of other religions no a thousand times no it is only another instance of the fact that we who have the strongest claim on a christian government possibly put in captain dering but i am only a soldier i do not ask questions i obey and we are soldiers too said dr campbell weightily and our orders are to be instant in season and out of season a little murmur of approval ran through the company there was a militant look on every face a militant ring in every voice as they discussed what ought to be done the women workers with erda at their head went solid for defianceonly mrs campbell making the reservation if james approved so did some of the men notably david campbell who passed from one group to another his pale blue eyes aglisten with enthusiasm erdas followed him with such approval that lance crossed over pugnaciously to where she stood with a pretty flush on her cheeks listening it is a pity you havent got jean ziskas drum miss shepherd he said by jove how you would bang it then right or wrong there would be a high old row and that would just suit me there can scarcely sir lancelotshe paused on the title with a strain after contempt which did not somehow come offbe a question as to right or wrong in this case he gave a kindly almost indulgent laugh there never can be really of course one is bound to be right the other wrong the mischief is to know tother from which now i expect the sixty thousand nobles and the grandmaster who were left dead on the field and the two thousand poor devils who got drowned in the river besides and all the othersyou know about em of course and you must admit he was a bloodthirsty chap at any ratehad got a musical instrument of some sort too you cant fight without a band miss shepherd specially drums and fifes but jean ziska was blind so he could only hear his own music and i hear it too she said superbly with all the more defiance because his words touched her innate sense of justice as they did so often as she spoke the not unusual soundconsidering that one side of the mission house gave on the cityof a native tomtom drifted in through the open window causing lancelots eyes to brim over with smiles that isnt it anyhow is it miss shepherd he said i saw that drumbanger as i came past just nowthe funniest old dried stick of a brahmin you ever set eyes on and you know those round the mulberry bush fairyring endless circles of men and women hand in hand we used to cut out of newspaper when we were kids well he was using gilt paper and trying to make a miracle out of the biz one god he said in many the outline being the same and the eye of faith sufficient to fill in the details of divinity the people were buying them by dozens for the half of nothing i asked em why and they said as toys for their children so i expect it will be the endless circle of boys and girls againdont you for you know he went on in the confidential voice which dimly she recognized was for her alone ive never been able to find out the least difference in kids i talk to the little beggars when im out shooting you know andwell the boys are just as much boys as i used to be used to be yet once again for the hundredth time at least since they had first met barely a month ago his youth his boyish wholehearted healthy zest in life made her eyes soft made her feel with all the true womanhood in her that if she ever had a son she prayed he might be like this and something else she recognizednot for the first time either namely that boyish almost thoughtless as he was puzzling himself not at all with the problems of life you could never dip below the surface without finding him as it were there before you finding him cleareyed ready to treat the shady side of things as he treated the light side that is with an absolutely limpid honesty so as she stood silent checked in her desire to check father ninian who had just entered with laila came up to greet her and having done so turned to lance with kind eyes and voice captain dering has just told me that we have to call you sir lancelot carlyon i am sorry for the cause since your uncle was a man who made the world better by being in itasas you will it is a fine old name sir lancelot it carries with it a fine inheritance of honour therefore i can wish no better wish for the world as well as for yourself than that you may hand it on to your son so peace be with you his clasped hands unfolded themselves for a space as he passed on leaving those two once more standing together with that sense of being singled out for friendship which had come to them in the beginning and this was to be the end of it even to her it seemed impossible to him it made the impossibility certain miss shepherd he said suddenly i have something i must say to you this afternoon come into the verandah after you have done pouring out the tea and let me say it there was so much of command in his voice that she might have resented it had not father ninians voice risen at that moment firmly yet with its usual faint hesitancy in words which made everyone in the room pause to listen i and i only am responsible dr campbell i gave the commissioner the information on which he has acted here he raised his hand against interruption i have been fifty years at eshwara fifty times have i seen the pilgrims pass to the cradle of the gods listening peacefully to your preaching but this year there is something new he paused to put on his spectacles yet the keenness they brought to his face was dimmed by wistfulness i cannot quite tell what it is there is something beyond the things i know though these are manysmall it is true but cumulative still this is certain the pulse of the people beats irregularly today and that means danger to the body corporate it may pass yet the faintest stimulus may upset the whole balance of the organism so my friends as our cause is eternal as we have time time interrupted david campbell passionately but now is the appointed time think sir how many of these poor deluded souls striving after salvation may die upon the road to their false godsnone can know how many better than you who the old priest looked at the young one with a whole lifetime of sad wisdom in his face yes he said softly for i am very old i have seen half a world die upon its road to the cradle of the gods diethough we have not the courage to say sowith their faces set to the eternal goal of humanity to the finding of something we have lost and something keeps us all back what is it have we the secret more than they who say as we do that it is sin his voice had fallen into a strangely musical rhythm so that dr campbells following it seemed harsh indeed we know we have we have the certaintywe are missionaries of that certainty and ito my shame be it said interrupted father ninian with a curious return to worldly courtesy as he removed his spectacles have never tried to make a convert therefore i can scarcely hope to persuade you but if gentlemen i might be allowed to talk the matter over with you a most sensible suggestion assented dr campbell looking round on his younger less experienced colleagues i should be loth to act hastily and give occasion to the scoffer mamma will you send our tea into the dining room the pure practicality of the last words seemed to relieve the general tension and vincent deringwho had been looking horribly boredseeing the piano open sat down to it as the dissentients moved off into their cave of adullam and began to play la donna e mobile saying with a laugh cherchez la femme depend upon it mrs campbell there is a woman at the bottom of it i know from personal experience that she is always fatal to my peace and pulse on any road erda shepherd holding her head very high crossed over to pour out the tea whereupon vincent being mischievously inclined suddenly changed the tune to whereer you walk which he played daintily purely altogether charmingly so causing muriel smith who had lately joined the party to relax her faint frown at his remark miss shepherd objects he went on provokingly she doesnt believe in men fighting for women she scorned the offer of my sword in favourexcuse me for having overheardof some drum or another what was it miss shepherd i really only heard lance say you would like to bang it erda flushed all over her face i was only alluding to jean ziskas drum which was sounded to call the hosts of the lord to arms mrs campbell gave a fine hearty shudder my dear she said why can ye not leave that gruesome tale alone for its just an awful tale mrs smith as if he could not be content with doing his duty in this life but must leave his skin behind for the next generation we have biblical warranty for that sort of thing mrs campbell said the sharpvoiced lady who owned the small black coat elijah left his mantle hoots interrupted mrs campbell scornfully we all have to leave our bodywear but a skins different altogether it soud just have gone to the grave with him honest man dust to dust ashes to ashes ive often heard dr james say there was nothing in the world for tying the hands o the leevin like dead mens dispositions theyre just a mortification indeed to a concerned there was always something about the good ladys comfortable commonsense which made further discussion difficult and the talk wandered into less rugged paths until the time for leisure from erdas duties as teamaker being close at hand lance went out deliberately into the verandah which overhung the river or rather the spit of sandbank which jutted out from this the turningpoint of the citys triangle on the right the wall set with its temple spires trended away to meet the bridge on the left to join the line of the palace the bathingsteps the fort in front of him as he stood leaning over the balustrade at the western end of the verandah lay dull streaks of sand bright gleams of water and beyond themdim mysteriouswas the great level plain of india on whose scarce distinguishable edge the sun was setting behind a bank of deep purple cloud it was a long low almost level bank outlined sharply against the sea of goldengreen light above it there was scarcely a hint of sunset fire save in a trailing chain of little fleecy golden flocks which stretched away from the purple of the clouds into the deepening purple of clear sky overhead lance waiting watched that clear almost level outline until as clouds do when gazed at fixedly it took shape for him as the body of a dead warrior halfcovered by a pall the straight sweep yonder was the shield still held upon the arm the peak of shadow below it was the mailed feet there was the curve of the throat the head thrown back the feathery plumes of the helmet the whole world seemed his bier the stars just trembling into sight the watchlights round it do you see he asked as erda joined him from the great deep to the great deep he goes she recognized the quotation and though she had come out full of determination to deny the glamour of their mutual comprehension it claimed her in a second yes she answered quickly and pointing to the trailing drift of cloudlets added bound by gold chains about the feet of god he turned to look at her then forgetting fancy in a sudden certainty i thought i had something to tell you he said but i think you know it already dont you yes she answered held captive still by that inevitable understanding i think i do he paused a moment then going back to the now fading likeness of that dead king of the dead continued then that ends it soso far as i am concerned but it remains as an excuse for my asking a question miss shepherd why are you going to marry your cousin she had known this was coming for a great many reasons she began boldly then paused wishing for the first time that these reasons had been fewer feeling that the possession of but one would have made speech easier to begin with it has been the dream of my life he turned on her with an amaze which was almost ludicrous what to marry him she frowned angrily no to workto helpto give my sympathyto stand hand in hand with someone who as he does gives himself as i do to the great work to someone whose life will be minewhom i can respect and admire andand lovein the best sense of the word her voice gaining confidence from its own statements rose almost passionately lance looked at her with his clear eyes and nodded yes i quite understand but what has that to do with marrying him how will thethe great work be furthered by your having to look after the house and all that and it isnt as if you couldnt give the help and sympathy without marrying a fellow even the loveat least i think so now i want to marry you because yes she said severely as he pausedshe felt glad to change places with him in the witness box because to begin with it doesnt seem possible for me to live my lifei mean my everyday life trying to rub along you know without doing any harm keeping things going asas my people have always kept them unless you help me and then he paused againfrom the first moment i saw you you reminded me he paused so long this time that a faint wonder as to what he was going to say next made her heart beat as she watched him leaning over the balcony looking dreamily at that fading likeness of a dead king of the dead i dont suppose anyone had a happier jollier childhood than i had he said suddenly though i was an orphan i lived at tregarthen you know he turned to her as he spoke and smiled you should have seen my grandfather and grandmother miss shepherd they were like the double christmas number of an illustrated paper she used to boast that she never saw a naughty child and she never did for the dear old lady always walked out of the room promptly when we tried it on i remember it used to take the starch out awfully having no audience but it was the same in everything it beat even a boy to be really bad in that house somehow yes we had jolly times you would have liked ityou would like it nowhe turned swiftly and held out both handscome to itcome and be lady carlyon as she was people may say all that means nothing but it means everything to a woman to be able to count on an inheritance like that for her he broke off as some of the others came out into the balcony and bending closer to her went on in a low voice ive said nothing of my loveyou know all thatand i thinkyes his voice took a note of certaintyi think youyou like me well enoughdont you there was something so truthcompelling in his face his voice that she felt thankful for the tepid word like i like you very much sir lancelot she said trying not to let her voice betray the absolute tenderness she felt but as you told me just now that is no reason why i should marry you it is at least as good as yours for marrying him he broke in quickly at least it has to do with youwith mewith our happinesswith mine at any rate do you remember when you first told me your namethe worlds desire i called itthe woman with the redgold hair the redgold hem to her garment the redgold apple in her handyou are that to meerda give me my hearts desire his voicelow quick passionatethrilled through her she saw herself as she had seen herself then yes it has to do with you with me she echoed desperately but only we two no he interruptedwith more than that surely in the pause which followed one vision faded in another and her own wish that if she ever had a son he might be as this man came to make her remember father ninians words i can wish no better wish for the world but father ninian could not have said so to her she could do better for the world in the other life the other work the very selfsacrifice of it attracted her vague though the sense of that was as yet sir lancelot she said at last i am very sensible of the honour dontfor heavens sake he interrupted that isexcuse mebunkum she felt glad of the faint resentment which came to her aid i am all the same she continued but it is impossible perhaps if i did not look forward as i do perhaps if i only sought happiness but she clasped her hands tightly and the militant look came back to her facei am sworn to another workthe noblest work of allto bring light to those that sit in darkness lance gave an odd little laugh full of bitterness you leave me out in the black night anyhow he said true enough in one way for the quick dusk had closed in around them but as he spoke a great white shaft of light like a moonray shot almost as if in denialwidening on its way from the shadowy stretches beyond the river shot waveringly as if uncertain until focussing itself full on the verandah it turned the dusk to day the searchlight cried mrs smith clapping her daintily gloved little hands eugene will be so pleased he couldnt positively swallow a mouthful at lunch because when he thought all was right something went wrong thats why he didnt come miss shepherd she added for the light had effectually joined the scattered groups into one i positively couldnt tear him away but i made him promise to turn the thing on here if he succeeded and he has isnt it splendid mrs campbell looked doubtful its just too much like the last day comin unawares and makin a things manifest for my taste an i wonder what dr james will say to it i wonder what the natives will say to it said vincent dering looking across at lance say echoed the tart lady i know what they should saythat of course we know a great deal more than they do and besides added a new and gushing voice it is so beautifully suggestively true we have the light we can light them oh but that is such a bother came laila bonaventuras fullthroated tones i hate having to see things i dont care to see i much prefer to have my own candle dont you she had been finding it dull work waiting for her guardians return from the dining room even though vincent had now and again found opportunity for a word or look he took advantage of one now to say it will be pleasanter by and by wont it we must settle the time before you leave what time asked muriel smith who happened to overhear his undertone she had been vaguely curious at their apparent avoidance of each other their occasional lapses into familiarity ever since she had challenged them at the viceroys party time echoed vincent coolly of that new song of course come in miss bonaventura let us decide about it the girl swept up her long lashes solemnly i should think a twelve beat would be best really it is safer when there are so many accidental notes his face as he led the way to the piano was a study if she had lived her life in a vaudeville at the folies bergeres she could scarcely have been more at home in intrigue yet her absolute sincerity and unconsciousness of wrongdoing was as palpable on the whole he felt vexed the more so because the vaudeville dialogue proved unnecessary since a sudden concentration of the party to hear the verdict of the adullamites who at that moment came out of the dining room would have given them ample time for more dignified conversation erda was in the front rank of the eager little crowd her hopes her enthusiasms heightened by the deliberate choice she had just made when dr campbell as the recognized head began to speak they had come unanimously to the conclusion he said that absolute revolt at this late hour would be unwise whether father ninian bruce was justified by the circumstances in his adverse report was another matter personally he denied it nor did he propose that they should sit down quietly under the interference they were only forbidden to preach in eshwara therefore they had come again unanimously to the resolution of leaving eshwara for the time in a body it would be a solemn protest and they could thus render both to caesar and to god since they could preach at other pilgrim stations on the road it would be a noble protest which was certain of proving blessed the words roused no little enthusiasm mingled with undoubted relief in most cases but erda standing beside her cousin said in an undertone did you assent to that david i suggested it he answered in a louder voice not without some selfsatisfaction it appeared to me to meet the exigencies of the case admirably and it will be very useful let me tell you at home it will emphasize the difficulties and dangers we have to contend against it will show our meek reasonableness and then he looked round with a jubilant smileit seems to me such a beautiful idea that the only result of this attempt to gag us will be that the thousands of poor benighted souls will have a chance of hearing the truth in many places instead of one but erdas voice broke in on the hum of applause almost harshly filling the room with its defiance i think it cowardly i would fightif i were a man you would beat jean ziskas drum laughed vincent dering rising from the music stool where he had been holding lailas hand under cover of the new songan occupation which always made him feel as if all the wine of life had gone to his head you refused my sword just now miss shepherd so i place my drumstick at your disposal so with a reckless gaiety he seized on a painted tambourine which good mrs campbell had hung as an ornament on the wallit was bedaubed with two white lilies and a butterfly rampantand catching up a teaspoon from the table he began to sing in his pretty lightcomedy voice oh dem golden slippers while the tambourine under his skilful drumming throbbed to the words golden slippers on a golden stair golden slippers on my tired feet golden slippers dat we all mus wear becos dey are so sweet he sang well he played better and both voice and drumming echoed out through the open windows they are singing in the missen said the people in the courtyard to the pilgrims who were still gathering to the miracles like moths round a candle it is not wise to listen folk become as they are if they do some of the pilgrims laughed and some stopped their ears but even so the throbbing of the tambourine was in the air golden slippers on a golden stair golden slippers on my tired feet golden slippers dat we all mus wear chapter xvi echoes if the twopennyhalfpenny tambourinewhich had been bedaubed with its white lilies and rampant butterfly by a suburban maiden lady for a mission sale and remaining over from that had been bought in at half price by mrs campbell for the adornment of her drawingroomhad been indeed jean ziskas famous drum eshwara could hardly have been more restless than it was on the night after vincent dering had sung oh dem golden slippers to its accompaniment the tune had occurred to him in an instant without thought simply as one he had sung more than once when doing bones and tambourine in a nigger troupe at a soldiers singsong he had meant nothing by it and yet the words golden slippers on a golden stair golden slippers dat wese got to wear fitted their environment that atmosphere of effort after something beyond above the real the actual the inevitable climbing of a golden stair the inevitable wearing of the golden shoes the inevitable search after the golden gates which found will open upon paradise true the paradise differed to each pair of yearning eyes and weary feet but the longing for it as a personal gain spiritual or bodily was identical for paradise is the desire of the world still whether men find it in the good they lost or the love which lost it for them and in eshwara that night the desire rose strenuously militantly erda packing her boxes in haste since she and her aunt had arranged to start with the others at dawn felt as if she had at last closed her hand firmly on the plough there could be no looking back now the golden slippers were on her feet the golden stairs before her the golden gates within sight she had said goodby to lance without a quiver she even smiled softly tenderly as she set an unopened deal box to go with her others it was one which the reverend david had brought with him from england and which had been made over to her not without nods and winks smiles and suspicions of tears from her aunt for it contained the wedding dress it was a moravian wedding dress of the old style to suit erdas fancy and she had been quite anxious to see the delicate white muslin robe and the quaint little cap with its bunch of orange blossoms which was to mark her as both bride and matron but it had seemed a pity in careful mrs campbells opinion to unpack it only to repack it and run the needless risk of crushing its daintiness so there in its box it lay still untouched unseen there would be real orange blossoms and to spare the girl told herself with a smile in the garden at herrnhut for so the summer restingplace of the mission had been called in deference to the moravian extraction of those who had built it and started the christian settlement in the tiny valley in which it stood this lay some thirty miles up the hara beyond the first range of hills and the river fresh from its mad rush from the snows beyond ran through it slackly peacefully before beginning its long swift yet smooth slide down the dark ravine which cleft the outer range until it ended in the plains at eshwara it was at herrnhut that every year in turns of two months during the hot weather the missionaries exchanged work in the bazaars for the lighter labor of the agricultural settlement naturally therefore it was looked on as a sort of holiday house but this year it would be something more it would be the headquarters of fight the centre of the resistance which was to use the commissioners order to cease firing as an excuse for a more determined skirmishing for it stood right on the pilgrims road indeed erda and the other rebels would have to travel a good eightandtwenty miles along that very road itself before coming to the slack water where they could cross the river by a ferry and finish their journey through the level fields on its further side to herrnhut with its homelike peaceful surroundings the memory of them came to erda making her sense of that inevitable climbing of the golden stair after righteousness more acute since she had to face a goodby to them also and sooner than she had expected for the breaking up of winter work a week earlier than usual owing to this secular interference had made david eager to begin anew plead for a speedier wedding so there were only two or three days left at most the knowledge however brought her no doubt it helped her rather to a greater certainty she had done right her feet were indeed upon the golden stair and in the other houses of the mission where everyone was disregarding sleep in the striving after something that was more to them than sleep the atmosphere was electric also the thoughts militant so they were in the streets the alleys of the town for on the bridge of boatsthat bridge which spanned the broad expanse of water between the city and the great plain of indiathe pilgrims were passing now in an unending streamto take up their places as near as might be to the pool of immortality where with the dawn the water would rise miraculously for the cleansing of sin hari hara hara hari the cry was almost incessant but the eye could see little for the moon was young the night dark hara hari hari hara hour after hour it came that cry on the dread creator the dread destroyer monotonous patient almost indifferent yet absolutely insistent the goldenshod feet of the pilgrims after whose souls the missionaries yearned were on the golden stair also and their golden gates would open at the cradle of the gods must open hidden though the goal was by mist when it was day by darkness when it was night what matter if it was hidden for the goldshod feet might falter and fall ere that goal was reached but the hidden spring of cleansing at the pool of immortality was theirs it would rise at dawn rise as it did always every year hara hari hari hara what matter birth or death if the finding of that lost paradise of purity was certain out on the bridge whence the cry came oftenest there was no doubt regarding this certainty but as each weary pair of feet stumbled on the first stones of the town it stumbled into an atmosphere in which nothing seemed sure save that there was change that eshwara was not what it had been to begin with it held soldiers wherefore and why had dead women been sent back to it by mother ganges to curse the men whose love had killed them but what wonder when the very logs the fishes were stolen from the river nowadays and from the people also then what of this strange new light the light which fed on mens brainsthat came and went at pleasurethat was quite small at first when but seven or eight men had been sacrificed but which only an hour or so agone had showed in a huge ray feeling here and there through the darkness for god knows what then settling on it making it impossible to hide aught prying into the very holiest of holies had it not shot into mother kalis very temple and shown the worshippers that two of her mighty arms were stuck on with sealing wax what god would stand that and how could the very gods themselves work miracles if everybody could see how they were done they had already refused to work them for pious jogi gorakhnath what wonder the gods did not like laughter especially the laughter of mllechas therefore who was to tell if the spring would even rise in the pool so those who were wise would make certain of at least a modicum of salvation and go straight to the bathingsteps since the river anyhow must be there this suggestion of a cautious hedge was diligently spread by the bathingghat priests among the new arrivals who listened patiently but so they did also to the other priests whose business it was to scorn the possibility of failure and to deny the displeasure of the gods to say that jogi gorakhnath had been found out by the huzoors in one of his usual tricks that was all so that people who wanted the genuine article and a real good old crusted miracle had better come as usual to the pool the wearyfooted anxiouseyed climbers of the golden stairs listened patiently silently even when the antagonists began in vehement quarrel to bandy threats and hint at worse portents to come to their experience their hope it seemed impossible even to dream their pilgrimage in vain the dawn would show anyhow so hour by hour minute by minute the tide of pilgrims set citywards till it brimmed over with faith and hope and these are dangerous things when charity depends on them and there are antagonistic claims to every alms so eshwara was restless over in the gaol also by which the goldenshod feet passed so closely with their heartstirring cry it seemed as if vincent derings thrumming following as it did on the heels of eugene smiths success with the search light had set what dr dillon called his hosts of the devil in commotion indeed that thrumming was still going on when george dillon had gone raging over to conjure the experimenter with oaths to turn off his confounded bullseye at once or the prisoners would go out of their judgment with thinking of the number who would have to die that night in order to keep up the supply of brain powerjust too as he had been congratulating himself that the cholera scare was over seventytwo hours and not a case it was too bad eugene whom he found on the roof of his house playing with coils batteries accumulators had suggested eagerly that if there was real trouble he might end it by turning his light bang on to the gaol and so reducing it to a paralysis of sheer terror dr dillon however had sworn violently that he would not have the poor wretches frightened unnecessarily especially when that triumphant cry of those who were free to defy the devil by seeking sanctification before death reminded them that they could notthat they must die defiled helpless hopeless that fear was he said in a way dignified worthy of consideration and he did not anticipate trouble unless there was treachery inside or out though perhaps he might as a precaution ask dering for an extra guard but when the latter happened to come in as mrs smiths escort home while the doctor was still there dr dillon apparently changed his mind anyhow he poohpoohed captain derings offer to send one saying the more you could keep a gaol to yourself the betteror for the matter of that anything else so with a curt goodnight to mrs smith he went back to his work leaving vincent to remark carelessly that dillon seemed in a bad temper at which muriel smiled there was something in the air she said conducive to bad temper she herself felt she must soon have quarrelled with the doctors assumption of knowing better than anyone else so it was as well he had not stopped to dinner her quarrelsomeness did not however extend to vincent who did indeed she made herself so tenderly charming and unconsciously friendly towards him that he began to accuse himself of having been too irresponsive of late the fact of being in love did not preclude friendship for someone else if indeed he was really in love with laila bonaventura in one way he knew himself to be so but the idea of treating this love of his on conventional lines was still repugnant to him the thought of her as his wife barely attractive so after a time spent pleasantly enough for those two eugene smith went off to his coils and accumulators and batteries halfsulky halfbored and wholly illused at having to switch off when he had at least half an hours electricity all ready stored for use he was grumbling over this fact when vincent called goodnight to him before starting to drive back and he answered that but for fools who were afraid of going to their proper place he might have given dering electric light on the road no thanks cried vincent gaily theres enough electricity in the air tonight without that i believe your machine has leaked smith i feel as if i should give out sparks if anyone touched me as he drove across the bridge eshwara looked as if it were doing that too there were lights everywhere twinkling little restless lights the very spit usually dark with the darkness of primitive life after sundown was alive with them for the pilgrims were camping there as elsewhere nor were all the fisher folk abed as usual for that surely was one of them paddling up stream on a dugoutjust under the last span of the bridge he saw the man distinctly not five yards from him in the flash of the lamps as he drove past overhead and wondered what the mischief the fellow was doing at that time of night going up stream something to be ashamed of no doubt else why should he have sent the dugout beyond the circle of light with a swift stroke truly father ninian was right eshwara was not normal its pulse beat irregularly and things were going on which should not be going on a sudden shame made him glance at the shadowed pile of the palace looming above the shadowed town it was all dark save for one row of restless twinkling lights those were the little latticed windows of lailas sittingroom that was fit for any kings favourite he had seen it already might see it again at twelve if she was in one of her reckless moods when she would risk anything for his sake truly there were things going on but this was between themselves this could hurt no one by and by of course he would insist on a commonplace engagement and a wedding yes a commonplace wedding he had despite his vague repugnance to her origin made up his mind to that no one but an utter cad could take what he was taking and then shake his bridle rein and ride away but for the present it was the most absolutely perfect bit of romance in his whole life he could not would not give it up laila was right this was the essence as a rule people mixed love diluted it were vaguely ashamed of its absorbing influence but when you came to analyze even the diluted feeling its virtue lay in this irrational content this desire for nothing better than this best of pleasuresthis paradise of a womans or a mans love he laughed suddenly at the memory of lailas quick grasp of his meaning when muriel had overheard his remark about the time such quickness in the latter would have made him revolt from it but with laila it was different a passionate gratitude to the girl to whom fear remorse the very possibility of change seemed unknown rose up and claimed him dear little girl she was so absolutely singleminded in her love for him how could anyone expect him to forego the luxury of such love yet awhile in thinking laila singleminded vincent thought the truth so far as he was concerned if love passionate as juliets and far more innocent in one way far more ruse in another ever existed hers was that love nevertheless its very integrity made her curiously cunning in regard to anything which threatened to disturb that idyll in the garden so at that very moment when vincent looked up at her windows asserting her absolute lack of pretence and singlemindedness she was pitting her wits against old akbar khan in a manner worthy of her grandmother anari begum since akbar far more than her guardian was to be feared the latter honest man went to his bed beyond the chapel at ten of the clock precisely but akbar who from ancient habit was given to prowling about at night and napping in odd corners had many chances of discovery during the last few days however when she for her own purposes had let him talk he had become so garrulous regarding his past that she had recognized in him an unscrupulous confidant with whom in face of the possibility of requiring one it was wise to remain on terms so as she lounged on the sofa she listened to his endless talk with tolerance nay she interrupted at last if as thou sayest she will she brings me more dresses and jewels she may call me begum and hint at my being one really a thousand times over why not begum and princess are the same and my greatgrandmother in italy was that pidar narayan told me so today the memory of the old mans voice when with newfound courage she had questioned him concerning those old days made her eyes soft yes he would he must understand so by and by when vincent and she were tired of playing romeo and juliet the story of the starcrossed lovers had been her only reading since vincent had taken to quoting so much from it they would make pidar narayan play friar laurence and marry them on the sly that would be so much more amusing than a regular wedding he could not refuse since he had once loved as she loved you could hear that in his voice after how many yearsfifty or sixty and the princess had of course loved also in exactly the same way laila felt sure of it that curious inexpressible feeling had come to her also laila trying to formulate that feeling slipping her heel idly in and out of her dainty little bronze shoe as she lounged suddenly remembered vincents song to the tambourine and laughed that was it golden feet upon a golden stair that expressed it exactly two pair of feet going side by side up a golden stair to golden gates so contented ah god how content seeking something claiming something yet still content that feeling came sometimes when you were saying your prayers a sort of yearning for a sort of satisfaction in something that was not you so surely if it came then there could be no harm in it harm the very sisters allowed that you must love the man you were going to marry and she and vincent would be married by and by and live happily for that was better than having a statue of pure gold erected to you in the meantime secrecy so long as vincent wished to play romeo and juliet was her cue therefore the more she could blind old akbar the more he could be turned on a wrong track the better especially when the turning was so delightfully ridiculous she managed however not to laugh her childish love of mischief into mumtaza mahals very face when after much shrinking into white sheets held up as screens and quick cuddlings into corners at the faintest suspicion of a possible peep that good lady in her very very best pink satin continuations was ushered in through the dark deserted passages of the palace to lailas boudoir for despite the amusement the girls heart was beating fast with determination to climb her golden stairs without interruption so she allowed herself to be kowtowed to and called begumsahiba and she accepted the new dress and jewels without protest eagerly in fact since they were far more gorgeous than the first and caught her taste better the former indeed had been roshan khans own choice dictated by his acquired knowledge of the sort of things memsahibs admired these latter were her grandmothers purely entirely oriental the difference was great put briefly this was the costume in which anari begum had flouted the nawab the other that in which she had caught bunavatars fancy laila took up one of the heavy gorgeous glittering garments it smelt strongly of musk attar of roses and jasmin and she snuffed at it with a smile that was ever so much better than the dull lavender water which was the only scent her guardian said a lady could use vincent would like that he like she did loved strong scents if only the stupid old frumpish thing would go away in time she would put on that dress at once and so give him pleasure that was all her thought as she sat with a happy smile her face halfburied in a tiny threecornered corselet of scarlet net embroidered in seed pearls mumtaza and akbar khan winked at each other and lailas sharp eyes catching this brimmed over with laughter she felt glad the rest of her face was hidden until she was grave enough to reply graciously to the hints the suggestions for mumtaza had been bound over by oaths not to go too fast and she obeyed her instructions even so akbar khan listening with folded hands in a mantislike attitude his angles all crushed together into humility wondered if he was standing on his head or his heels as he heard laila admit gravely that she was certainly in a way the head of the family in that she possessed its land but that of course roshan was really the heir that it had given her great gratification to see how thoroughly he had adopted english ways that of course it would be impossible for him to marry an uneducated cow of a girl here for a moment she had relapsed to sincerity in order to remark that it must be impossible to love a person you had not seen and that for her part she knew in an instant if she was going to like or dislike people if the latter she tried never to see them really again then remembering her part she had resumed it hastily by saying that no doubt she would see more of her cousinwho by the way was very nicelookingin the future as he was quite in society old mumtaza had hard work at this juncture to prevent herself from cracking all her fingerjoints over the girls head for luck and wishing her a numerous offspring while akbar gave a gasp that was not all pleasure he felt that he was being rushed that the crisis might come before he was ready for it at this rate pidar narayan would have no chance of dying at this rate roshan khans castle in the air must topple over from sheer lack of foundation to such a lofty structure as he trotted back beside mumtazas curtained dhooli to that little parasite of a house against the palace wall where he knew roshan was waiting for the upshot of the interview his one consolation was that bowstrings were out of fashion in truth there was no more restless man in eshwara that night than roshan khan the desire for this paradise had grown overwhelming and as he listened to his grandmother while akbar pointed each triumphant appeal of the old ladys with a helpless gereebpunwas his face grew pale with emotion until at the mention of his good looks and lailas desire to see him he turned fiercely to the gobetween and bade him fix a time the sooner the better akbar felt inclined to tell the truth then to admit that he had never breathed a word of roshans pretensions to the misssahiba and that so far the negotiations only existed in his own imaginings but the look on roshans facehe had seen it often in his youth in connection with women and sacks and bowstringsreduced him to protestations he would do his best he said but with pidar narayan it would be difficult to manage roshan strode about the little courtyard like a wild beast in a cage biting his mustache and thinking then he turned to the old phrasemonger i have settled it before dawn tomorrownot this dawn that is too nigh on us nowbut the next thou shalt let me into the garden thou knowest the little balcony which was not lit up i will stay there waiting till she come for an early walk among the flowers that can be managed then if the coast is clear we can meet and talk if not there is no harm done for i can slip into the stream and swim back that will be best since it is not possible by day and at night the mems do not receive visitors as we do without reproach roshans knowledge of etiquette was sound yet at that very moment laila ablaze with gold and jewels was meeting her lovers eyes with a happy laugh whats in a dress she paraphrased it is no part of me was it not never had vincent seen her look like this so absolutely desirable so perfectly adorable he caught her in his arms and kissed her the heavy scent upon her dress assailed him she looked up into his eyes and laughed but trust me gentleman ill prove more true she whispered than those who have more cunning to be strange juliet he whispered back lost in his own mad passion juliet their goldshod feet were upon the golden stairs the gates of paradise were before them chapter xvii the pool of immortality hara hari hari hara the cry was incessant now for there was a glint of light in the east and the hosts of pilgrims to the cradle of the gods were cramming almost to solidity each street and alley in eshwara which could be said by however long and tortuous a detour to give access to that small tank where at dawn the miraculous waters of cleansing would rise as they always did on this the great day of atonement in the sea of slightly upturned faces upturned in the vain hope of seeing over the heads of those in front the most noticeable thing was the expression of mingled eagerness and patience and this was most noticeable in those who stood nearest to the bamboo railing which had been erected in a square some four feet from the first step downwards as a precaution against a dangerous rush on all sides and in consequence a dangerous crush on those steep steps the only entrance to them therefore was by a sort of double sheeppen at the end nearest the town by means of which when the time came some fifty bathers would be admitted to the railed square from the inner pen their places in which would be taken by the fifty in the outer one their places in turn being filled by fifty from the general crowd by which double check no more than fifty could stand at one time with no barrier between their mortality and immortality the railing itself was guarded every two yards by a yellowlegged constable and at the sheeppens stood the two european policeofficers in whose hands the peace and order of the vast crowd lay their assistant stood at the exit gate at the other end and their three white helmets showed strangely conspicuous amongst the bare or saffronturbaned heads the two at the sheeppens were talking and laughing to each other as englishmen will before business begins talking and laughing london talk for one of them was fresh from home furlough and had only been detailed for this special duty on his way up country yes i had a jolly day he was saying the dear old heath was looking just as it always did it was like being born again to come back to the whole caboodleaunt sallies tommy dods welshers and the lotand then the enclosure a sudden sway in the crowd made him look round hastily at his own it was all correct so many yards this way so many that with yellow legs marking the yards and those three white helmets marking the limits within which regeneration was legal the sway ceased the moment had not yet come though slowly surely the light grew to give the great mass of bronze faces a greyish corpselike tint while half way up the sky behind them the serrated edge of the sacred snows grew pale and cold and stern like the very face of death itself hari hara hara hari there was a note of anxiety in the cry now for the shadow thrown by the tall houses which hemmed in the wide courtyard was growing paler and in another minute at most the twelvefoot square of cleansing water which was all the gods vouchsafed must surely begin to rise and show at the bottom of those worn stone stepsworn by generations on generations of goldenshod feet seeking immortality stand back please not yet came an english voice inaudible for the rhythmic roar of the multitude but the raised riding whip was sufficient the eagerness died out for a moment from those nearest faces lost in a cheerful obedience a respectful salaam or two a general acquiescence i wish those devils of priests would turn on the tap remarked the other englishman with a yawn yes answered the first speaker if you are on duty next year id insist on the curtain being rung up at the bill time it is rough on the audience especially when they dont catcall he gave an imitation of a london gallerys sign of impatience which made some of the goldenshod ones stare for the rhythmic roar had died down in one of those sudden silences which seize upon humanity even when in masses so that a faint rumpatumtumrumpatumtum was distinctly audible from far it was the tomtom of the old brahmin whom lance carlyon had seen selling the endless circles of cut papers as a whole pantheon of gods it is an eminently disturbing sound that ceaseless insistent throb of a tomtom which has no end no beginning which holds ever in its beat the necessity for something more for another repetition and yet another so on its ceaselessness broke in again that swaying pulsing roar of many voices hari hara lifedeathcreatordestroyer something must have gone wrong with the ballcock and as usual the plumber will be in directly from another little job said the man who had just come out from england reminiscently he had gone there to settle his wife and bairns in a jerrybuilt villa near london so the memory of something beyond the iniquities of the plumberthose borgias of modern life dealing death unchecked undiscoveredmade his eyes pass beyond the crowd pass the spires of the clustered temples and settle on the still dark western sky over whose curved edge lay the goal of his solitary feet the end of his pilgrimage the cradle of his divinities stand back please not yet came his order again and once more eagerness died down to obedience once more that cry on the creator the destroyer ended in that insistent restless beat of the old godselling brahmins drum it was a strange scene above was the growing light of day below the square stone font of immortality and between them a clamouring crowd a careless few and between them what a light railing of bamboo the dignity that doth hedge an empire that was all and now with a sudden access of light came the quick indrawing breath of thousands to voice a sort of sharp short sob followed by an instants silence then long soft with the hush in it of some huge wave far out at sea which swallows up a lesser one the outgoing breath of those thousands voiced a sigh for the pool was still empty though the dawn had come something was wrong seriously wrong to judge by one english face as it turned to give a look round then settled on another english face theres something upgod knows whatthe commissioner feared a row you know youd better go to the fort and ask dering to send us down every man he can men you understand not sabresas yet and tell pidar narayan hes a host in himself with these pilgrimsramanund too you might get himwe want anyone who can help the crowd to keep its temper though i dont expect hed be much goodand theres no one else inspector here the police officer turned to a silverlaced turban beside the outer pen leave that in charge of govinda and suchetstay shivdeo will be better he is a highcaste brahmin and you go and send every twiceborn constable youve got and can trust to every alley and street that leads here for there will be an awful crush when those in front dont move on and he wrinkled his forehead in hasty thoughthave we anyone connected with the temple priests someone they can trust ah annant of coursethe very man send him to find out if there is anything really wrong and he lowered his voice if it is anything to do with the siphon or whatever it is get workmen and set it straightpour water downanything only there must be a miracle and be quick if this crowd gets impatientgod help it the last was to himself as he looked round the solid packed mass of humanity there was no sigh of impatience in it as yet only eagerness and mind he added no truncheons drawn till i myself give the order the word passed in a low tone round the square of authority and that done the head of it pulled out his cigar case he might as well smoke while he could the crowd watched him vaguely interested at his lack of interest in what was coming until a faint forward sweep a halfhearted shout came from behind from those upturned faces which could not even see an englishman lighting his cigar not yet stand back said the latter again as the pressure on the sheep pen grew and they stood back all save a miserablelooking dirtclad wildeyed mendicant who had wormed his way to the front and now feared to lose it lo brother said big govinda a sikh from patiala as he thrust him back gently have patience awhile give the gods time there is not water to wash a babe yet shivdeo taller even than govinda a saraswati brahmin if ever there was one at the other side of the pen twirled his mustache airily and laughed nay govinda he called let the beggar in he seeks but to drown vermin the rude jest served its turn after the manner of policemens jokes all over the world the crowd close at hand tittered caught up the cue amused itself with additions and those behind forgot the great question in curiosity but not for long hara hari hari hara the roar of relief rose up tumultuously the mass of people swayed with that curious sidelong motion of a forward crowd as in the clear light a trickle of water showed through the crevices of the paving stones at the bottom of the tank look out shouted the englishman but remonstrance in words was useless in that storm of sound so big govinda promptly snatched two intruders out of his pen like puppies by the scruff of their necks one in each hand and shivdeo choosing out the nearest lowcaste man unerringly caught him in his arms like a baby and literally tossed him on to the heads of the crowd with a shout which even in that uproar could be heard of some in that nearest crush brahmins first washerman thy sort can bathe in the suds of our clothes and those who heard ducked and when the victimwho was not a washermanfell amongst them hustled and silenced him and nodded to the big man whose claim to dignity was writ so plain upon his face but despite ready wit and sheer strength one determined fellow would have made good his entrance and so served as a bellwether to that overwhelming flock if a white hand and arm with silver buttons on the cuffholding a silvermounted huntingcrop clubbed savagely shorthad not come downglinting in the first sunray like a swordclear on the bare head as it ducked under the barrier the intruder a big burly devotee dropped on his face like a stone then to the strikers relief sat up and apparently howled apparently because that rhythmic roar smothered all individual sound hara hari hara hari suddenly as it had begun it stopped for that faint inrush of water had stopped also stopped hesitated then sunk out of sight again with a sort of drowning gurgle that came as an accompaniment to the only other sound the insistent throbbing of the old godmakers drum in the distance not enough pressure murmured the police officer to himself judging that an attempt had been made to fill the tank in some new way then he frowned there would be pressure enough and to spare among the crowd soon most likely what could be done to prevent it halt by your rightsingle file the order came far back from the widest street and it was full ten minutes ere lance carlyon with a following of sikh pioneers armed with spades and picks could edge through the crowd though it still yielded room to authority without a murmur he had been on his way with a fatigue party to finish clearing the camp when the assistant superintendent of police had met him in the bazaar and told him he was wanted send four of your men to clear the mud from the crevices of the stones said the police officer seizing on a possible diversion gladly it will serve to keep the crowd amused till dering brings his men down as the four stalwart pioneers stepped to their work of making miracles a stir of expectation ran through those first rows who could see surely they said to each other if the masters took the job in hand the gods must needs send the water of a surety said shivdeo catching the comment do not the gods always befriend the bold do not we of harriana find the sacred river which the devils hid though we have to dig threehundredfeet wells to find it this allusion to the extraordinarily deep wells dug by the peasantry in the almost rainless tract beneath which so the legend goes the river saraswati still runs passed from mouth to mouth consolingly yea if devils hid water men found it why not these men since nothing was impossible to a miracle the sun was shining broadly now as if it had been up for hours and showed far as the eye could reach down every lane and street and alley nothing but that sea of upturned faces converging to one centre wonderfully still wonderfully patient i wish someone would stop that cursed drum said lance suddenly its enough to give anyone the fidgets i feel myself he broke off and his memory going back to his jesting remark to erda his young face clouded was it possible he should never see her again was it possible that the reverend david was to claim his paradise he felt savage at the very thought impatient full of an almost righteous anger at everything especially the drumbanger for making such an infernal noise and now far back as before an english voice could be heard giving an order it was to loosen scabbards this time and the police officer looked up hastily it meant that for the first time the crowd must be hesitating in its quick obedience to command perhaps because most of the troopers were mahomedans i hope theyll get through without using them said the man responsible for peace and order but steady please in case of a rush remember that if we yield more footroom someone must fall then there will be the devil to pay at present they are so tight packed they cant that indeed was the position so long as authority could prevent those few yards of clear space about the pool being encroached upon there was safety so the barrier of men waited anxiously but no rush came the reason of this being made clear when the file of troopers appeared led by old pidar narayan who had joined the party at the crucial moment and piloted them through the crowd which gave way to his wellknown figure with absolute alacrity he turned at the entrance to hold up his hand in priestly fashion patience my children he said sternly tarry ye the lords leisure let him do what seemeth him good the idea familiar to the least of them brought instant assent and a sort of relieved sigh from those who heard it here was something they could understand a man set apart from others by his dress his life his invariable assumption of authority his unquestioned claim to be mediator between the dim inaccessible creator and his creatures to be interpreter of the hidden mind but the police officer heaved his sigh of relief over the appearance of more matter his barrier could now be one of men standing shoulder to shoulder and such a barrier would soon be needed since this latest contingent brought discouraging news the priests were helpless the secret supply had somehow been tampered with but where not even they could tell without help and though they had sent long before dawn to both amma and guguthe only two men likely to know anything or be able to do anythingneither could be found and wont be interrupted vincent suddenly remembering as he listened what he had seen the night before they are most likely in the plot one of them at any rate was going up the hari in a dugout late last night not amma put in lance he started before that to go up the hara and pilot down a raft for the forest officer i met him as i came back to dinner well he is not getatable anyhow and thats all we have to consider said the police officer briefly the miracle is off the bill now how the deuce are we to get the audience to go away peacefully perhaps if i as a fellowcountryman and a brahmin were to address them began ramanund who had come down with pidar narayan feeling important at being summoned the latter turned to the man whom he knew had long since rejected the faith of his fathers and so to speak thrown the almighty overboard to lighten his ship you cannot argue with that my son he said gently pointing to the sea of patient yet eager faces no one of your sort ever has in all the history of the world that does not reason it feels show it another miracle and it will worship give it a cause and it will espouse it give it a lead and it will follow but wordsnever well i hope to god no one will supply it with the wrong lead put in the police officer for the rest we must hold the fort i suppose inspector when is the showthe miracle i meansupposed to end not till sunset sir said the man salaaming and its now about six i suppose eleven hours he took out his cigarcase and counted yes ill last through inspector close your men in and let them stand at ease captain dering if you can spare yours till then i shall be obliged certainly i left a troop with roshan khan and orders to send word of any disturbance and i wired to dillon in case father ninian shook his head there is no fear till this is settled he pointed to the pool and he was right all through the long hot hours the crowd waited sometimes the cry hara hari burst out to be followed by a faint rush sometimes the great mass stood silent listening to the insistent throbbing of the old godmakers drum in the distance but through it all the note was patience and it was patience also in the square enclosure of authority sometimes a wouldbe intruder would be lifted like a puppy and chucked back to his fellows once or twice an english arm would go up and come down on some more wilful head but that was all and far away at the fort the gong chimed the hours regularly up to twelve and begun at one again but there was no fuss no noise the crowd stood their ground giving no inch and authority stood its ground and yielded none since in that lay safety for all so with a horrible slowness the day dragged on until at last the red sun sank behind the levels beyond the gaol and the strain was over ill take a biscuit in my pocket next time said the police officer cheerfully as bit by bit the stones of the courtyard began to show between the goldenshod feet inspector send your men to quarters and let them eat their food then he walked over and looked down into the deep empty tank it might have been full up he said we couldnt have stopped them for a moment if they had had any sort of a lead over and from what you told the commissioner sirhe turned to father niniani was afraid of one the old priest stood watching the crowd disperse for a moment in silence so was i he said but i was mistaken so far still there is danger in the air i feel it i hear it and as he spoke above the hum of the crowd silent no longer rose that insistent throbbing of the old godmakers drum chapter xviii adrift erda shepherd stood in her bedroom under the woodshingled house at herrnhut looking at a heap of white muslin and delicate embroideries which lay upon her bed it was the wedding dress she had just unpacked it partly because she felt decoeuvre partly in the hope that the sight of it ready to be worn so soon would still the vague disquiet of which she was conscious yet if anyone had ventured to suggest when she had said goodby to lance carlyon the evening beforesaid goodby almost carelessly by reason of the fervid enthusiasm which absorbed herthat within twentyfour hours the wisdom of the farewell should seem logically doubtful she would have been desperately angry but she was too honest to deny that the doubt had come come in a moment wildly passionately when they had thwarted her desire of joining in the crusade over the other side of the river along the pilgrims road she had meant to go with david who was to take up his position at a campingground some six miles off and she had fought hard for the privilege but they had quoted scripture at her to prove that a wife or a wife to be must needs hamper a man more than any other woman even his sister david had been kind about it almost too kind she flushed a little at the recollection of his words his look for that sort of thing had scarcely come into her calculations but dr campbell had pompously reminded her that her future profession would be wife caretaker sympathizer and general bolstererup to a worker nor need she think the task small it was the noblest one a woman could have he had gone on to comfort her with instances of such general support from his own life and those of his friends until with a flash that unexpected questioning had come to the girls mind she had asked herself what difference there was in the nobility of being one mans wife or anothersprovided the man was worthy and his work in the world good father ninians words i can wish no better wish for you and for the world had come back to her then as if in answer to her questioning and even now they echoed in her heart the house was very quiet very shadowy for the sun left the little oasis of valley set in its circling wilderness of hill long before a fraction of light faded from the sky above it she could hear mrs campbells voice down the little ladderlike stairs conferring with the cook over the wedding cake and in a sideissue exhorting him to be sure and have the soup hot in case the workers might return exhausted and require something to eat the moment they arrived erda sat down on the bed beside the white muslin and fingered the quaint little cap idly as she told herself that such things would be a part of her duties in the future but only a part life was no unknown country to this girl who had spent years in a medical mission she was no ignorant baby standing in a fashion happily past on the verge of she knew not what she looked ahead calmly taking the world as the creator made it she thought without a flush as good women do of the children she hoped might come and as she thought she frowned not from any revolt of her spiritual or physical nature but because once more the question arose was not lance right was not this the essence was it not everything to be sure of the inheritance she started up at the sound of her aunt calling her glad of the interruption had she not better the good lady suggested try on the dress now she was about it since if there was anything amiss the sooner the tailor set to work to rectify it the better undoubtedly besides she told herself the mere putting on of this the sign of her new profession would be healthful it would give her the feeling of being set apart for the life which she had chosen deliberately chosen with her eyes open though maybe focussed too much on that mental companionship too much impossible lance was wrong that was the crowning glory of marriage and even if it seemed hard to have to stand aside from actually fighting the good fight the victory would be hershers almost more than her husbands since the effort would be greater the work more against the grain yes she would try on the dress and if it did not fit perfectly what matter was anything in the world perfect yet it should be as perfect as she could compass even the little cap should not lack its bunch of orange blossoms as she told herself this she was for the time womanhood incarnate womanhood playing with dainty little tendernesses and conceits about the abyss for which it is responsible so with the smile of an angel she passed into the garden the old militant feeling at her heart her feet were on the golden stairs she was going to regain the lost paradise hand in hand with one of those whom she had driven from it they were going to forget all the consequences of that mistake they were going to bewhat the vague confusion did not prevent her feeling that she was absolutely certain she was on the right path indeed the only regret of which she was conscious was one that she was not on the other side of the river on the pilgrims road with the rest of the mission she stood looking over to the frowning cliffs from the little wooden landingstage built out at the bottom of the garden into the wide shallows of the river which here showed scarcely a streak or dimple of current she could see the mission boat lying moored on the other side against the fighters return yet the very idea of fight seemed impossible she thought in that utter peacefulness and stillness the rim of dark hills circled the jewel of the sunbright sky tenderly as if it sought to keep in the heavy sweet perfume of the orange blossoms which starred every tree in the wide fruitful garden they were famous oranges those in the herrnhut garden grafts brought by a missionary from malta mrs campbell notable woman as she was made a steady income for good works out of the sale of the great redskinned redhearted fruit and prided herself in keeping them later on her trees than anyone in india indeed in the shadier colder alleys some were still hanging side by side with the new blossoms a sort of example to these novices showing them what their real work in the world ought to be erda smiling at her own conceit stroked one of the warm yet stainless petals in the bunch she held as if it were a sentient thing perhaps it was who knows as she turned to go back warned by a softening of the sky that the time was later than she thought something showed rounding the smooth silver bend of the river above and she paused shading her eyes with her hand to see what it was a raft the first of the rafts of wood which at certain seasons were floated down the river to eshwara ammas raft most likely which he had told her he had to pilot yes there he was on the quaint contrivance which the river folk used for journeys down stream a common string bed no more no less supported between inflated bladders of skin the sight of it gave her a pang to think that she would never more go bobbing sidling dipping racing on one of them as the mission folk always did when they wanted to stay the last possible minute of holiday at herrnhut and get back to eshwara as quickly as they could for it took half the time of the winding road when the river as now was quiet and manageable and amma was the most dexterous manager of the singular craft there he was paddling for dear life now leaping to his great pile of timber steering it with his paddle round a bend then back to his string bed with the tow rope to haul the rudderless mass to a straight line again if she had time she thought she would have asked him to take her just once more as far as the ferry two miles below then she might have walked back through the fields she had often taken the pleasant little trip with amma there was no danger so far but after that when the river began to slip and slide even he had sometimes to cut a raft adrift and trust to catching it again in smoother water since it was not pleasant to have such a crushing neighbour in the eddies and swirls of a lasher as she stood watching him she saw him pause looking towards her then leap from the raft and come paddling down stream he had evidently seen her waiting on the landingstage and thought she wanted him so she shook her head and began to walk back to the house as she did so an orange caught her eye under a tree whence it had fallen from sheer redgold ripeness and knowing how mrs campbell mourned a single loss she gathered it up and took it with her back in her own room she began to pin her bunch of blossoms in her cap hurriedly for she had lingered longer in the garden than she had intended and there was a chance only a chance that those much to be envied churchmilitants might return and claim her attention still hurried as she was she knelt down beside the bed for a moment or two and with her clasped hands laid almost caressingly among the soft muslin prayed that she might wear this symbol of her entry into a new profession worthily so scarcely looking at herself in the glass which indeed was too small to show her more than a rather pale face smiling under a quaint little cap she dressed hastily her aunt would be able to tell her if there was anything wrong in the lighter rooms below here under the roof it was already a little dark then catching up the orange she ran downstairs wondering if the bridal blossoms always smelt so overpoweringly strong and thinking that if it was so they must make the trying ceremony still more trying to one who disliked to have strong scents about them as she did her aunt was not to be seen in the dining room so erda parted the heavy curtains which in indian fashion divided it from the drawingroom and looked in to see if she were there it was at all times a dark room especially in late afternoon as now but the light from behind her sent a shaft straight to the pier glass which stoodthe joy of mrs campbells heartjust opposite the curtains so makingas the good lady used fondly to saythe room look much larger than it really was to those entering it but what the girl saw in it today was no illusory enlargement of actualities no idealization of fact it was something real something not to be explained away exaggerated or minimized it was a woman tall slender robed in white a woman with redgold hair edged by the light behind her a woman with a redgold apple in her hand she stood arrested before herself helpless before the memory of a voice all straight foldsthe sunshine on your hair and a redgold apple in your handthe worlds desire and she had refused him his she stood for a second not thinking at all simply with a rush feeling the truth feeling herself then with a queer little cry which might have been his name had it been articulate she broke adrift broke for the time from all moorings and possessed with but the one idea that she could not do one thing that she must do another she turned to the garden andthe redgold fruit still in her handhurried breathlessly through the waning light through the deadsweet perfume of the blossoms till she found herself she knew not whysave that she must have air have spaceupon the edge of the river there was something now swaying idly against the landingstage a rude craft buoyed up by air and there was a rude sort of man in itcomprehending yet uncomprehendingprimitive simple expectant huzoor he said with broad smiles and outstretched hand i have been waiting the huzoors pleasure the presence will go whither whither even in her excitement the quaint coincidence struck her as absurd and yet it seemed to sweep her further still from her moorings whither she gave that queer little cry again and this time it was lance lance whither did the misssahiba say asked amma gravely the cry turned to a strange laugh to eshwarawhere else does the river gowhere else the strange frail boat was sidling against the landingstage in the pulse of the river her stranger frailer self was adrift on the greater river of life and a hand heedless seeing nothing strange in either careless of all the finedrawn niceties of culture had hold of hers so straight to the centre huzoor i have placed the seat correctly that is right the misssahiba recollects the old rules we shall be in eshwara before dawn she sat down mechanically feeling only that she was adriftadrift on the river that went to eshwarawhere elseand that she was glad glad because she could not stay because she could not face and then the thought came of facing something elsehis glad delight when she came floating down the rivernot dead like the lily maid to lancelotbut alivea woman with a redgold apple in her hand she sat staring at what she held as if hypnotized by its colour absolutely unconscious of anything else till ammas voice came stolidly we must pick up the raft first huzoor this slave let it drift while he waited for the miss but we shall find it at the ferry at the ferry the familiar idea startled her from dreams to the reality how came she there what had she done what did this mean a flush of intolerable shame swept to her face she rose to escape but ammas warning hand was on hers in an instant that hand so heedless of so many limitations so certain here that there was no escape from these limitations the misssahiba forgets he said deferentially when one is in the stream there is no change possible but if the place is not right we can alter it at the ferry she sat down again telling herself this was true she could alter it at the ferry she could walk home through the fields no one need know the quaint craft rocking itself back to balance made her feel giddy her dress was only muslin she could remove the cap if necessary borrow a shawl from the biblewoman near the ferry saying she had not thought it would be so chilly she buried her face in both her hands in a sort of despairing revolt at the duplicity so with the redgold fruit in her lap sat trying to think but she could not the scent of the orange blossoms seemed to cloud her senses so she raised her face again and stared at the river why had she done this why had she put this thing that she must always conceal into her life there would always now be something she could not say straight out and yet if she lived to be a hundred the memory of it would never fade it would be as fresh as it was now when she died with davids hand in hers the intolerable humiliation of it stung deep the instinct to escape rose fiercely be quick she cried seeing amma idle letting the current do the work i want to get there as soon as possible i must or something worse may happen there isnt a moment to spare amma bent towards her from his seat astride a skin airbag did they kill anyone he asked in sudden interest did the prisoners escape as it was arranged and was it carlonesahib they killedthey swore it should be he because he laughed at the miracle the prisonerscarlonesahibkilled she echoed stupidly then with a great throb of the heart she realized that here might be something of more importance than her selfhumiliation had father ninian been right had there really been some conspiracy afoot and had amma heard i have had no news from eshwara amma she said boldly what is this about prisoners escaping and the sahiblogue being killed who was going to do that amma looked crestfallen i thought the huzoor had heardthat that was why she was going it is nothing idle talk it is always talk and the huzoors have the deepukrag they must still be kings amma she interrupted sternly you must tell me about this if you do not i will take my hand off your sons headi will never he almost dropped his paddle in absolute terror huzoor he said helplessly it is talk idle talk it is always so all day long and all night long in the bazaars and the masters have the deepukrag there is no fear but this slave will tell they were almost opposite the ferry before he had finished his tale and she had grasped the whole tissue of trivialities which yet went to make up so formidable a possibility the discontent and dread regarding the canal the strange lights the deaths in gaol the return of the cursed corpse gopithe ticketofleave manstalk of revenge if the cleansing water should fail much of this was new to her but it hung together with what she already knew and yet it seemed incredible what could be the object what could they expect to do here amma had smiled inscrutably and said the miss did not know bazaar talk everything was possible to it had they not even spoken of making a new nawab out of roshan khan the risaldar indeed had not the jemedar at the palace already treated him as one and the pool of immortality had it risen or not amma could not say they had asked him with bribes and threats to do the jobthat was only the priests revenge but it would serve other purposes toobut he had refused partly because he had to come away and partly because he was the servant of the lightbringers as to when the prisoners were to escape he could not say today perhaps tomorrow most likely never unless something really happened it was talk the miss need have no fear the huzoors having the deepukrag must needs be safe and carlonesahib was a real hero none braver none stronger that decided her she had been counting costs as she listened an hour say back to herrnhut even if anyone were there which was uncertain half an hour at least to start a messenger then the boat might be at the other side of the river then all those miles on a rough road at night when shall we get to eshwara she asked at the turn of the night and day if the river is kind said amma but he looked doubtfully into a copper tint that remained in the sky though the sun must have set behind the mountains it had a curious effect that coppercoloured dome above the rim of almost black hills with the river dark mysterious already beginning to slide towards the narrowing ravine it did not strike her that she herself adrift on that river in what was to be her wedding dress with prehistoric aboriginal amma as pilot to her and a lumber raft would have had a still more curious effect to a spectators eyes but there were none and it was already almost dark amma she said i will give you fifty rupees and keep my hand on the sons head if you will leave the raft here and take me as quick as you can to eshwarato the little steps below the fortfifty whole rupees he shook his head and grinned partly at his own superlative honesty we should not go so fast huzoor now the slide is near he said for see you the raft is the woodsahibs new shape it is a good shape it came down the rapids above the valley like a boat faster than this when the paddle cannot be used it will take us with it i will fasten this behind and steer then in the slacker water when the paddle is possible we will leave it if the misssahiba is in a hurry but there is none the huzoors are lightbringers he had already paddled alongside the rafta boatshaped mass of huge logs rising towards the backand leaping to it came back after a moment with the towrope it shall do the work he said with another grin as he fastened the airbuoyed bed to a ring placed for the purpose in one of the logs then he clucked emphatically lo who would grudge mens brains to the masters when they are clever as the gods themselves the miss will see how fast this goes we shall be at eshwara before the night turns to day something in his tone warned her that the recurrence of the phrase was not pure chance that is when the prisoners were to escape she said quickly he did not affirm or deny it so many things happen in the fight of dawn he said affably that was all but she thought rapidly the rising or whatever the conspiracy aimed at could scarcely have happened just after they left eshwara the night before in that case the news must have followed them on the road therefore if it was to happen at all if this were not all talkand father ninians words came to make her doubt its being soit would happen in a few hours so she must be there in time to give warning as she thought this a sudden strain at the towrope a quick dip of the boatshaped prow of the raft a louder swish of the water as it curved out from its rising stern told her she was adrift indeed on the way to eshwara it seemed almost more incredible than what had gone before but there was nothing to be ashamed of here it was the only possible thing to do under the circumstances her journey might prove unnecessary but it might not and supposing anything should really happentoto anybodyshe would never be able to forgive herself if knowing this chance of danger she had not done her best to avert it chapter xix juliet the coppercoloured glow into which weatherwise amma had looked distrustfully as it domed the little valley set in its rim of hills had replaced that of sunset in eshwara also and pidar narayans eyes weatherwise as the fishermans looked at it as doubtfully as he walked home with lance and vincent dering when the long strain at the pool of immortality was over if it were not so early in the year i should predict a duststorma real electrical duststorm he said lance whose hands were full of cutpaper godsfor in obedience to a sudden impulse he had stopped on his way through the crowd to buy up the old brahmins whole stock in trade and give him an extra eight annas to go away and not drum any morelooked up also and filled his broad chest with a great breath perhaps that is it ive felt choking all dayhorrid vincent dering laughed i dont chokei tingle and it is rather jolly yes sir there is a lot of electricity in the air and i shouldnt wonder if we had a regular black snorter glad it didnt come in the middle of the miracle biz for as a general smasherup of ordinary experiences commend me to a real electrical duststorm it seems to attract the earth earthy in everything in fact if there is such a thing as the devil and he ever gets the upper hand it is then father ninian turned to him quickly and then to the crowdthrough which they were still cleaving that curiously acquiescent way which white faces still cleave through dark onesthen i trust my son he said gently that for your sake and theirs the storm may not come or that there isnt a satanic majesty retorted captain dering cynically that sir is the easiest way out of the difficulty lance had looked round on the crowd also well if there is he said and i had to paint him id take that mans face as my model for lucifer he pointed to a gosain who was forming the centre of a group of gossipers round a syrupsellers shop and addedfor he knew his milton as well as his shakespearethe superior fiend who gives not heavn for lost looks a bad lot i admit remarked vincent carelessly have an idea ive seen him before in gaol i believe yes im sure of it he is the fellow dillon told me was going to get his ticketofleave for good conduct he looks scoundrel enough for that but really sir he turned to father ninian againi think we may count on their behaviour now he indicated the crowd if there was going to be a row it would have come off before this now they will settle down youll see and go on to the next campingground tomorrow morning as if nothing had gone wrong they are such creatures of habit you could see that from their sticking on in expectation of that footling old miracle all day father ninian in that curiously irrelevant way he had put on the gold pincenez which always dangled over his black soutane and looked round him again they will settle down he said quietly if nothing new crops up to give them a lead into new ways that is always the danger and a very small thing does it sometimes in india they had reached the courtyard which lay between the palace and the fort and with a wave of his hand in farewell he passed along the wall to the former while the others striking across the raised unionjack of paths made for the latter the yard was crammed with pilgrims on their way to bathe on the river steps who the deuce are those fellows said vincent angrily as half a dozen figures slipped out through the door in the bastion as they approached and mixing with the crowd got lost in it while the door was closed behind them by some unseen hand ill talk to roshan about that he was complaining only this morning that the men were breaking out of barracks what else can he expect if he doesnt look out by jove ill teach em his first words indeed as he entered the outer courtyard of the fort was to order a sentry down to close the doors against all comers without a written pass from him and as he went by the guardhouse he gave rather a sharp reprimand to roshan khan who happened to be outside for not having kept his eyes open while in charge of the fort during his absence no one was in future to use the small door the key was to be brought to him and all passes were to be stopped for that night roshan looks in a demon bad temper i wonder whats up remarked lance casually as he passed on through a wicket in the massive closed gates to the inner courtyard where the officers quarters lay hugging the river wall it was quite a citadel a distinct fortification of itself with no entrance or exit except through the outer yard or by the little flight of steps leading down to the river at the foot of which lance moored his canoe he has been sulky as a bear with me these last few days replied captain dering with a contemptuous smile i believe the old colonel was right after all and coming here has put wind in his head i shall have to teach mr roshan that good man as he is he is only a risaldar before long poor devil said lance under his breath im always a bit sorry for roshan he would be a fine fellowifif he wasnt soso civilized civilized echoed vincent with a laugh you havent seen him fight i have talk of devils he has got one in him if you like he certainly had at that moment when having gone straight to his quarters after vincents reprimand he found himself alone and free to show his feelings and yet had he been calm he could scarcely have told wherein the grievance lay which for the moment clamoured fornonot redressrevenge it was not the first time that he had had to ignore hints innuendoes suggestions of heaven knows what impossible intrigues as he had had that very afternoon it was not the first time that in his position as intermediary between the ignorance of the native soldier and the ignorance of the english officer he had had to ca canny so as not to alienate the confidence of either indeed the consciousness of the necessity for this by enhancing the value of his services had always been a pride to him hitherto and these particular intrigues were so childish especially ifhe paused in his angry pacing of the room and smiled complacently why should he give a thought to an impossible plan when a possible one lay ready to his hand if he married laila the land almost the title would be his of right it would be easy anyhow to regain then with a fresh frown he remembered vincents order that would upset his plans he had meant to slip out by the bastion gate just beforesay an hour beforedawn and cross over to the palace akbar khan had arranged to be there to let him into the garden now he must make other arrangements he must find the old eunuch change the hour and the place since nothingno not all the tyranny in the worldshould prevent his carrying out his intention of seeing his cousin and claiming her as hishis by right so he must settle this at once settle it before there was any chance he told himself bitterly of his superior officer coming out of the messwhere no doubt he was guzzling swines flesh and bibbing winethat faint amaze at the presence in his own mind of such antiquated halfforgotten ideas assailed him again at this point to encroach further on his liberty his privileges he had to pass the troopers lines on his way to the main gate and the quick salaams the ready smiles given him by the men as they lounged and smoked after their long day on duty soothed his pride the captain had certainly said they had behaved wellkindly and discreetly but whose merit was that the englishmans who gave the word of command or his who had drilled them to obedience who lived with them day and night without such as he a native regiment could not be managed if he chose to give the word he would not of course but if he chose he set his teeth as he walked out of the fort and met at its very gate that surging tide of patient eager faces drifting on and back again aimlessly he need not as a matter of fact have feared any further interference from vincent dering for the latter being very tired after the long day in the sun and having reason to know that part of the night time at any rate which is usually given to sleep would be employed in something better had after staving off hunger with what the cook would produce at a moments notice and postponing the dinner hour gone to sleep deliberately advising lance to do the same but the latter had rather to his own surprise found this impossible not even over a cigar in the balcony above the sliding rushing river the sound of which was as a rule sleepcompelling would sleep come not even in the cool darkness which was settling on eshwara despite the curious hint of glow lingering in the sky the air was too electrical he decided and thenerda he had slept the night before after she had said goodby so carelessly without realizing that the goodby was for ever and he had not had time to think all day but now at rest in the cool darkness looking from his lounge chair down the river to that other balcony he did realize it for ever yes that regret was in his life for ever and he was so young only twentyfive why had this come to him erda erdahis hearts desire he sat there voiceless sucking mechanically at a cigar long since gone out but that was as much the cry at his heart as if he had allowed himself a fine frenzy of despair in older fashion and he imagined her as he had seen herthis way that way every way in an unending torture of visionsuntil he exhausted reality and fancy showed her to him in her wedding dress and then he felt as if he could kill the reverend david campbell without shame or fear he was vaguely ashamed of the lack of shame however especially when his fancy led him into endless mishaps which might befall a man especially a missionary before his wedding day there they ate a missionary yes sometimes but there was not much time left for that sort of end what a brute he was when the only thing that mattered was that she should be happy and content but would she be so it went on and on and on the controversy between himself and that other self so that he felt worn and harassed and dirty and altogether undesirable when vincent about nine oclock reappeared dapper and scented as usual in his mess kit and expressed surprise at finding his companion still undressed he was hungry as a hunter he said besides he wanted to have a decent interval between dinner and turning in and that must be early for he had just heard from the police authorities that though everything was quiet for the night absolutely quiet they thought it would be safer to have the pool guarded again at dawn in case of accidents since none of the pilgrims though apparently quite resigned had as yet gone on they never do till the next day pidar narayan told me so commented lance crossly why should they rake us up at such an unearthly hour why cant they let the people have a row if they want one id like it give a fellow something to do in this beastly hole he went off to dress moodily wishing savage wishes so adding perhaps to that electricity in the air and vincent gave it his quota of desire also in his reckless determination to regain paradise as it was lost through a woman and that play of romeo and juliet in the scented gardenjuliet whose bounty was as boundless as the seawas a bit of pure paradise to him he had never he thought been in love before he had never known what love was those other loves of his had been mean ungenerous calculating so he was at his best his brightest during dinner lance on the contrary was at his worst his dullest and vincent made this his excuse for going to his room betimes he was not due at the palace till twelve but he was anxious to ensure the coast being clear and lance seemed just in the mood when a fellow sits up sulkily out of pure cussedness and drinks whiskeyandwater if he can find a companion on whom to vent his cavillings in truth lance would have liked to do so he wanted to feel miserable but after vincent had gone and he was left alone in the balcony sleep began to assert itself he found even his despair becoming dreamy and being obstinate tried to fight against the fact the result being that he finally fell asleep in his lounge chair with a soundness and unconsciousness usually reserved for bed fell asleep and promptly relaxed into content with happy dreams of erdas return to him for his left to itself was a healthy soul and so were the vast majority of those which through patient yet eager eyes were looking into the scarcelit darkness of the streets as the pilgrims crowded into an almost solid mass seemed to slide with a slow almost unseen movement through them they were waiting for the dawn if nothing new came before then they would pass on towards the cradle of the gods so scarcely seen restless yet restful their feet on the next rung of the golden stairs they waited and overhead the young moon had risen with a coppercoloured edge to its crescent of light for the glow was still in the sky and the troopers in the fort resting after their long day in indian fashion by sprawling on their beds and gossiping had dragged these beds into the open and discarded most of their clothing since the night was strangely still and warm so even the wonder what had become of the risaldarsahib was languid for roshan khan had not returned and yet as he sat in a quiet courtyard of the city with closed doors realizing how late it was growing he had no fear of further reprimand on the contrary his pulses were bounding with the certainty that he would gain praise and there was something beyond this mere desire for personal advantage in the keenwitted diplomacy with which he listened with which he suggested with which he led the talkers on to tell what it was of the utmost importance that he should know not so much to himself as to the government he served for his vague discontent had vanished his wellreasoned wellfounded loyalty returned at this the first hint at anything beyond the wild aimless intrigue with which every indian bazaar teems but here in this definite plan by the collaboration of his troopers of liberating fifteen hundred scoundrelsor at least desperadoesof aping the stroke of action which made the great mutiny of possible was something tangible something which when known to the uttermost must be told without delay to his superior officer a vast pride swept through him as when the gongs were striking oneshort yet with lingering vibration in the dull still airhe made his way fast as he could back to the fort without him and such as he faithful despite limitations what would the masters know hours before as he went out he had arranged with akbar khan that the palace door giving on the great square between it and the fort should be on the latch only so that he might slip in at any time and take his chance of hiding in the garden his chance of seeing laila before the dawn came and he had to go back to the fort the old sinner indeed had jumped at this indefinite arrangement which bound him to nothing which made it unnecessary for him even to broach the subject of an interview to his mistress since what was easier to say than that it had been impossible as indeed it was perhaps roshan khan had himself grasped this fact perhaps in insisting on this entry to the garden he had been backing more than his own luck and had been meditating a coup detat of his own however that may have been all was forgotten in his newly recovered loyalty his keen ambition as he hurried back to the fort intent on but one thingthe forewarning and forearming of those whom he had long ago deliberately chosen as his masters some of his men were still lounging about on their beds and he spoke a word to them as he passed warning them to be ready if wanted so leaving them in sudden vague excitement he passed on to the inner court here where lance carlyons small band of sikh pioneers were quartered in the long low building in which the fortified gateway stood no one was astir and no lights were visible in the opposite building where lance and vincent lived doubtless everyone was in bed he passed on therefore swiftly to the room he knew to be his captains and knocked there was no answer he opened the door and looked in it was empty a vague wonder assailed him and he passed on to lance carlyons room it was empty also and the vague uneasiness died down they must be sitting up still in the balcony overlooking the river where they sat every day after dinner stupid of him not to have gone there first and yet surely it was late perhaps they were uneasy perhaps they had already heard an open letter on her majestys service lying on the dinner table as he passed through the mess room which was still lit upsign that the servants had gone to sleep awaiting their masters call attracted his attention he glanced at it half fearing to find himself forestalled by the police authorities no it was from them as he had seen at once but it was only that notice for dawn ah what was this this tiny scrap of paper which had been twisted to a cockedhat note lying caught in the fold of the foolscap with the two wordstwelve oclockwritten on it in a womans writing roshan knew enough of invitations from englishwomen to be sure of that the vague uneasiness returned as he went on to the balcony beyond the diningroom there too the swinging lamp still burnt and showed him lance carlyon fast asleep in a lounge chair but no one else where was captain dering captain dering who had the key of the little door in the bastion captain dering who had had a note with twelve oclock in it a sudden thought struck him ifif there was anything in his vague fearthen by taking the canoe which lay at the bottom of the stairs he could slip down stream and see forgetting everything else roshan stole softly past the sleeping lance and went down the stairs the canoe was not there then captain dering must have taken it and gonewhither there was but one place whither he was likely to go alone at that hour of the night one place a stair like this leading up to a balcony over the river where he had gone once before with a woman a woman in a dress which marked her for what she was reallya dress that marked her secludedwhich made this shame unutterable roshans impotent fury rose hot at the inexpressible humiliation the thought of captain dering and laila alone in that balcony meant but one thing to his inherited ideas no glaze of romance was possible it was shame unutterable irredeemable shame that must be revenged without delay so forgetting everything else in the world except this he passed the sleeping lance once more hurried back to his quarters for his revolver and only stopping to see that one chamber at least was loaded made his way to that door which he knew would be on the latch that patient eager crowd was still thronging the courtyard as he crossed it pausing a moment beside the great gun which centred the unionjack of raised paths the teacher of religion ay they needed a teacher needed a lesson these aliens these usurpers these depravers of women yet in sober truth vincent dering at that moment sitting in the little balcony alone with laila bonaventura felt quite virtuous they had just come in from the garden where they had been strolling and whispering and now as they sat together without a word scarcely a thought in the faint light of the young moon and a red jewelled handlampwhich laila with that unfailing instinct of hers for all that matched the passionate mystery of the place had set in a carved niche where it looked like a votive offering to the unseen image of a saintvincent could feel the warm ivory of her cheek against his own hear the soft chink of her jewels as they slid towards him following the soft warm curves on which they lay the red light of the lamp glittered faintly in red stars on the myriad facets of lookingglass with which the vaulted roof above them was adorned it fell reddening the red lights on the goldstiffened crimson waves of her dress that sent such a bewildering perfume to cloud his senses with passionate content a vast tenderness a vast triumph surged through him at the thought of her who dared to judge her by the narrow standards of todayshe who had gone back boldly to realities this was what poets had sung since time began this was what the world had exchanged for paradise juliet juliet and if he was the god of her idolatry she was to him the dearest morsel of earth he bent and whispered the name to her with a kiss and as he did so a step swift bold masterful sounded in the passage above the step of one with a right to be there vincent startled sat listening but laila was on her feet in a second with a reckless laugh father laurence she cried well let him come im not afraid for he loved her he must remember so as a dim figure showed half seen in the archway she stood like a queen her hand raised her head thrown back a sight never to be forgotten there is no use in being angry guardian she called in her fullthroated voice it is too late for that remember she paused gave a slight scream and flung herself before vincent there was a flash a second scream and then the arches rang with the echoes of a pistolshot laila laila you damned scoundrel youve killed her laila laila there were two voices echoing the womans name but only that one pistolshot then two useless clicks of a trigger before with an oath roshan khan flung the revolver from him and fled chapter xx trapped but that pistolshot as it pierced the hot sultry air in the vaulted archways was caught by a sudden blast of warm wind sweeping god knows whence to god knows where and was blown out riverwards citywards blown by that sudden blast like the hot breath of someones anger which always heralds an electrical duststorm one moment there is the stillness of the uttermost void brooding over the deep the next causelessly god knows why the spirit moving palpably and so it is always when the everrecurring struggle for the right road to that lost paradise for the right method of regaining that bartered birthright begins afresh among the sons of adam when the hosts of the lordfighting as men always fight under the banner of right for what they think good and true for what seems to them to bring them nearer to the golden gateschange armed peace for war it was so now and lance carlyon waking to the familiar yet unfamiliar sound of that pistolshot woke also to the knowledge that someone had already resorted to that last argument between man and his fellow who was it and why as he stood still half dazed by sleep listening as one does instinctively for another shot to follow the first a new sound distracted his attention was he still asleep and dreaming or was that really erda shepherds voice rising towards him from the sliding unseen river i will come back to you directly it said in urdu the halfheard promise of the words took him by storm making him forget the strangeness of the language yet even that made his bewilderment more utter and all around him about him a mistor was it a cloud or what was ithad sprung into being a wreath as of smoke drifted past the wide arches of the balcony blotting out the pale shimmer of the young moon the swinging lamp above his head darkened reddened as the dustatoms leapt from the earth into the air obedient to the call of that mightiest force in nature which holds the world together and guides it on its way among the stars pidar narayan had been right the electrical storm had come but erda had come with it he could see her now standing at the top of the river steps dimmed by the dustatoms that glittered faintly in the clouded ray of the lamp could see hertall slim whitewith a redgold ball in her hand so it was only a dream he was asleep still the certainty of this the knowledge that he would wake soon made him yield to impulse to emotion as he would never have done otherwise he held out his arms to the gracious vision his voice rang with passion erda erda you have come back to methe worlds desiremy hearts desire and then suddenly his heart atremble for the first time he drew back from his own fervour almost apologetically for the scared look of the face seen through those earthatoms had brought it home to him that this was no dream this was erda shepherd herself the woman who was the dearest atom of gods earth to him and she had come back for what not to listen to his passion anyhow what is the matter he asked briefly sternly for it came home to him also that the cause must be grave she gave a little shiver the hearing of that first greeting had upset her calm her courage at last yet they had been firm till then and heaven knows the long hours of slipping through the rapids in the wake of that heaving plunging mass of logs had been trying enough to anyone then for the last half hour since amma had cut the raft adrift to follow them at its leisure through the slacker currents and in obedience to her order had forged ahead with his paddle her anxiety had risen to feverpitch since the night so far as she could judge must be waning fast and her errand would be useless if she were not in eshwara before the dawn for as she had listened to ammas garrulous talk while he steered the conviction had grown that the danger to peace and safetyif there was anylay in the future not in the past that this dawn and not yesterdays was to be the signal for the insensate almost incredible attempt to wreck authority an attempt which yetincredible insensate though it bemight bring death toto one she held very dear she admitted so much now to herself and pulling that self together looked that dear one in the face there is a good deal the matter she said you had better call captain dering to hear it too it will save time he nodded acquiescence but ere he left her the instinct in him to guard his dearest atom to the uttermost from others made him set a chair for her and glancing round for a wrap take the mess jacket he had laid aside for a smoking coat and fold it round her for the air had grown suddenly chill as it always does in a sandstorm you must be cold in that dress he said as he did so the daintiness of it struck him the scent of the orange blossoms made him turn pale despite his hurry his certainty that something serious was ahead he paused to ask sharply that is your wedding dress isnt it i am not married if you mean that she answered as sharply then she flushed up angrily more at the comprehension shown in her own answer than the meaning in his question and burst out what does it matter if i amor if it is go i tell you and call captain dering yet when he was gone she lay back in the chair and shivered again all the more because of the unaccustomed touch about her throat of the gold lace on a mess jacket how red it looked against her white dress and what a lot of little gold buttons there were at its edge foolish useless little ornamental gilt buttons round and redgold like the comparison brought back lances cry of welcome and made her realize that quite mechanically she still held in her hand that useless foolish unnecessary orange that of course was what had made him remember had made him say those words which had come like the writing on the wall to remind her of her own guilt she flung the fruit from her hastily into the unseen river beyond the arches only just in time ere lance reentered with a puzzled face i cant find dering anywhere he said vexedly he is not in his room hasnt been to bed either though he turned in early saying he was half asleep i wonder what is up can he have heard already do you think scarcely and he would not have gone without waking me his surprise seemed to absorb him then i must tell you for there is no time to be lost interrupted erda impatiently yet even in her strenuous desire to make him understand quickly she did not fail to explain breathlessly how she came to be dressed as she was she had been trying on her wedding dress to see if it fitted and had gone into the garden forforflowers when amma and his raft had come floating down the river and was not that all true she asked herself passionately as she told the tale it was all of the truth anyhow that he or anyone else was ever to know so she had come to warn them as she was a great joy at her courage filled lance as he listened for to most men the possibility of a woman acting as a man might act comes as a wonder it was awfully plucky of you he began but she cut him short with a question as to what was to be done now warn dillon first of all he said readily we have a wire laid on you know i only hope this infernali beg your pardonduststorm wont interfere with the connection you had better come over with me to the office it is just across the yard and i dont like leaving you alone do you mind ill come of coursebut i must make sure of amma waiting first she added with a ring in her voice the ring of a vigorous vitality which finds itself face to face with action he said the raft couldnt overtake us for half an hour but he must not go anyhow and he will want to i had difficulty in getting him to leave it as it was but i had to make him i had to be in time and you areloads of time he called as he ran down the river steps before her to give the order it isnt two oclock yet and he paused abruptly on seeing to his surprise that only ammas strange craft lay sidling against the bottom step over which little waves were curving hurriedly to reach up the wall as if the wateratoms were as restless as those of earth as eager to seek a new element for the air was growing darker thicker every instant with the intruders he looked round hastily but there was no sign of the canoe anywhere yet he had seen it moored to its ring before dinner vincent must have taken it whither an answer leapt to lances mind and he flushed up even in the dark redly if this was sowhat the deuce was to be done there was an added confusion an added responsibility in his face as he ran back to where erda stood waiting him and catching up a lamp from the mess table started with her close at his heels for the office that is the first thing anyhow he muttered half to himself dillon must be warned and perhaps captain dering will be back by then she suggested cheerfully as with the mess jacket worn as it should be for greater convenience of action and greater protection she had slipped her arms into it deliberately while waiting for lance she followed in the little halo of dull red light cast by the lamp through the dustmist the courtyard was still without sign of life for there was nothing to guard here the massive gates of the citadel once closed and a sentry outside the wicket there could be no fear of secret comings and goings i hope to god he may said lance ahead and his tone made the girl wonder his face too surprised her as sitting down to the instrument he signalled for attention no doubt when time is an object there must always be a sense of strain in that pause before the answering tinkle comes to tell that a human hand and brain is at the other end of the thin wire which means so much but there was more than that in lance carlyons frown in truth as he waited he was not thinking so much of what would happen if the communication was interrupted but what was to be done if it was not thinking that he must somehow warn vincent thinking how awkward it would be for him if there was a row and he absent as it were without leave so it was erda who recalled him to the wider issue what are you going to do if dr dillon doesnt hear she had to raise her voice a little for somethingeither coming wind or fardistant thunderhad brought a curious faint reverberation to the air it seemed to come from all quarters scarcely distinguishable yet unmistakable like the roll of a halfmuffled drum or a deep organ note quivering into silence the darkness all about them grew thicker and thicker lance close beside her in that red lamp circle showed as if seen through gauze how unreal it all was herself most of all in a mess jacket and of coursebut this thought came secondher wedding dress and then it struck her that she herself was more unreal than anything else to be there at dead of night feeling no fear only a sort of savage interest but if he doesnt hear she persisted you will have to go down the river and warn him he nodded and yet his thought went first to the fact that if he had to do this if roshan khan had to be left in charge of the relief it would be still more awkward for vincent dering tringatringtring the answering tinkle brought a little breath of joy to them both but erda felt inclined to stamp her feet at the slow precision with which lancewho had to remember each equivalent signspelt out his message he could not be quicker of course and yet surely he might she longed to snatch at the handles herself though she could not signal at all there thats done she cried as a continuous short rattle followed from the other end which lance translated intoall right await you now what is to be done next roshan khanhell get the men together answered lance already on his way to the wicket in the gate to his surprise it was closed he knocked no answer came erda holding the lamp looked at him startled sentry he called sentry open the door miracle it was the password for the night given by captain dering in contemptuous memory of the day but it produced no result the wicket remained obstinately closed theyve locked us in whispered erda the lowering of her voice being due to a swift instinct that the less fuss made the better the less chance of interruption lance bent his ear to the keyhole to listen those dull muffled reverberationseither distant thunder or faint ineffective explosions of electricity close at handwere louder now but he could hear no sound above them he shook his head erda had the lamp on the ground in a second and was beside it her redgold hair in the dust as she peered through a threeinch iron grating between the ironrimmed door and the iron lintel when she rose up her face was like the iron also theyve trapped us she whispered there is a sentry outsidei saw his feet come away and let us settle what to do and say something something angryyou know what i mean damn that brute said lance cordially in a loud voice where the deuce has the sentry gone to ill have it out with him tomorrow the infernal erda ahead with the lamp turned to look back and put her finger on her lips reproachfully thats quite enough she said but she said it with a smile that vigorous delight in action which some women feel was making her blood race through her veins now whats to be done she said swiftly as she put the lamp down on the mess table again lets think hard the gate was closed against interference withwithsomething that was evident proof positive therefore that ammas tale was true so it followed that the most urgent need for help was at the gaol but how to reach it and with whom lances thoughts turned instantly to roshan khan was hecould he be in the plot surely not yet with or without his knowledge the outer court was in the hands of rebels who thought their english officers were caught like rats in a trap for of course they did not know dering was absent and so it was he and his pioneerstwenty or thereaboutswere in a trap what could they do to get out of it their arms scaling ladders everything were in the outside courtyard what would be the use either of trying to force the door mere waste of time the thing required was to prevent those fifteen hundred men with a criminal past being let loose on eshwara let looseas men like them had been in the mutinyto give a lead over and thathow was that to be done he looked across to erda and took sudden comfort in the quick intelligence of her face you had better take my place with amma she said sharply go down stream to the spit cut across by the mission house and chance getting over to the police camp he had thought of this before the extra police with their two officers who had come over to see the festival through peacefully were encamped above the boatbridge and though of course most of the men would be scattered on duty through the town even some help would be better than none yet how to leave erda not alone even but with twenty men whose loyalty would depend largelyas it always didon action on their having someone to fight but you he began ill stay here they wont try to come inyet a while i am not afraid of being alone i wouldnt mind your being alone he put in but my sikhs your sikhs she echoed are they here then why they have no armsi could find some perhaps his wordsboth their wordsjostled each other in sheer haste yes then why dont you call them how can i use themtrapped like a rat theythey might be worse than useless without something to dowithout a lead overdont you seeand there is nothing nothing she echoed almost savagely as she clasped and unclasped her hands dragging the fingers through each other in sheer straining after some thought on which to clutch in cruel whipping and spurring of her wits against that inaction nothing nothing the word seemed to fill the world nothing in earth or air or fire or stay she cried with a gasp the raft the raft amma shall fetch itit must be close by now there will be room it can float down to opposite the gaol he stared at her as she stood in her white and scarlet and gold by jove he said softly by jove youve got it the next instant he was off to rouse his men and she was on the bottom step giving amma his orders short sharp clear but when lance came back again to look out what arms and ammunition he could lay hands on he found her in his room sorting cartridges as if she had done it all her life and her face turned to him all aglow and splendid we shall manage it ammas gone he didnt want to but i told him id kill the baby if he didnt i suppose it was wrongthough her womans tongue sought speech her womans hands stuck to their workbut i couldnt help it i felt so savage you are very brave he said simply brave she echoed why not people talk as if women always had to try and not be afraid but we are not all like that some of us want to fight i do always she looked it as when all was ready she leant straining her eyes into the darkness for a hint of ammas return he must come she muttered to herself he shall come and he did a bigger wave came sweeping up to the wall as a herald and then a voice calling for a rope half a dozen were ready posted in the mens hands from various points of vantage they flew outwards one from ammas hands inwards to a group holding a lantern on the steps so with a silent haul the pioneers had the raft stopped and sidling slowly back to mooring against the wall then lance turned to erda hesitating divided between his loyalty to vincent and to her the palace ought to be warned he said brieflyif i go there ahead on ammas craft i could pick you up on your way down could you manage she gave a look round on the men eager with the sudden excitement with the rush with the very novelty of it all and laughedpositively laughed manage yes of course i can managehavildar see those cartridges are put well back out of the wetstay bring down that table someone and give it a lash yet despite this absolute lack of fear despite the fact that she evidently wanted and desired no more consideration than a man lance felt a wild dislike to leaving her there alone as he stepped on to ammas skin craft and edging his way along by the wall prepared to drift down to the palace balcony it was mirk dark now and he had no fear of being seen by the crowd on the bathing steps and the courtyard though he punted his way with the paddle shaft within a yard or two of the shore for he wanted to judge how far excitement had spread how far the crowd was aware of what was coming at dawn to judge by appearances not at all there was no more restlessness no more movement than was inevitable in such a concourse of men women and children here and there files of shadowy forms drifted about but the most of them seen by the little lights set on the ground beside each group were in heaps like the heaps of dead on a battlefield huddled up on each other sleeping resting indistinguishable shrouded in their shawls waiting for the dawn to come and above the soft yet increasing murmur of the still windless storm came a softer murmuring of prayers a weird low chanting the hosts of the lord had not yet risen to battle the spirit had not moved the word had not been made manifest the palace also lay as yet undisturbed unseen in the darkness except for a glimmer of red light just above the river a paler glimmer closer at hand the red light must be by the stairs for which he was steering the other he did not know but as he slipped past it another murmuring as of prayer seemed to come from within it must come from the chapel if so then pidar narayan must be awake also he felt a certain relief at the thought when he caught sight of the canoe at the bottom of the steps then vincent as he had feared was there but not on the errand he had feared if pidar narayan knew of it so mooring his strange craft to the canoe he ran up the stairs eagerly chapter xxi margherita father ninian had been awake all night he had been vaguely uneasy all day conscious with that fine perception of his that something was amiss but it was no fear of what might happen which had kept him watching when others slept it was the memory of something which had happened for by a coincidence that for more than fifty years had never lost its mystical significance for ninian brucesentimentalist as he was to his finger tipsthe night of the vaisakh festival when the pilgrims watched for the dawn to guide them on their way to the cradle of the gods was to him personally the saddest and gladdest of the whole year since it was the night on which he had sinned the great sin of his life and repented of it even in the sinning and that sinning that repenting was no slight thing to him it was the man himself for the passion that was in him in his youth was in him in his old age it had only changed its dwellingplace it had fled from the senses and found refuge in the emotions in a way indeed by thus seeking freedom from it he had fallen into a greater thraldom so that his whole life had been as much swayed by this renunciation of a woman as it would have been by her possession old as he was this very night had brought himwith the thought that death could not delay much longer and that next vaisakh festival might find him no lonely watcherthat thrill of selfabsorption in another self that claim for all which is the essence of passion for this woman waiting for him in the land where there is no marrying or giving in marriage was still a woman still the one of all gods creatures whom he claimed and who claimed him even as the first woman claimed the first man in paradise so he had passed the night watches of the festival of spring as he had always passed them partly in his room that room made holy by her presence in his heart partly in the chapel made holy by the bodily presence of him for whose sake he had renounced her the two holinesses were inextricably mixed in pidar narayans mind he had finished one of the masses for the repose of a sinning yet sainted soul and before repeating the next was confessing his own repentance in his room when that hasty footstep along the passage which alarmed those two lovers in the balcony nearer the garden had resounded through the arches it had disturbed but not startled him its very boldness reassuring him of its right to be there probably it was some messenger from the police camp or the fort so he had risen from his knees calmly and passed into the chapel which lay between his room and the balcony in order to see who it could be for the candles were lit on the altar and sent a faint light into the vaulted passage beyond it was as he paused in passing to do homage to that bodily presence upon the altar which was readyas he was in his robesfor the service of love which was to him as a priest his duty as a man a joy unspeakable that the pistolshot came clamouring through the arches followed by those despairing cries what they were he could not distinguish but that they were urgent was unmistakable and had he been young as he had been on that night long years ago in the balcony above the pale flood of the tiber he could not have been quicker to reach the armoury seize the long rapier which he had not used save in play since those ruffling days in rome and run out into the wide dim passage whence the sound had reached him none too soon someone was already flying down it he pulled himself up for attack but the figure ere he could lunge at it was past him desperate indifferent flinging him against the wall as it continued its reckless way to the outer door where with swift opening and closing it disappeared into the crowded courtyard out of sightbeyond recall he stood for a moment stupefied what was roshan khan doing there for that faint light from the altar had given him a glimpse of a familiar dark face roshan khans without a doubt laila laila the cry was clearer this time and the blood left his fine old face in sudden doubt as he turned swiftly to his left turned and saw a faint red glow through an arch far down the passage that was the arch leading down into the balcony that was never lit upthat was never to be lit up because of something that had happened there long agobecause of the something which had begun a tragedy why was it lit up a stronger fear caught at his heart could lailanoimpossible he ran on and the next moment was realizing that some tragedy had ended in that balcony but what who was the woman in native dress who stood with a mans arm around hera man in a scarlet and gold mess jacket ahthat was captain dering undoubtedly but the woman the woman in scarlet and gold alsogod in heavenhad the dead as he stared the long supple limbs so clearly outlined under their cunningly contrived draperies seemed to lose themselves in the colour the glitter of rich stuff one white arm losing its hold on a cuff of scarlet and gold swung back helplessly and vincent dering with a passionate entreaty to his darling not to be afraid to look up and tell him where she was hurt sank to one knee the better to support what he held and so the face tilted backwards over his shoulder came in view laila for an instant ninian bruce stood bewildered then all his youth the pride of birth the dash and the fire which had made that youth what it had been rose up in him the blood surged back to his face in wild anger in savage sense of insult and desire for revenge how dare you he cried clenching his hand on his sword you shall answer for this sir how do you come to be here at this time of night and why vincent who at the first word had given a hurried glance to see who the speaker was then returned to his task with the indifference of one absolutely preoccupied held up his hand passionately against more dontand dont preach for gods sake old man he cried recklessly come and help if you like some bruteoh curse him curse him his one trembling hand for the other was round her supporting her was busy with the quaint jewelled clasps of the scented corselet which was crimsoning deeper with another dye its too late for preaching he muttered half to himselftoo late too late the words seemed to stun his hearer into silence he stood bewildered too late for what and now roused by that pistolshot also another old man who had carefully hidden himself away from the possibility of being found by roshan khan on the rage for an impossible interview who had counted with malicious cunning on the cooling effect of a useless waiting in the garden till dawn should make it necessary for hotblooded lovers to return to the fort stole like a thief to the balcony what could have happened the only likely trouble which had occurred to his vast experience had been the possibility of roshan khan seeking the interview upstairs and for that very reason had not he akbar khan felt it his duty to sleep outside his mistresss door what more could faithful servitude be expected to do but this what was this his charge had stolen a march upon him old as he was in the care of frail womanhood he had been imposed upon then as he crept round a pillar craftily the sight of pidar narayan in his priestly robes made the old sinner throw up his hands and grovel in the dust this slave knew nothing he mumbled gasping this was unknown and for the other i told him it was too soon too soonfar too soon too soon and too late what did it all mean father ninian stood helpless paralyzed but vincent caught at the words the other he echoed you black devil who was the other who was that man curse him he paused for laila opened her eyes it was roshan khan she said with a smile that halfamused halfmysterious smile he gave me the dress you know and i think he wanted meto marry him hush whats the use of being angrynow she checked his incredulous outcry and her hand hesitated up to his trembling fingers and held them back from their task dont she went on id ratheryou didnt waste time i want you to look at meonly meme myself ah thats nice there was an instants silence then her eyes wandered to his cuff as it rested on her corselet and she smiled again we match dont we im glad besides it wont stain much i expectthats why soldiers wear red isnt it the deadly realism roused vincent to a sort of fury at his own helplessness but what could a man do caught in a second by fate to be chief actor in a scene like this where he was lostlost utterly and those two fools looking ondoing nothing at least in common charity you might help youre something of a doctor he cried passionately we can settle scores afterwards you and i cant we but now you might help her what did she say asked father ninian tonelessly he had caught a word or two and their triviality in the face of what had happeneda triviality common in those who have been struck down as she had been almost painlesslyhad but increased his bewilderment what does it mean how do you come here i must know first the girl had turned her face quickly to the new voice and after vainly trying to rise lay back breathlessly tell him vincent hes father laurence rememberhe must knowandand icant then here it is sir broke in vincent brutally if you will wait to know when every moment is precious we love each otheryouve done it in your time im told ive been coming here night after night to see her she wears that dress to please methere now youve got it and tonight some devilshe says roshan khan but shes dreaming what can he have to do with itstood there and firedat me i think but she flung herselfah laila my darling why did you now will that satisfy youyouyou hush came lailas voicethere is no use in being angry besides he understands he knows what it is to be in love quite well dont you guardian you loved her didnt you margherita i mean she wandered off into italianthe language they always spoke and her rich voice dulled died away as the faintness returned for gods sake sir bring the light if you wont do anything else cried vincent wildly she has fainted i thinki cant seeit is so dark for gods sake sir the light at least the light at least as father ninian mechanically took the red lamp from its niche he felt that he needed no more light than those words he understands had sent into his very soul yes he knew what love was but he knew alsoit came home to him in a secondthat his love even after all these years differed not at all from this girls he heard it in her voicethat voice so strangely like that other voicewhich he rememberedoh so well take off the shade said vincent it makes everything soso redyouyou cant see the truth he shivered as he spoke but that first look at the girl had been enough for pidar narayan it had roused him his apathy was gone he thrust the lamp into vincents trembling hands without a word and his own steady onesthe hands which had not touched their kind except to heal body or soul since they had said farewell to a womantook up the task so for a few minutes there was silence but for the old pantaloons ceaseless mumblings as he rocked himself backwards and forwards he had meant no harm he protestedhe had conducted more affairs of the kind to a decent ending than he could well rememberno one could be more discreetaccidents would happen she is shot through the lungs said father ninian breaking the silence there is very little to be doneii he would have said fear but for vincents face of anguish what right had he to feel sorrowhe the man who had brought this about still i will try akbar bring the candles from the altar stay she had better go there it will save time you two can carry her but vincent had her in his arms with a brief where the chapelthe lights are lit lay her on the cushions before the altar i will be with you again directly when he returned from his room with lint and bandages she was lying there as he had directed her long red skirt trailing down the white steps the candles pleasethe smaller ones akbarand place them at her head they will give me a better light vincent shivered again at the sight she looked already dead with those tall tapers about her ah what did it all mean was he dreaming how was it possible the wild improbability of it stunned him when not three hours ago he had had a sherryandbitters before dinner the curious irrelevance of his thoughts made him feel as if he must wake soon yet there she lay laila whom he loved is sheis she he began not dead if you mean that replied father ninian quietly but she will not live an hour there was no mincing matters between these two mennothing but the brutal truth yet this time it was the old priest who held up his hand against a passionate outcry dont make a fuss be brave at least and dont disturb her she is coming to herself again to herself certainly to the old halfamused halfmysterious smile as her eyes caught the tapers the lighted altar beyond her lover kneeling at her side it is the wedding i suppose she saidthere was a catch in her breath nowbut why have they put the candles like a bier to save time i suppose but it mixes things up and she gave a little impatient sighoh tell him to be quick romeo forfor we always meant to be married in the enddidnt we the words cut vincent like a knife yes he had meant it not always not till even to one with his past the perfection of this idyll in the garden would have suffered without that promise to himself and now death should not cheat him should not leave a stain a regret on the one perfect romance of his life he stooped suddenly and kissed her kissed her with more passion than he had ever kissed her before it wont be long juliet he is just going to begin he whispered then rose to his feet unsteadily this at least he could do for himself and for her a sob almost of gratitude of admiration came to his eyes as he realized that it would never nevereven if she had livedhave mattered to her really but it had been a part of the play part of her as juliet so it should be his wild revolt at the sequence of improbabilitiesfor after all that idyll in the garden had been bar its environments commonplace enoughwhich had landed him inin an adelphi dramahe could not help the thought though he despised itshould give way to this the play should end with a wedding juliet should have the statue of pure gold in the eyes of the world he could ensure this by a word and the word should be spoken he touched father ninian peremptorily on the shoulder as he bent busy with his instruments i want to speak to you hush she must not hear father you say she is dying well i claim my right i am a catholici have sinnedwe will say nothing about herthat lies between us i wish to marry her while i can i ask it as my right of you a priest do you understand i ask you to marry us ninian bruce looked for an instant as if he could have killed the man who stood before him then he drew himself up priest utterly have you the right to claim it i claim it as a right replied vincent fiercely that is enough surely it is not enough i will ask her and pidar narayan knelt down beside the girl my daughter he began captain dering tells me then he gave waycara mia he whispered laying his hand on hers tell mei have never been unkind surelytell meyour old guardian who has loved who lovesmust i marry you toto him laila looked into his face with a faintlywondering reply must she echoed dreamily its just as he likes of course i dont mind i only want himwhere is he im here sweetheart vincent knelt down again and took her in his arms the faint querulousness left her voice thats nice she murmured tell him to begin quickly vincent for i dont want to waste time i want youyou yourself and meme myselfnothing else father ninian gave a sort of cry and turned blindly to the altar if this was not love what was then monotonously his voice began the marriage service have you a ring he asked when he came to stand by those two the girl supported in vincents arms the latter shook his head go on without it he said sternly she is failing fast but there was one on the old mans finger one that had never left it since it had been put there by a saint in paradise he took it off now and gave it to the man whom at that moment he hated and despised more than any man on earth so swiftly the prayers went on and old akbar paused in his rockings to say amen with the others he had learnt thus much in these latter days of grace the last one came as a step resounded down the passage lance carlyons step as he sought the light he had seensought his captain he seemed to bring a breath of fresh air into the passionladen atmosphere a solid reality into the shadows vincent he cried as he caught sight of the scarlet and gold thank god youre here the troopers have seized the fort he paused suddenly horrorstruck at what had caught his eye i beg your pardoni didnt knowis sheis shehurt vincent stood up suddenly hush that has nothing to do with it leave that to me the troopers have risen when lance with his eyes still on that pitiful sight shook his head there was a pistolshotyou must have heard it heard it echoed vincent wildly yes i heard it go on what then i dont knowi know nothing in this infernal nightmare thats got hold of us all cried lance i only know that if we dont get to the gaol before they dotheyve gone to set the prisoners freethere will be the devil of a row so you must come at once vincentyou must come at once captain dering gave an irresolute look at the dying girl she had saved his lifehe loved hercould he leave her was anything worth that sacrifice you must go said a stern voice it was father ninians who had taken vincents place and was now holding laila in his arms you must go captain dering and prevent worse from befalling if you canif you can there was almost a triumph in his voice lance looked from one to the other in sheer despair well if you wont come im offoh come along vincent and dont be a fool itit isnt worth it it never is vincent dering stood still irresolute youll stay sir he said andand look after father ninian drew the unconscious girl closer to him i will look aftermargherita the last word came in a half whisper to himself and his eyes met vincents with a curious dazed defiance the latter gave the defiance back as their owner stooped for a second over lailas indifferent face and kissed it goodby juliet he said and the last word came also in a half whisper to himself the next moment he was following lance down the dim passage full of a vague relief and realizing for the first time that the mist which for the last half hour had dimmed the reality of all things was due not to any aberration of his brain but to the simple fact that an electrical duststorm was in full blast he realized it with relief that was at least real tangible almost too much so and as the hot wind charged with those aspiring atoms of earth met him fiercely he realized also that the storm would fight against him in his efforts to prevent worse from happening if indeed anything could be worse than what had happened worse than lailas he broke off in his thought incredulous it could not be true he would come back to find her betterwell but that other dream was true his men had risen the one thing necessary therefore was to get to the gaol before any decided action took place and this he realised still more clearly from lances curt explanation as they ran down the river steps once there the sight of the canoe he had left suggested the feasibility of getting to the gaol in it his personal influence might avail if that failed he would at least be able to save time by choosing a suitable place for the raft to come ashore the great thing was to be on the spot to be within reach of action at once to wait for the raft meant needless delay so a minute after the faint splash of his paddle was lost in the rising hum of the storm and lance was left looking anxiously for sound or sight of the raft which if all had gone well should by now have started but neither came so seeing from the light he had snatched up as he passed through the balcony that the air was growing darker more impenetrable than ever he shoved off his strange craft to wait further out in the stream where there was less chance of the raft passing him unseen unheard for this reason also he paddled up along the wall a bit into the faint glow of light which showed still from the arches of the chapel and as he lay in it his ears and eyes strained for the least sound he could hear as a kind of background to that muffled drumming of the storm the sound of the pilgrims chanting as they waited for the dawn the dawn which would bringwhat who could tell the sound of other prayers echoing from the chapel made him shake his head feeling that it was hopeless to look forwardor backward for that matter why had roshan shot the girlif he had and why had pidar narayan called her margherita and vincent called her juliet the whole thing was exactly as he had saidan infernal nightmare then a faint sound in front of him made his strong arms sweep the paddle through the stream as he shot into the darkness in search of the raft in search of erda not that she needed him really the memory of her in that redandgold mess jacket above her wedding dress giving orders to the men squarely came back to make him smile god bless her she could do well enough without him that was one comfort and dillon could hold his own too without much help for a timethat was another for what with this and that help was bound to be overlong in coming chapter xxii a monopoly lance carlyon was right in trusting dr dillons power of doing without help until providence chose to send some this was the easier task in that he had made up his mind deliberately beforehand as to what his best course of action would be should an alarm of this sort occur therefore that imperative klingkling of the telegraph bell which roused him in a second from his bed where ready dressed for any such emergency he was sleeping the sleep of the just found him alert prepared for anything and everything so it has come he thought as he hastily wired back the comprehensive reply all right await you he felt as a doctor does when a dangerous symptom which he has foreseen as a possibility shows itself he had been on the lookout for this for days but as the dawn would end the period during which it might be expected he had as in the outbreak of the cholera had hopes that danger was over his last thought as he slept had been this he woke to find that the complication must be faced woke with a strong regret but a stronger instinct of fight so he slipped his feet into his shoes jammed his big mushroom hat on his head out of pure habit and so armed capapie with a brain quick to work and a body ready to follow and obey he ran across the sandy road to the smiths bungalow realizing as he did so that a duststorm was just beginning that would delay both attack and relief on the whole this would be an advantage since once things were secure half an hour or so would make no difference in the latter whereas he wanted every minute he could get now for preparation he had not warned eugene smith of his fears there was never any use alarming people by mere probabilities unless by so doing you could forearm them and this was not the case here since the safestin fact the onlyplace of refuge for mrs smith and the child should trouble arise was the semifortified roof above the gate of the gaol and that he knew to be ready for use he had therefore only to wake them as quietly as might be so as not to give the alarm to the servants fortune favoured him in this for just outside the verandah he ran full tilt upon eugene himself tall gaunt in his sleepingsuit carrying a roll of bedding on his back like a snails shell the heat of the evening had enticed him to sleep outside as he preferred a la robinson crusoe and the duststorm was sending him in hello dillon he cried whats upnothing wrong with my wife or the childi hopeno he gave a sigh of relief then its the beastly duststorm disturbed you i suppose isnt it sickening to think how many times in the next six months we shall have to take up our beds and walk hm hope i shall have the chance replied the doctor dryly recovering his breath no it isnt the storm theyre going to try a row smith just had a wire from the fort theres a plot on to come here and set the prisoners free and thats dangerous so till the troops come i think youd better bring mrs smith and gladys to the gateits the safest place and ive got everything ready it maynt be much but the devils whoever they are might turn and rend youespecially if they fail with me eugene smith had dropped his snailshell and sat down on it aghast in surprise but he was up again before the doctor finished by jove he said rapidly calmly as the doctor himself thats a taking up ones bed with a vengeance ill have em both ready in a jiffyanything else no ill rummage round till you returnone forgets things to the last sometimes and i shall want your remington and such likei know where to find em a moment after he was striking a match to light the tall floorlamp in mrs smiths drawingroom she had turned it out herself a few hours before thinking as she looked round the room full of soft roseshaded light how pretty how cosey it was it had the same air of refined security now everything down to a copy of the last queen lying on an inlaid table by her favourite chair was so exactly what one would have expected to find in her room the room of a delicate cultivated civilized society woman and now now the delicacy the culture the civilization the society and the security belonging to them had been invaded in an instant by what the dustyou could almost see it springing into the air in these sandy stretcheshad already settled thick over the dainty furniture and as dr dillon standing by the table in the pink glow of the lamp asked himself the question he yielded to the imperious fascination which a smooth sandsurface has for humanity but he did not write his name upon it only the idle answer to the question god knows the writing lay upon the table beside the latest fashions staring up into the pink paper shade after george dillon had passed rapidly to eugenes office to choose this that and the other and make them into a bundle with a tablecloth when he returned to the drawingroom muriel smith was standing by that writing in the sand a fragile figure in a blue dressinggown all frilled and embroidered like the pictures in the paper she looked more forlorn than frightened forlorn and pathetic is it warm enough said the doctor as he entered your dress i mean theres a storm on and it generally brings rain it is flannel she answered and he nodded there was no excitement no heroics only that that and the writing on the sand and her forlornnessthe forlornness of a delicate dresden shepherdess set to drive a flock of real sheep to the shambles but the needlessness the pity of it made dr dillon set his teeth eugene will be here directly with gladys she said we thought it best not to wake her and he said we had better start at once for you see i cant walk nearly so fast as he does there was no trace of fear in her voice but there was none of resistance either and she turned at the door to look back with an almost reproachful acquiescence poor room she said softly it seems so strangesuch a pity but i suppose it cant be helped she turned to the darkness again with a little shiver and went on vincent sent the wire i suppose i didnt ask replied dr dillon curtly then repenting him added i suppose so he will be here directly i expect andand we will all take care of you and gladys as long as we can you know that and we cant do morecan we she smiled quite tenderly of course you will and i am really not a bit afraidexcept of being in the way she seemed to accept the necessity of this perhaps rightly for the storm itself was no joke in these desert stretches where the sand rose in choking clouds yet left enough to make each step a toil muriel stumbled along breathlessly but so slowly that when her husband joined them striding along with gladys still sleeping wrapped in a blanket in his arms the doctor bade them come at their leisure and wait until he gave the signal before entering then ran on swiftly to the gaol for there was no time to lose though on the other hand there was very little to be done the less the better if his plan was to be successful since that involved the utmost quiet and the keeping of the prisoners from all knowledge of what was going on as long as possible as he faced the choking darkness the hot blasts of causeless wind blowing all ways at once george dillon reckoned up his chances fairly the storm would certainly make it easier to keep such knowledge from those within and make it more difficult for those without to establish communication with the former so far good on the other hand no amount of the light at his command would enable him to see even from his coign of vantage on the gateway roof what was going on either outside or inside and darkness was the diggers best friend while digging was the recognized enemy of mud walls especially of those inside walls which divided the gaol into sections yet the best the only chance of keeping the prisoners quiet lay in preserving their segregation into companies for the gaol was of the cartwheel pattern that is a huge circle of outside wall thick as an earthwork the felloes of the wheel as it were then a small central cylinder of brick like a lime kiln the nave of the wheel as it were between these two the spokes spokes of twelve feet high mud wall dividing the whole into seven wedges of prison absolutely distinct blank apertureless save for one heavily stanchioned door in the apex of each wedge leading into the central tower exit or entry was therefore impossible to six of these wedges except through the tower that is the citadel the key as it were of the gaol proper the seventh wedge however gave at its wider end on the entrancegate which was a square semifortified building pierced by a tunnel gated at each end and further protected by an outside yard or roofless porch also gated the inmost of these three gates opened on to a small courtyard and this narrowed again into an alley which gave access to the central tower briefly then the whole gaol consisted of six wedges opening by a door in their narrow end into the central cylinder and a seventh wedge split in two by an alley leading between high mud walls from the gateway to that central tower the key to the position in the two halves of the split wedge lay the warders barracks the solitary cells the cook rooms the hospital and the entry to these was by a door on either side of the little courtyard just beyond the inner gate from the corner of this also rose the outside stair leading to the roof of the square brick gateway thus the fifteen hundred prisoners were broken up into companies of about two hundred each and were absolutely without possibility of communication so long as the central tower was in the hands of authority unless there was time to undermine the mud walls and tools also wherewith to work of these however there were none in the gaol nothing even that could be used to take their place except in that seventh section which held the executive of the gaol and there dr dillon meant to leave no hands to use them if he could compass it as he pulled up to regain his breath before walking up to the gate and giving the countersign the whole place lay quiet and dark so far good there was the risk however of the plot being known and of the sentry refusing him entrance it was not however and the next moment calmly as if he was merely on one of his not infrequent rounds of unexpected night inspections dr dillon passed from the outer porch to the tunnel and told the sentry at the inner gate to light the lamp in the little office room to one side call the superintendent he said to the first man and you can tell him i am going to inspect the solitary cells he added this because he knew it would give time since the superintendent would be sure to give a private look round first to see all was in order and remove possible traces of tobacco or opiumthose luxuries out of which so much money can be made by gaol officials no sooner however had the first sentry gone through the door to the left section than he sent the second one on a similar message to the right where the hospital lay then the coast being clear he rapidly unlocked the private safe in the office which held his set of keys in case of accidents and locked both the right and left doors secure for a moment therefore from interruption he ran outside saw that the tool rooms etc were closed gave the signal to eugene smith hurried the refugees up the stairs and then after unlocking the two doors again on his way back to the office sat down in his usual chair and began to look over a register he was engaged in this calm occupation when a minute or two after the native superintendenta big dignified person in a blatant undress due largely to his bulkarrived breathless darogahjee began dr dillon instantly and the mere tone of the title made the man quiver ive had constantly to complain of the tobacco and opium smuggling that is going on among the warders and i mean to stop it ive had information tonight which will clinch the business so take the night guard rouse every warder bring everyone here even those on guard in the sectionsthe hospital orderlieseveryone in fact who is free to go out of the gaol they are to come at once no time allowed for arrangements if they are not all here in five minutes i shall think you are in league with the smugglers the darogahs fat flesh shook yet he winked as he went off if the doctorsahib expected to find anything in this fashion except maybe a smell of the forbidden drugs he was mistaken on such a night too when the dust was in everyones eyes well it might have been worse for though he knew nothing definitely of any plot he could not fail to know that there was more to excite men in the gaol that night than tobacco or opium so he went about his summons with a sigh of relief and before the five minutes were over had his posse of minor officials together including a file of unfettered prisoners with good conduct badges who were used as gang leaders he himself finally coming down the alley with a stupendous bunch of keys followed by the little group of night warders he had collected from the other sections all here asked dr dillon lighting a cigar the register please darogah they will answer to their names pass out through the wicket into the porch and stay there until ive tallied the lot im going to have it pakka this time some of the men grinned some looked uneasy and some few frowned but all obeyed though they cuddled themselves into their blankets as they slipped through the wicket and faced the whirling swirling storm in the open porch the doors of which were barred not solid kishen rao came dr dillons voice after a long series of names followed by brief presents and swift exits there was no answer he turned to the darogah for explanation absent explained the latter timorously a little more decision might have saved him the quick question with or without leave huzoor palpitated the fat man he went out to bathe in the holy pool by permission this morning he is of the utmost sobriety a brahmin promoted by your honour to as your honour knows general head wardkeeper he is not to be suspected leave till pm commented the doctor looking over the register mark him down absent without leave go on so rapidly the last man ducked under the wicket is that the lot everyone protector of the poor protested the burly official with smiles the prison is empty of the unfettered then let it remain so for the present said dr dillon coolly as he stepped forward closed the wicket slid the bolt to its place and turned on the darogah all in one swift sequence now then he went on sharply you and i have to settle a bit of business your keys he took out a revolver and laid it on the table beside himevery key you have duplicates triplicates everything im going to keep this gaol myself for a bit do you understand huzoor bleated the man helplessly putting his big bunch on the table dr dillon smiled sarcastically wont do my friend i want the lot by the list wheres the register when it came he ticked them off rapidly by it sections b and c warders duplicate wheres that he asked the official grew green kishen rao he beganbut he is of the utmost dr dillon turned on him like lightning youre a damned scoundrel sir what else is missing he ran over the rest swiftly then looked up suddenly with a scowl that made the man literally collapse so thats it is it duplicate of b and c sections missing and duplicate of the alley doors a pretty little game he laughed sardonically kishen rao gurgled the darogahby your honours promotionof the utmost but it wont play my friend it wont play went on the doctor with a curious elation i hold the thirteenth trump now you go in therehe pointed to an inner storeroom behind the slip of an office a windowless place pitch dark where the clothes in which the prisoners arrived awaited their release in pilesand thank your stars youre in such good quarters all but that brief order you go in there was spoken in english as a sort of outlet for the intense satisfaction which was filling him at his own successso far the next minute he had turned the key on the darogah and was up the stairs calling eugene smith in a low voice to come down and help to bolt and bar but to come as quietly as he could ive got rid of the lot he said joyously after he had explained the position in a few rapid words there isnt a soul in this section except the solitary cellerswho of course are ironeda few sick people and the assistant surgeon but baboojee is an agnostic and is so confoundedly afraid of the possibility of a future life that he may be trusted to go into green collapse if he hears a shot fired so rapidly the two men set to work undisturbed by more than a protesting huzoor what shall we do from the posse outside the first gate and a low knocking at the wicket there were double doors here however and of the sort which it would need time to negotiate without powder they will hold out for an hour at least said the doctor then there will be the inner one and after that the alley doorunless he remembered kishen rao and frowned that was the only weak spot in his armour we can count on an hour and a half at least he continued carefully allowing for the worst longer perhaps now then smith for the toughest job ive got a couple of crowbars here those first six stepseight if we canof the stairs must come down there arent enough of us to hold them so for fully a quarter of an hour no sound was heard above the curious vibration of the storm except the grinding and crushing of the bricks as they were rapidly eased out one by one from the mud mortar the light of one of the office lamps set on the ground showed by that time a sheer drop of eight or ten feet and eugene smith working above jammed his crowbar into a crevice of the wall against which the steps clung like a swallows nest and gave dr dillon who had been working below a rope and a hand up the latter set down the keys and the lamp he had brought up with him and deliberately dusted the knees of his trousers there thats done he said couldnt be better yes it seems pretty safe assented eugene smith a trifle dubiously safe echoed the doctor enthusiastically i havent felt so safe for the last fortnight hullo whats that that was a sudden buglecall the doctors face fell what already i didnt expect relief so soon however it cant be helped ill just go up and tell dering what ive done so that he may be prepared for the locked out ones he took the light in his hand and crossed to the outer parapet hello dering he began peering down then a couple of shots whizzed past his head and he ducked at the same moment as if roused by the concussion the first crackling thunderclap of the duststorm sounding muffled through the thick air followed like a rollcall and reverberated dully sluggishly through the black darkness when it passed dr dillons voice rose quietly there will be no relief smith those are the troopers and theyre against us so nowweve got it to ourselves smith for some time there was a certain satisfaction at the monopoly in his voice chapter xxiii the searchlight the sound of those two shots greeted vincent dering as after infinite difficulty owing to the darkness the fitful gusts of wind and the sandbanks he drew up the canoe against what he knew must be the high bank below the offtake of the canal it had only been by trusting the stream to guide him and refraining at times from the use of his paddle that he had managed to steer his way at all so he knew he was late felt indeed that he must be too late to use his influence with the men and yet despite this knowledge a keen disappointment filled him when those shots proved him to be so since by long experience he knew that once open resistance began there could be no more question of words what then was there for him to do if he in his light canoe helped wherever possible by every atom of strength his arms possessed had taken so long to come down that mile or two of stream the raft could not possibly arrive for another half hour he could not sit still for half an hour he felt indeed as if he could not sit still for half a minute a passion to act to sweep away the past to forget was upon him he had had time during his strange journeyso often idle perforceto realize his position time to piece the still stranger events preceding his journey into a reasonable sequence so that he had by now arrived at a fairly accurate guess as to the cause of much that when it happened had seemed causeless for instance lailas dress given her by someone that joined to the knowledge that she was connected with the late nawabs family of which roshan khan might with justice claim the headship had brought the latters action within the bounds of credibility jealousy revenge these were potent causes laila then must have been playing with roshans pretensions playing like a child with a toy playing rather like a woman who hesitates at nothing for the sake of the man she loves and she had hesitated at nothing not even at this to give him pleasure to make things match with his passion the thought the remembrance made him for a moment feel inclined to fling up his hands and let the canoe take him where it chose take him down stream utterly then a half choking yet wholly strenuous desire to escape from the whole story a wild instinctive effort for a more wholesome atmosphere like that of a drowning man for a breath of fresh air had sent the canoe bounding on his way his way and none others in swift obedience with a rush he had grasped that there was more in lifethat he had allowed himself to be a slave but that was pasthe would shake himself togetherhe would forget the thraldom of sexand he would forget the past yet as he cast about in his mind for the best method of applying the half hours leisure the remembrance of a woman came to him as if to mock at his resolution muriel and dear little gladys who called him derin darling where were they his eyes grew soft in the remembrance stern at the probability of their being in danger why had he not thought of it before how could he ever have paused wondering what to do he set the red light which he had taken from the fateful balcony carefully in the canoethough even should some gust of the rising wind not blow the light out it could scarcely be of any use in that outer darknessas a signal to the raft should it by an off chance drift past in his absence then struck across the sand in the direction in which he knew the smiths bungalow must lie that was a little to the rear of the gaol the storm as he faced it was so fierce that the doubt rose inevitably if an unwieldy raft could make way against it if so then there would be no help the only thing would be to defend himself and others until the end came the end which would at least end the past he had almost to feel his way the darkness was so intense it was a relief to stumble against something which he knew must be the low mud fence of muriels garden that garden in which she tried to defy providence and rear english flowers he knew his feet must be crushing her treasures as he passed on towards a faint glow a red glow but everything that was not the blackness of outer darkness tonight seemed redblood red a minute after with a vast relief at the silence the solitude he was in muriels pretty drawingroom the pinkshaded lamp was still alight showing red through the fog of dust he passed to it instinctively and as he did so noticed the writing on the table but many an earthatom had fallen on that confession of ignorance since george dillon had made it idly and so as vincent dering bent quickly to see if by chance it was some message left for those who might come after he also had to frown and say god knows was it possible that eugene and his wife were still asleep the doors stood open but that was to be expected at that season of the year unless someone had been awake to close them against the storm he must make sure however but there was no one to be found in any of the rooms it occurred to him then that they must have taken refuge in the gaol and he told himself he was a fool not to have thought of that before dillon would of course have seen to that he vincent might have remembered so much at least might have remembered that he himself was not the only slave then he gave an odd bitter little laugh was it never possible to get beyond a womans apronstrings and here he was wasting time over the question when he ought to be doing something better but what go back and wait for the raft or on to the gaol there was a big tamarisk tree at the end of the garden only two days before he had pointed it out to muriel and said that an active man accustomed to trapeze work might swing himself from it astride the high mud wall of the gaol and so gain the roof of the gate dillon had denied it and she had said laughingly that no one ever tried to break into a gaol only out of one curious still if it had only been light it would have been worth the risking but it was impossible now in the dark so suddenly a remembrance came to him the searchlight was it only last night he had been dining here in this house after bringing muriel home from the mission where they had seen that huge ray piercing the shadows was it only yesterday that he had listened to eugenes lamentations over his unused electricity which was sure he said to vanish into space from his rude contrivances was it only yesterday that in obedience to that pathetic look of martyrdom on muriels face which still seemedto one part of vincents natureto call for instant sympathy he had to appease the honest inventor shown an interest in searchlights which was purely fictitious and learned a variety of facts about buttons and stopcocks and had all this happened yesterday on purpose that today when he was in need of light he was up on the roof with the thought if only the blessed thing had go enough for that as he picked his way rapidly through the litter three or four cigarends a halffinished whiskeyandsoda seen by the flash of the hurricane lantern he had sought out and lit told him that eugene must have been at work over his new toy till late so much the better for his chancefor everybodys chance since a signal like that might make all the difference to the raft all the difference to dillon in the gaol george dillon was indeed beginning to realize this himself his almost triumphant mood had passed it had come home to him that the unexpected revelation of the troopers complicity in the plot whatever it was had changed the whole aspect of affairs now there was no question of keeping the gaol quiet until help should arrive he was face to face now with the fact that he must not rely on any aid at all what had really happened he could not guess for all he knew the troopers and pioneers might have risen and killed their officers killed everybody who would be likely to help his aim now was to sell his life andand hersas dearly as he could but in the dead darkness like a rat in a hole what could be done except waitwait for the walls to be dug through the gates to be mined that poor eight or ten feet drop at the foot of the stairs scaled then a rush still in the dark andthe greatest darkness of all not even the chance of a shot and he had plenty of ammunition it would at least have passed the time to take potshots at the devils and though these would have brought retaliation there would have been no need for exposure the parapet walls were high enough and properly loopholed so for a few minutes he sat almost sullenly beside those for whom alone he now felt responsible in the little turret which as is always the case in india rose at one corner of the flat roof giving fair shelter for the time in his first hurried recognition which had come with the shots that not help but attack lay outside he had blown out his light fearing lest eugene smith might also be exposed to similar attentions so it was pitch dark and the now almost constant reverberations which seemed to send the sandladen air in pulsebeats on your face deadened all other sounds into vague confusion but he knew that the warders within the porch the troopers without were trying to force the barred gate that would not take long though the two doors blocking the ends of the tunnel would be a tougher job and he heard closer at hand a sleepy whimper from the child a low comforting from a mothers voice the sound made him set his teeth god if there was only light to kill withal and then in a second as if by a miracle it came a great flood of shining light contemptuous at that short distance even of that outer darkness for it was electricity against electricity a house divided against itself the first thing he saw by it was that fragile figure in its dainty blue frills a childs golden head and so naturally the next instant found his hand on a rifle the searchlight by all thats lucky well everyone has not been killed anyhow cried eugene smith killed echoed dr dillon savagely no one has been killed yet but it wont be long before they are it was not for a trooper engaged in staring stupidly at the velvety black circle out of which the intruding light seemed to spring suddenly threw up his hands swirled round and fell face upwards in a crumpled heap there was an instants scare in the crowd in that hundred and fifty or more of troopers and conspirators thrown into black and white relief like a shadow pantomime about the outer gate then the startled murmurs of the lightthe deepukrag which were passing from lip to lip changed into a yell the fight had begun in earnest shoot straight remarked dr dillon a few minutes after we shant have such a good chance long the gate is almost gone then most of the game will be out of rangetoo close to the wall and once they get into the tunnel we shall have to sound cease firing until they come out on the other side but then we ought to do decent damage if the prisoners dont get at us first he paused and shot on steadily till with a hoarse shout the attackers surged inwards then he laid his rifle aside remarking that it would be as well to keep an eye gaolwards in case of complications so far as could be seen in that curious chequering of dense darkness and sharp glittering light light which was palpably an intruder which seemed absolutely apart from the things it showedeven from the dustatomsthere was none as yet at least the uppermost portion of that vast wheel of wall stood out perfect unbroken the roof of the smiths bungalow where the light stood being however but little higher than these walls much of what lay below in the sections themselves was necessarily hidden in shadow especially on the side nearest the light but the narrow alley leading up to the central tower being in straight line with the ray showed clear as daylight save just under the citadel itself so did most of the little courtyard with its doors opening to the right and left george dillon gave a sigh of satisfaction at the sight since whether the foe electedwhen once inside the gatesto rush the roof or press on to liberate the prisoners by those six doors in the round tower there would be fair chance of a good bag for a straight shot or even if the convalescents in hospital were to set free the solitarycell convictsa contingency which had occurred to him too late for any plan of minimizing the dangerand were to swarm into the courtyard to help against the last gate which of course was partly barred from the inside he could settle their hash also and that now was his one idea the idea of all brave men when they find themselves in a tight placeto kill before being killed as yet however there was no sign of life even within the vast wheel with its rims and spokes of light its centre of shadow it lay dim curiously still behind the dustatoms that danced in the ray like motes in a sunbeam there was not a sound not a sign within only the tumult of voices the intermittent shots without rising above the dull muffled hum in the air stay that was something half way round the circle where the shadow of the tall tamarisk tree in the smiths garden cut a jagged gap in the white rim of wall there was some change something that had not been there a moment ago the gap had moved had changed place and form though for a time the air was still with one of those breathless suffocating pauses when the dust above seems to sink on the dust below and fill ones very lungs and now the gap was back again as it had been before but it had left something clinging for a second to the wall like a limpet the next astride it safely reach me over my rifle smith said the doctor briefly theres a brute trying to sniggle along the wall must have come up that tree in your garden wish id taken derings advice and cut it down thanks i dont want to take my eye off him for fear he means to drop into a section ill shoot if that seems his game if not ill wait till he comes closer he leant over the parapet waiting just below him the inner wall of the gate against which the stair clung and which was prolonged into the turret where muriel and the child were sheltering joined the circular outside wall of the gaol the man thought dr dillon trusting to their being occupied in front must be trying to steal a march on them slip down the stair and take them in the rear there was plenty of time to prevent that however muriel smith roused by the sound of vincents name from the sort of lethargy into which she had fallensince she was not wanted either by her husband or the doctorrose to her knees and peered over the parapet cautiously from the tree in the garden she said dreamily yes i remember you said it couldnt be done and i said no one would ever want to do it and he said he could she paused and gave a little cryit is vincent himself she gasped dont shoot doctor its vincent i know it i feel it i knew he would come if he could vincent vincent whats up asked eugene still firing steadily at all that was to be seen only your wife says the man is captain dering andand by jove i believe she is right of course im right she sobbed half hystericallyi knew he would comei knew he wouldnt leave me to die alone eugene smith laid down his rifle and crawled over in cover deliberately with an odd look on his face yes thats dering plucky fellow hes swung himself up i always knew he was a nailing gymnast there was no grudge in his voice only a curious challenge as he looked at his wife then laid his big hand on her shoulder keep more down pleaseyour heads showing hell get here all right never fear well lower a rope to him when he comes alongside but i would rather lookid rather see anything happen she moaned it seems so unkind not to watchnot to be therewith him she was shivering all over the patient selfcontrol the steady acquiescence even in her own danger which had been hers till then gone utterly george dillon felt a great pity a vast impatience so you were right smith he broke in hastily to cover her sudden break down they arent killed now we shall have a chance of knowing whats at the bottom of all this foolery but when five minutes later vincent dering reached the roof in safety the doctor felt vaguely that the explanations only added to the general incomprehensibility and that something was being kept back what he asked impatiently had started the show of course there were plots pidar narayan knew of them but as such things generally did they had seemed abortive what then had upset the applecart vincent gave a gesture of despair what does it matter he cried we can think of thatif we can thinkwhen its over and if we cantwhat does it matter you can bet your bottom dollar on one thing said eugene who in this pause for a council of war was methodically loading various weapons for future use it is either the sex or sin this world would be a paradise of peace if people didnt want virtue or vicei dont say which is which mind you he spoke suddenly harshly and once more george dillon came to the rescue as dering says it doesnt matter but the fact that the pioneers are staunch and may be expected before long alters our tactics a bit smith we must husband our ammunition and stick on as long as possibledont you think so dering vincent kindly always had stooped to take little gladys who had crept over to him in his arms and now the child her arms round his neck was cuddling close to him im so glad oos come derin darlin she whispered and sos mumarent oo dearest vincent unclasped the soft little clinging hands almost resentfully and pulled himself together yes he said briefly weve got to hold out so it will be better to reserve ourselves and try to keep the gaol itself quiet it will take the brutes some time to force those gates unless they get help from within and then there is the alley and the doors still we shall want every minute for unless the storm lessens carlyon will scarcely get the raft here before dawn it was awful on the river it was indeed even amma had lost himself utterly while lance after paddling and drifting and shouting after a dozen false hopes was still as far from finding the raft as ever what could have become of it had it started sooner than he had expected and passed down before he had found vincent or had it never started at all had the men after he left turned round on her this fear had come to him early in his search and he had felt inclined then and there to paddle back to the fort and satisfy himself it was not so but the thought of her face if he allowed care for her to cause delay had kept him to his task steadily till he could no longer doubt that something had gone wrong but what and what was he to do then in a flash had come back her words after she had bidden him think hard you must go down to the spit cut across it by the mission house get round if you can to the police camp that had been her verdict involving her being left to take her chance and now either the raft the relief for the gaol had started or it had not if the former he might of course by a stern chase overtake it but erda was there and vincent would meet her they could do without him but if it had not started what then then matters were exactly as they had been when she had bidden him leave her so with a feeling that if this were so he cared little what happened he steered so far as he could judge for the sandbanks of the spit to the right amma on the contrary steered instinctively to the left towards the high bank the deepest stream it would at least float his logs to their destination and that was something kings had come and gone and battles had been won and lost but the logs had always had to go down the river whatever happened and among the men also an apathy seemed to have settled as they drifted on and on in the dark erda crouching in a dry spot beside the ammunition alert to the uttermost for the least hint of lance realized this from the very tone of their voices as they talked under their breath to each other she felt instinctively that the inaction the darkness the lack of a leader were lessening the value of those twenty men each minute if lance would only turn up what could have become of him the time seemed interminable she felt sure that they must already have drifted past the gaol she began to wonder if amma was not playing false for the darkness the uncertainty had its grip on her also it was like some horrid nightmare to drift on and on hearing the muffled drumming of the storm feeling the strange vibration in the air the sharp sand tingling on your face and to know nothingnothing at all save that you were there amma she cried sharply at last certain of but one thing that she must acti believe we have passed the gaol steer to the right do you hear a laugh not exactly insolent but tolerant came from the group of men tis easy to give orders missybaba said a voice but not so easy to obey them when the lord is against your side and sends darkness erdas heart gave a great throb not of fear but comprehension that was the beginning a minute or two more and these men would be out of hand amma she called again do what i tell you remember the child remember we have the deepukrag another laugh came from the men if you have the deepukrag send it now we need light for sure and the voice ended in a gasp for it was there a long ray of light showing them that they were indeed just opposite the gaol amma came erdas voice again and there was a hush and yet a triumph in it to the rightsteer to the right the raft edged slowly towards the ray but the soldiers still crouched inactive awed yet not certain then suddenly that quick crack of george dillons first shot echoed over the river then the yell then the answering shots and following on their heels rapidly came a stir among those crouching figures and one of them stood up excitedlyit has begunsee you prag lehna give the boatman a hand lo do as the missbaba bade thee quickly son of a pig steer for the lightthey have begun erda gave a sigh of relief that danger was over chapter xxiv beyond the shadow the fact that the quarrel had begun did not however have the same effect upon roshan khan in the first tempest of rage and hate which the sight of laila and vincent in the balcony had roused in him he had simply let himself go he had not thought at all had his revolver held other cartridges he would have gone on shooting at vincent pidar narayan at everybody till he could shoot no more he had run amak that curious phase of the oriental mind when once it oversteps the hard and fast lines of custom in which it moves and breathes and has its being the very fact that his revolver did not contain more possibilities for death that he had no other weapon emphasized his wild revolt he was helplessimpotentbefore these strangers who had stolen everything everything save bare existence this thought as he burst into the open into the lurid darkness of the newcome storm had made him laugh bitterly for it was only that bare existence which he wished to steal they might keep the rest but that he would claim from them somehow in fair exchange the time was ripe for such exchange toofor fair exchange the epithet fair haunted him trying to still the keen remorse for that shot in the dark for one part of him knew it to have been cowardly yes this useless plot with foolish mischief hidden in its heart to which he had just been listening with loyal intent to frustrate it could be made to serve his purpose without delay his men would follow him anywhere he had but to say the wordthe word so many of them wanted then those thieves of all that made life worth living would learn a lesson they would fight and win of course but the lesson that without such men as hemen whom they thwarted and repressed at every turnthey could not rely upon their regiments would have to be learnt and in the learning one thief would learn something else so without more thought than this desperate clashing of jealousy and despair he had dashed through the crowd of pilgrims who were waiting for the dawn gone back to the fort and given the word in the excitement which followed spreading swiftly from his own he had notand it was typical of the man that he did notforget lance carlyons friendliness a more equal friendliness than that of most there was no need to drag him into the quarrel the more so because the disloyalty of the sikh pioneers was doubtful they might complicate matters at the beginning so he had locked and barred them into the inner courtyard out of the way but captain dering he knew was outside let him be alone with his troopers as he roshan would be alone with them let them both try their influence let them try conclusions on these terms that was but fair this first step however necessitated others the original plot with its waiting for the dawn its cumbrous mechanism of keys and pilgrims and god knows what was not to his liking he meant to fight and if as the conspirators had asserted some of the warders were friends hand and foot his men could crack the nut of the gaol in half an hour the sooner the better pidar narayan he knew had recognized him and he was a fox for wiliness then captain dering must be after him even now and dillonsahib might be on the alert any time so the coup de main must come at once as to what might follow that might be after the fashion of meerut in or not who could tell the end of anything the beginning would be an opportunity for fair fight between him and a thief once more the epithet fair scorched and shrivelled him with vague remorse not for lailashe was but a woman a woman who had played him false and who deserved the worstbut for that shot in the dark for there were two roshans warring fiercely in heart and brain then after his mad reckless ride to the gaol the first realities had come to him in the sight of dr dillon standing with the light in his hand to welcome friends and in the sound of those two snapshots proclaiming foes why the question had come swiftly what quarrel had he with dr dillon or with eugene smith whose tall gaunt figure showed behind the other eugene smith who must have brought his wife his child with him the horror the terror of what might come swept through the quondam prize pupil of a mission school the horror the terror in the remembrance of the great mutiny which is alas a legacy of wrong to young india which ties her hand and foot which makes those who are worthy of the name shrink instinctively from anything which may rouse the underlying savagerythe unavoidable savageryof their countrymen could he hold his troopers could he be sure he had come to curse was it too late to bless then the memory of lailathe whole hateful tale which was irrevocablestruck him hopeless he was damned utterly he could not escape he sat rigid as a statue on his horse for a second then with a wild fury gave the orders for his troopers to dismount and force the gates your slaves nawabsahib had come the answer making him smile proudly that at any rate could not be stolen from him now now he could fight and die in what should have been his real position yet once more when the searchlight had come to throw that group of excited men hacking and hewing at doors closed by authority into significant blackandwhite relief that doubt had returned that desire to be on the side once more of men like dr dillon whose bold resolve to be alone responsible for his gaol which the warders tale revealed filled him with admiration but that sudden throwing up of a troopers hands that sidelong stumble into death had left roshan cruel as death itself for the man thus killed had been to him as a brother so he had gone on with a fresh impulse towards revenge and for a time found forgetfulness in the excitement the action for though the first gate that one giving on the open sort of porch had yielded almost at once to the troopers outside and the warders within the second barring the arched tunnel was a tougher job it was not until this had given way and the attacking party were completely sheltered from the fire of the little garrison on the roof that there was leisure for that thought to return what am i doing why am i doing it no man it may be said broadly ever fights without feeling that the battle is an appeal to a tribunal beyond himself and roshan did not feel this then the remembrance of the woman the child upstairs came persistently burdened by the weight of that past tragedy which in india it is impossible to forget and this was a woman who had always been courteous to him a child to whom he had given toys what was he doing the men were at work on the last the strongest gate with every tool they could find not many for dr dillons forethought had left them before barred doors everywhere the delay had already been great would be greater they must be close now on the lines of the original plot at which roshan had laughed for the dawn was showing faintlya mere promise of light to comein the east and the storm was passing the dull reverberations of faint thunder were lost now in the cries the blows of those at work trying to batter down the iron bars a sudden distastemore than regret or repentancecame to roshan as he stood silent watching blow after blow a sudden doubt which was the right no man worth calling a man ever fights for anything else every man worth calling one fights for that but which was right those men hacking and hewing or the little garrison upstairs there were no such searchings of heart there at any rate no question as to what they were doing though at that exact moment they were engaged in the trivial occupation of drinking tea muriel smith had made it at dr dillons suggestion against this very pause this cease firing which he had foreseen and in the making of it she had used a continental teabasket which more than once had been her companion on the brindisi route dr dillon had laid hands on it in his foraging and as she had boiled the kettle the rush and roar of a train racing through the peaceful french champaignes had seemed to be in her ears instead of that rush and roar of blows and shouting which was now rising from every part of the gaol though the prisoners were still helpless for evil in their sections so the three men haggard anxious drank their tea in silence hastily yet with a curious insistence as if the triviality gave them a hold on things familiar things beyond this midsummernights dream of madness but the child chattered as she munched a biscuit chattered of the charms of this strange picnic on the woof in the dark with oos nighty an sippers only the unconscious little voice struck a chill to the mens hearts but the woman smiled as mothers can do when they wish to guard that blessed unconsciousness to the last the unconsciousness of which they are guardians by right we are doing as well as could be expected remarked dr dillon suddenly with a quaint professional reminiscence then added i wish to god though i knew what my prisoners were up tothose solitary cellers are on my mindi believe the convalescents could dig them out with the cookroom platters and ladles i ought to have thought of that but as i say we are doing very fairly wellyour light dering was a godsend eugene smith looked up sharply almost as if he meant a disclaimer then he gave a brief assent yes but that will be more of a godsend stillit is the dawn he pointed to that faint promise of light in the east and vincent derings eyes followed his hand with the doubtful look of one sick to death as he watches the long weary night merge once more into another long weary day of certain pain there was an utter hopelessness in it yes he echoed slowly that is the dawn carlyon said the attack was planned for dawn didnt he asked the doctor deliberately helping himself to another lump of sugar deliberately trying to keep the pulse beats of those around him as near normal as might beand there had been something beyond it in vincents voice they must have meant to use the keys that brute kishen rao made off with i wonder what it was that started the show prematurely do you think it was premature why put in eugene smith we should have had some of the townspeople some of the pilgrims otherwise perhaps the stormbegan vincent the doctor shook his head if they had meant to come they would have come of course now with the wind blowing straight off us they cant possibly hear he paused and listened for a sudden silence had fallen on the turmoil beneath and out of it came an all too familiar sound the clank of leg irons some of the prisoners therefore had managed to break out of their dormitories or were these the solitary cellers i wish carlyon would turn up he muttered almost petulantly its our only chance but there was to be another for from below a voice rose loud and clear dr dillon i have no desire to hurt you or yours but i warn you that if you persist i am not responsible open the gates and you shall have a safe conductforfor everybody george dillon was on his feet at once but captain dering stopped him his eyes ablaze what shall i tell him dillon he said sharply ill take my orders from youyoure in charge but that man is under mine what shall i say dr dillon gave one glance at the woman and the child tell him to be universally damned he answered and eugene smith husband and father nodded acquiescence roshan khan was standing in full view as vincent dering stepped up to the parapet his face was raised there was almost an appeal in it but every atom of that every atom almost of humanity vanished as he recognized his captain his hand went instinctively to his revolver then a thought seemed to come to him he drew himself up proudly and waited for the answer it came keen as a knife risaldar draw off your men and return to barracks or ill shoot you as a mutineer there was half a seconds silence then a wild laugh close up men rush that gateforward the words and the crack of vincents revolverthe bullet of which aimed too high passed through roshans turbanwere almost lost in the answering yell but the risaldar stood his ground for a second then coolly sought shelter that was over they were quits now for the fair fight and fate had been kind he had unwittingly offered this manhis greatest enemya safe conduct and it had been refused luckily well let vincent dering take the whole consequences the blood of one woman was already on his head so would be the blood spilt here he roshan would need have no further scruples so as if it had gained strength from the brief respite the turmoil recommenced and now roshan khans voice could be heard urging the men on and there were answering shouts from different parts of the gaol george dillon frowned they mean business now and i fancy i hear pounding at the left section door if so we shall have the solitary cell menmy worst lot of courseout in the courtyard before long deringcan you hear anythingtheres such a confounded noise vincent who was standing at the top of the stairs which led to the tenfeet drop ran down a few steps and listened then he looked up quickly and nodded they are there the doors shaking how many of them are there two dozen or thereabouts and the convalescents of course thats nothingif they havent got their leg irons off we ought to settle most of them before they can help with the door still i wish carlyon would turn up a sudden hurry and urgency had come to the struggle and dr dillon passed restlessly to the other side of the roof the sky was lightening faintly more because the dust had sought dust again the earth earth than from any increase of light and so the broad ray of the searchlight widening as it went lost itself in the distant darkness and there was nothing to be seen riverwards but close at hand two menone in a warders uniformwere running towards the gaol shouting the doctor was back to the inner parapet in a second look out theyve got the keys nownot of this door but some of the sectionsand the alley the games up unless carlyonmrs smith pleaseyou had better go into the turretwe shall be shooting free eugene who had been standing beside her laid his hand on her shoulder yes dear he said gently go insideit will be better for gladysand for me muriel turned white but stood quite firm quite calm come little girlie she said holding out her hand to the child youve had your teaits bedtimei cant have you sitting up all she broke down a little partly because she was passing vincent and he busy loading various rifles and revolvers kept his eyes studiously from her but gladys did not choose to pass her friend in this fashion she paused a dainty little figure in a blue dressinggown like her mother and with the same fluffy golden curls about her coaxing delicate little childs face doodnight derin darlin she said im so glad oos here an sos something that was not all desire to check that formula made the man pause too to lift her gently and kiss her goodnight gladys you mustnt be frightened at anything you know youve got to be a brave girlhavent you the coaxing face was close to the haggard hauntedlooking one if oos goin to be brave derin darlin ill be brave too is oo dearest the haggardness vanished i think so little one goodnight he put the child down hastily at a crash the moment for courage had come shoot as straight as you can shouted the doctor the section doors gone let em have it the door had gone indeed and in a second the courtyard beneath them was half full of naked desperate men the worst characters in the gaol pick off the ones nearest the gatedont let em touch the boltsits good for another ten minutes if we can keep them from it came the doctors voice in jerks as he leant over the parapet just above the centre of the door below and carried out his own orders with deadly effect though his heart sank when he saw that some of the prisoners were unironedor rather unironed on one leg and that they were armed with the other iron a deadly enough weapon at close quarters besides it meant more treachery it meant a previous filing of the anklefetters and if others in the remaining sections were as free he shot quicker steadier while eugene smith and vincent one above the other on the top of the stair did the same taking the intruders on the flank it was growing lighter every instant the air was clearer the breeze of dawn was sweeping the smoke of the rifles riverwards the great white wheel of the gaol was growing broader in its outlines the shadows were shrinking but the storm seemed still there in the ceaseless reverberations theyre up to something in the far corner called eugene what is it dillon you can see better the doctor ceased firing for a second and ran farther down the parapet the keys the keys he shouted back they are trying to pass in the keys shoot the devilsthose in the corner dont let emor the gaol is gone so for the next minute it was deadly work down in that corner by the crevice through which some unseen hand was thrusting something three times a man clutching at the prize fell in a heap ere he touched it then a fourth pitched forward against the doors with the keys in his hand and a fifth groping for them rolled over on his side with them hidden under his dead body and from outside the gate came rendings and crashings and yells from above that call shoot straight or the gaols gone muriel crept out from shelter possessed once more by that frantic desire to see to the very end and stood looking down on those two on the stairs she gave a faint cry when vincent flung his rifle away and ran down to that tenfoot drop for revolver practice at the sound her husband gave one quick look up and followed suit but their own success was against them the growing pile of the wounded formed a barricade behind which a man squirming with covetous hands among the dead and dying found what he sought hes got them stop him stop him there was a fusillade the man dropped but the keys were in another handanotheranotherpassing outwards from the crushoutwards towards that low door at the end of the narrow alley without a word vincent revolver in hand let himself drop on the heads below oh dont vincent dont came a womans voice and at the sound another man gave that swift look up once more and followed suit let them be said dr dillon sharply let them do what they can it is about the only chance and still as he spoke he kept singling out a foe and firing the chance even with his help was a poor one in that crowd where there was always another dark hand to snatch at the prize and pass it nearer to the doorthat door which was the key to so much yet the crush through which they fought lessening those two englishmen found themselves with the straight alley before them for a race a race against three men without arms but without irons and with a fair start while close behind was the crushthe crowd it was nothing but a race now since the revolvers had done their worst had fired their last shot a race with the hopeif vincent could come up with those threeof using a goorkha kukri which he had thrust into the yellow silk sash he wore instead of a waistcoat beneath his red jacketthrust it therewith an ugly frown as a last argument for his foes when he had seen it lying among the pile of miscellaneous weapons dr dillon had foraged from the smiths house it had a dainty ivory handlevincent had given it to mrs smith himself and its last use had been to cut the pages of a fashion paper it had a sterner job now but vincent was behind a yard or twono more he had fired one more shot before beginning the race and eugenes legs were longer yet the yard meant all things and he knew it so as he ran his hand sought the knife look out smith look out he called ill chuck you my kukri get on and job them ill keep the others backa bit as he spoke a glittering curve sped from his hand to the other mans feet then he pulled up and faced the crowd behind with his clubbed revolver the lane was very narrow three men could barely breast it shoulder to shoulder surely one could bar it by swift blows and slow retreat for a time at any ratetime for the opening and shutting of a door he could but try oh what is he going to do gasped the woman who was watching i appose hes going to be brave mum said the child who clutched at her hand watching too with great wide uncomprehending eyes but the man beside them held his breath so retreating step by step vincent dering kept the crowd back lured the crowd on safeso far for these the first the swiftest were naturally the unironed therefore the unarmed but there were others forcing their way to the front who would be harder to deal with vincent threw his head back and wondered how eugene was faring for he dared not turn his face from his task even for a second had those three been caught up had the kukri helped it had and one of those three had fallen before a flash as of light and another but the third had the key in the door had turned it when eugene struck him from behind with a wild yell he flung his full weight on the door it burst open and the two fell headlong into the tower beyond but only for a second eugene smith was up again had the key out and in on the further side all right he shouted make a rush for it im ready vincent dering gave one sharp look round the door was not four yards from him but the crowd was not one there was no time shut it he called im all right eugene smith stood uncertain the door ajar the keys ah what could he do with the keys if he went back to helpand if not oh please shut it smith theres a good fellow please the four yards were two now were one then slowly the door closed and vincent had his back against it oh vincent vincent the agonized cry echoed above all other cries but only for an instant the next george dillons hand was gagging the lips which uttered it hush he said fiercely cant you let him forget for these last few minutes that there is such a thing as a woman in the world hush i say and a great hush came the sound of blows of iron clashing on iron and falling with a dull thud on something softer seemed to fill the world and leave room for nothing else nothing except a softer sound still a shuddering moan as a woman slipped to her knees and covered her face with her hands then slipped lower still to the ground in a heap but the child looked at her mother surprised doesnt oo like derin darlin to be brave dearest she asked in a concerned little voice chapter xxv dawn had an hour passed or twain ninian bruce could not tell it seemed to him that he had been kneeling for a lifetime there on the altar steps beside the dying girl with the glittering redandgold drapery trailing to the white marble and opening to a white breast stained reda brighter red a long lifetime long as his own that long life in which he had seen had felt so much for as he waited for her inevitable death his mind had followed that long life of his own year after year day after day hour after hour and everywhere it had seen a womans eyes a womans soul looking back from a soul from eyes that should have been a mans yes the keynote of that long life had been the love of a woman passionate love absorbing mind as well as body claiming its reward in kind as such love always does in kind there lay the whole difference between anathema and beata they were both karma or desire one of the girls white feet slid with a silvery jingle of its anklet to the next step and as he replaced it to a more comfortable position a chill struck to his heart as he remembered what such chiming had meant in the past history of the world the measure which that provoked wasanathema thatdisguised palliated refined in a thousand wayswas one kind and the other the memory of his own past surged to his brain as he bent over the girls whitening face and scanned it narrowly how like the face was to that other one now that coming death had sharpened the full youthful curves he had noticed the likeness oftenit had been clear when laila had worn the old italianbeatricesdress but not so clear not half so clear as when in thisthis almost shameless oneshe had saidi only wanthim it might have been margherita speakingmargherita who had wanted a mans soul and she had had one that was the other kind but both were desire the desire which drove humanity from paradise and keeps it vainly seeking for one still saturated as he was with the mysticism of the east and west these thoughts came to him dreamily making him feel curiously aloof from himself the pity of it filled him and brought a pity for the dying girl also the girl who had failed to find a paradise in this world and was seeking a new road to it seeking it alone the only thing she craved in all gods earth to make that paradisegone priest as he was the humanity in him rose in passionate hope that she should not wake to the consciousness of this what good would it do let her enter the shadows in peace but as he wished the wish her head which had been resting on his arm turned to the touch of it and her smooth cheek nestled closer to what it found kiss me vincent she said and her voice came back full rich round to make the claim kiss me before you go dear the old man gave a slight shiver and was silent vincent came the voice again you are there arent you you wouldnt leave menowsurely there was another silent pause and then silent still father ninian stooped and the old lips and the young ones met in a lovers kiss and as they met he knew that in that kiss lay the great renunciation of his life that henceforward there would be no woman waiting in paradise for him that the spiritual presence had gone from his life like the bodily presence that margherita was juliet and juliet margherita thats nice murmured laila softly thats nice her head settled to his arm again and the silence went on on and on till he stooped lower to listen for an unheard breath then lower still to shift that head from his arm to the ground for the need of a human touch a human sympathy had gone forever he made the sign of the cross over the dead body rose to his feet unsteadily and looked about him dazed uncertain in truth he felt all his years for the first time felt that his last hold on life had somehow gone from him in that kiss that something more than one woman lay dead before him then the sight of akbar khan still rocking himself backwards and forwards a perfect pendulum of protesting innocence and helpless remorse roused the old priest to the present he took up the rapier he had laid aside in crossing the chapel and passed over to where the old eunuch was bemoaning the highhandedness of fate it was a tyranny indeed who could have foreseen such an ending to a very ordinary intrigue who could even have dreamt of it had not men and women loved and met thus since the beginning of time so to the sinners outraged experience of life and love came the saint with his and with the face and sword of st michael and all angels tell me the truth he said sternly and tell it quickly for there is no time to lose in truth there was not much to tell it was all so simple viewed as a whole so complex in detail and as he listened the anger left pidar narayans face wistful wondering more so than ever at the last mumbling excuse it all comes gereebpunwaz from the almighty having made the missybaba so like her sainted ancestressanari begumon whom be peace anari begum on whom be peace her sainted ancestress on whom be peace he stood for an instant looking towards the altar towards the dead girl then he echoed under his breath on whom be peace that was the end peace on those women who had loved and died and on the men who had loved themlived for themperhaps died for them but for the rest who lived and loved still a quick life seemed to come back to him at the thought of these a desire to save them from death follow me he said briefly to the old retainer it must be close on dawni must see what i can do so still in his robes with the blubbering old pantaloonapostle of another cultat his heels he passed down the arched passage to the door at its end which opened on to the courtyard between the palace and the fort and as he went his brain confused as to the past clear as to the present was busy making plans for peace so far as helping those at the gaol went he knew himself to be powerless physically a couple of old menmere shadows of mencould give no help and he could not hope for influence there among the hosts of the devil but here in the city among those hosts of the lordthe pilgrims for whom he had always had a secret sympathy who knew him at least by reputationwith whom at least he stood on common groundhe might have some he could but try try to persuade some at least of the great mass of seekers after the cradle of the gods to go on their way in peace when the dawn came try to save some of them from following a wrong road the door was slightly ajar he widened the chink and looked out with a sinking heart over the courtyard with its raised unionjack of paths much larger than the yard about the pool of immortality it was crammed from end to end now with a crowd the first look at which told him that his chance of a hearing was small indeed for the dawn was closer than he had thought for amid the shadows of the chapel and the grey glimmer of coming light showed him once more a sea of upturned eager faces but the patience of the previous dawn was gone they were restless now restless with the vague uncertain restlessness which is so dangerous in a crowd which tells that the fuel for the flame is only awaiting a match any match to fire it and there were many only waiting to be struck the next instant might bring one father ninian felt this instinctively felt that here in this courtyard lay the mine which the returning troopers the desperadoes from the gaol were to fire first all eshwara might rise afterwards but the great danger lay here must be grappled with here but how not by words the ear of a crowd is always difficult to gain unless the eye is taken first and a man had both already for aloft on the barrel of the big old gun which centred the square jogi gorakhnath was expounding their wrongs to the pilgrims their inevitable damnation if the wrath of the gods was not instantly appeased his wild weird figure in all its nakedness its austerity could be seen above the little circle of lamps which his immediate supporters held upwards at armslength and above his head like a canopy drifted the wisps of tired earthatoms which were being driven sideways by the breeze of dawn as they fell in their search for rest for the storm was over their brief ambition for something beyond mere earth was past wisps which as they swept over the circling lights took a lurid glow then faded into the dim shadows again and something else caught the light redly the chaplet of human skulls the dread mothers necklace which the jogi swung from one hand to the other as he called for bloodfor blood to appease herthe mother of allthe eternal womanhood since without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins the tenet of all religions echoed into the ear of the crowd the strange demoniacal figure in its lurid setting held its eye what chance was there for a single voice none yet something must be done for the dawn was nigh every instant the light grew any moment might bring that inrush of evil from the gaol which would breed violence among these still peaceful folk the ignorant helpless folk who were being held captive by words against the coming of that inrush suddenly for a second the attention of the crowd wavered a tall man in the white dress of a europeanized native had been hoisted to the shoulders of some others not far from the jogi and so from this coign of vantage prepared to harangue the people tis ramanund said someone close to where father ninian stood in the shadow of the door he is brahmin and a scholar above scholars mayhap he will tell us what to do these times when all seems wrong there is no harm in listening nor good either for the first words of that appeal of culture to ignorance were drowned in a fiendish laugh a frenzied rattling of the dread chaplet a loud defiance hold thy peace baboojee what is blood to thee who hath no god to whom thou canst give it but we have brethren these be her drinkingcups the skulls of men like ourselves let us give her pleasure brothers and have blessing from her hands not cursing as thou hast had ramanund whose head should still be shaven whose touch unclean from the loss of a woman the allusion to the death of ramanunds wife roused an instant murmur of assent from those who were of the city and they passing the tale on to others the murmur swelled to a roar which effectively drowned the rest of ramanunds advice but father ninian still at the door still uncertain could hear a man who had been buckling on his pilgrims sandals as if for a start say as he stood up and thrust them back to his waistcloth well i for one go no further without remission or the blood which brings it as jogijee saith no man should risk the womans cursing no man can hold his own against that he hath a young wife in his house see you and all know what that means sniggered a neighbour but a third voice broke in gravely young or old what matter women sit ever on the knees of the gods as we men have sat on theirs seeing they are the mothers of us all so mother or wife we cannot escape them babajee speaks truth assented another bystander and jogijee also if she needs blood she must have it seeing she is woman as for him let him be silent he hath no god no blood sacrifice no remission of sins let him speak who hath them there was a faint sound as of the closing of a door and beyond it in the darkness of the arched passage an old voice said with a curious note of gladness in it follow me quick akbar there is not a moment to be lost the dawn has come it seemed to have come to pidar narayans face as he knelt hurriedly once more beside the body of the dead girl to fold her dead hands decently as if in prayer to cover the dead feet with the crimson draperies the dead face with the flimsy glittering veilthe veil which hid nothing of its beautywhich struck the keynote of the whole on whom be peace he whispered as he rose stretching out his thin old hand in benediction and as he said the words the vision came to him of a whole world which had loved and sinned and gone on its mysterious quest for something beyond love a world to which he had said farewell with a kiss he passed on to the altar and with swift steady hands opened the sanctuary and took out the treasure it contained a starshaped starrayed pyx set with jewels relic of the days when singingbirds that sang of themselves and such like things with many another had come to eshwara from italy take the candles from the altar akbar he said and walk in frontjust in front you knowas you used to walk the old courtier mumbled gereebpunwaz with a caper of alacrity in his confusion his resentful remorse it was a relief to return to pompto servility so with that bodily presence which till then had always brought the thought of the lost paradise of a womans love with it in his hands father ninian and his strange acolyte priest of another cult passed swiftly out of the chapel leaving the altar dark bereft of its treasure leaving the dead woman bereft of her treasure also lying in a glitter of gold and crimson on the altar steps passed on a mission of peace to the living on the chance of gaining the ear the eye of that waiting crowd outside in the courtyard as he went rapidly yet with the faltering step every now and again of one wearied by long journeying down the arched passage ninian bruce scarcely thought of success or failure there was a wistful triumph in his facehe looked as a slave might look who dies in making himself free he did not think even of the strangeness of the little procession the night had been so full of strange things but the dawn had come and he had a message to give those waiting souls outsidethe souls who were being kept back from the cradle of the gods by that fear of the eternal womanhood set the door wide akbar he said and then his voice merged into the salutaris so as the crowd turned at the sound of the opening door the sound of the chanting voice it saw raised above it dim against an arched shadow seen by the grey light of daybreak and the flicker of two tall tapers a strange starrayed cup shining in the clasped hands of a man an old man in a strange dress chanting a strange song and the sight by its very strangeness its claim to something beyond familiarity was not strange to that restless crowd waiting for a sign waiting for something not in themselves what is it what means it the whisper came like the soft hush of a wave and above it the chant rose clearly tis pidar narayan and his god said those of the city who knew as they fell back instinctively from the raised path and those who did not know followed suit in awed bewilderment till the way was clear and the little procession passed on slowly above the jammed mass of humanity above the sea of upturned expectant faces tis pidar narayan who went with my father said one here and there mayhap he goes nowlet us see yea let us see answered others that slantwise limb of the unionjack of raised paths which crossed from one corner to the other of the courtyardfrom the door in the palace to the wide archway through which the pilgrims always passed on their way to the cradle of the godscleared itself by common consent edged itself with a thicker throng of curious faces only in the middle it was barred by the big old gun by the teacher of religion as its legend boasted and by the man who claimed to be its mouthpiece for jogi gorakhnath recognizing his adversary recognizing the danger of his influence had slipped from his post above and now stood before the gun full in the path defending it with frenzied wavings of his chaplet of skulls listen not brothers he yelled jai kali ma blood blood without blood is no remission of sins and now a new curiosity a new interest came to that crowd of mere men what would happen what would these two mere men like themselves do which was backed by divine authority that both claimed that authority was clear it held its breath partly from the desire for a sign from god partly because of the desire which humanity always has for a sign of the best man let the two try which was the better so it waited ready to approve either till those two the eastern and the western sacerdotalisms met face to face within two yards of each other in the centre of the courtyard on the platform before the teacher of religion then not till then pidar narayan ceased his chant shifted the pyx to his left hand and with his right drew the rapier hidden till then by his long robes aha ahaa sighed the crowd approvingly there would be a bodily as well as a spiritual fight for jogijees chaplet of skulls swirled dangerously for both attack and defence since a swinging blow from it would kill a man and its circling sweep keep him beyond swordpoint reach which would be the better manthe better weapon but pidar narayan did not attack he only stood the pyx in one hand the sword in the otheralternatives as it wereand called in a loud voice let me pass jogi gorakhnath let me pass i say for i carry my god over the whole courtyard waking now from shadow to light under the coming day the claim echoed sharply and the arrogance of it the strength the certainty of it sank deep into the souls of those who heard it there was not a sound not a movement only a vast breathless expectancy and pidar narayans fine old face set like the nether millstone everything that had ever been in himlove passion faith worldly wisdom sympathythe grit of the whole manrose up and claimed the crowd let me pass he cried again in absolute command and this time the rapier twisting like a snake caught the chaplet of skulls in its upward swirl a dexterous unexpected turn of the old fencers wrist followed sending it flying from the jogis hand the next instant the rope on which they were strung severed by the strain by the rapiers edge the skulls were clattering bounding like balls like useless toys on the stone platform aha aha came from the crowd but the sigh was but half content and men looked at each other wonderingly since no matter which priest was the better man these were mai kalis drinkingcups the jogi however had fallen back a step and pidar narayan was in his place by the old gun pidar narayan and his strange god were now the teachers of religion what had they to say the crowd had not to wait long for father ninians voice with that nameless ring in it which makes the orator and makes the audience was already in its ears listen listen to me for i carry in this cup the blood of sacrifice the victim required by your god and mine by all the gods is here we are free brothers you and i the eternal womanhood hath had her toll in full the great mother is appeased there is no fear lift up your eyes unto the hills from whence cometh your help and follow me and my god to find yours he pointed with the swordas he paused a second for breath for strengthto the mountains to those far peaks which now that the storm had ended the earthatoms returned to earth had begun to show spectral in the dawn to show shadowy yet clear with never a wreath of mist or a wandering cloud to hide the hollow whither the feet of millions had journeyed seeking righteousness and journeyed in vain faint and far they showed against the faint far sky but as father ninian pointed to them a ray of light from the still unseen sun below the visible horizon of this world a ray of light seeking perhaps another world among the stars found the heights of the holy hills in its path and dyed their snowdrifts redblood red at the sight a roar rose from the crowd jai kali ma she gives a sign the sacrifice is there she is appeased he speaks the truth let us follow him and his god ay as my father did cried one and mine and mine assented some while others forgot all save pilgrimage in the shout ram ram sita ram hara hari hari hara so on that babel of sounds pidar narayans voice rose steadily as preceded by that ambling figurestrangest of all acolyteshe walked on chanting the st psalm levavi oculos meos in montes unde veniet auxilium mihi the words were in an unknown tongue the rhythm strange but the spirit the idea were familiar it was the song of someone seeking the cradle of the gods as they were he carries his god and that means all said an old man pushing his way to follow the other had none how could he lead the way that is true assented many following suit and some shrugging their shoulders said he is mad god has touched his brain then he goes the way our fathers went they lingered not beyond the second dawn why should we ram ram sita ram thus swiftly the footfalls gathered in strength behind the little procession and no one dared to stop it not even the mahomedan sentry at the fort gate to whom some of the agitators ran in their disappointment he only laughed contemptuously though his gravity returned somewhat at his recognition of old akbar khan lo that is a new walking for him he muttered in an awed voice truly folk are right when they say there is magic in these idolaters who would have deemed him pilgrim well let him go he and his mummery we soldiers can do without priests and hindoos he twirled his mustache fiercely and wondered when his comrades would return victorious from the gaol and give the word for plunder that was all he cared for ay assented an angry voice joining the group we can do without the fools there be plenty of wise men left plenty put in another but their mood is different see how they wander it was true the crowd had broken into groups and from these pilgrims singly or in smaller groups were drifting after the lessening sound of that chanting voice not so much from any belief in pidar narayan not even because of his lead over but because it was the old way the way worn by the feet of their fathers and their fathers fathers so jogi gorakhnath who now the coast was clear had sprung aloft on the old gun once more attempting to regain his empire failed egregiously the crowd passed him by till a big countryman with a lumbering jest asked him if he was sure he had picked up the right skull to put on his own shoulders then it laughed uproariously best come on to the pool of immortality suggested a conspirator consolingly as he hurried past tis no use here the fools have followed after strange gods and men but at the pool there are tens of thousands to one here and they are weary waiting besides tis nearer the gaol between the two success will lie yea added another that was the first planthe soldiers and the fort spoilt it but the pool and the gaol remain jogi gorakhnath with a scowl gathered up his skulls to a bundle and followed hastily he would at least be out of hearing of that chanting voice it had reached the last verse of its psalm now and faltered a little over the words dominus custodiat introitum tuum et exitum tuum ex hoc et usque in saeculum but the echo of the footsteps behind filled up the blanks chapter xxvi foiled on the gaol or the pool of immortality lay the hopes of those whom pidar narayan had so far discomfited by his arrogant claim to stand between heaven and earth in other words to be in personal relations with the great awarder of gaols and immortalities forgivenesses and punishments but the stars in their courses hidden though they had been by the stormdarkness had used that very darkness to the due maintenance of law and order as they wheeled serenely to meet the coming dawn when lance for instancehis heart torn in twain by his desire to follow erdas fate at all costs and his knowledge that if he was to do the best for others he must leave her to face it alonehad struck down stream on ammas strange craft his sole intention had been to rouse the police camp and secure what help he could for the gaol but the darkness set him another task for after drifting past the spit whence he had meant to cut across by land to the bridge of boats and so creeping past the city find the camp beyond it he had lost himself absolutely in the maze of sandbanks and shallow channels which when the river was low as it was now lay like a network between the deep stream of the hara and the deep stream of the hari lost himself so utterly that realizing his own bewilderment he had called himself a fool for having lost himself a curious discouragement came to him yet it made him more dogged and persistent even while the hopelessness of finding his way grew every second surely thought he he could not be such a fool as to fail sometimes a sudden belief that he really had had some faint indication of his bearings would make him put all his young strength into the paddle until once more a soft yielding yet irresistible impact came to tell him that he had failed again that he was on another sandbank and another and another the dull concussion of them seemed to pass into his brain he found himself fumbling on almost aimlessly despite his doggedness his mind busy with imagining the things which might be happening in the dark around him for all he knew close by there lay the sting it was suffocating to be set as it were in the solid darkness likehe thought of a fly in amber the birds he had limed in his boyhood finally of a death mask that was more like ithe felt as the corpse must feelclogged hampered helpless in such conditions minutes seem hours and lance in reality had not been drifting about for half of one before the certainty that his mission must inevitably be useless unless he could fulfil it more expeditiously made him resolve on trying conclusions with the river at first hand he was a good swimmer as he told himself this the first pulse of gratitude he had ever felt for the big bully who had chucked him a small boy in his first term at harrow into ducker to take his chance came to him for those few minutes of despairing effort had taught him more than mere swimming they had taught him to trust himself in water more at any rate than in a beastly contrivance made of beds and footballs with no stem no stern and a devilish habit of spinning in every eddy like a teetotum the mere condemnation of ammas craft being a prelude to better things raised his spirits he flung off his clothes and knowing he could not hope to keep his revolver dry improvised a waistcloth out of the silk sash he wore instead of a waistcoat in which to stick the huntingknife that was his only other weapon as he did so he thought of the deer the knife had killed as men think idly irrelevantly of such trivialities when their attention is really concentrated on something that is as yet outside experience and lance as he slipped into the water knew himself prepared to swim or wade but knew nothing else so doggedly as before and infinitely quicker he went on through the darkness sometimes feeling himself in the cool water sometimes finding his feet on warm sand sometimes parting a way he knew not where through the low tamarisk and high grass marking an island if he could have guessed which island or even known which way his face was set these light swishing touches might have been guides but he knew nothing until after a time a faint far glow a mere suspicion of something not outer darkness showed on his left even so he could not guess whether that meant the gaol side or the city side of the rivers if the former could the gaol have been fired by those devils the thought made him set his teeth and dry sand being beneath his feet run on recklessly towards the glow only for a yard or two however then he pulled up short amazed to find that it was not far but near that it came from the ground from a leaping fire of tamarisk branches within a stones throw of him a step or two more in fact showed him a cookingpot the remains of some food a familiar fishingnet and a chrysalislooking figure wrapped in a blanket and halfburied in the sand one of the fisher folk by all that was lucky if anyone could tell they could it was only a slender stem of tigergrass which snapped under his feet but the noise was sufficient the sleeper sprang to his like a wild animal the blanket falling from him one lithe arm making for the long spear stuck in the sand beside him gugu the missing gugu lance had him back in his sandbed before hand and spear met there was no struggle gugu knowing himself helpless lay limp slack every muscle proclaiming capitulation in so far showing himself something less than a wild animal which struggles till it dies reckless of odds but in truth gugu with the certainty of speedy extinction before him due to that cursed ghost had given in to fate utterly all round death would come when it came all that remained therefore was to make others suffer if he could especially those who were responsible for altering the currents of the river with one of these on top of you this was impossible but time might bring opportunity you devil cried lance throttling the abject jelly by way of emphasis you know all about this business of course but now ive found you youll have to do mineor ill kill you do you understand now which way is the town gugu pointed in the direction whence lance had come the latter frowned realizing that it was impossible to know if the brute spoke truth but that unfortunately he must be trusted then get up he said curtly taking care to keep the jelly within reach of his knife and show me the way there ill give you a hundred rupees if you do and if you dont he gave the yielding flesh an explanatory prick does the huzoor mean the pool of immortality asked gugu affably and the words made lance remember that fruitless waiting for the water ah you did manage that swindle did you he replied savagely and of course you were camping out of the way i see no i dont want to go there yet to the bridge so quick march or swim you can tell me about the other as we go along it may be useful another prick with the knife he held in one hand while his other clutched firmly on gugus hempstrung waistbelt of blue beads started them so they went on till the sand grew colder less resistant changed to water beneath their feet then lances two handsand the knifecame down on gugus bare back strike out he said briefly ill help the two pair of legs and the one pair of hands forged ahead into the darkness none the less rapidly because the second pair of hands were restingwith something in themon yielding flesh the fact indeed or something else seemed to make gugu confidential if the huzoor he said with a shameless comprehension which made lance inclined to use the knife then and there wanted to give the alarm at the police camp he was taking a long road to it he gugu could show him a shorter if the huzoor would trust him for a second lance hesitated he could not see the mans face but there was a sort of cunning anxiety in the tone which was doubtful then remembering that short or long he was equally at the mans mercy if he chose to brave resultsthough there seemed to be no reason why he shouldhe said quietly i told you to take the shortest the huzoor can dive asked gugu he should since he swims so strong dive echoed lance yes why because the short way gugu explained was by an underground passage which could be only reached from the river undoubtedly the huzoor was right the passage had to do with the miracle but there must have been more than one miracle in the old days since there was quite a network of canals and caves which could be more or less flooded at will all the river people knew of them but few ventured in there was nothing to be gained by doing so as a rule and the dive to reach the passage was long and awkward but if the huzoor would trust go ahead broke in lance sharply he had to trust and time meant everything besides even in diving he could have his revenge on that sleek yielding back for answer gugu altered his course with almost suspicious alacrity though once more lance could see no reason for treachery a hundred rupees was a big bribe to a man who evidently had no personal interest in the matter else why should he have been on the island instead of in the row but then lance did not know of that call to death so through the dark the one pair of hands and two pairs of legs forged ahead till a sudden arrest of the former gave lance a dull shock once more but this time gugus voice came quite cheerfully the city wall huzoor this slave must feel if he goes up or down apparently it was up and after a few minutes of crablike edging gugus voice came again the tunnel is below protector of the poor let the most noble take the longest breath he ever breathed then strike down till this mean ones legs cease moving the most noble ones must cease also the rest will this dustlike one accomplish save the breath that is in the huzoors own keeping therefore let him take time for filling and when he is ready let him signal this slave withwith a knifeprick if he chooses the cool grasp of the position made lance smile though the situation he knew was grave enough that breath to be drawn might be his last all the more reason why he could have wished it less full of sand for the storm was now at its fiercest even here out on the river over the water the air seemed solid and it had a vibration that could be felt on the bare skin as he drew in that long breath before trusting himself to the unseen man whom he held within reach of the grim signaland something sharper should there be sign of treacherylance told himself that the water could scarcely be more suffocating than the air thenthe sleek skin under his hand shrinking from the knifeprickthe two pairs of legs and the one pair of arms struck down it was almost a relief at first to get rid of the stinging dust in ones face almost a relief not to breathe but when after a few seconds the legs in front of him grew rigid and nothing was left to be done save to hold on desperately to a waistbelt of blue beads and ones own breath at the same time the sense of suffocation returned and the question how much longer seemed to throb in his brain he gripped everything he had to grip tighter but his own body seemed to grip his mind tighter still he could feel the clutch of his veinsa whole corded network of themcould see them a corded pulsing network edged with prismatic light sending stars into the darkness beating time to the singing in his ears to the fierce duel between the desire to gasp and the determination to hold onbeating time to the confused rush of thoughts which ended in onethis is drowning it made his clutch tighter gugu at least should drown too that was the last conscious thought it merged into a frantic insistent clamour for air air air till something cold hit him full on the face and forced him into a quick gasping cry that left him senseless when he came to himself as he did a moment or two afterwards he was still clutching the waistbelt of blue beads and the touch of it lulled him to an instants sheer relief the dive was over they must be in the cave the cold that had hit him in the face must have been the air but what was he lying upon surely rock and the hand he moved to feel it brought the blue beads with it unresistingly gugu where was gugu gone and the knife too it had been used to sever the hempen string of the belt curious it might have been used for a different and more deadly purpose but you could never count on what fellows would doeven when they were treacherous lance thought this dreamily before he realized more than the fact that he was alive not drowned then he sat up hastily and faced the truth that he was alone once more alone in that network of underground passages and caves of which gugu had spoken was there any chance of his getting out of it not by the dive certainly without help that was impossible he set himself to remember what his guide had said in reply to the questions with which he had been purposely plied first as to light if gugu was to be trusted the materials for this must be close at hand lance rose cautiously and felt about the ledge on which he lay and the walls of rock about him and ere long came on what he sought flint and steel a box of tinder a bottle of oil and a rag torch hung in an old bit of fishingnet to a peg that was driven into a crevice so far good and after a minute these enabled him to see that he was in a sort of vaulted well half hewn out of rock half built in with brick it was filled to some three feet or so with water except in one corner where the flooring shelved down to an archway there it was deeper this must be the opening of the tunnel through which they had dived and through which doubtless gugu had escaped for he was not likely to have braved the intricate passages without a light this thought made lance look to see how much oil the bottle contained there was only a mere driblet at the bottom plainly therefore he could pause no longer so instantly without further thought he waded across the pool and ran along the only passage which led from it he had to stoop as he ran and from the feel to his feet he guessed that the passage led upwards first then downwards apparently too in a perfectly straight line the river therefore must be behind him and he tried to make this point a fixed one so as to give him some notion of his bearings after a hundred yards or so he emerged into a second cave or chamber also nearly waistdeep in water from this several passages opened some too small to admit of a man passing through them these then must be the canals of which gugu had spoken one of them possibly that which should have supplied the pool with immortality the memory of that crowd of eager patient faces disappointed by such a miserable trick made lance feel pitiful then his pity brought a sudden practical suggestion why not open the sluice or whatever it was now and give the miracle it would at least keep some of the crew quiet when it came at dawn the dawn which might be so fatal to quietthe dawn which must surely be close at hand he raised the torch and saw close beside him a foot or two above the present level of the water a clumsy closed stone conduit with an iron handle it was a rude primitive tap no doubt by which the levels could be raised without further thought he turned it and smiled to find himself right as water poured out filling the vaulted chamber with sound then without further pause he passed on down the biggest of the passages leading from the chamber since that seemed the most likely one after a while however the passage narrowed seemed in danger of ending altogether so he harked back there was no longer any sound in the chamber when he returned to it and the level of the water had risen almost to the floor of the passage in which he stood wondering which of the other outlets he had best try the choice was a case of sheer chance of course he told himself a mere backing of ones luck but as he paused to make it something cold struck on his feet causing him to look down in sudden surprise the water was still rising that must be stopped anyhow unless he was to be drowned out like a sewer rat he stuck the torch into a cleft in the rock beside him hung the net to it and swam over to the conduit which was already submerged but the handle which had turned so easily was stiff now possibly because of the pressure of the water possibly because there was some other rude mechanism of which he was unaware anyhow after a few trials he realized that he was helpless until the water had found its own level but what was that who could tell would it rise and rise and rise till it filled the whole place who could tell it was not fear which clutched at his heartonly a vague selfpity almost an amused wonder that this immortality for others might bring death to him he looked up into the vaulted arch above him then to the as yet dry passages which he could just see as darker arches of shadow unless one of them rose abruptly to a higher leveland the chance that one did or that he should find it was remotehe would be wiser to stay here and see what happened the roof was at least higher he swam back to the torch and holding on to the crevices of the wall waited still rising he shifted the torch to a higher crevice and waited again a dull curiosity taking possession of him still rising he wondered suddenly whether it would not have been better for him to have gone back the way he had come the passage had certainly seemed to ascend and it was a question of levels that was all a mere question of levels he shifted the torch again it was dying down now the rags showing charred cindery but as he fed it with oil and it flared up and smoked the thought came to him that it was using air needlessly making suffocation more imminent he blew it out deliberately if a man had to die he might as well die in the dark he was glad a moment later of the darkness it shut out reality and left him to dreams to vague hopes to kindly forgetfulness to erdas face how plucky she had been well even if he had to be drowned like a rat in a sewer he must not be behind her the pathetic comfort of kindly memory which with strange unreasonsince it enhances the value of the life that is being leftmakes the face of death seem less stern to poor humanity came to him and absorbed him if he died and she lived she would not forget him he knew that and still the water rose it must be rising now he thought in the pool of immortality and the eager patient faces that had been waiting for it so long must be showing glad in the grey light of the dawn for the dawn was coming to the world though he would not see it strange incomprehensible thought even though the reality of it was so certain so close incomprehensible say rather impossible frankly impossible he could not be going to die he shifted the unlit torch to a still higher crevicealmost a ledge in the rockand waited incredulously for the water to rise and as he waited in the dark someone else in the grey dawn to whom death was more familiar to whom in a way it was the one great certainty of life was feeling the same frank incredulity at the thought of the immediate future for dr dillon when he found himself alone on the roof of the gaol gate with an unconscious woman and a child knew that the end could not be far off with vincent dead and eugene cut off by the stern necessity for keeping that door shut he could not hope for more than a brief savage resistanceand then failure inevitable failure unless help came and that seemed far as ever as yet dazed by that closing of the door that desperate triumphant death of the man with his back to ita death which had gained them nothingthe prisoners were still huddled together crushed out of further action at the far end of the alley so the courtyard was clear free from assailants but that could only be for a minute or two there was an ominous rending and hewing at the gate below ere long those outside would be inside and with a leader who would know what to do so life could only be an affair of moments yet it seemed incredible more than incredible that all his strong will and determination would not avail even to save those helpless creatures in his charge he stooped hurriedly and lifted the still unconscious woman in his arms carried her into the turret closed the door on her and the childfrightened now for the first time at her mothers silenceand returned to wait and watch it was all he could do for them unless fate gave him a chance of appealing for them to roshan khan but even then there could be no bargaining no compromise no surrender a sharp crash a sudden rise in the babel of voices below warned him that the gate had given partially at least the next instant a soldier or two ignorant of that dead man with his back against the closed gate ran lightly down the alley calling on the prisoners to make way one of them was roshan khan but george dillon did not waste a cartridge even on him he was reserving his fire for that storming of the broken stairs which must come when the assailants found themselves still foiled in truth roshan khan had this same storming in his mind as all he cared for since it would pit him against his rival against vincent dering who he knew was on the roof and so with that odd acquired sense of honour fair play god knows what he had been planning as his men battered down the gate how best to compass those fair odds which were necessary alike to his sense of justice and injusticefor the injustice of his own position cried aloud for proof that he was worth a better one so he had settled to complete that liberating of the prisoners which with the help of the keys ought already to be in hand this done the general rabble would be eager for freedom eager for plunder eager to get to the town and raise it eager for all things for which he cared no jot then would be his time thenhe did not even try to formulate howhe could find himself face to face at fair odds with vincent dering wild memories of duels he had read about in western books duels with others who had nothing to do with the quarrel looking on occurred to him yes that would satisfy him to have it out till death he set his teeth as he forced a peremptory way through the crowd at the end of the alley which hid the closed door until one actually stood beside it then he stood transfixed for he saw vincent derings dead body still backed by that closed door still guarding it unarmed there was a curious look of content in the dead face and roshan grasping its meaning by intuition turned from it with a curse knowing himself forestalled cheated twas not our fault khanjee protested a voice quickly the swine fought till the other one had locked the door in our faces and so roshan struck at the voice fiercely not forestalled not cheated only but outdone conquered his rival had died a heros death and hehe might live to be hanged a rage of despair of despite seized on him his one real object gone the whole hideous folly of the rest made him fling up his hands passionately as he dashed back to the gate neither knowing nor caring what he was going to do next storm that feeble garrison on the roof those broken stairs every crevice every foothold in which stood out clear easy in the light of the searchray was that a mans task confused dazed he ran on followed instinctively by the crowd wondering what he would be at george dillon seeing the rush covered the first foothold of the broken stairs with his rifle and waited for a man to show on it but none came just as the rush reached the courtyard eugene smiths searchray having exhausted itself went out leaving not darkness but the grey mystery of dawn in which for an instant all sound all movement seemed arrested there was one utterly peaceful second and then from behind the splintered gateway from the shadows of the tunnel came a breathless voice close the outer gate sergeant if you can you have them in a trap a regular trap a trap the word reached those who had followed roshan in his causeless retreat had he foreseen this was he escaping from the trap their eyes flew to the tunnel but the light which till then had lit up its darkness the swinging lamp by which the batterers of the gate had worked was dashed down by someones handa small white handand there was nothing to be seen only that voice to be heard repeating theyre in a trap keep them there keep them not if they could fight their way into the open the cry rose in a second a trap yea a trap out of it outside brothers outside where we can fight free roshan who would have paused at this chance of fair resistance was caught in the rush from behind and found himself through the gap in the gate fighting desperately in the crowd calling on his men to rally but they had construed his halffrenzied flight from that look on vincent derings face into a lead and they were mixed up inextricably with the horde of undisciplined conspirators who having been till now safe under cover of the tunnelled archway yelled for the open not so much in which to fight but in which to run away the mere handful of men whose number was fortunately hidden by the darkness could never have prevented the rush but a quick wit amongst them seized on a possibility and the breathless voice called let them passlet them pass so in a second or two amid confused yells and mad slashings at friends and foes alike the positions were reversed the inside was out the outside in like brian olynns breeches and dr dillons first hint at what the amazing turn of affairs below him meant came with the words barricade that gate sharp as you know how they wont give us long is that you carlyon he called doubtfully leaning over the parapet and peering into that grey mystery of dawn the figure he saw a woman in a white dress and a scarlet mess jacket made him doubt the evidence of his own eyes but the answer in a womans voice with a quick breath in it sent his back in something between a laugh and a sob then he isnt here oh what can have become of him there was no doubt that this was a woman chapter xxvii laddio del marito once outside where they could discern friend from foe the troopers instantly realized their mistake and rallied round roshan but it was too late for that now as he stood centring them there was a wild contempt a vague relief in his face he knew now where his sympathies lay not with these men treacherous to their salt but with those who could holdwho had heldtheir own against all odds yes even with that dead figure still with its back to the door that must not be opened the thought stung and seared like hot iron no not with that not with that that waswhat he could have killed himself for the unwavering testimony which every scrap of him gave to the heroism the defiance of such a death he knew he would give everything to die one like it and he knew he could notnot now he knew he must die a useless death to save himself from a worse one there is no real harm done khanjee broke in his lanceduffadar in hurried excuse seeing the expression on his face we can get in easily again those holding the horses say there were but a score of them all toldthe cursed sikhsgod knows how they got out of the fort i thought we had them safe and there was a woman with thema missbabahe laughed savagely well if they be brave as men these infidel women let them die like menthe hellcats roshan khan looked at the man whom he had known for years as if he had never seen him before and the thought of another womanwith his own blood in her veinswho had been brave also and who had dieddied by his handreturned to sweep him from every bearing from every landmark eastern or western and leave him rudderless drifting in a storm of sheer despair he laughed suddenlyan insane laughat the hideousness the hopelessness of it all laughed like the madman he was for the time at the horror which drove him mad kill her if thou wilt fool i have done my share of that he cried brutally striking out at the voice as he had struck at the other which had told him of vincents victory striking as he felt inclined to strike at anything and everything most of all at the hateful confusion in himself and in his world so without another word he broke through the circle of troopers dashed to where his horse awaited him and was off like a whirlwind that strange possession of the oriental races which in a way claims kindred with the berserk rage of the north thrilling to his fingertips yet held in check diverted from sheer mad uncalculating desire to kill by that acquired sense of fair play he goes to rouse the city said some of his men following him hurriedly and time too assented some of the conspirators the dawn is upon us and if the pilgrims drift away our hope is gone but most of the crowd troopers and conspirators alike felt vaguely that the dawn had indeed come that the midsummer nights dream of madness was over that those who were wise would try while they had the chance to escape from its consequences and that such a chance existed even now was patent the very madness of the night its lack of reasonable explanation were in their favour and its darkness the outer darkness of the storm which had sprung up in a minute must have hidden much who for instance was to sayexcept those impenitent ones whose evidence if given at all must be doubted as the evidence of condemned men seeking to drag others down to their fatewhether such and such a one had been a rebel at first provided always that there was no doubt about his staunchness at the last that is now that the dawn had comethe dawn which showed doubt almost a surprise in so many faces what had come to them why were they there kuchch saiya pur gya some shadow fell on me muttered one man below his breath as he sheathed his sword and another with an oath said boldly this one is for the winning side then gave the cry to the rescue brothers to the rescue cut down the mutineersso promptly began operations on the nearest defenceless prisoner thus almost before those who had galloped in hot haste after roshans lead were out of sight the prisoners even the resisting warders had been driven into the portico and penned like a flock of sheep between the troopers outside and the pioneers within the lord is king said the lanceduffadar piously to a neighbourhe had started back from roshans blow with a scowl and watched his retreat resentfullythe handleend of his sword is safest lo have at them brothershe added aloudhave at the evilborn ones who would have killed the mems and the babalogue as such scum did in the great breathing making the faces of the soldiery black for all time show them our mettle forward gordsavethekaveen gordsavethekaveen the cry grew to a shout and dr dillon who with a great incredulity lessening the values of all he saw and heard had promptly swung himself down into the courtyard looked through a crevice in the barricadewhich was fast taking form under the willing hands of the pioneersto see what the noise meant it is all over he said slowly his face pathetic in its bewilderment the troopers are siding with us he stood for a moment as if unable to grasp the reality and his keen inquisitive eyes seemed to search almost reproachfully for some cause some hint of reason in his surroundings in the splintered door in every cranny and foothold of the broken stair and so past the parapet they continued their question to the lightening sky against which faint and far those distant peaks where lay the cradle of the gods had begun to show dimly all for nothing he muttered to himself almost petulantly poor dering so swiftly he passed down the alleyswiftly but hopelessly for he knew what those iron shackles meant on a mans bare head he drew the body to one side with tender care then knocked at the closed door and called to the man within smith open the door youd better come outi think its all over now be quick please there was a pause then a fumbling at the bolts and bars so in that grey cold light a figure stood at the open door tall gaunt with a hunted look in its eyes almost a terror as they looked downdown to the thresholddown for what they knew should be there dering asked eugene smith rather hoarsely then seeing what lay to one side covered his eyes from the sight with a cry like a womans and trembled all over that strain of patient idle inaction had been awful oh god damn them burst out the doctor fiercely and all for nothingfor nothing at least i think so come on smith and make sure for nothing for nothing the words were echoing in roshans brain also as with loose rein recklessly he galloped over the frail bridge of boats making it quiver and thunder beneath his horses hoofs and send curved waves of light and shadow over the clear steely surface of the water seen like a polished shield in the dawn the air was clear also the distant hills steel grey as the water the sky steel grey as the hills and there was the bright keenness as of a glittering sword in the chill breeze that swept from west to east but roshan did not feel it he was absorbed in himself in the useless battle of his life for nothing for nothing he did not even hear the soft yet sonorous roar beginning like the rush of a big breaker on a beach ending with a wild musical note like the wail of newweaned lambs and their mothers on a lone hillside which suddenly echoed out over the water making those who galloped behind look at each other and whisper joyfully tis all right khansahib said one urging his horse alongside the pilgrims are waiting stillhear you not their cry they grow impatient roshan looked at him with lacklustre eyes what were the pilgrims to him or their impatience what was salvation immortality to one whose only desire was deathdeath and forgetfulness he dug his spurs into his horse savagely glad to give pain and rode on hara hari hari hara the roar was articulate now and those behind looked doubtfully at each other if it should be the miracle suggested one conspirator but another shook his head how can that be none know the trick save those two gugu and amma and they are safe unless it be a miracle put in a third almost timidly gods club makes no noise and the night has been full of marvels so an uneasy silence fell upon the rest hara hari hari hara there was no mistaking the cry now it rose exultant yet with that wailing note in it still which lingers always in humanitys claim to have found its lost paradise its lost purity yet there was no trace of doubt in the almost frantic joy on every face in the dense multitude which stopped the little cavalcade as it entered the square around the pool of immortality stopped it hopelessly as if the moving breathing living mass had been a dead wall hara hari hari hara it was almost a yell the patience was gone utterly and far as the eye could reach in all the wide square in every street and alley converging to it there was the restless ineffectual movement of the sea when on a summers day it beats itself calmly yet persistentlyrising and fallingupon a sheer cliff against the impossible there was no one to check the crowd now to prevent it from finding death and immortality at the same time what matter what were a few hundreds of crushed bodies when the soul found what it sought the riders behind roshan threw up their hands at the sight no hope here for the littlenesses of life for principalities and powers even for political liberty this was the bedrock this in its unalterable aspirationnot for something better but for the bestneither culture nor conspiracy could touch this was as much beyond the control of kith and kin as of strangers and aliens come khansahib they called to the figure with the lacklustre eyes which sat its horse like a statue staring at itself at its world conscious only of the hideous discords which were perforce the music of its sphere come nawabjee there is still a chance with the teacher of religion the jogi will have held his folk for sure they will be ready for blood since mai kalithe speaker spat his mahomedan contempt for the idolatry ere he went onlets none go shes a true woman for that so by back alleys and crooked ways roshanwhy he did not know since he meant nothing by itled the cavalcade past the palace through the archway into the courtyard with its unionjack of raised paths and found it empty empty of all save the jogi gorakhnath who was busy resignedly in rethreading his chaplet of skulls ere starting to seek safety over the british border in some far recess of the holy hills whence when this affair had blown over he could swoop down with added sanctity on some other religious fair he and his god stole them from me not the saying of a rosary past he said cheerfully after he had explained the position they went by yonder door to the old road so what matter they are in it they will come back to her by and by it is so always men follow other leads other loves but they do not find what they seek so they come back to her to the many named woman jai kali ma those behind roshan looked at each other it is the end they said briefly come risaldarjee the change of title was significantwe shall have to ride far and fast if we are to live once more every atom of the man soul and body seemed to strike out furiously at the voice at the truth and the untruth in it at the assertion of failure the linking of his need with theirs ride for your lives if you want them he cried fiercely i seek death they left him after unavailing protests and rode helterskelter on to the fort warning their comrades that the game was up so on towards safety and the jogi naked but not ashamed still swinging his chaplet of skulls followed them leisurely for he knew himself safe in the superstition and the devotion of every woman in india since he her servant could not fail of shelter in every hindoo homestead far or near in which a womans hand closed on a mans holding him tight for herself alone as the great mother holds all men roshan thus left alone rode his horse on slowly to the central plinth dismounted and hitching the bridle over the muzzle of the teacher of religion stood staring out dully at what lay before him so quiet so commonplace nothing changed from the day barely a month ago when he had stood beside the old gun with vincent dering and lance carlyon contemptuous of the ignorance of others satisfied with himself and nowwhat had come to him the madness which his wild gallop from the gaol had calmed somewhat returned in a fierce rush and with it that one desire for revenge for something by which to show the contempt which was not now merely for the ignorant but for those others selfrighteous tyrannical who had dared to touch himdared to make him what he wasa prey both to ignorance and wisdom savagery and culturea laughingstock even to himself and who had begun the fooling who had taught him as a boy pidar narayan who else who else had begun the game giving some things withholding others and who else was within reach who else could be followed up and forced to fair fight forced to admit that the pupil was ahead now of the master he laughed a laugh of absolute exultation and a wave of purely childish satisfaction swept through the mind in which there were still so many depths of childish ignorance and misconception unavoidable depths in the culture of a bare score of years leaving his horse tethered to the old gun he ran hastily across to the palace so finding the door open the whole place quiet went on down the arched passage it was still dark there but a glimmer of light showed the entrance to the chapel and to the armoury beside it which was his goal he had no other thought except for that armoury until with the tall tapers burning at the head and feet he saw the dead body of the woman who had deceived him lying on the altar steps then the pitifullest clashing of satisfaction and despair of desire and disgust came to him that ever rent a man in twain for a moment he fought for bare reason between them then with a savage cry he flung himself beside the dead girl caught her to him covered her with frantic cruel kisses and almost flinging her from him again ran on into the armoury the red of her dress her bosom in his eyesthe red of blood the armoury where he had had his first lesson in the foils there they were harmless in their buttons crossed on the wall and above them something more murderous the dangerous delicate rapiers to which those others were but the prelude no one was gone one father ninian had used against the jogi one he must have with him so much the better he tore down its fellow and passing the dead girl without a look dashed out into the courtyard again his last trace of sanity gone the next instant his horses feet were echoing madly along the pilgrims road his enemy must have a quarter of an hours lead but that was nothing he could overtake him anyhow at the first station in the pilgrimagea temple under a vast banyan tree at the foot of the first rise where the pious must pause to make offerings the road was almost empty at first for the news that the miracle had only been deferred had spread instantly through the unrestful town so to a space beyond it making those who heard the tale turn back to see for themselves but after a few minutes wild gallop he came up with those who had been beyond recall who had gone on content with that strange lead of a strange god of a saint a sinner yet after a time forgetful of that leadership utterly for they needed it no more the danger of novelty had passed with their first step along the beaten track which their fathers had followed father ninian wise with the wisdom of long years of secret sympathy had known this had counted on it in his forlorn hope of leading them into familiar bondage he had told himself that he need only go as far as that first station that then during the pause for offerings he might return as it were to realities to something more consistent with the nineteenth century but to him also as he led the way chanting his offices for the day had come a strange peace a strange desire to go on to the end of the pilgrimage a strange desire to leave those realities behind him in a world from which he was taking nothing not even his love surely it was time surely he was old enough to claim rest no not rest it was something more than that surely now that he had left every atom of earth behind him lying with a dead woman on the altar steps he also was free to find the cradle of the gods my soul fleeth unto the lord before the morning watch i say before the morning watch he chanted he had gone on blindly from psalm to psalm intent on the desire to lead those voices behind have a care babajee thou and thy god said a halftender halfjesting one as he stumbled among the stones and a dark hand stretched itself out to steady the old priest and a dark face turned to nod approval at other saffron robes since here was a true pilgrim a true madman forgetful of this world to judge by the face lifted towards those distant hills yet the desire in him to reach them seemed to the wise old heart something that must be set aside he must return yes he must return to do what what could an old man do who had left life a useless life behind him he crushed down that thought also and stumbled on man is like a thing of nought his time passeth away like a shadow his voice spent itself tremulously on that one certainty and those behind him joined their testimony to his all unwittingly as they called on hara or hari on the creator the destroyer as one and indivisible and in the rear again roshan in his search for death for annihilation bore witness also as he came cursing those who stood in his way his horse slithering among the stones in its effort to obey whip and spur and sending a dry clangour of hoofbeats through the little stony valley to startle the sleepy snakes coiled on the distant rocks and drive them back to their crannies with a hiss so every instant the distance lessened between the old man and the young one both weary of life it was broad daylight now though the sun was still low on the horizon the mystery of dawn had left the world the very pilgrims between their recurring cries were chattering laughing over the everyday details of life which would make today as trivial as yesterday tomorrow as trivial as today there had been a breathing in the night they told each other some shadow had fallen some god or devil had had power but the shackles of custom of familiarity were back again the despotism of detail only in those two strangely different minds in the van in the rear the mystery still clouded the reality and the distance between them lessened as roshan drove his way through the saffron robes recklessly yet fast as he went when he reached the end of the dry watercourse up which the last part of the rough track had wound and stood in the hollow backed by a further rise of the hill where the quaint dumpy black temple hid itself under the huge blotch of the banyan treethe only green thing visible far or nearthe figure he sought was not to be seen among the crowd akbar khan indeed he saw utilizing one of the tall tapers as a pipelight before casting himself on the ground to suck contentedly at the screwed banyan leaf full of tobacco which he had gathered by claiming a pinch in return for the loan of that same light to others but with a curious shame roshan avoided him and passed on in his search among the jostling crowd the continuous babel of trivial talk for this was restingtime when men and women could be men and women and forget that they were on a pilgrimage when they could even dream themselves back in the village under the familiar shelter of some village tree asking no more than the familiar round of life but above the babel came every now and again the insistent clang of a bell telling that some new petitioner was seeking a favour of the gods and making a golden oriole which sat in the green leafage flit to another bower with a sudden fluting note full joyful mellow what dost seek musulman cavilled a saint drawing back from roshans shadow as he gabbled invocations all he knew on a rosary ere solacing himself with the pipe which his disciple had prepared if tis the madman and his godhe hath gone yonder he pointed to a side track which was a short cut to the road above roshan flung himself from his horse without a word and followed the distance lessened at every step now for the old priests breath failed him at the steepness of the rise still it would not delay him long he told himself to take that one look at the soft white cloud which generally hid the goal of pilgrimage before he turned back over the hill as best he could to find what task remained for him in the world he might have that one look surely so reaching the summit of this first bulwark of the unattainable he sat down breathlessly beside an upright black stone which showed strangely distinct amid the redness of the surrounding rock a plain black stone not three feet high chipped rudely to a blunt point father ninian did not need the scattering of dead marigolds and dry basil leaves about its base to tell him that it was a fragment of an older faith than that of the temple below a faith sterner purer founded on a clearer perception of what humanity needed in that search for the lost paradise on a closer memory of the cause which lost it he laid one hand on the stone almost caressingly as holding the pyx in the other he sat down facing the distant peaks but there was no cloud upon them the day had dawned clear and still and as he sat looking wistfully over the valleys on valleys the hills on hills which lay bathed in light between him and the cradle of the gods a sunbeamstill slanting from the curved edge of the eastern plainscaught the jewelled star of what he held and stayed there it was peaceful beyond words the hurry the strain not only of that long eventful night but of the whole long eventful life seemed over all things seemed behind him the passion the pride the courage the manhoodall things that had made ninian bruce what ninian bruce had beenwhere were they only wisdom only a tender knowledge seemed to remain the clank of steel upon stone roused him the clank of roshans spurs upon the rocks and father ninian turned to see him a yard or two on the path below outlined clearly against the distant view of eshwara against the world in which ninian bruce had lived and lovedthe ninian bruce whom he had left behind behind no it was ninian bruce and none other who was on his feet in a second a flush on his facethe face that was like the nether millstone in its stern passion and pride and power for in a second the old mans soul was back in a world where a dead woman belonging to him lay waiting for revenge his hand was on his hidden rapier as he flung his first word of defiance at the man who had killed her murderer your pupil at that even gasped roshan you began ityour pupil whom you taughtcurse you the words failed himhe paused inarticulatebut the keen eyes and ears opposite him took in his meaning with the swift comprehension which had been pidar narayans always a sort of contemptuous pity fought with the passion of ninian bruces face my pupil certainly he assented have you come to ask me for a final lesson roshan glared at him you understandyou always didthat is the worst yes i have comehere he laughed wildlyfor what you taught mefair play and no favourand i mean to have it in his fierce excitement he pressed closer flourishing his rapier pardon me came a cold courteous voice i did not teach you that method of assassination surely i thought you desired fair play if so you might allow me to meet you on equal terms roshan drew back with a flush from the figure which had stood its ground which looked at him with bitter disdain he scarcely seemed to recognize it no wonder for this was ninian bruce himself ninian bruce as he might have spoken to an overhasty antagonist in the days when he was the most reckless swordsman in rome when the world held him body and soul the years his very priesthood had slipped from him i beg your pardon sir muttered roshan standing aside there was a savage satisfaction in his heart this man was not old the odds were equal there was enough fire and passion here to please any opponent so after a pause to lay aside the pyxit found a strange restingplace on the blunt summit of that upright black stonea slim still elegant figure divested of its priestly robings took its stand its back to the hills its face to the world still upright still active with its black soutane caught up and tucked into the sash to give free play to its limbs now sir came the courteous voice i am ready something in the proud grace of bearing the reckless contempt made roshan follow suit the sun will be in your eyes he said let us fight lengthwise to the ridge we willby and by came that icy voice as the speaker without moving stood on guard we can omit the salute if you are ready i am for an instant roshan hesitated realizing what the life that he meant to take had been what the man himself whom he meant to kill had been and was the man whose figure stood out like a black shadow against the distant blue of the hills and as he realized the fine fibre of his enemy a sense of powerlessness to touch to harm him kept roshan motionless shall i count five and give you a start the question came with a shrug of the shoulders the taunt told roshan pulled himself together and stood on guard also but the sense of powerlessness was intolerable he lowered his rapier for a word morea word to raise his own selfesteem i warn you he said haughtily that the sun is in your eyes that i have learnt more than you ever taught methat this is to the death it could scarcely be anything else could it came the instant reply in a voice that vibrated harshly like a harpstring struck to its fullest with a dead woman between us engage you devil or i will kill you as you stand roshan gave a short sharp cry like a wild beast the next instant the curious hiss of two meeting blades sliding along each other was the only sound it is a strange sound which to the listeners the onlookers seems to say hush to the whole world hushhushshsh then short and sharp as that cry of roshans came another sound the beaten baffled clash when steel meets steel instead of flesh roshan with an inward curse gripped his rapier closer he had almost been disarmeddisarmed in that first encounter strange that he should have forgotten his foeforgotten the deadly insistence of the masters blade slack as a snake in curves firm as a vice in grip then that almost invisible turn of the wrist which had so nearly done for him he had forgottenthese in years of meaner adversaries he remembered them now and would not forget again and he had such things ay and more in reserve for himself so had his master in reserve for both of them if needful and the knowledge that it would be needful came to ninian bruce at the first touch of his adversarys sword for there was that in it which told the old hand that the young one was a masters also my pupil has improved he said quietly as abandoning the attack he parried roshans furious onslaught with scarcely a motion of the hand held level to his heart that he could do but the other must surely come in the end since he was old and roshan young if in the end therefore why not now the sooner the better a minute after the sun was no longer in pidar narayans eyes as he had said they were fighting lengthwise to the ridge and he drew back choosing his ground until under his feet he felt the dead marigolds the withered basil leaves that lay about the upright stonethat strange pedestal on which the starshaped pyx stood as on an altar glittering in the sunrays he seemed to see it to feel it standing there between the world below and those faint far peaks and the eyes which had seen so much felt they need see no more sta alerta signor he cried jibingly flinging himself savagely forward and may the lord have mercy on your soul he added in a lower tone as in an attack which held in it all the wildness the fire the passion of his youth he drove roshan back a stepone step down the faint slope on which he had counted a fierce lunge or two a swift parry and thenthen an inch beyond safetygiven purposelyyielded room for the riposte he sought from that other rapier it came with a quick cry of triumph as roshan felt that thin cold steel slide silently on through a dull faint resistance a cry that ended in a gasp as the hand which held the rapier dropped for a second then flung itself upwards for pidar narayan had given the reprise and laddio del marito had done its work so for an instantheld upright by the lingering force of the old mans handthe two stood within a swords length their faces glaring at each otherstern implacable the one in death the other still in life then the strength the life ebbed the balance between it and death wavered and ninian bruce overborne by his enemys dead weight sank to his knee then backwards but his hand still gripped the rapier so roshan khans body as it fell forward slithered down the sharp blade sending a little jet of crimson blood backwards till it stopped with a dull thud upon the hilt so he lay face downwards beside the old man whose face looked skyward whose head rested among the withered marigolds and the sweet dead leaves of the basil which generations and generations of pilgrims had offered to an unknown wisdom on their way to the cradle of the gods chapter xxviii the truth and to look at it now came the commissioners rich round brogue you would think butter wouldnt melt in its mouth he waved the cigar he was smoking towards eshwara it looked sleepier more sunsaturate than ever as it lay reflected in the still lagoon between it and the tent in which he was sitting a doublepoled commissioners tent which two days before had swooped down like an avenging angel with broad white wings to take possession of the just and the unjust in the name of victoria kaiserihind it was pitched on the site of the viceroys camp for the convenience of being close to the gaol where the late disturbers of the public peace had taken up their residence in fact the mast from which the royal standard had floated still reared itself bare undraped from its roundel of roses but the flowers were withered dead even the palms their work of welcome over were wilting fast but they still gave a doubtful shade to some groups of manacled men who guarded by yellowlegged constables were placidly awaiting the commissioners leisure and pleasure both being at the time occupied with lunch and dr dillon so the wide white wings of the tent being set open and supported with bamboos to let in the breeze the representative of law and order could be seenhis feet on the table among his law booksdrinking an iced whiskeyandsoda dr dillonhe looked careworn chiefly because in his care for others he had as yet been able to take no restnodded yes and it doesnt as a rule a more peaceable spot never was you cant account for these sudden idiotic outbreaks one reason is as good as another and so old mother campbell with her assertion that it all came because miss shepherd would talk about jean ziskas drum the commissioner smiled yes the good lady has an endless circle of unfounded beliefs all dependent on each other for support its the most comfortable way of getting through life an miracles are like dramsye cant stop them once you begin besides on me soul it was queereven carlyon said and if it were true interrupted the doctor we shouldnt be any forrader we shouldnt understand and thats our position now you cant in fact its better you shouldnt in india at any rate just accept them ignore them smash them hush them uphere his face cloudedand in this case there is a good deal that had better be kept darkyoull do your best i hope the keen whimsical face hardened i shall follow the usual official routine sir he said cynically for look you there never was a row like this in india but there is something in it about a woman which weve got to hush up an thats gods truth yes we pay a heavy toll he broke off took up a pen as if to write threw it down impatiently and stared out into the hot yellow sunshine dr dillon sat twiddling his mushroom hat round and round in his nervous fingers and staring out into it also a sense of being face to face with an unpleasant truth was on them both suddenly he laughed harshly we ought to have got accustomed to the fact by this time anyhow he said for it began early enough in the history of man well im off you wont want me will you this afternoon now those men have turned queens evidence dont think so lets see the commissioner drew a list towards him and ran his eye over it ive condemned three warders and seven prisoners to death for poor derings murder so i daresay penal servitude will see through the rest then theres jogi gorakhnath and his gosain they ought to be hung but we havent caught them and we never shall the wild ass that snuffeth up the east wind isnt in it with a hindoo ascetic in eluding captors so the lot out there are really small fry for the other ringleaders are either dead or departedeven that amphibious brute gugu dr dillon looked up cheerfully by george id have given something to see that waterfight between him and amma by the way what are you going to do for that queer fish but for him we would never have seen lance carlyons face again the commissioners expression was curious its a bit hard to do anything for a man who wants nothing but earth air and water and has got all three besides he drew a paper out of a file looked at it then looked at the doctorbesides it wasnt altogether amma he paused smiled an infinitely kind smile then went on i was a brute entirely to talk about a heavy toll just now we get its worth back me dear fellow over and over again see here is ammas affidavit i took it this morning and upon me soul dillon i should be obliged if you would tell me whether to hush it up or inform the party concerned so saying his brogue took possession of the sunbright sundry air i amma of the river folk solemnly affirm that knowing the deepukrag to be in the power of the huzoors i several times warned gugu not to follow other masters but he had learned books and become ignorant he could not even feel when a current changed its course and then he thought he must die because of the ghost and that made him wild so when i refused and set off as ordained for the raft he took the brahmins money and stopped the miracle of a surety the awarder of justice is right this slave knew what was to come he did not tell of it because where the deepukrag is there is victory so there was no fear yet when the misssahiba bade me help her i obeyed because she has power over devils and my son huzoor is still in the first week of life therefore for that reason i guided the raft but when i saw that the lightbringers had smitten the darkness of evildoers and that the raft would be needed no more i went on with it to the place appointed by the woodwallahsahib whence it could float of itself so i returned to my home and ate my bread and the day was quiet as the huzoor knows only the folk reviled because i had no fish to sell but at night at the waning of the sunset stars about the third jackal cry came the misssahiba to my hut dr dillon ceased twiddling his hat and looked up in sudden interest to my hut reiterated the reading voice i deemed it because of devils first but it was not it was because of carlonesahib who could not be foundonly his clothes and pistol on my craft stranded on a sandbank by the midchannel he has not been killed said the misssahiba he would not have fought with his clothes off nor did he go to fight he would not have left the pistol if he had he has gone swimming to get quicker and find help so he is drowned he is in the river still and i cannot think of it amma you know every inch of the river find him find him then i said yea misssahiba i will find him when his body rises no man can find a dead one in the river till then but as i spoke the son at his mothers breast left sucking and cried aloud the misssahiba said it was but the gripes but wemy house and iknew more than that we knew it was the devils winning a way because the miss was not content so i said i will find him while his beauty is still on him for you to see againsince that is in the heart of all women o awarder of justice thus at the dawnthe dawn after the dawn of darknessi amma set out with my nets seeing that fish anyhow could be found and the market would be dear because none had come to the bazaar during the commotion so remembering where my craft had stranded i went first to midchannel thus working up came to where it had stranded once before then seeing footmarks i followed them till in an island eating his bread i found the evilbegotten gugu he had a knife in his bead belt at the sight whereof i gave glory to gods and devils alike for i knew the handle of it it was carlonesahibs shikar knife and i had been his shikari many a time so i said where gottest thou carlonesahibs knife gugu thinking to startle him and it did he said no word but came at me with it so we fought his right hand and mine on the knife and our left arms round each others throat choking us and our legs wrestling till the water grew too deep then we swam with them but he said nothing nor did i there was no need we understood as dogs do that it was foe and foe so it came to the deep stream his right hand and mine with the knife between them and our teeth fixed in each others shoulderstill i bethought me of his ear then he yelled and let go but i was after him as he dived it was a long race wherefore not since we are the best swimmers in the river but i felt the cleave of the water from his foot at last and spent myself in one stroke so i laid hold of his leg and ran my hand up till i found his back then i used carlonesahibs knife on him and he sank and i sank too with the blow and when i came up leaving him there i found how long the race had been for my right hand struck the city wall then it came to me what the misssahiba had said of carlonesahib wishing to go quick and i bethought me of the secret passages and the knife and gugus fear and i said to myself someone must have restored the miracle not gugu else why was he hiding what if it be carlonesahib but most of all i thought of my little son and the devils longing for him and for a woman longing for the sight of a mans beauty and i knew i must go and see if it lay there so i dived and found him as the awarder of justice knows sitting high up with the water about his feet waiting for death and brought him back as i promised and gugu is dead for his body was drifting by the tunnel with carlonesahibs knife in the back as we came out so the miss is pleased and the devils do not come near my son the brogue ceased and there was a pause well what do ye say dillon asked the commissioner fretfully george dillon rose and put on his hat deliberately nothing except that i must really be off ive to see smith first and carlyonthat sprained ankle of his which he got trying to climb up beyond the rise of the water will be the deuce and all if he uses it too soon and then if i can i want to get round and say goodby toto the misssahiba shes off to herrnhut again this evening in fact campbell didnt half like her waiting for the funeral he is in such a blessed hurry to get to his new field as he calls it thinks of nothing else they are to be married on monday i believe the commissioner laid aside ammas affidavit with a soft damn and dr dillon paused on his way out at the sound quite soi entirely agree with you he said sympathetically but unfortunately there is only one person who has a right to tell that story sirand she wont why not interrupted the commissioner militantlywhy the blazes shouldnt a woman tell the truth because women dont know it broke in the doctor or men either for that matter because we men and women have got ourselves on such false lines into such an absolutely false position towards each other that the only course consistent with propriety and les convenances is toto hush the thing up so hushabye baby sir to your hearts content so long as the mother can tell her blessed infant that she is a lady what does the real fact matter he spoke with a concentrated bitterness an almost fierce resentment and the commissioner nodded finished his whiskeyandsoda at a gulp and returned to work tossing his papers about recklessly its a quare world certainly he murmured with a lack of originality which sat ill on him then catching sight of something in a file his humorous kindly self returned listen to this now for quareness he laughed beginning to read the petition of mussumat mumtaza mahalthats roshan khans grandmother you knowsister etc etc humbly sheweth that she has endured grievous wrong and hurt by loss of her grandson in the late deplorable mutiny of which she was utterly incognizant being helpless veiled old woman perpetually confined in house therefore prayeth that whereas one mussumat ashrafunnissa her neighbour is in receipt of pension rupees twentyfive per mensem for similar bereavement of male protector and head of family lost in mutiny therefore her pension of rupees twenty per mensem only for exile of husband to calcutta be commuted to similar sum of twentyfive seeing that your poor petitioner is in floods of tears and wholly heartbroken through this most nonregulation premature death of promising young scion of her noble house on whom as on blessed victoria queen her hopes were fixed said petitioner being able to prove alibi absolute incomplicity and continuous remaining at home during late devilish disturbances poor old soul laughed the doctor give it to her if you can sir and as for remaining at home everybody except the actual conspirators did that even dyaram the disaffectedthough he has preached armed resistance to tyranny in his paper for years he barricaded himself in with his printingpress fact jammed his fingers in so doing and came to me in a blind funk for a professional certificate that the wound could not have been caused by any lethal weapon as if anyone could ever have suspected him of taking part in raising a row or even in settling one his sort are simply negligible quantities but ramanund seems to have attempted a lead put in the commissioner judicially exactly attempted and failed his sort are negligible quantities also sir im sorry to say and will remain so until they learn amongst other knowledge to believe in something besides themselves here the hard eyes softened the hard voice paused that is another thing i should like to have seendear old pidar narayan the hard voice found even softness too loud and in the silence which fell between the two men only the commissioners pen could be heard youll look in at the palace perhaps and see all is right came the brogue after a bit and give my love to old smith im not sure but that id rather have seen him behind the door than anything else for it must have been the hardest job considering the circumstances yes put in the doctor so with the pith hat turning him into an animated mushroom he passed out into the blaze of dry yellow sunshine on that dry yellow sand the sky above was molten with light and heat the gaol positively shimmered in the glare not a sound not a sight told of that midsummer nights dream of wild useless revolt save when one of the shackled prisoners awaiting trial sought a better bit of shade under the wilted palms which not a week before had welcomed the hosts of the lordsahib on their way to the hills the whole thing seemed incredible yet as he crossed the road to enter the smiths compound the footsteps of those other hosts who had passed on to the hills also remained to dimple the dry yellow sand the smiths bungalow lay calm peaceful the drawingroom as he entered it struck him with the old familiar sense of refinement indexing the refinement of its mistress only one change caught his observant eyes vincent derings photograph was no longer on the mantlepiece whence it had always looked out with a certain challenge in its very prominence where had it gone what matter there was no need for such defiance now thought george dillon with that curious halfcynical halfresentful smile he kept for one subject only she might keep the photograph where she chose now and none would blame her so thinking he set aside the curtain which hung at his patients door and as he did so resentment cynicism vanished in quick sympathy ah fever again i seethats a bore he said going over swiftly to the bed where eugene smiths long length lay visibly shivering for somethingthe exposure the excitement the strain perhaps of that awful inaction behind the door against which vincent dering was making that heroic standhad knocked the big man over a prey to an old enemymalarial fever when did it come on muriel smith who sat on the bed her hand in one of her husbands shaking trembling ones looked up she was very pale but very calm half an hour ago it is a pity we hoped it was broken didnt we but he will fret himself so doctor her eyes on dr dillons were telling their tale so that it scarcely needed the rambling quivering voice to show that the fresh onset of fever had once more clouded the sick mans brain how can a fellow help fretting murmured eugene his teeth chattering when he waits like a coward behind a door where his best friend the woman beside him winced but interrupted him bravely but i tell him doctorand its true isnt itthat it was hardest for himand thatthat vincent would rather have had it sobecause he had to leave no one and eugene had gladysand me her voice seemed to bring comfort and the glistening feverish eyes closed go on with the mixture said the doctor vexedly conscious of a lump in his throat this will wear itself out in a day or two andyou cant do more than youre doing i suppose not she replied listlessly but the tragedy of her face remained in his memory as he drove over the creaking groaning bridge to eshwara the bazaar was full as ever with drifting humanity busy in the details of everyday life there was no hint anywhere of the past storm not even in the palace it lay as ever silent its blank walls seeming to hold the sunlight back from some secret withinfrom some veiled hidden beauty the door was closed but old akbar khan came capering at his call his back roached in bowing like a caterpillars the tomb is finished gereebpunwaz he mumbled in blubbering importance ala the sad day but this slave knowing all customary things hath remained insistent on the workmen therefore all is befitting the noble people as the huzoor will see so down the shadowy passage he led the way crablike to the chapel for hither long years before father ninian had brought the body of pietro bonaventura and here just in front of the altar steps he and pietros granddaughterthe last of the old priests chargeshad been buried the day before the masons had been busy building up the vault again but as akbar khan had said the work was finished the chapel restored to its original state swept and garnished even the candles were lit on the altar and four of the tallest tapers had been placed one at each corner of the stone slab on which two more names would have to be cut while from these tapers long strings of jasmine flowers such as native women wear had been hung in drooping chains to form an enclosure on the slab itself great bossed yellow marigolds were laid to simulate a cross dr dillon turned to the cringing figure beside him sharply but there was something almost pathetic in its simper of conscious merit its certainty of satisfaction did you do that he asked gereebpunwaz there was a world of pride and of servitude in the voice and in the folded prayerful hands which shot out under the bowings this slave made it the huzoor will notice it is fitting even the crass he pointed his prayerful hands to the marigoldsis not forgotten has not this dustlike one spent his life in preparing amusements and spectacles for the noble people he knows that tombs require flowers as women do through the arches behind the old pantaloon dr dillon could catch a glimpse of the garden ablaze with colour could smell the perfume of the now fading orangeblossoms could see the watermaze with its marble ledges among the lotus just wide enough for the flying feet of a laughing girl the words the contrast held him as the old man went on with an orthodox whine of petition in his voice so since the sirkar will doubtless appoint a guardian of tombs seeing there is none to inherit the palace if the protector of the poor would intercede for this slave with the commissionerif the huzoor would say that the dustlike one has provided the pleasures of palaces all his life long for the noble people yea from the cradle to the grave if he will say that he flourished his hands towards the slabboth in the making of garlands and the making of crasses there is none equal for tombs require flowers as women do the phrase asserted itself again and dr dillon looked at the wicked old face so comic so pathetic with the hopeless recognition of the humour of tragedy which comes to all save the invincibly dull you would do as well as anyone he said gravely ill mention your name gereebpunwaz the title prolonged itself abnormally and akbar khan a mask of toothless smiles darted in instant assumption of his anticipated office to remove a fallen jasmine flower from dr dillons path as if it had been a deadly reptile indeed he paused in the midst of his parting salaams to ask if it was in order that the populace be admitted to the sanctuary since the missenmiss his accent of disdain tempered by reverence was delicious had announced her desire to enter it that afternoon for farewell had indeed asked him to be there at four to open the door dr dillon turned so sharply that the old courtier began instantly on asseverations that without orders have everything ready of course interrupted the doctor impatiently so strode off across the courtyard his head down his hands in his pockets with a jerk as of irritation in his walk he found lance carlyon in the balcony over the river very apologetic at being caught there against orders but it was so dreary keeping to ones room he said especially when there were a lot of dismal things to think about and he really had been most carefulhad made two of his pioneers almost carry him doesnt seem to have done much harm admitted the doctor gruffly as he sat feeling the ankle and looking at lance with the oddest air of impatience irritation and kindliness yet there was nothing strange in lances wholesome young face save that it showed a little older a little graver it must be beastly dull too went on the doctor loudly suddenly youyou might get them to help you over to the palace garden this afternoon about four you know when it gets cool that would be a change lance positively gasped rather why you told me yesterday i wasnt to move a muscle for ten days dr dillon positively blushed under the brown he got up vexedly walked to the parapet looked down the river towards the mission house and came back again no more you are he said fiercely not what you call moving but gentle exercise andand congenial societyand all that you know the treatment besides the huttonwhartonhood school dont believe in rest andandlook hereill put you on the stiffest starch bandage ever madeandoh confound it man one must risk something sometimes you know here orderly go over to the sahibs washerman and tell him to make me doubleextrawhiteshirtfrontstarch and if that doesnt counteract thethe indiscretionwhywhyi wash my hands of the whole business he was at work undoing the bandages already and the last part of his remarks came argumentatively to himself if you really think it might injure me permanently began lance soberly in some surprise dr dillon paused and looked up with a vast resentment if you mean your foot i dont think it will and thats all im responsible forthank god but as half an hour after this he came out from saying goodby to erda shepherd he paused as he passed the pool of immortality and looked down into it as if he felt some need of salvation if i be not damned for this he quoted softly shook his head and went back to his prisoners so it came to pass that when erda shepherdafter laying the wreath she had brought as a sort of crown to akbar khans crasswent into the garden for a last look at the familiar places she found lance carlyon comfortably settled in one of the balconies overhanging the river this is luck he cried forgetting the starched bandage until reminded of it by a sudden twinge of pain i thought i was never to see you again and it seemed a bit roughonon us both considering what a lot we did together you know ive been writing you a letter to say how disappointed i was at not being able to get over and see you all this morning that was very kind of you she said feebly conscious that the surprise had made her feel a little limp though of course she regretted nothing nothing at all ive been wanting to know such a lot he went on of course i heard about the others but not about youyou neednt go away immediately need you he asked as he watched her faceifif you could stop a bit it would be so jolly the frank wistfulness of his tone was too much for her yes i can stop she said quietly what is it you want to know lots of things but about yourself first of all herself that would be the hardest task she felt and the memory of that senseless flight from her own reflection in the mirror came back to bring a quick flush to her cheek of course if youd rather not began observant lance i was only thinking there was very little to tell she put in quickly she was not even going to allow that in keeping this incident to herself she was giving it any importance she had told herself during the last few days that it had been unfortunate that was all otherwise it was trivial since it did not could not alter her decision on the contrary it strengthened it just as a temptation resisted always strengthened that resistance so in the balcony where lovers had sat and talked of love those two sat talking of that midsummer nights dream of everything but love of vincent derings song of the raft of lances experience as he clung to the highest crevice and felt the water stop steady between his knee and his ankle of his incredulity when amma appeared and his immediate lapse into unconsciousness chiefly he supposed because there was no need for further endurance of how he had no notion of anything till he found himself lying on a string bed in the sun right away on the other side of the town whither amma had brought him by heaven knows what secret passage so as the shadows grew long they seemed to invade lances face and bring a doubt to it i havent seen amma since he said so i havent found out yet why on earth he came to look for me erda rose and held out her hand we were all looking for you mr carlyon she said quietly and we were all very glad to find you andand i am very sorry toto lose you he rose too stiffly and taking her hand held it while he looked into her face steadily goodby miss shepherdimim sorry it has to be thatbut you know best and thank you for telling meso much he paused and his hand tightened on hers a little thanks all round for that it has been the truth between us hasnt it always and sothough it has been a bit roughgoodby there was a pause a curious pause goodby she echoed dully her face grown very pale his hand left hers gently she turned and faced the garden where the shadows were invading the blaze of colour and the coming cool was sending the scent of the orangeblossoms into the air the watermaze with its marble ledges where there was but room for the feet of a laughing girl lay still and glistening before her the palace with its fanciful nooks its illogical recesses its suggestion of elusive pleasures beyond the pale of solid reality rose up into the sky and something in the scene came home to her with the sense that all this in its way was real also that this was part of the truth the truth which she had not told it has been the truth between us hasnt it always she turned suddenly to where lance stood turned to find him leaning over the balcony looking down into the water with a listlessness he had held in check till then and a great wave of remorse swept through her it has not been the truth between us she cried impulsively recklesslynot quitebut i will tell it nowif you like he looked up startled if you think ii ought to know she gave a queer halfimpatient laugh ought how do i know yes i suppose soas its trueabsolutely true i cant help that can i there was a forlornness in the confession almost a despair then tell me please said lance deliberately making room for her to lean over the balustrade beside him his heart was beating fast at something in her face and yet his uppermost thought was for her for that forlornness that despair i can forget it afterwardsif you want me to he added consolingly she came to the place beside him and looked down hiding her face from all but the sliding river and he seeing her desire looked into it also it was about my starting on the raft she began with a little sob i didnt tell you the truth about that ii didnt come to give the warning at firstii was coming to you yes he said quietly but his hand found hers and held it you were coming to me dearwhy that touch seemed at once to help her and to make her desperate becauseoh lance it was so foolish i saw myself in the glassall in white with the orange in my handand i thought of youof what you saidofof the worlds desire andand i felt i couldntsoso i was coming to youfirstwhen ammadont you see there was a long pause his hand firm strong did not tighten it simply held hers as they both looked down on the sliding river thanks he said after a time and then there was another pause until he added it will be a bit rough im afraid on the reverend david but i dont see how we can help thatdo you and this time his clasp tightened erda said nothing she felt there was nothing more to say now that the truth had been told between them so while the sinking sun flared red on the cradle of the gods another man and woman consoled themselves for the lost paradise footnotes footnote bonaventura footnote pension footnote
