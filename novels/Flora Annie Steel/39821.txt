plough song sowing song harvest song cottonpicking song from the five rivers gunesh chund i outside the village a man stood alone in the moonless night yet it was not dark for in the unending depths of violet blue the stars hung manyhued and manysizedeach in their order so clear so bright that the simile as one star differeth from another in glory stood out in all its vivid truth undimmed by the mists of a western atmosphere the man however neither looked nor thought of the stars he had seen them shine thus after the winter rains ever since he had been able to see and his eyes were full of the shadowy stretch of level fields which seemed to rise towards the pale horizon there was a fresh damp smell in the air and close to his feet some lighter shadows surrounded by darker ones showed that the recent rains had been heavy enough to leave fresh pools of water in the hollows whence the village had been dughollows like the skeleton at the feast serving to remind the inhabitants that their origin was dust their end the grave toil and moil flung their refuse into these as if in derision the pitiless eastern rain washed the mud from wall and roof back to its birthplace but year after year the antlike builders piled more mud over the ruins of the old until the village girt by its grave grew dignified by age and gaining renewal from its own mortality rose higher and higher above the surrounding plain such a treeless formless plain circled round by that fillet of paler sky where the stars shone dimly like distant fireflies not a landmark anywhere save behind the man his own village by day an anthill of low huts in the soft darkness piled like a fort lightless soundless he turned towards it his eyes seeking a central block standing higher than the rest it was his house the house where he and his forebears for many a generation had been born where he had stood by his fathers deathbed and taken the reins of office from the dying hands where he too hoped to die and pass the headship of the village to some stalwart son and it was childless as yet a curious thrill seemed to join heart and hand and brain in a trinity of skill and strength and love for yonder in that dim house a woman was bringing a child into the world with pains beyond the primal curse and he the father driven by a restlessness new to him had wandered out into the night to seek patience in action it could not be over yet his mother had said it would be long and the jackals had not yet given their second cry he turned again to the fields the land is good he murmured to himself the crop is good and the rain is good if only this be a son he drew a long breath that was half a sigh a stir in the thorn enclosures where the cattle were folded for the night caught his practised ear and he walked towards them listening a feeble bleat followed by a patter of feet made him push aside the rude hurdle barring the entrance among the crowding sheep and goats the first lamb of the season lay beside its mother and his eyes lit up as he forced his way through the circle of uncertain elders to reach it he was in luck to be there else the firstfruits would have been dead by morning he lifted the lamb gently thinking the while that he must divide the flock ere another night and so run no more risks as he made his way back to the village with swinging strides the mother trotted after him bleating and the village dogs snuffed at his heels silently they knew better than to bark at gunesh chund the headman tall and strong looking all the taller by reason of his white turban and the lank folds of white drapery falling from his high shouldersso tall that he had to stoop in order to enter the door leading to the outer court of his house within were lights and a cackle of womens voices but here in the wide expanse of beaten mud floor darkness and silence save for the cudchewing of the milch kine ranged in one corner and the rasping rub of a weighted halter through its ring as the headmans pony turned at its masters entrance gunesh stood still and called mother mother an old woman with an oil cresset held above her head came to the inner doorway and peered into the darkness through the flowers and branches garlanding the entrance then she set aside the swinging sickle hung to bar all passage to evil spirits and stepping out shook her head at the mute inquiry in her sons eyes not yet o gunesh but all goes well twill come with the dawn like many another and fear not o my child tis a son the stars and the omens are agreed a faint bleat made her set the cresset nearer what hast thou there o gunesh the firstling mother twas in the fold i have brought it hither for safety the old womans face shone with delight a ewe lamb tis another omen and there is luck in the house tonight for as the ewe lamb to the fold so is the male child to the hearth have no fear o gunesh have no fear she laid one wrinkled hand on her sons arm and with the lamp held high in the other gazed fondly on his face curiously like her ownthe same refined aquiline features and narrow forehead but the mans was less alert than the womans and softer especially now as he stood hesitating andandveru he asked somewhat sheepishly his mother shrugged her shoulders oh veru she is well enough she suffers but that is the womans part twould have been better for her years ago but she will forget all women do and the omens are good a querulous complaint from within followed by womens voices made her pause i must return folk are so ignorant nowadays i wonder aught comes right but thou needst not fear my son the old mother knows it all so the lamps are lit the flowers strewn the spices burned the chants raised duly the great ones must needs be pleased and look you guneshwa the sun comes back with the dawn yea mother he answered meekly and sure the firstling shows luck when she left him he threw some straw in one corner for the ewe and guided the tottering lamb towards it smiling to himself over the frail ridiculous attempts at escape made by the little creature the bleats subsided into contented silence and he groped a stumbling way up the narrow steps leading to the flat square roof of his house there he sat down his back against the parapet wall which gave seclusion to the womens court below whence a glimmer of light and a murmur of voices reached eyes and ears the rest was darkness and silence with the dawn he mutteredit will come with the dawn he took a nugget of opium from an inner pocket broke off a bit and having swallowed it set himself deliberately towards patience most men of his race would have found the situation simple and their minds if on the rack of expectation would have been free from doubt gunesh chunds heart however was softer than most menssofter than his mother for instance deemed a true mans should be it was occupied with one thought supposing it was a girl after all what should he do he could not feel orthodox disgust or anger at the idea yet he longed for a son if only because it would settle so many vexed questions and make life so much easier even now with his mother and veru peace was not always to be had but how would it be if the second wife with whom the former threatened him came to make a third in the quarrel sooner or later he would have to make a fourth of course that was always the end and he had all a kindly mans hatred of tears and fuss yet a son he must have and that quickly for as his mother said truly the cousins young wife was becoming unbearably pretentious over those big boys of hers what wonder were they not what all boys should be gunesh chund felt himself mean and spiritless as he recognized his own admiration for those whom his mother regarded as mere pretenders to the hereditary office of headman did not kishnu their blackbrowed sonsy mother openly declare that even if gunesh had a son hers might yet be preferred as being older should autumn chills and summer pestilence carry the present incumbent off before his time at least so the old mother said and one thing was certain devi ditta and pooram lal the village elders were no friends of his since that dispute about the common lands they might side with the other branch without doubt a son must be had to carry on work in this world and give life to the next and if this was a girl a bleat from the lamb below made him suddenly smile at the very idea of baby fingers playing with his beard and baby kisses on his face were girls kisses less sweet girls fingers less soft he shifted uneasily conscious that his thoughts were heresy in his mothers eyes doubtless she was right he would have to marry again since veru would plainly be accursed unable even after all the pilgrimages and vows to perform her first duty as he sat trying to harden his heart wild skirling chants rose every now and again from the womens court and at each outburst he shifted again uneasily for through the noise he seemed to hear the cry it was meant to deaden lest a complaint might anger the dread givers of pain and pleasure and veru had been good to him he sat on till the dreamcompeller made even his hazy thought more hazy and patience came with sleep when he awoke the dawn was past and as he stretched his long length skyward in the first enjoyment of past sleep the whole circle of earth and heaven round him was ablaze with the sun rising gloriously over the cloudless world he stood so for a moment the centre of his universe contented serene ere memory returned to him then he made his way down to the yard with fear at his heart all was still as the grave even in the womens court and it was a relief when he peered past the swinging sickle to see his mother wrapped in her quilt dozing by the open fireplace in one corner he went over to her and touched her on the arm mother he called she was alert in an instant and looking in his face answered his mute question fiercely it is a girla useless girl what need to wake thee for such bitter news the woman is accursed the quick assent rising to his lips was stilled by a little cry from within the quilt somethinghe knew not what it wasthrilled him and kept him silent isis it pretty mother he asked sheepishly after a while the old lady eyed him with suspicious scorn see for thyself ninny she replied shortly gunesh chund felt a distinct disappointment as he looked down at his firstborn he had forgotten what newborn babies were like since the days when as a boy he was admitted to such sights this one struck him as ugly or at least as less pleasing than a lamb or a calf god send it be not illlooking mother he blurted out in a tone of alarm she laughed still in the same short and scornful fashion lo there never was a plain woman among us the child is well enough and favours thee is it not enough that it should be a girl he did not hear the latter sentence accustomed in all things to accept his mothers fiat he was lost in trying to trace the likeness to himself and to aid his efforts drew a reflective forefinger over the featureless face feeling as he did so that strange thrill at his heart again suddenly as he neared the mouth the lips trembled and a little red tongue shot swiftly on his fingertip he burst into a great roar of delighted laughter ho ho look mother look didst never see a child suck before o gunesh chund lumberdar retorted the old woman crossly as she tucked the baby away again he felt abashed but the laughter had left him at peace with all mankind footnote headman and veru how is she this was too much the stern old lady rose to her full height and faced him her grey hair disordered by the nights watching escaped from the close folds of her veil and the quilt slipping from her showed her tall erect as a girl she threw out her right hand in declamation thou art no better than a woman thyself o gunesh to ask after veru the wife of disgrace thou shouldst not have thought of her were it not better she were dead ungrateful wicked for she must be wicked to frustrate my prayers and alms lo have i not fulfilled her every wish these nine months past and now tis how is veru forsooth and no thought of the mother who has slaved in vain but this is an end she is accursed and thou must bring a new wife to the hearth if thou wouldst not lose thine own soul and the soul of those who begat thee leave veru her girl and be kind to her if thou art a ninny there are other women in the world who can bear sons as gunesh crept out of the house feeling small despite his great height he told himself it was only what he had expected for all that his mother might have waited a day or two ere speaking of the new wife within verus hearing also god send she had been asleep after her long suffering he was so dispirited that he did not care to face the dharmsala with its congregation of elders ready to condole and its younger men inclined to sneer so he gave up his morning pipe and carried the firstling to take possession of the lambing fold as he walked along in the sunshine as he had walked in the shadow with it in his arms he felt its little tongue sucking at his hand and it seemed to hurt him body and soul ii the forty days of seclusion being over veru in her finest clothes sat crosslegged on a string bed ready to receive company the courtyard had been freshly swept the brass cookingvessels scoured and set in a row against the mud wall where the sun smote them into retaliating rays a few flat baskets of sweets covered with pennyhalfpenny manchester pockethandkerchiefs printed in the semblance of a pack of cards stood ready for the expected guests and gunesh chunds mother had been busy all the morning making a sort of furmenty in honour of the occasion for though she considered her labour thrown away on the birth of a girl she would not for the world have omitted a single ceremony and so have given colour to outside condolence veru herself was a delicatelooking pretty woman of about sixandtwenty with a broad forehead and a thinlipped sensitive mouthboth of which characteristics were more blemishes than beauties in the opinion of her neighbours her chief defect however in the eyes of the stalwart openhearted shrillvoiced village women lay in a certain refined reserve which they set down to conceit born of her pretensions to scholarshipthough how any woman could be so wrongminded as to usurp mans estate by learning to read and write passed their simple understanding but veru who had lived with a rich uncle during her girlhood had shared her cousins desultory visits to a mission school for a year or two and returned to her parents and marriage with a book in which she could read glibly and a reputation for writing she could also knit manyhued comforters in brioche stitch and darn strips of net in divers patternsappalling and almost incredible culture viewed with disfavour by all save gunesh who was simple enough to admire it probably because she was woman enough to admire him immensely the infant to whom the name of nihali had been given lay in her arms bedizened into the semblance of a performing monkey tight little silk trousers on the bandy legs a tinseldecorated muslin bodice and a flowing veil the size of a pockethandkerchief disposed over the round skullcap where a black fringe of wool simulated hair on this outfit veru had spent much time and trouble while her motherinlaw grumbled under her breath at the expense or openly said that in her day a decent woman would have thought it shame to make such a fuss over a girl after keeping her master waiting ten long years for a child there was bitter war between these two women outwardly yet however fiercely veru combated the elder womans views in her heart of hearts she could not overcome the inherited conviction that the meanest thing on gods earth was a sonless wife cultured retorts as to what she had heard and read in school of western opinions and of the sex of the queenempress did very well as lethal weapons but as inward balm were most unsatisfactory often and often after a passage of arms in which her more dexterous point had reduced her adversary to the usual appeal for patience she would creep away into one of the dark windowless rooms opening off the central courtyard on pretence that the light prevented her baby from sleeping there safe from observation she would weep salt tears over its unconscious face after all her prayers and alms why had not fate given her a son how much easier it would have been for everybody fate included for now high heaven would have to be wearied once more she had seen but little of her husband during her days of seclusion so the task of shutting her white teeth over a retort when he was by had not been a very difficult one but now the everyday life was beginning again and it would be harder to keep up the forbearancethough she was clever enough to see that it earned his gratitude he came in before going to his afternoons work in the fields to inspect the preparations the sight of the bedizened baby awoke his broad laugh ho ho ho grandmother see what a figure veru hath made of the child for sure it is like the puppets dya ram brought round at diwali fair that danced on a string im glad thy wits give thee sense to see the folly of dressing the child so grumbled the old woman in my day there were none of those fallals on farmers children we left them to the silly townsfolk in your day mother farmers wives did not know how to make them but i cut and sewed them all retorted veru with studious courtesy aye aye thats true remarked her husband relieved thou hast clever fingers despite they are so smallhath she not mother clever mayhap but in my time wives found better work than snipping and sewing they made stalwart sons for the hearth and left clothes to the tailor tis the other way on now i suppose thou wilt send to the tailor for a son soon i suppose it is time nay but the mother is right interrupted gunesh chund hastily seeing verus eyes begin to flash the little one is like a puppet as i said veru and tis happier with its arms and legs free i love to watch it struggling on its back like a young duck with the megrims tis comical but feed it well wife if twere a calf i would hold it overthin young things need fat do as the mother bids thee and tis sure to thrive had she not daughters of her own in her time his voice had a ring of appeal in it aye and some of them in mans guise muttered the old lady as she watched him bending over the baby nevertheless she spoke more softly as she bade him get to his fields the proper place for a man true mother true he assented happily as he went to the door with her and there is no place i like so well tis good to stand kneedeep in young corn when it grows bluegreen as this year thou shouldst see it in the dip by the sandy bottom and see the dappled sky like a partridge breast auguring more rain a good harvest mother a good harvest and new dresses she checked him nay gunesh there is the new wife to think of first good harvest days are good wedding days they were beyond earshot and yet the man gave a quick glance at the woman within hush mother hush he said almost in a whisper should a man take the name of another woman in his mouth with the cry of a monthold babe in his ear there is time yet time she echoed time indeed tis not time but will is wanting get thee gone to thy fieldsthank heaven thou art not a ninny therefor see yonder comes kishnu to the reception bringing all her three the jade tis only to crow over our girl gunesh tried to frown as he stood irresolute but his mild face refused the task may be mother he replied simply yet were the boys mine i would take them wherever i went crow or no crow they are so sweet his mother stamped her foot aye aye sweet for sure and will not the eldest make a fine lumberdar folk might almost deem him thy son i could wish none better foiled by his gentleness she watched his tall figure go down the alley for a minute and then began the attack in a more promising quarter here comes kishnu veru did i not say she would be the first the crowing cock loves early hours she hath her three with her and gunesh poor soul must needs stop and fondle them he loves those boys and who can blame him sure a mans heart cannot live in his breast always that is true but when a man gives it to a wife she can keep it from straying retorted veru she was never without words but they were empty diet and she could not help looking at kishnus boys with hungry eyes i scarce liked to bring shivu here today quoth the latter settling herself with a flounce among the voluminous skirts that hung halfway down her trousered legs you see he grows so bigalmost too much of a man for these womens doings she tittered twisted her huge nosering to one side disposed her youngest at her capacious bosom and thus prepared for conversation began afresh in a shrill strident voice so thats your girl veru sure you have dressed it for the wedding already early days but with a daughter one has to think betimesis it not so grandmother our women have no difficulty in finding husbands replied verus motherinlaw who whatever she might say herself was not inclined to stand impertinence from outsiders but perhaps in thy family tis a different story now kishnu was no beauty despite her fruitfulness neither was she ready of tongue so she sniffed comforting herself with the knowledge that words after all were but poor weapons against facts as an immediate revenge however she dragged the most disagreeable topic she could think of into the conversation guneshwa looked but ill at ease it struck me no doubt the new settlement in the village gives him trouble what new settlement asked veru sharply settlement time meant war time since in the compiling of new records lay ample opportunity for spite and her husband as headman had enemies kishnu tittered again this was better than she had expected so i have broken the seal of a secret mayhap gunesh said nothing lest it should worry thee during the time of recovery but tis so my man heard it awhile ago through his friends at court for certain yesterday sure veru tis a thousand pities this is a girl gunesh could have written a sons name as his heir in the new papers and that would have ended dispute forever the lumberdars women folk looked at each other for once in accord gunesh had hidden this thing from them and they were too proud to show how it had moved them they preferred letting the shaft rankle perhaps needlessly rather than inquire further of kishnu tis no pity at all retorted veru tossing her head there can be no dispute that i know of and i prefer girls this went too far for her motherinlaw at the risk of kishnus delectation she lost patience there tis heard one ever the like i prefer girls so thus thou mockest the great ones and by idle words turn my prayers to naught tis too vexatious girls are every whit as good as boys the great queen pshaw i am sick of the great queen why did she come to breed dissension and teach young women to mock at the old though for sure she herself knows better seeing she hath proved her worth by a good family of sons so may nihali in her time what that sickly thing thou wilt scarce rear her to the first year and mayhap tis better so dead girls thou knowest bring live boys verus face of fear sent a pang of remorse to a heart which beat true after its fashion and the old lady went on hastily nay daughterinlaw perchance i am wrong the child dwindles a bit no more i will make seven spices for it twill thrive if only thou wilt be reasonable and save thyself from tantrums and tears tis the calf has the pain mind you if the cow steals green wheat and with a girl the mind is at rest continued kishnu in malicious consolation now with me if the charcoal rubs from their foreheads im agog with fear of the evil eye and the rest of my day is wasted in prayers and offerings as thou sayst veru girls are better veru had no answer ready and even when the stream of visitors set in full of chattering congratulations and condolences she did not find her tongue the noise she said made her head ache and disturbed the baby she stripped the finery from its little limbs and wrapping it warmly in her veil held it tight to her breast refusing to uncover it in order to gratify the curious gunesh coming in from the darkening fields with their calm in his face found her crying in the inner room she wants to bring another wife home even now she will not have patience and wait awhile that was the burden of her complaint while gunesh sat comforting her uneasily surely veru i have waited he said after a time few would have been so patient but thou art a good wife and duteous even with the mother and thou oh thou art good guneshso good to me see thy patience hath brought nihali wait a year only a year longer husband and it will bring thee a son he looked at the mother and child with kindling eyes a year surely surely that is but fair so dry thine eyes wife for i am hungry that night when veru had retired to her bed with the baby and he sat smoking with his mother in the outer yard he asked her wistfully if she really thought the child was dwindling she turned on him fiercely perhaps from a feeling of pity and if it does canst not trust me to physic it or wouldst thou have a man doctor to thy womens rooms they tell me the travelling one sent on his rounds by the sirkar is in the next village but now shall i bid him come since thou seemst to hold by newfangled ways footnote government gunesh chund filled his pipe again with poppyleaves and tobacco and watched his mother carding cotton viciously what would she say if she knew of the promise he had made to veru the narcotic did not soothe him and when sleep failed he strolled out to where the village elders sat discussing the possible effects of this new settlement on the total of revenue due from the community the familiar company was a relief though it brought a doubt of his own wisdom in waiting a year still it was only a year after that if veru failed to bear him a son his duty to himself to his ancestors and to the sirkar demanded another wife iii whether gunesh chunds mother when she prophesied evil to little nihali did so from conviction or temper it was not long before her words came true despite the marvellous seven spices and many another timehonoured remedy the baby dwindled and pined unaccountably then came a day when veru half distraught and absolutely helpless sat with it in her arms sullen and silent the old women of the village dropped in one after the other more from curiosity than sympathy each laying down the law as to some infallible nostrum whose efficacy they defended against other views in highpitched cackle at last veru whose smattering of knowledge only brought incredulity without lending aid declaring she would not have the child tormented further laid it to her breast and turned her back upon hoarded wisdom only when gunesh chund came wandering in restlessly from the fieldwork which for the first time in his life failed to bring him peace she unclasped her straining arms to show him the still face lying against the full breast that roused no sign of life or desire a piteous sight the big tears ran down his cheeks and fell on the soft closed hand he took a corner of his cotton shawl and wiped them away clumsily but with infinite tenderness sure thou dost love her though she is a girl said veru with the calm of despair the man broke into a sob and turned away mother canst thou do nothing he asked in all the wistful confidence of a child laying his great hand on the old womans head as she bent over her task of kneading the dough for his supper do what is to be done with a woman who cries out if the child is touched i tell thee o guneshwa the little one is bewitchedthough god only knows why any one should trouble to cast an eye on a girl ask munlya ask premi or chuni or any wise woman but veru heeds us not saying the books deny it so be it the child will die gunesh chund lingered hesitating iiperhaps mother twould be better to fetch the doctor he is here still they say his mother sprang to her feet all the vigour and fire of her past youth in eyes and gesture that i should have lived to hear such words in the house where i came a modest bride where never man set foot save thy father and mine wilt thou cast thy honour and mine in the dust for a baby girl be it so gunesh choose now between her and me or choose rather between verus barren kisses and my curse for the child will die if the evil eye be not averted by charms choose i say for by my fathers soul if this bastard halfaman enters the house i leave it nay mother i did but suggest veru o veru veru i am sick of the name tis she who hath bewitched thee tis her evil eye he interrupted her fiercely seizing her by the wrist peace i say mother peace i will not hear such words they are true for all that she hath bewitched thee they stood for a moment face to face so like each other in their anger and dread then the strong man quailed and fled before her words and his own thoughts he was no wiser than his fellows for all the soft heart that betrayed him into progress perhaps less so since the superstitions of his fathers enslaved his mind without controlling his affections he wandered into the fields once more where the rows of blossoming mustard sown among the wheat showed like a yellow sea against the horizon but close at hand broke the green gloom of the earing corn in long curling waves crested with golda sight dear to husbandmens eyes yet it brought no comfort to the dull ache in guneshs heart which drove him to finish work with the first excuse of waning light the child was at least no worse perhaps the warmth had soothed its pain perhaps the feeble life was sinking silently but the ignorant loving eyes that watched it knew not whether the stillness made for sleep or death save for gunesh chund and his wife the house was empty for his mother had sought the relief of words with a neighbouring crony veru said gunesh in a whisper as if the darkening walls had ears dost think the doctor might do her good the mother will not have him heremayhap she is rightbut i could take the child to him o husband brought face to face with decision the woman shrank from action i know not and the mother would be so angry but the slower mind and warmer heart had been at work on the problem and ciphered it out once and for all she need never know sit within silent as if thou hadst it still should she return i shall not be long so give the child to me half fearful half pleased at his decision the mother shifted her burden to his awkward arms how small how light it seemed hidden away in the folds of his flowing plaidlike shawl as he passed through the twilight alleys on his way to the campingground where in the mud caravanserai the travelling vaccinator was to be found neighbours resting after the days labour called to him in various greeting and he paused to reply with dull patience conscious always of the unseen burden near his heart so had he carried the firstling lamb on the night when nihali was born how it had struggled to escape and sucked at his restraining hand in fierce desire for life a fear lest the childs quiet was death made him turn aside more than once into a darker corner to look and listen still with the same dull patience he sat down before the vacant room in the serai to await the vaccinators return for patience and doggedness are the peasant farmers unfailing inheritance not to be reft from him by tyrants or strangers some cameldrivers newly arrived were cooking their food at a blazing woodfire in the open whence the flames threw long shadows distorted out of all human semblance into the far corners of the courtyard where a circle of kneeling camels browsed upon a pile of green branches familiar sights and sounds to guneshs eyes and ears yet tonight with that strange burden near his heart seeming out of place and unexpected meanwhile veru with empty arms and nervous fingers twisting and turning themselves on each other restlessly was straining her eyes into the darkness and wondering with greater and greater insistence what kept her husband her motherinlaw had not returned she almost wished she had for the solitude and silence seemed unending at last unable to endure the suspense any longer she drew her veil tightly to avoid recognition and stole like a shadow along the darkest side of the street to meet gunesh but he also weary of waiting returned from an unsuccessful pursuit of the doctor by another route thus no reply came to his whispered call to veru as he stepped over the threshold what had happened he repeated the call louder verumother is there no one in the house his mothers voice answered him from behind and he turned to her relieved for all its lightness the little burden at his heart grew heavy in responsibility even in his mothers arms it seemed safer two old women who had accompanied her with the intention of making a last appeal to common sense looked at the child critically truly o mother of gunesha said one tis the evil eye but there is time yet to cast the devil out by fumigations without doubt echoed the other i have seen children nearer death than this snatched from the grave by wisdom such as thine gunesh chunds mother looked at him her triumph dimmed and softened by appeal wilt kill the little thing by overkindness she whispered see chance hath given her to us veru poor fool is awaylet us work the charm guneshwa i worked it on thee when thou wast a sickly babe and see how strong and tall thou art he looked from one to the other doubtfully what was he an ignorant man to set his wishes against these wise mothers when they assured him of success he gave a sign of assent and set himself towards authority should veru come back ere the business was well over the old women turned to their task joyfully the time was past they cackled for any but robust measures and life in nihalis frail form must be made unendurable to the devil without delay for this purpose what more effectual than red pepper and turmeric swiftly with muttered charms and many a deft passing through of this thing seven times and that seven times seven the child was laid on a low strongseated stool in full blaze of the firelight while the grandmother bringing the drugs from her stores within mixed them in approved manner an earthenware saucer filled with smouldering charcoal served for brazier then all being ready and placed beneath the stool a discordant chant was raised and the powder flung on the embers from the dense yellow smoke enveloping poor little nihali came a feeble gasping cry mother pleaded the man hiding his face tis the devil cries replied the stern old woman flinging fresh drugs on the coals a fainter cry came echoed in a shriek from the door where veru stood paralyzed for an instant by rage and terror the next dashing the witches aside with furious blows coughing and suffocating in the fumes her empty craving arms sought the child and found ittoo late a sigh a struggle and the demon or angel of life had fled forever smarting and half blind with the foul smoke verus eyes failed to see the tall figure half hidden in the corner but her voice seemed to pierce him through and through i gave her to guneshwa where is he then as the full extent of the result came home to her shriek after shriek rent the air and she fell into one of the violent hysterical fits so common among indian women of all classes the devil hath entered into her said her motherinlaw bitterly so the turmeric and red pepper came in handy gunesh chund torn by a vague remorse and uncertain what to think found his refuge in the dreamcompeller but while he dreamed under the stars on the roof that rose like a watchtower above the village and veru lay in the unconsciousness of exhaustion below a strange ghastly scene was enacted in the outer courtyard where the old women flitted about with tiny oil lamps in their hands little nihali dressed in her fine clothes with bandy legs straightened and struggling arms at rest lay stiff on the string stool with each tiny palm clenched over a ball of raw sugar and miniature cards of cottonwool such as women prepare for their spinning between each finger so armed with all female attractions the sugar symbolizing sweetness to a lover the cotton diligence as a wife nihali was ready like a true woman to sacrifice herself unconditionally in order to bring sons to the hearth veru of course would not hear of this said the stern grandmother to her cronies and guneshwa is fairly bewitched by her obstinacy nevertheless the opportunity shall not slip for if the omens are bad i must give him another wife without delay so in the darkest of the night before the jackals last cry heralded the dawn the three women slipped through the deserted streets no fear was on their faces no huddling together or whispering straight in solemn order as to a sacred duty went the little procession headed by the tall gaunt grandmother bearing the dead baby in her arms past the still shining pools of water girdling the village beyond the thorn enclosures through the fields of wheat till the village commonland a stretch of bare mud and low sparse bushes lay dim and desolate around them tis the nick of time said one of the cronies pointing to a grey shadow slinking away from their steps now may the great one send a good omen in an open spot surrounded by bushes gunesh chunds mother paused and looked around here she whispered and the others nodded she stooped to lay the dead child on the ground carefully placing it so that the feet were from the village then raising herself to her full height she stretched her right hand towards the horizon as if pointing out a road repeating in a wild chant echoed by those behind her thus we drive you forth o daughter come not back but send a brother swift and silent as they had come they made their way back to the village leaving the dead baby alone unwatched for a while the night was still then soft pattering feet crept round nihali and fierce eyes glared on her from the bushes but death held her in his arms secure and fear was over forever hist cried the retreating women as the sobbing wail of the jackal beginning with a faint whine rose louder and louder till each bush and brake seemed to give a voice to swell the horrid chorus they waited listening now may the omen be good said one the dawn will show replied the grandmother calmly i will wait here go you home to bed but when the rising sun brought sufficient light to see withal her eager eyes could find no certain indication on which to build either hope or fear marks there were and plenty showing where the beasts had fought but no broad track of dragging either away from or towards the village conveying nihalis last message to her friends had she gone over the edge of the world seeking for the longsought son or had she come back to haunt the hearth with her unwelcome presence who could tell everything goes wrong nowadays muttered the discontented old woman even the omens fail tis all the fault of the great queen and her newfangled notions iv the next three months brought gunesh chund many an uneasy hour even when driven to bay by his mothers entreaties to allow her to look for a new wife he confessed his promise to wait a year he gained no respite from her reproaches but rather enhanced their venom by her contempt for his weakness what was he to set himself above the wisdom of his fathers what was the readingwriting woman that she should run counter to the traditions which held the first duty of a hindu wife was to be that of bringing a son to the hearth he had no answer save a dull consciousness that somehow he was not quite as his fathers they for instance had calmly acquiesced in such customs as the exposure of the dead child to the jackals while despite his familiarity with the idea its practice had filled him with aversion honest as he was by nature he never regretted the deceit which sent veru after she recovered from the illness following on the shock of nihalis death to cool a little grave by the burningground with her tears and offerings footnote female children are not worth the expense of burning twill only make her ill again to know what thou hast done he had said to his mother with a decision new to him silence will be the wisest for thee also since in this i am on her side as for the casting out of the demon which had hurried on the inevitable end veru always maintained to her motherinlaw that it partook of the nature of murder but with her usual shrewdness she exonerated gunesh chund from blame for this he was grateful though his mind was by no means made up as to the rights and wrongs of the question from this and many another problem he took refuge in the fields the fierce dry winds of summer blew with scorching heat bringing with them the necessity for a ceaseless watering of the crops many and many a silent peaceful hour he spent in the forked seat behind the oxen half asleep half awake while the wellwheel circled round he circled round the wheel and the great world circled round beyond him whether it span swift or slow he knew not and he cared not many an hour too he spent resting smoking and talking under the shade of the one big mulberrytree while the greybeards wheezed out their mouldy proverbs and the lads listened with their mouths full of the overripe deadsweet fruit a kindly honest crew mayhap not far above the circling bullocks in mind or ambitions but for the most part without an ungenerous thought or unfriendly wish or he would take his pipe down to the village dharmsala where strangers found a lodging and the inhabitants a debating club but here the goad of fate hit keenly at times when the talk fell on the coming settlement and kishnus people would condole with him in covert sneers for gunesh chund had been accustomed ever since his father died to have the first and last word in that assembly of elders and even his gentle selfdepreciation could not fail to feel a certain loss of authority one night after kishnus husband his own cousin backed by some friends had openly derided his opinion and talked big about changes in the future gunesh sat on longer than was his wont among the elder men they had been his fathers friends and he turned to them instinctively for support yet as they sat solemnly crouched up on the high wooden bench which filled the rudely carved veranda from end to end no voice came from the darkness where they showed grey and shadowy in their white drapery almost formless save when every now and again a more vigorous pull at a pipe fanned the embers in it to a glow which lit up the lean highfeatured faces and wrinkled hands and gunesh too remained silent and perturbed knowing well what was in their thoughts it was a relief when the hubblebubble of the pipes dropped into insignificance before a speech summoned up by neighbourly nods and nudges it came from the patriarch whose palsied hand shook as he stretched it forward listen o guneshwa the lumberdar thy grandfather and i played together as boys in the house of my father and his but his father was the lumberdar and mine but an elder if the seed of strife springs in the village whose task is it to root it out answer me ye who hear me a murmur of approbation ran round the assembly whereat the patriarch went on in a louder key if there be young untutored cattle in the herd whose duty is it to see they do not gore the old answer ye who hear me but gunesh chund knowing of old the length to which this system of exhortation could be extended broke in quickly granted that tis my task wouldst thou have me root out mine own family nay retorted the elder laughing in proud anticipation of his own joke i would have thee plant some more of the same stockis it not so my brothers this time a wheezy chuckle of assent came from the darkness followed by a fresh voice a man without a son hath one life a man rejoicing in a son hath two then another took up the parable aye and four hands to boot wherewith to root out weeds the hundredfold wheat hath more stems than one quoth a third and a toddling child can drive bullocks put in a fourth so in solemn adage ran the talk with many a weighty pause and many a selfcomplacent wag of the head when the ball of ancient wit had been successfully passed to the next neighbour accustomed as he was to this style of reasoning each remark was a fresh tap driving the nail of conviction into gunesh chunds slow brain as he stood on the roof that night whence he could see the horizon strike the sky in one unbroken circle a keen desire to live as his fathers had lived excluded all other thoughts here was his world here lay his duty thou canst choose a wife for me if thou wiliest he said sheepishly to his mother when in the early dawn he found her already at work while veru lay abed with some ache or pain o my son o guneshwa cried the old woman flinging her arms around his neck with unwonted tenderness and with tears of joy in her bright old eyes i will find thee a pearl and paragon with a skin wheatcoloured and nay mother interrupted the big man still more sheepishly an she please thee and have a soft tongue that is all i care for and mother say no word to veru yet there is time and mayhap thou wilt not find a wife soon his mother laughed scornfully not find one to marry the lumberdar such a fine straight man as thou art guneshwa why they will come in crowds nay be not so modest that is the girls part not the mans nevertheless as thou sayst tis time enough to tell veru when all things are settled there is but one woman needed in a marriage if some rankling doubt as to the honesty of his silence lingered in gunesh chunds mind it vanished quickly before the personal peace which his decision brought to the household perhaps veru might have wondered at the lull which thereinafter fell over the combat but that she herself was absorbed in a new hope of victory and thought it possible that her keeneyed motherinlaw might in like manner be preparing for defeat so the time of truce passed on until one day almost before gunesh had realized his own capitulation his mother informed him that a bride had been found so soon he exclaimed dismally o mother take care sure the choice of a ploughbullock would take me longer then tis time to tell veru was his only remark when the beauties virtues and charms of the young lady were dinned into his ears whereupon his mother with much inward contempt at his scruples told him curtly that she had purposely chosen a bride from a far country so that he need say nothing since nothing would be known by others until the festivities began i will tell her before then he said relieved but somehow the days passed by leaving behind them the silence that they found meanwhile veru wearied heaven with prayers and penances till she grew thin and palegiven to fits of hysteria and tears yet with a triumphant look in her eyes as she listened to her motherinlaws constant allusions to her illhealth with which the old lady bolstered up gunesh chunds failing resolution all three were too much occupied with their own thoughts and secrets to notice anything unusual in the bearing of the others or if they did notice it naturally put the change down to vague suspicions and so held their own counsel more firmly the crops were fast turning russet and gold under the glare of sunlight succeeding to the monsoon rains when gunesh chund said goodbye to his household for ten days and rode by winding village ways to the broad white road that carried western civilization in the shape of a postbag through the district veru clothed in madder and indigo stood on the roof to watch him out of sight loath to lose him and regretting that she had not risked her secret ere he left how much more would she have regretted it had she known that her husbands destination lay far beyond his usual bourne the central revenue office and that his bundle contained all things necessary for the interchange of presents with a new bride meanwhile her motherinlaw stolidly at work below wondered how any woman could be so immodest as to show grief at a husbands departure and gunesh chund riding between serried ranks of feathertopped maize and swelling bosses of millet thought of the coming harvest in a way each and all were looking forward with eager desire to reaping what they had sown as if life held any other fate for humanity that same afternoon veru unwilling to relax any of her efforts because of her hopes set off to worship a snake which frequented an old anthill at the farther end of the village common the day had been one of extreme heat and a yellow dusthaze hung over everything dust above below around her only the anthill furrowed by longpast rains into rugged pinnacles rising clear and distinct she was a timid woman unused to roaming so far and she looked fearfully around dreading lest from one of the dark holes piercing the mound a hooded head might rear itself and speak to her such things had been she knew for beneath the veneer of unbelief the old superstitions held her in thrall hastily yet carefully lest evil should befall from any lack of ceremony she ranged her sugarcakes hung up her chaplet of flowers and sprinkled the milk she had brought in a little brass pot with a lavish hand it left dark ominouslooking stains on the white dust glad to escape from such weird surroundings yet feeling the need of rest she drew aside among the wild caperbushes and sat down wiping the beads of perspiration from her forehead with the corner of her veil it felt quite hot against the damp skin cooled by the fierce dry wind that even in this sheltered spot drove the dust along in swirls she drew her veil over her head and sat still as a statue in the curiously drooping attitude which to western eyes suggests absorbing grief but verus mind was full of a great joy which gained no little sweetness from the thought of revenge yet as she dreamed far away into the years a spreading fold of her veil caught in a caperthorn seemed pointing to something that glistened among the roots behind her veru rising to go stooped to disengage herself and sawa babys bracelet the next instant with a shrill highpitched shriek of rage she set off running towards the village her mind slow enough to take in novel ideas needed no prompting here it was little nihalis bracelet and the explanation of this fact followed as a matter of course the dead child had been exposed as an augury but what had the verdict been strange as it may seem that thought came uppermost doubtless had the truth been told her in the first freshness of bereavement when the soft touch of the little hands and the clinging of the lips were more than a memory indignation and horror at the outrage on her child might have overcome her curiosity at any rate the desire to pose as an advanced woman would have induced her to conceal it but months had passed bringing a new hope to ensure which her inherited instincts would gladly have sacrificed more than a dead girl indeed the wish for some such augury had more than once invaded her and lo the sign had been given and she knew nothing of it that it had been favourable she assumed believing that otherwise her motherinlaw would have hastened to make it known unheardof spite and crueltybut if it were the climax it should also be an end to tyranny trembling with excitement and the uneducated womans desire for words she ran forward panting and breathless with little cries of anger and grief until she sank down exhausted with the unwonted exertion and her own emotions when she arose again it was with greater calmness but more resentment her motherinlaw was toasting the newmade doughcakes by the fire when after many pauses veru reached home wearied out she leaned against the doorjamb for support ere commencing the fray and looked at the elder woman with sombre menacing eyes the latter paid no attention but went on tossing aside the heatblistered cakes and placing others upright in the embers till they blew out like bladders suddenly veru raised her hand something gleaming flew through the air and the dead babys bracelet fell at her enemys feet and rolled among the ashes the jackals have sent thee a present grandmother the old woman looked at it startled then sprang up and faced her adversary in fiercest indignation what hast thou done fool bringing the curse of girls back to the earth the wild beasts were more merciful than thou art for they gave no sign and see where the bread is baking thou hast thrown the augury o guneshwa o my son would that thou wert here to see this witch casting her spells to bring barrenness to the bride thou art wooing but no matter the old mother will avert them so bring home thy bride guneshwa bring home the virtuous kirpa devi daughter of kirpo ram of badrewallah veru struck dumb by the possible consequences of her own act as revealed to her in her motherinlaws unforeseen reproach felt the whole world turn round as the old woman roused out of caution let loose her secret and her tongue without reserve it is not true it is not true guneshwa would never deceive me so was all the poor creature found to say against the torrent of words and facts not true echoed the other remorselessly come hither and see if it be not true that a wedding is nigh seizing veru by the wrist she dragged her across the courtyard flung open the storeroom door which was kept jealously locked against all intrusion and pointed to a row of handkerchiefcovered baskettrays ranged in order on the ground behold she cried jeeringly as she lifted the covering from one displaying a pile of cheap tinseldecked garments such as are made to fill up the measure of more solid wedding presents guneshwas mother is not so careless as his wife here is everything needful and yonder is the pile of dates whence he took the offering that went with him today staythou canst read put thy scholarship to some use for once and see if it be not true but veru did not take the letters thrust at her the shock was too great following on her excitement and utter weariness she swayed as she stood and with a cry of o guneshwa bring the dates back bring them back she fell in a heap among the baskets in the dawn of the next day her motherinlaw as she lay down to snatch a little sleep while one of her cronies watched by verus bed told herself that the house was cursed indeed who would have dreamed of the gods bringing such hopes to veru who would have thought of her concealing them even for a day and what a heritage of evil she would leave behind her if she died now nihalis augury was bad enough but what chance would there be for the new wife if the ghost of an expectant mother haunted the house veru must not dieshould not die so the old woman nursed her tenderly and strove in her rough way to bring comfort to the mind stricken by mad jealousy and resentment i will die was the only response i will die and become a ghost i will i will footnote a woman dying with her unborn child has infinite power for ill hearken o veru replied her motherinlaw at last thy dying will not harm any one for if thou diest ere guneshwa returns i swear he shall never know a word neither of thy hopes nor of thy fears it shall be silence silence forever and who fears a ghost he knows not of answer me that and veru gripped in the stern old womans greater strength could only turn her face to the wall sullenly hast thou no message for guneshwa asked the watcher at the last as veru lay sinking nonethatthouwouldstgive came the reply with a strange smile that remained on the lips even after death now thank god neither guneshwa nor his bride need know aught of this thought the old lady as they streaked the corpse with many a weird ceremony and precaution v the moon shone brightly as gunesh chund rode through the village common on his homeward way there was scarcely a track to be seen on the hard white ground where the sparse bushes close at hand lay like shadows here and there but in the distance blended themselves into a grey line against the lighter sky no visible track yet the lumberdars pony picked its way unerringly true as the needle towards the manger awaiting it instinct or habit supplying the place of reason its rider could boast of no such contented certainty somethingwhat he would have been puzzled to sayhad made the path of custom seem doubtful without supplying him with a new or clearer road and overlying the dull sense of discomfort was a distinct remorse for the deceit to which his honest if sluggish soul was quite a stranger the memory of his promise troubled him although he quite acknowledged that a pudmuni or ideal hindu wife would never have claimed its fulfilment suddenly his pony started and swerved throwing him forward in his shovel stirrups in his efforts to keep in his seat the cause seemed to be the sudden appearance of a veiled woman beckoning with outstretched hands but when he could give a calmer look the difference in position caused by his ponys advance showed him that it was but the dead trunk of a tree with a sign of relief he gave the animal a dig in the sides tis thinking so much of womenfolk does it he said to himself i weary for the ploughing and peace a sense of wellbeing came over him at the familiar sights and sounds as he neared the village even the dogs barking in chorus at the ponys echoing steps seemed to him a welcome and the house quiet and dark though it was a haven of rest after the hustle and bustle of his rapid excursion into an unknown world the door of the inner court was closed for he was not expected till dawn and he stood for an instant beside it listening all was still as death and with another sigh of relief he stumbled up the steep stairs to his favourite sleepingplace how calm it was there under the stars how clear the path now that he was at home once more among familiar landmarks why if difficulties arose had they not arisen over and over again in the lives of those who had gone before him what more easy than to adopt the ancient remedy and by building a new court for the new wife separate the jealous women his mother would of course side with her own choice so veru far from having any ground of complaint would find greater peace than heretofore in his quiet limited way he loved her more than he would have cared to avow and so thinking of her ease he fell asleep full of content the night passed the dawn lightened into sunshine yet still he slept wearied out by his ten days exile from the village and so it came to pass that his mother apprised of his return by finding the pony in its accustomed place had to rouse him by sad words awake o gunesh chund son of anant ram and make thy heart strong for veru thy wife is dead a sad amaze an almost pitiful resignation followed the first incredulity and then as he sat below patiently waiting for many a rite and conventional lamentation the memory of his last waking thought returned to him i thought of building her a new house for peace sake he said wistfully to his mother and lo the great ones have given her a grave and peace forever perhaps tis as well guneshwa replied the old woman softened by his gentle grief her health was poor and if death drew nigh it was better he should come before the bride perhaps twas as well that was all her tongue found to say but her heart rejoiced exceedingly that eternal silence had fallen over the dead wifes reproaches if premi and chuni only held their tongues as they always did if it was made worth their while neither gunesh chund nor his bride need know the curse that had come upon them above all the softhearted bridegroom would be saved the daily terror of seeing the fatal ghost even as it were the autumn chills were upon him making him shiver and shake and bringing the haggard aguestricken look so common at that time of year to his sad face he took little interest in the preparations which his mother pressed on with feverish haste but passed days and nights out of doors among his fields going the round of the crops with the village accountant and seeing to the payment of revenue dues thou takest no rest gunesh chund exclaimed his mother indignantly when he pleaded business as an excuse for not going to the silversmiths to hurry him up with the remodelling of poor verus ornaments a lumberdar was a lumberdar long before the sahibs came to the land what is it to thee if they want this written one way and that another there were no such piles of papers in thy fathers day and he was a better lumberdar than thou wilt ever be mayhap mother but somehow tis ill work nowadays doing things as they used to be done it suits no one not even thee not suit meid like to know nay are not the old trinkets being altered even now for my part i liked them best as they were guneshwa thou art a ninny but thou wilt sing another song when the bride comes to thee adorned that new silversmith hath done well there is a fashion of neckletfrench pattern he called itlike needlework for fineness and i have not forgotten the old ways for the talisman veru wore is made into a saukinmhora to keep her ghost away the lumberdars face assumed a startled alarmed look the ghost mother wherefore the ghost veru was a good wife loving me and i was a good husband to her there was no illwill betwixt us surely his mother could have bitten her tongue out for her inadvertence twas but a thoughtless word o my son and i am overanxious surely the woman took too many blessings from thee in life to give thee curses in death and see she added hastily in the hope of diverting his eager anxiety i have found what thou wert asking forthe certificates of thy fathers to many and many a generation thou hadst given them into verus keeping but they are too precious for a womans holding who knows but she has lost some squandering thy sons heritage out of spite who canst give back the praises of the dead so she went on in purposeful grumbling while gunesha opening the handkerchief in which the precious documents were folded counted the frayed papers laboriously nay they are here and more let me count again surely there are thirtyandtwo and when the canal sahib gave me his last year there were but thirtyandone thirtyandone no more he sat down on the doorstep shifting the papers through his awkward hands with the uncertain eyes of one who being unable to read has to seek recognition through more devious ways his mother meanwhile utterly indifferent had turned to some household occupation see there is a new one that one may be tis cleaner than the rest he muttered to himself opening up the folded sheet conspicuous by its whiteness it was written in the nagari character and his puzzled face cleared at the sight tis all right mother he exclaimed there are but thirty one the other is a letter he was about to add a suggestion that veru might have written it but checked himself from fear of starting another tirade against the dead woman a letter echoed his mother contemptuously throw it in the fire i have no patience with folk who find their tongues too short to touch friend or foe but mother returned gunesh with a smile even thy tongue is not long enough to reach over the world and wherefore should i try i tell thee guneshwa that we peasantfolk have naught to do with the world what he can touch with his hands is a mans portion till he dies and tis theft to go beyond writing is no good except for certificates there is devi dittas house thrown into grief just as the boys betrothal began by the news of his father being killed in burma god knows where burma is far enough may be to keep the news back till a more convenient time if it came as god meant it to come and the man is dead anyhow but gunesh chund refolded the paper and placed it in his waistband his friend the accountant could tell him its purport the chills again asked his mother with no anxiety in her voice when coming back from devi dittas house with a throat rendered hoarse by neighbourly lamentations she found her son huddled up under his quilt you must get the sahibs white powder for a wonder it does good quinine will not cure me mother he replied in a curiously muffled voice that startled the hearer by its dull despair what ails thee then guneshwa the man sat up amid his heavy wrappings and looked at her without resentment the ague cramped his blue fingers and made him draw shuddering breaths through widely distended nostrils as he sat gazing at her with wild eyes full of a mute appeal and reproach then with a little almost childish cry he fell back among the quilts once more thou knowest mother thou knowest it well her heart throbbed but her voice was steady as she replied what do i know o gunesh chund that veru kept her promise and i broke mine she knew you would not tell me so she wrote that was the letter the old woman stood for an instant bewildered then as she realized that all her wisdom had not availed against the dead wifes knowledge she threw her lean arms up over her head and beat her hands together wildly while the court reechoed with her high resonant voice she wrote it now may god curse her utterly my curse upon her and every woman who learns a shivering hand reached out towards her hush mother i have had enough of curses today the mild reproof made her forget her anger in thoughts for him light of mine eyes heart of my heart she cried flinging herself on her knees by the bed and stretching the arms but now raised in cursing around him in fierce protecting she cannot hurt theeshe dare not if charms avail the iron rings are about her hands and feet the nails are through her cursed writing fingerswould god they had been there ere she wrote that letterand the mustardseed lies thick between her grave and the hearth i have sown it and will sow it with each new moon look up guneshwa she cannot she dare not return she hath returned already the old woman rose with a gesture of despair say not so break not thy mothers heart with idle words tis but the chills and thou hast them often the powder will cure them perhaps tis so he replied listlessly but i have seen her ere ever i knew of her death she met me on the common as i rode home nay weep not so soon the truth will be told ere long and there will be time enough for tears then there will be no need to weep at all my son she said crushing down her own dread in order to lessen his and fiercely determining to shed no more tears till life held nothing else she kept her word though as the days passed on even her wilful blindness could not fail to see how the strong man grew weaker and weaker her heart stood still with fear as she watched for the sleep of exhaustion which followed each successive attack of fever and ague before stealing away to seize the opportunity for the charms she dared not work save in secrecy indeed the subject was barred between them and even when the fever fiend held him in its grip gunesh chund never alluded again to the fatal ghost he put aside the saukinmhora which in her clutching at straws she would have had him wear as a talisman with quite a broad laugh wouldst have me altogether a woman mother he asked cheerfully i deemed instead i was too soft for thee but see whether it be the chills or the other thing death will come if he is on the road for all the courage of his words a conviction that he was doomed dulled his interest in all things save his fields and when he grew too weak to find his way there and back his patience broke into restlessness i will go and stop at the well mother he said at last the air is freer out there and i weary to death looking at these dull mud walls so leaning on his mothers arm gunesh chund the lumberdar made his way for the last time down the village street to meet death in the open it is good to be here he said with peace in his face and heart as he lay day after day gazing with dull contented eyes at the broad expanse of newlytilled soil where the sun gleamed on the furrows the birds chattering in the mulberrytree overhead and the ceaseless babble of the lifegiving water flowing past him filled his ears with familiar comfort there was nothing here to puzzle his slow brain nothing to disturb a nature welded by long centuries of toil under the sunny skies into perfect accord with its environment so his mother coming back from her unavailing spells found him one day looking out over the springing crops with sightless eyes and placid face i might have saved him she said to herself with infinite bitterness as from the sleepingplace on the roof she watched the smoke of his funeral pyre drift away into the cloudless bluei might have saved him but for the letter oh curses curses ten thousand curses on those who taught her to write curses to all eternity on all newfangled ways once more her lean brown arms flung themselves in wild appeal towards heaven as she stood out against the sky facing the futureold sonless hopeless the blue monkey willie mark twain tells us had a purple monkey climbing up a yellow stick he further informs us that this quadruman made its owner deathly sick the following story shows the effect that a blue monkey on a gilt spike had in a remote indian village called jehadporea very ordinary village set out on high unirrigated soil beside a large irregular tank whence the bricks of many generations of houses had been dug the only peculiarity about it being a glaringly whitewashed mosque facade rising above the whole and flanked by a palmtree merely a facade viewed frontwise distinctly imposing with minarets and domes in orthodox numbers and positions viewed sidewise as distinctly disappointing the jerriest of london jerry builders could have done nothing better than this one brick front elevation of which even the domes were but bassorelievos still it dominated the village in every way for it was built in the courtyard of exrissaldarmajor azmutoollah khan sahib bahadurs house and he with his hangerson represented jehadpore it was a rangur villagethat is to say a village of mohammedan rajputs a race which supplies half the native cavalry of upper india with recruits that was the case at jehadpore when the district officer came round every year to attest and write up the big village notebook there was always something to add on this score either the number of those away asoldiering had to be increased or an entry made that soandso had returned with a pinson to his wife and family on these occasions the district officer invariably found an escort awaiting him at the boundary consisting of sowars on leave from various regiments with their horses a contingent of pinsonwallahs in nondescript uniform on broodmares and khan azmutoollah khan bahadur cie exrissaldar at their head he was a very old man as deeply wrinkled as a young actor doing the part of an ancient retainer in the privacy of that courtyard garnished by the jerry mosque he clothed himself scantily in limp white muslin and his beard was tricolouredwhite at the roots red in the middle purple at the ends but on his screaming stallion sword in hand a goodly row of medals on his worn tunic azmutoollahs beard was of the fiercest black and the line of moustache shaved from the hard mouth into an arched curve under his aquiline nose curled right up to his eyes his voice too lost its quaver of age and before he had safely inducted the huzoor into his tents down by the tank that irregular troop of cavalry had been put through enough manoeuvres to last out three ordinary field days it was the old soldiers kriegspiel footnote pension when it was over and he dozed wearied out by the unaccustomed effort on the wooden bed under the nimtree the hard rolypoly bolster tucked in to the hollow of his neckor something elsemade his sleepingplace a bethel and he dreamed dreams then he had to resume the old uniform once more and go over to the tents again with a petition rangurs always have petitions about wells or water or brood mares for if they make excellent troopers they are intolerably bad ploughmen that was why mool raj the hereditary moneylender of jehadpore was able to send his son hunuman sing to college and make a pleader of him the exrissaldar with two sons and three grandsons in the old regiment waxed contemptuous over the pleadery career but that was his attitude in all things towards mool raj and the small hindu element the latter represented in jehadpore the fact that the mohammedan population to a man was in the usurers debt did not affect the position of affairs at all or detract from the feeling of virtuous tolerance which allowed a most modest and retiring hindu temple to conceal itself behind the back wall of the mosque facade it was a great concession for azmutoollah was not the only hadji in jehadpore the place was a perfect hotbed of fighting mohammedanism which only needed opposition to grow into fanaticism footnote pilgrim to mecca yet when mool raj added a new story to the hindu temple nobody said him nay they were good friends with the wizened monkeylike usurer bismillah khan sahib laughed one of the group of sowars round azmutoollahs wooden bed he saith it is to save his soul from sin god knows he needs it for he hath charged me rascally interest on my last debt if we must needs have a hindu in the place seeing god and his prophet forbid the true believer to soil his hands with usury then by the imams let us have a pious one even when he put a gilt spike on the top they spoke of it in contemptuous kindness whether he buries our gold or sets it on high is all one so long as he hath enough to lend us when we seek it and tis thankoffering he says for his son hunuman passing as ba god knows what that may be but the boy hath thin legs and a narrow chest azmutoollah khan cie looked distastefully at the extreme tip of a gilt spike which from the farthermost corner of the courtyard showed just over the facade so far well said the old martinet a hindu may have repentance and he is like to ourselves in affection for his familythough allah be praised none of mine carry themselves like a lumpa ta heen but that is an end of repentance and affection i will have no idolatrous spike under my eyes and so i will tell mool raj let hunuman build himself a temple in lahore out of his scholarships and pleaders fees we want none of his kind in jehadpore footnote big crane the usurer came back from his interview with his patron quite resigned to tell the truth he himself was not much set on these pious additions which cost a heap of hardwon money their initiator was hunumans mother who ever since her pilgrimage to shah sultan had been rewarded by the longprayedfor son had looked on him as doubly dependent on the favour of the godshis very name hunuman having been bestowed on him because she had seen a monkey when she first regained consciousness after the curious hysterical crisis which seizes on most women at that most famous shrine the inference being of course that the monkey god was responsible for the babya presumption not in the least weakened by the fact that shah sultan was a mohammedan saint to whom monkeys and gods were an abomination chand kor therefore gave shrill disapproval to azmutoollahs fiat in her heart of hearts she nourished the ideal of a blue monkey god perched on the top of that golden spike and when two days afterwards hunuman sing ba came down for his vacation she poured the tale of intolerance into his ear now hunuman sing after the manner of his kind did not carewell what the iron duke said cost him twopencefor his godfather nor indeed for most of the beliefs of his mother how could he who could expect it of him the cry which goes up now and again in india when some clever lad educated at a missionschool openly forsakes his religion is beneath contempt there is not one orthodox hindu father north or south who pushing his lad on for the sake of worldly success does not do it with his eyes open to the inevitable gulf which must separate them in the future this particular son was like many another son of the sort a good lad on the whole if more interested in his own development than anything else in the world this again was inevitable when you have to cram the evolution of ages into twoandtwenty years and grow from a baby named after the monkey god into a ba a strict attention to business is necessary if he was pushing was not that also inevitable jonahs gourd had to push some as the americans say for the rest he was like hundreds of the amiable clever young graduates whom one longs to have in the desert for forty days and nights opposite the sphinx one by one of course for if there were two of them they would form a subcommittee and vote the sphinx to the chair then the millennium would come of course and that would be inconvenient for nous autres but though hunuman cared not at all for the blue monkey god he worshipped libertyespecially his own and he preferred it if possible with a flavour of law about it what deprive a citizen a subject of the queen empress from due exercise of religious right who was azmutoollah khan to promulgate such a pernicious attempt at intimidationvide section soandso little mool raj who seemed to shrivel smaller as he grew older listened to all this with great pride but steadfast inaction he knew who azmutoollah khan was well enough he knew the temper of the people who had enriched him all too well liberty was a fine thing but money was betterpeace and comfort best of all this latter conviction however made him give way slightly before chand kors tears and the next evening when the rissaldarmajor was interviewing two new arrivals on leave and bringing the wisdom of a lifetime to bear on their horses an odd noise floated over the sham domes of the mosque tis a donkey with the strangles khan sahib remarked rahmat ali yea mine is a lucky onefive curls and he paused no it was not a donkey what was it a camel snoring a cow dying the women servants baking bread in the corner stood up to listen the two boys heads down arms interlaced wrestling stark naked in the sun paused also then suddenly as if by mistake an inconceivable gamut beginning with an earthquake passing on to a foghorn and ending with a pennywhistle let itself loose god and his prophet yelled azmutoollah it is a conch as they stood petrified by the audacity the low grunting recommenced and then once more something let go lost control over itself and went skirling up like a burst bagpipe my sword gasped the exrissaldar the idolatrous defiler of the faiththe desecrator of my fathers graves a conch in jehadpore by the lord who made me tis the last if the opponents had been better matched there would have been bloodshedding in the village on that calm evening but what could a dozen sowars with drawn swords headed by azmutoollah joined by half the populace of the village do against hunuman sing who with a trembling in his knees but the courage of martyrs in his mind stood on the steps of the temple nearly bursting himself in his efforts to play the unwonted instrument a roar of laughter went up from the crowd as alarmed but determined he backed from the onslaught to the temple door stumbled on the step sat down violently and the concussion sent a perfectly supernatural kerwhooooooooph through the conch even azmutoollahs indignation could not withstand it go rahmat ali and take it from him ere he do himself an injury and seek mool raj kutbudin tis his blame not the boys but hunuman was on his feet again full of outraged importance the affair to him was deadly earnest i am no boy khan azmutoollah but of legal age with ba pass i am a loyal citizen of victoria kaiserihind religious liberty enjoins me to play conch if i choose and i do choose the spirit was willing but the flesh in the hustling hands of half a dozen troopers was perforce weak the hindu is not naturally resistant and the fighting men around him were not slow to recognize hunumans unusual show of determination it is assault it is battery i am coerced i claim my rights the law is on my side he gasped between his struggles smash the blasphemous thing and let the boy go called azmutoollah enough hunumanji seek thy law elsewherenot here in the house of my fathers the conch lay shivered to atoms but the young man felt himself master of the situation just as the concussion of his fall had forced his breath into the conch so the pressure of illegal coercion made his newly acquired love of freedom overflow into eloquence heart and head were both full to inflation with the finest sentiments as he stood on the steps haranguing the people he would have done credit to the house of commons in a party discussion by the faith he speaks well tis a pity his shoulders are so narrow remarked a trooper carelessly as he strolled away to a bare beaten patch by the tank where a number of naked boys were standing in pairs heads down hands on knees smacking their thighs and crying hulllala to give themselves courage ere closing for the grip beneath the skeleton of a peepultree hard by whence the branches had been stripped for fodder some elders were at work over gymnastic exercises swinging clubs orsupported on palms and feettouching the dust with their foreheads and then rising again like a strung bow the sunlight shone on their bronze sinews didst kill him asked one breathlessly keeping the count of his own performance kill him look you allah bakshthere was not enough of him to kill and a chuckle ran round the assembly a fortnight after when the district officer was playing whist with the policeman the doctor and the young assistant who was gradually being taught that rules are occasionally more honoured in the breach than the observance dhunput rai judicial assistant sent in to ask five minutes leisure of the huzoor every one laid down his cards at once and the doctor lit a fresh cigar for dhunput rai was one of those natives of the old school who many a time and oft have steered the british bark safely through troubled waters as their fathers steered the alien armadas of the mogul he was a brahman of the highest caste keenwitted clearsighted privately a bigot publicly a statesman huzoor he said briefly young lala amr nath the extra hath this day in a case given leave for a conch to be blown in jehadpore there will be trouble in my opinion it is a fitting occasion for the huzoor to act under section which gives absolute power to the district officer in emergency five minutes afterwards dhunput rai took his leave with an interdict in his pocket and a deputy inspector of police and four mounted constables rode out with it post haste so as to arrive before the earliest blink of dawn made conchblowing compatible with anything save sheer malice aforethought it was a great blow to hunuman and a small circle of select college friends who had assembled to witness the triumph of religious freedom they consoled themselves during the interval of appeal by writing an article to the sun of asia in the course of which they promulgated several valuable new discoveries such as that there was one law for the rich and another for the poor azmutoollah meanwhile admitted grudgingly that there was some sense left in the sahibs still in spite of their setting goldsmiths sons like amr nath to rule over honest folk im dashed if i can find a precedent remarked the district officer disconsolately talking over the matter with the policeman the doctor and the assistant and in a case like this where every thing depends on the environment and its sure to be appealed again there is no mortal good in anything but a precedent if i say there will be a row i shall only be told with great dignity that mr smith is expected to keep his district in order there was a pause finally the doctor spoke he hailed from aberdeen its an ill burd that files his ain nest but for religious intolerance give me scotland awm no saying utll hold as a preeceedent amongst the heathen but its a preeceedent in the court o session it was aprepaw of a bell a bell heaven be praised the very thing a bell is not a conch remarked the assistant alias i should say murmured the policeman bell conch call to prayer thats the spirit fire away old chapbearer bring the doctorsahib another peg so the precedent of a faraway cathedral whose schismatic chime annoyed good calvinists was brought to bear on hunuman and the conch and the latter not being an integral part of public worship was proclaimed a nuisance the deputy commissioner himself had no doubt about its being one as he wiped the perspiration from his brow and remarked to dhunput rai that that ought to finish the business the courteous old gentleman smiled huzoor he said i have heard my father say that akbars order to his judges was write ever with the pen which has been cut by the sword then there is peace in the land the case will be appealed and the pen of the huzoors is cut by machine he was a true prophet hunuman backed by the sun of asia not only appealed the conch question but raised another in the interim by putting a small blue plaster monkey on the top of the gold spike in fulfilment it was urged of the prenatal vow made for him by his mother a pious hindu lady whose virtuous life was crowned with honour the monkey remained there exactly fiveandtwenty minutes after the first beams of the rising sun disclosed the fact that it had been put there during the night that it remained so long was due to three reasons first that the jehadpore troopers if good swordsmen were uncommonly bad shots second that azmutoollahs blunderbuss was a flintlock third that he insisted on letting it off himself until it knocked him down this time the case was taken direct to the deputy commissioner who urged on the one side by a remembrance of dhunput rais remark and on the other by a sneaking fear of revision decided that the blue monkey as an idolatrous image was a distinct nuisance when displayed unnecessarily over the top of a mohammedan gentlemans private mosque on the other hand viewed from the hindu standpoint the image of a blue monkey might be an integral part of public worship azmutoollah khan bahadur cie exrissaldar must therefore pay over to mool raj and to hunuman sing the price of the destroyed blue monkey as they might wish to erect a similar one in a less conspicuous place now though mool rajs name was duly entered in the file as complainant the affair had long ago passed out of his hands and become a real solid heavensent grievance to a small knot of advanced young pleaders indeed the old man was so distinctly unsatisfactory as chief victim that they had more than once taken the opportunity of his absence to advance matters a step azmutoollah khan as shrewd an old soldier as could be found on either side of the indus was not slow to notice this and his blind opposition covered a great longing to have these youngsters on the hip after all he and mool raj had pulled along well enough for years before this ba was thought ofay and their fathers before them if the usurer had been alone the money screw could have been put on him somehow since he would not risk a pice for all the blue monkeys in heaven or on earth azmutoollah khan was cogitating these matters one afternoon on the wooden bed with his turban as usual standing like a helmet beside him when a party of boys rushed into the courtyard full of news and excitement hunuman sing who as every one knew had come with some friends in a bullock cart that morning must have brought the thing with him but as sure as fate there was a blue monkey sitting on the square pedestal in front of the temple which alla ditta the mason had built in all innocence of heart last weeka blue monkey not a miniature marionette at the top of a gilt spike like the last but a lifesized affair and what is more all the hindus in the place and many more from neighbouring villages were doing poojah to it the fierce old mohammedans very lips turned pale he never even thought of his turban but baldheaded as he was and stumbling in his haste was out of the courtyard into the narrow street the next minute a cry that was not pleasant to hear cut the calm sunshine like a sword jehad jehad futteh mohammed jehad jehad futteh mohammed shrilled the boys in refrain a knot of young men in patentleather shoes standing by the blue monkey heard the cry with a glow of triumph brothers and sisters called one in the polished curiously artificial tones of one accustomed to public speaking remember we are peaceable citizens there is to be no opposition our trust is in truth and justice not in violence our weapon is right not might stand aside and let them do their worst i will repay saith the law it was a bold paraphrase lost on all save that little knot of culture which said hear hear as if to the manner born the speech however though admirable proved somewhat superfluous the first sight of that mad assault coming round the corner sent the crowd composed for the most part of women and children scattering hither and thither like frightened sheep culture stood firm unwisely firm for a minute then a voice rose in english gentlemen discretion is better part of valournor is it permissible to foster or excite breach of peace we can speak with equal fluence and freedom from roof of house and they did the scene thus described sounds farcical there was not even a grain of comedy in it to the actors least of all to the plaster monkey on whose blue hide the sabres hacked fast above on the roof as on a hustings the new culture wielded the sword of the spirit below the older cult clinched argument by the sword of the flesh that night peace reigned in jehadpore young india in a body had gone to report wilful destruction of private property accompanied by violence to the deputy commissioner old india sat triumphant but thoughtful on the wooden bed while the troopers laughed and drank and made merry over the discomfiture of the blue monkey by the prophet cried rahmat ali i swear it had a look of old moneybags and why not seeing tis the father of sri hunuman haha but thou shouldst have seen the old mans face rissaldarsahib when he returned but half an hour gone and i told him we were but waiting leisure to burn his books and clear off old scores in the old way he wept and said twas none of his doing that he asked but peace as in the old days yea as he sat abegging on his haunches praying forgiveness he looked more like the blue monkey than ever khan azmutoollah khan let off a detonating roulade of arabic anathema as a te deum fetch him here rahmat i have a plan we old folk will settle it old ways the next morning the deputy commissioner the police officer and the doctor rode out in hot haste to the scene of what they were told had been a bloodthirsty riot at the village boundary they were met rather to their surprise by the usual escort the leader of the little band was more military than ever but there was an odd twinkle in his eye as he obeyed the curt order to fall behind and the hintwhich british majesty gave in the interests of law and orderthat his presence even there was undesirable hunuman sing and a friend who had remained to see fair play certainly seemed to think the troopers jingling and clashing along in close order very much in their way they edged their ponies here and there only to find themselves perpetually ridden over especially when at the head of the lane leading to the temple british majesty reined up short the troop behind turned to stone the horses on their haunches steady as rocks then there was a wild hustle the two ponies shot out in front where their owners managed to pull up flabbergasted at the sight which met their eyes how is this asked the deputy commissioner sternly i thought you said the blue monkey was destroyed and there it is in perfect condition there it was indubitablybright blue with a long tail curving over its legs from behind among the troopers came gentle grunts of disapproval that the ears of the huzoor should be assailed with such wanton lies blue monkeys indeed what quarrel had the faithful with blue monkeys khan azmutoollah khan sahib called british majesty what does this mean i was told you and your fellows had wantonly destroyed mool rajs monkey is this true the old man rode up from behind his martial dignity undimmed by the discipline he respected and understood i am no scholar myself huzoor he said saluting but i am a just man for all that i injure neither man nor beast wantonly let the huzoor ask the blue monkey if it or its master hath aught against me of thesehere he gave a contemptuous wave of his hand to the pleaders on their poniesi know naught nor did my fathers then he rode forward oh bunderjee speak for thyself and for thy master by the lord harry shrieked the policeman as the figure on the pedestal rose slowly and salaamed its old mool raj himself my lord faltered hunuman this is irrelevantthis is contempt of court peace oh hunuman and respect the voice of thy parent began the blue monkey then a roar of inextinguishable laughter played the mischief with majesty half an hour afterwards when chand kor in tears was washing the blue distemper off her lord and masters shrivelled limbs he repeated his injunction regarding the fifth commandment to his son who sat haranguing on liberty freedom public spirit equality fraternity and a host of other duties and privileges they are good my son he said but money is good also and peace best of all ask no more i am content and thou hast naught to do with it the temple is and the blue monkey was mineat least i was the blue monkey then hunuman sing swore that evening the deputy commissioner held a friendly inquiry and everybody shook hands all round excepting hunuman sing and his friend who left by ekka before the proceedings commenced vowing vengeance on all summary justice he was a fullblown pleader before the famous case of mool raj and a conch versus azmutoollah khan and others came up before the chief court of appeal on that occasion he argued most eloquently on various subjects for half an hour and was about to resume his seat covered with perspiration and honour when a voice from the body of the court cried respect thy parent o hunuman remember the things that are behind coiled up neatly on his chair was a blue tail and once more laughter played the mischief with majesty some people say that was why the appeal was dismissed anyhow it is certain that shortly afterwards hunuman set up as a pleader in another province so jehadpore brought up its troopers and paid or did not pay its debts in peace and when mool raj died the folk wagged their heads saying well he was not much to speak of as a man but he was a firstrate monkey shah sujahs mouse he had no name the village folk it is true called him baba but so they called all such as he nor did he ever show that he identified the word as anything more personal than the rest of the strange sounds to which he listened serenely as if he had no part or lot in them perhaps he was deaf perhaps he was dumb perhaps he was neither nobody knew nor for the matter of that cared he was one of shah sujahs mice no more no less in that lay the difference between him and other men a small difference in some ways in others illimitable to the level of the brows he was as fine a young fellow as you could meet of middle height with clean straight limbs above that nothingnothing but a skull narrowed to the contours of a newborn babes conical repulsive like a rats whence the name shah sujahs mouse the learned among us call such poor creatures microcephalous and talk glibly of joined sutures and osseous formation the natives of upper india have a different theory these mouselike ones belong to shah sujahs shrine because they are the firstlings of barren women made fruitful by the saints intercession therefore from their birth they bear the token of the mothers vow dedicating them to his service the seal is set on them from the beginning in mute witness to the truth whatever that truth may be whether as some say the newborn babes brought to be reared like samuel in the temple are born as other babies and the typical distortion produced by slow pressureas in lesser degree the coveted bomblike foreheads of the sindhi women are producedor whether as others hold a tradition favourable to the wealth of the shrine is kept up and additional gain assured by the secret exchange through agents all over india of the normal babies for that percentage of microcephalous infants which nature makesthis much is certain all children dedicated to shah sujah are his mice there are hundreds of them growing up at the shrine dying there and during the cold months spreading over the length and breadth of india begging with unvarying success of all women fruitful and unfruitful living meanwhile on the broken food given them but hoarding the money with an odd unconsciousness of all save that in some mysterious way it belongs to the saint then as the heat returns wandering back like a homing pigeon to the insignificant little shrine at gujrat which means so much to so many most of the mice are repulsive some are more or less deformed more or less idiotic making idiotic noises as they dawdle through the village alleys carrying their hollow gourds in their outstretched hands he was not repulsive and he made no sound of any kind whether from inability or from some lingering consciousness that his sounds would not be as those he heard no one knew in fact no one knew anything about him save that he was a mouse too naked to be dirty in that country of canals and tanks and seemingly quite content with a beggars staff and gourd as his only tie to this world here today gone tomorrow secure of a meal and of a sand blanket to sleep in if the nights were cold perhaps he had more sense than others of his kind perhaps the theory of deliberate distortion was true and his fine physique had struggled against it more successfully than some but all such things were idle speculations and there was nothing to be learned even from the big luminous eyes somewhat overprominent which looked at everything so serenely at the children running out to him with their mothers dole at the lean dogs following him in hopes of a scrap at the birds and squirrels watching for the crumbs he might leave behind down by some watercut his feet buried in the warm sand his naked body covered with the fairy garments made of sunbeams the very minnows and sticklebacks gathered round him in radiating stars expectant of bread cast on the water beneath the arching plumes of the datepalm thicketsplumes almost touching the surface and sending lanceolate shadows like the fishes themselves through the sliding water as the breeze stirred the leaflets it sounds idyllic viewed from our standpoint from his with that osseous formation of the learned closing in like an eggshell round the embryon god knows what it was until one day something happened sonny baba went amissing fuzli the ayah prone on her stomach beating her palms in the dust called god to witness that he had never been out of her sight except for one single minute when she took a pull at the gardeners pipe this was down in the taleri bagh where the english roses blossomed madly beneath the mangotrees and the wellwheel under the big peepultree had the oddest habit of creaking the first two bars of home sweet home as the slow zebus circled round and round mid pleasures and palaces then a silence save for the twitterings of birds and the soft thud of a peepul fig falling rifled to the ground until the bullocks were back to the old spot then it began again mid pleasures and palaces if there was no place like home sonny baba evidently did not think so anyhow he had left it had disappeared utterly in that luxuriant little world down by the big canal which was a maze of sunlight and shadow of thickets of sweet lime and groves of datepalms interspersed with patches of tomatoes and gourds and plantations of pomegranates laden with leaf and flower and fruitsuch ugly illhumoured fruit after all that beauty of blossom yes he was gone and the solitary bungalow a mile up the road nearer the city where the assistant commissioner in charge of the subdivision lived was in a lethargy of despair for a child means much when it has been waited for during long years every one from the highest to the lowest was away searching save only for the mother walking up and down the pretty drawingroom clasping her hands tighter and tighter as the hours went by and the ayah numb with grief and remorse in the dust outside it was growing late the sun sent its picture of the shishamtrees to decorate the blank side wall of the house the wilderness of wild petunia usurping the place of the fastyielding english annuals began to send out a faint perfume and sonny had been out all day alone under the hot sun among the treacherous canalcuts and the lurking snakessonny who since his birth three years ago had never known what it was to be alone thath way manth it was a sweet little voice full of liquid labials the ayah gave an inarticulate skirl of joy as she sprang from the dust leave me lalone layahith all light puth me down now pleath man a cry came from within a womans figure came flying to the veranda a child bubbling over with glee went flying to meet it and bury a little mop of golden curls in mothers dress o mummie mummie heth got quilth then after a time with dignity donth pleath them kitheth hurth and mummie donth loo hearheth got quilth oh lever tho many quilthhathnt loo man the man was shah sujahs mouse he stood as he had set the child down obedient to heaven knows what understanding of the little voice now he seemed to hear nothing as he looked serenely almost brightly at those three out of his large soft eyes ayah cried the mother clasping her darling tighter as by instinct whowhat is he ask himask him about it all not only the ayah but many others asked him fruitlesslypeople running in from the courthouse close by hearing the news of sonnys safe return wanderers coming in disheartened from the search finally sonnys father with an odd catch in his voice but there was no answer and the childs tongue went no further than loths and loths to eat an loths an loths of quilth loh said the ayah indignantly he is nothing but a mousea janowar give him a rupee mem sahiba and let him go if the huzoor indeed will not hang him for stealing my king of kings footnote janwar animal donth layahthem kitheth hurtho mummie donth loo know heth goth quilth lever tho many quilth cant you make out anything dear asked mummie almost aggrievedly it was dreadful to lose a whole long day of sonnys life no dearest replied her husband meekly aware of the offence no more than you can make out what quilth means except of course that the tahsildar tells me that hethe man or the mouse as you pleasehas been begging right away to the rivers meet and is now no doubt on his way back to the shrine possibly he will meet an agent at mooltan they are seldom later than this in calling in their itinerants he must have been in the gardens and either met the child after he had lost himself oror stole him that is all unless sonny remembers something when he is less excited at any rate he brought him back unharmed andandi should like to reward him reward him why of course we must reward him thinkonly think what might she paused able to think not to speak of it just so but how the tahsildar says he will put any money into his bag and never touch it andand it does seem mean to reward a man for saving your sons life with broken victuals there was no help for it however though just for the sake of appearances and proprieties they gave him five whole rupees for the bag he slipped them into it as if they had been pice took up his gourd and went away his beggars staff making little round holes in the dust as he walked down the petuniaedged path serenely as if nothing unusual had happened so that was an end of sonnys adventure for the time since ere he woke like a young bird at dawn next day the child seemed to have forgotten all about shah sujahs mouse but only for a time at first they thought it nothing but a touch of sun fever from being out all day which made the darling of their hearts so languid he was down in the heat a little later too than was perhaps quite wise but those holidays at the end of the month which would give father the chance of settling mother and son in the wee house among the himalayan pines and of getting a whiff of fresh air himself had been so tempting but a week after the doctor summoned from headquarters looked into their scared faces and said typhoid ere loath to leave them to this knowledge he had to ride back promising to arrange his work so as to be there as often as possible he stood talking in undertones to the native doctor in the veranda before mounting and the sound of their voices made the mother shiver it was soon after this that the little voice began o mummie he had quilthlovely lovely quilth whereth he gonethe quilthman i wanth to thee the quilth againdada will loo shend for the quilthman cant you send for himsomehow she had sonny in her arms and the heat of him struck through to her own breast yet she shivered again two days after when the cot was set out in the veranda for the sake of the cool evening air she bent over the child who lay more languid than suffering among the toys he liked to see even while he did not care to play with them sonny the quilthman has come dada has brought him whence is no matter the fiat had gone forth as fiats do go forth the order had been given to find and if possible to bring back one of shah sujahs mice who had wandered on northward through the villages they had found him and he had returned with them peaceably contentedly serenely thaths jolly sighed sonny now mummie lool thee the quilth too he wanted to be carried out in those brown arms as before and stretched his hands to shah sujahs mouse who stood just as he had stood before silent uncomprehending incomprehensibleexcept perhaps to sonny but they took him cot and all as he lay across the petunias and set him down under one of the great shishamtrees backed by palms and a widespreading banyan the air was dry and balmy he was as well there as elsewhere until the dew should begin to fall specths lool flighten them mummie quilths is flightful fings posing loo an dada an layah thits light awaylight away so they sat right away over the petunias once more upon the veranda steps and two pairs of strained anxious eyes looked at the group under the trees the third pair looked also doubtfully it was an odd sight certainly the childs soft curls on the pillow his flushed cheek seen sidewise his little hot hands clasped round the bars of the cot beside him on the grass like a bronze statue shah sujahs mouse now manth if loo pleath murmured sonny and as before he seemed obedient to the liquid voice a strange sound indeed not a cry not a whistle more like the croon of wind through tall tigergrass scarcely audible and yet a hush fell on the trees as if they stopped to listen jack the foxterrier cocked his ears a horse neighed from the stables then came a rustle as of leaves i know whispered mummie touching dada on the arm he means squirrels how stupid of me look along the branches they came circling shyly down the trunks now with a swift patter now hanging splayed against the bark petrified by curious timidity odd little mortals these with the mark of great rams fingers on their shining coats and barred tails abristle soft little mortals not much bigger than a mouse their round ears cocked their bright eyes watchful nearer and nearer by fits and starts hopping from distant trees through the short grass as through a thicket while the croon went on and sonnys eyes grew heavy with sheer satisfaction lovely lovely quilthgo on pleath manth nearer and nearer a dozen or more sitting up with the scattered crumbs in their odd little fingers dainty over the feast nibbling a bit here and a bit there and growing fearless climbing on to the bronze limbs looking into the dark serene eyes sonnys grew heavier and heavier i think he is asleep said dada indistinctly through a lump in his throat but mummie could not speak at all dew fallin mem sahiba remarked the ayah in a dissatisfied tone time sonny baba leave janowars alone it was a slow fever as it often is with the little ones in india and every day for many days sonny would rouse himself when the sun left the air cooler and ask for his quilth it will not hurt him said the doctor who looked graver at each visit our best chance is to keep him going somehow if you were on the railway id risk all and have him in the hills tomorrow but that long dhooli journeyit is not to be thought of we must keep him goingkeep hold on life as best we can so they used to carry him out under the trees to the quilth and shah sujahs mouse and some sort of a comprehension seemed to come to the janowars as the ayah called them scornfully of what was required of them for day by day the crumbs were scattered nearer the cot and day by day the timid courage grew into some new venture rousing a languid smile from sonny lovely lovely quilth he would say as the bright eyes looked at him knowingly and the patter patter of the little feet came nearer but the sheer content came quicker and he slept sooner and sooner until one day when they were racing over the cot and playing gymnastics with the bars he made up his mind that there could be nothing more to wake for and fell asleep once and for all take her away at once said the doctor as in the early dawn they drove back without the little coffin on the back seat of the dogcart from the graveyard where dada had read the service without a break in his voice there was no lump in his throat now nothing but an angry despair in his heart take her away i telegraphed for you to the commissioner last night that will give you three days then furlough privilege urgent privateanything she must not come back till the baby is born and leave the ayah behindthey will get talking of the child that evening when the servants were being paid off and certificates to character written while the dhoolies waited in the shade where sonnys cot had stood the day before the ayah whimpering but indignant asked what was to be done about the janowar ill look after that said the doctor kindly seeing dadas look five rupees i suppose and the tahsildar to have him escorted so far on his way north to the shrine tis time he were getting back undoubtedly even the last few days had brought the heat the roses down in the taleri gardens had dried to potpourri as they grew smelling almost sweeter than ever the mangoes grew larger and larger and the green parrots clung to them eating the pulp as it ripened that was when the gardeners were away turfing a grave in the little enclosure opening out of the garden and planting red and white quamoclit to twine up a wooden cross it did not take long for the grave was small so they came back to frighten the parrots leaving it to take care of itself for the rains came early that year and after a time there was no need for watering so much rain that three months after when dada back from leave walked through the garden at sunsetting many of the mangotrees were ankledeep in water and a second crop of roses nodded at their own reflection in the still pools but the graveyard stood purposely on higher ground and its brick wall was backed by a perfect thicket of datepalms stretching away to the low sandhills save on the side marching with the garden there oleanders and roses and elephant creeper massed themselves into a hedge and clambered over the arched gateway where dada paused the doctor was there too for fever comes with heavy rain and the outlying hospitals needed constant inspection as the gate swung open they paused again not at the sight within but at a sound they seemed to recognize it was a shady spot to begin with great branches swept over it from the garden and then in the far corner a huge peepul stood quivering its silverlined leaves there lay the little grave solitary in its square of grass for the place was divided into four by two narrow gravel walks ending abruptly at the walls two other graves claimed other squares the fourth lay vacant it seemed as if when that was occupied the shady spot would refuse another tenant yet there were others even now whos that cried the doctor sharply it was shah sujahs mouse he sate propped against the peepultree and over the grass and the cross of quamoclits the squirrels were chasing each other and playing pranks with the crumbs they were scarcely hungry enough to eat while the other janowar looked at them out of hollow serene eyes he shifted his gaze to the newcomers but did not rise he could not good god muttered the doctor kneeling down beside him the man is a skeleton and burning with fever how the mischief well the first thing is to get him moved to hospital when dada came back with a string bed and four coolies impressed from the garden he found the doctor looking suspiciously at the crumbs at a piece of doughcake and a bag of money there were ten whole rupees in it besides odd coins the poor beggar seems starved and yet he had this andhe was feeding the squirrels theres something deuced odd about it all odd but simple especially in the ayahs eyes master having given orders for the janowar to go the police had naturally taken him away he had come back again and beggednaturally when the mem sahiba had given him sweet rice every day but she had given nothing nothing at all except information to the police then they had taken him away again miles and miles quite close to the highroad to the shrine and had bidden him to go home even a janowar could have found his way had he chosen but the obstinate animal had come back after the sweet rice so then every one had been told not to give the disobedient one anything to eat indeed it was past time for alms to shah sujahs mice they should have been back at the shrine with their earnings to linger was sacrilege nothing less especially when the huzoor had said he was not wanted any longer but instead of going when he was starved out as every one imagined he must have hidden in the damp garden and got fever as to what he was doing on the little king of kings grave that was mysterious perhaps now the master might believe that janowars were not safe round a sick chuprao you fool shouted dada as the ayah sidled away still indignant the two men sat and looked at each other footnote hold your tongue im afraid its no use said the doctor starvation and fever are ill companions but ill stay over tomorrow and see what i can do it is as much my fault as yours if any one is to blame but the doctor being orthodox paused when they went down on the following evening to see the patient in hospital they found the native assistant volubly apologetic he had seemed so content not to say weak that they had left him alone while busy over an accident half an hour ago they had missed him from his cot doubtless delirium had supervened with acerbation of fever but since peons were out in all directions by the blessing of god come on doctor said dada impatiently interrupting the flow of words he was there face down on the grass and the squirrels were playing over his dead body and searching for crumbs no said dada when the coolies came with a string bed again bring a spade or two im going to bury him here the doctor having religious views looked doubtful ii wonder if it is consecrated ground i hope to god it is said dada fervently as they lingered at the gate when the work was over a squirrel hung head downward on the peepultrunk eying the newturned earth suspiciously then another with bushy tail erect came hopping fearlessly over the grass cher ipa pippippip it was a challenge the next moment they were chasing each other over the cross of quamoclits dada closed the gate softly lovely lovely quilth he murmured to himself the lump had come back to his throat and the doctor gave something between a laugh and a sob but they neither of them said anything about the other janowar perhaps because there was a difficulty in finding an epithet to suit shah sujahs mouse suttu i a grove of datepalms each cluster of carved stems set in its feathery crown and base separated from its neighbours by sandy spaces where the snakes sunned themselves right in the wayfarers path finding few victims however for the karait stretched out like a blue whiplash curved back to the prickly cover at the distant step and though the duskcoloured vipers tied in truelovers knots held their ground their evil temper gave warning of their presence as scale rustled on scale in the angry sliding of the watchful coil day and night the sweeping fringes overhead swayed softly even when no breath stirred the tangle below but now when the coming of dawn sent that curious whisper of wind through the world as if warning it of what the sun may disclose the leaves tossed their long arms wildly a stretch of level land curved inward to the palmgrove outward till it merged on the village common with its greyspined caperbushes set with coral buds in the distance shadowy in the half light was a native town flatroofed against the sky close at hand an open grave with a man and woman standing beside it a queer couple the old man dwarfed to distortion grotesquely ugly the woman young straight as a palm supremely handsome lo they come shahbash she said in a bold mellow voice which fitted her appearance as she shaded her eyes with her hand the coarse madder veil she wore fell from her broad shoulders as if cut in stone wah illah thou hast sight to boast of mother suttu replied her companion she might have been his daughter in age but he used the title of respect due to all decent women from one not of their own blood yea tis true she echoed carelessly the potters hand slipped not when he made me i have naught to bring against him it was perhaps a heartless truism considering her company but then shahbash was bucklered against bitter thoughts by an ingenious theory accounting for his own ill looks a fairy he held had fallen in love with him as a babe when as might be augured from his name which meant well done bravo he must have been possessed of extraordinary beauty her jealous determination to keep his perfections to herself had attained its object in roundabout fashion by preventing the eyes of others seeing him as he really was hence the distortion lay with them i would thine eyes were as sharp for the future as they are for the present he said thoughtfully leaning on his adzelike shovel twere better they were sharp enough to see through dust she answered smiling broadly into the grave at her feet so thou didst not find it after all shahbash not a cowrie not a dumri and i swear tis into the tenth dozen of graves i have dugwith texts of the holy koran pouring from me the while without stint good sound texts hard as melted solder on a bodys teeth and to no good except to pave a blessed bed for another sinner for they pay worse and worse mai suttu when old feroz shah buried his son last week he left but a rupees worth of clothes on the corpse for perquisite look you if i take not the very windingsheet which decency would leave een to the dead thou and the holy saint yonder will starveto say naught of servant shahbash who needs muscle to sow men in this hard soil he let his shovel fall on the hard ground to show how it echoed to the clang suttu laughed if dead men do not pay there are the dates still they will ripen ere long aye but how long can they be kept if the saint dies without speaking the others will find their tongues a woman needs goldor a man thou wilt have neither unless thou wilt give up the religious vow and marry the kazis son he is willing suttu laughed so are others that be not pockmarked and one eye to boot tobah and thou virtuous and a widow lo he is a man and beauty is not safe for us was not i shahbash the handsomest she interrupted him remorselessly tis safe for me anyhow the grandfather may rouse any day and tell me where the gold is hidden once it is found none will covet the graveyard shahbash wrinkled his hideous face to an appalling frown god knows if not then it is a case of digging graves all my life till i get overscant of breath for texts and mattock together if only the sickness would come twould give more chance for the fox of a fatherinlaw will be claiming shares of treasure with thee if i dig aught but graves lo mai suttu i tell thee tis ghoullike work i watch the old folk in the village and my fingers itch to give them a blessed bed in deen alis yard tis destroying my soul thou must marry or i am damned sure the fairy will make thee a paradise anywhere laughed suttu lo they come is all prepared alms or no alms deen alis bed must be ready for the faithful tis in the bond she spoke with a grave dignity quite apart from her previous manner would god they had put the alms in the bond likewise grumbled the dwarf as he slid into the shallow grave to sweep some loosened soil from the niche hollowed in the hard ground to one side for the uncoffined tenant then he swung himself out again by his brawny arms and strained his shortsighted eyes toward the advancing procession tis well he muttered as a sudden braying of shawms beating of drums and skirling of songs rent the still dawn at least they remember that the burying of the old is as a bridal sure it may be better than i feared and they will not send the decent patriarch back to his friends half naked it was an odd funeral the bier covered by a tissuepaper canopy swayed as it was borne shoulderhigh at a slow trot the crowd laughed and sang the streamers fluttered flying round that still muslinswathed form bound with tinsel only suttu seemed in keeping with it as she stood forward welcoming it to deen alis bed but the next instant as she stepped aside to let it pass a malicious look of amusement was on her face as she returned the greeting of a pockmarked man with one eye then her role of hostess being over she walked away to the dategrove followed by admiring eyes for suttu the fakeerni if somewhat outrageous was distinctly attractive that made her vow of celibacy all the more unnatural she sat down on the edge of a back channel of the river which after creeping tortuously in a deep narrow bed expanded here during the rains to a broad shallow lake dotted by clumps of pillared palms beneath whose fringed crowns great bunches of fruit were ripening fast each islet was reflected so clearly in the water that it needed sharp eyes to see where reality ended and unreality began here and there showing where the perennial pools lay beneath the temporary flood stretched a green carpet of lotusleaves where the flowers rose in varying height the buds still resting on the water the fullblown flowers flaunting between them and the macelike stems on which the hidden jewel in the lotus stood disclosed while the fallen petals floated like shells on the water or lay piled up in little pink heaps on the green carpet a faint scent as of bitter almonds perfumed the breeze which now and again ruffled the lake and slid a fresh gift of rolling sparkling water diamonds into the leafcups beyond this was a golden sunrise cloudless serene suttu seated on the edge of grass which grew just as far as the moisture filtered through the sand and no farther nodded at the scene approvingly the potter had made no mistake here either she liked it liked her own freedom purchased by an easy vow the idea of giving it up in favour of another ten years or more of marriage in a stifling city quarter was absurd a kingfisher flashed down into the water like a sapphire and her quick eyes followed it shahbash she cried gleefully as the bird came up with a bar of silver in its purple bill tis not shahbash said a voice behind her tis i come to ask she leaped to her feet confronting the kazis son in real wrath so will not even death keep thy mind from marriage why hast crept here to see me alone tis not decentfar worse tis not even pleasant have i not told theeaye and othersthat i am a pious widow she drew a corner of her veil across her eyes and hid the suggestion of a smile under the semblance of tears a pious widow vowed to the sonless shrine of my ancestors the kazis son drew a step nearer thou art too young and too well favoured for a religious every one says so he began the lord looks not at beauty mir sahib retorted suttu gravely and tis well for some of us that it is so a sharp weapon is no weapon against enemies and thou hast enemies my house would protect you think i am the kazis son lo why should i forget my lords merit smiled suttu sweetly he has not so many he bit his lip repartee of that sort he knew but not from the lips of reputable women the whole affair had the intoxication of an intrigue and its defiance of conventionalities set his pulses throbbing listen o suttu he said curbing his passion hussan thy dead husbands father will claim the land when the saint dies and god knows how the case may go against a woman marry me and i will gain it were thy fatherinlaw fifty times over the village accountant hast heard the saying only the kazi can fight the putwari lo if i came to thy house there would be fighting enow to fill thy stomach without going to a neighbour she drew the coarse veil which she had slipped from her head back to its place with widespread arms as she spoke and the action displayed the full vigour of her finely moulded form he cursed her bigness and boldness inwardly but schooled himself to another and more tender appeal why not o suttu lo i am rich i am young ii lie awake o nights thinking of it yea i swear it i get no good from my food i love you if i died the very houris in paradise would not tempt me but i would make thy grave gladly mir sahib and then may be thou wouldst find rest it was too much he seized her by the wrist and glared at her every evil instinct roused to fury then i will buy thee thy fatherinlaw has the right for the saint is half dead already listen i will buy thee to be my slave what dost say now that even slaves have naught to do with pockmarks and one eye her free right hand came down on one cheek with a resounding slap making him stagger her left thus released followed suit on the other go she cried or i will make shahbash yonder strangle thee with his monkey arms go and remember that suttu the fakeerni hath slapped thee in the face the kazis son entangled in the trail of his turban which had fallen off caught sight of the gravedigger within call and felt that his chance was over he stalked away trying to look dignified as he wound his headdress on again but conscious of a suppressed titter behind him making him grind his teeth and swear vengeance when he had gone suttu sat down again on the grass and slipped her hands into the cool water they tingled unpleasantly yonder beans look ripe she murmured and they would eke out a meal five minutes after her sleek black head was rising and falling her round arms gleaming in the overhead stroke which sent her straight to a lilyfield a couple of moorhens fled leaving a rippling streak of silver behind them as she entered the leaf carpet it took in great waves of water over the edgeswaves which broke into dewdrops that ran races with each other for first place in the leafy hollows the dragonflies darted around her timid but persistent and myriads of tiny insects disturbed from the sweet stems rose in clouds attracting the swift swooping of the bronzewinged flycatchers shabash was waiting for her on the bank as she came back wading her arms full of blown lotus her track marked by drifting petals as she approached he flung a few yards of tinsel and muslin on the ground in extravagant theatrical disgust that is all he cried by the faith of my fathers six ells of false tinsel and four of twopenny muslin for digging a grave in kunker soil god and his prophet why didst not send them to be born hindus then twould have taken ten rupees of firewood to save them from being burned in hell and last night look you i cut a sleeping snake in two as i dug and both ends fell at my toes ari a riddle indeed in the dark which be head and which be tail and i am to go through such moments for six ells of tinsel and four of such muslin no mai suttu tis the kazis son or starvation footnote nodulated limestone suttu smiled as she stooped to wring the water from her scant petticoat not so shahbash the kazis son doth not like me and lotusbeans are good till the dates ripen then the gold it may be in the next grave he scratched his thick grey hair on which he wore no turban doubtfully god knows every full moon i stretch my sheet on the ground and dance to please my fairy then when i fall into the trance i ask the old question where is deen alis gold but there is no answer in the morning now if the fairy cannot tell suttu laughed dost not may be forget the answer the black bottle steals thy brains tis not the bottle muttered shahbash sulkily as he gathered up his perquisites tis the fairy steals my brains for sure there be not rum enough in it nowadays so they walked home to the mosquelike tomb in the dategrove she with her sheaf of lotus he with his shovel and shroud ii suttus greatgreatgrandfather had been a saint of the first watera doubledistilled aboveproof performer of miracles his holiness being strong enough to stand two generations of dilution and still leave spiritual distinction to his descendants yet the difference in the saintship of deen ali the original and inam ali the present incumbent of the shrine lay more in their surroundings than in themselves the former according to tradition had lived for ten years in a trance oblivious of all save the touch of a certain prayercarpet on his feet a carpet brought from holy mecca which had been usedagain according to traditionby the prophet himself then sight speech action were restored to deen ali for a space and while earth and sky wore the glorious apparel of sunrise and sunset his soul came back in praise and prayer inam ali inherited the trance but folk called it paralysis and the death in life yielded to carnal not spiritual food doubtless physiologically it was quite as wonderful that twice a day regularly as clockwork the halfdead organism should accept nourishment practically it was not so impressive but other things had changed too in the seventyandodd years since deen ali had planted the arabian datestones he had also brought back from holy mecca in the land granted to his saintship curious holdings these burdened at times by quaint conditions in return for official canonization for in those days saintship paid in this case the offerings of the faithful had taken visible shape in the bluetiled tomb where deen alis body lay under a stucco rolypoly twelve feet long whether this length awarded to saintly tombs which contrasts so oddly with the curtness of those allowed to the laity has reference to the extent of piety or whether some mohammedan exemplar of old really was of unusual stature is a moot point certain it is that in upper india as elsewhere the unco guid are tedious even when at rest the bluegreen dome of the saints tomb therefore soared up into the greengrey plumes of the palms as a record of past munificence and round it the greenblue parrots circled and swept till the wearied eye sought relief in the gold clusters of dates above and the gold sand below gold if report said true golden indeed with other records of munificence but where that secret lay hid in inam alis paralyzed brain he must have known for despite the slackness of modern offerings there had never been any want in the mud hovel hitched on to the tomb until suttu coming in one evening with her veil full of dates had found the old man quite unconscious on the saints high wooden bed which still stood over the grave under the dome the news thrilled the adjoining township with brief enthusiasm then a bustling hindu assistant surgeon got wind of the case and sanctity vanished before science from that day several years past matters had gone from bad to worse a railway appeared reducing offerings to the lowest ebb for as shahbash declared with mingled truth and tears the pilgrims counted their thirdclass return tickets as offerings to the shrine and the traffic department charged dead against charity in the extortionate fares for sheep goats and fowls on the other hand the railway had certainly brought cholera three years in successionan unheardof eventand that had increased the chances of finding the gold in the digging of gravesgraves however for which the perquisites lessened month by month that was due to the village accountants spite spite born of family matters which went back to the time when suttu was born inam ali briefly had lived for six months in hopes that a posthumous child of his only son would be an heir to the saintship and in his first disappointment had been only too glad to get rid of mother and child by the formers marriage to the accountant and the latters betrothal to her stepfathers son after a time however he had bought the child back with bribes to keep him company and thereinafter had spent years in spoiling her consequently when the inevitable fulfilment of the betrothal came round suttu was dragged off to zenana life struggling like a wild animal she failed however to fulfil her duty of bringing a son to inherit through her the datepalms and the hidden treasure and after one baby born when she was thirteen ceased its feeble efforts to live she settled downwell as a leopardess might settle in its cage ten years after she paid her first visit to the cemetery in order to cool her newly buried husbands grave with decorous tears she went there calmly and then as calmly refused to return she had made up her mind to become a religious she said now this fell in with both the old mans and her fatherinlaws views the former was willing as before to pay for her companionship and the latter with an eye to a future when he should have suttu entirely under his control thought it as well she should keep in with her grandfather and the hidden treasure so a religious she became somewhat to the scandal of the neighbourhood then came the paralysis leaving hussan minus his monthly payment and quite uncertain whether suttu said truth when she denied all knowledge of the hoard in truth the position was awkward the saint might recover speech and then if he found that suttu had been violently used he might resent it and make away with the treasure if however by starving her out suttu could be induced to break her vow and marry hussan could no doubt get himself appointed guardian of the shrine and so have an opportunity of searching where he chose the task was not a difficult one since the people around were easily led to believe that her ways and works were anything but what a fakeernis should be so the offerings grew less and less the complaints of mischance or neglect more frequent yet still suttu held her head jauntily and laughed when of an evening she met her fatherinlaw prowling around the graveyard it had a fascination for him and often when his feet were not there his finger was tracing its outline on the village map there within that little space lay the treasure and a horrible conjunction of a halfdead old man and a very much alive young woman prevented him from getting hold of it the thought kept him from sleeping when there had been a death in the village and he knew shahbash was digging and delving and when he slept he dreamed that the old saint sat up and spoke but that no one could hear a word he said he did not know that suttu and her henchman had gone the crucial length of spreading the holy carpet meccaways and setting the old saints feet upon it more than once at sunrising and sunsetting in vain the miracle would not work for gold so they had lifted him back again to the high wooden bed shahbash was really losing his temper over his part of the business lotusbeans for breakfast were all very well but you could not dig graves on lotusbeans besides the black bottle was always empty lo mai i grow thin he grumbled then the fairy will cease to care for me and that is an end women are not to be trusted as he set to work on a babys grave he went on grumbling and muttering to himself he had been her fathers fosterbrother and she was the apple of his eye for all that he must eat some day her enemy would tempt him to treason when he ached with hunger and who could be faithful on an empty stomach he blubbered at the thought of his own betrayal thus on the evening of the day when suttu slapped the kazis son matters were approaching a crisis all round even hussan prowling about the graveyard in the vague disquiet which beset him after every fresh excavation of the soil made up his mind to a bolder game as he picked his way through the short mud mounds a sort of thrill shot up his legs at the thought that he might be treading on gold for the hope of buried treasure takes possession of men body and soul he found no one in the reed thatchedhut but a savory smell of curried beans from the fireplace showed that its mistress would soon be back to supper so he went over to the tomb where the saint lay on the wooden bed under the dome in which the faint breathing of the old man swelled to a murmuring echo like a swarm of bees hussan stood beside the bed full of rage malice and greed if he could only crack that bald old noddle and pick out the kernel suddenly the thought came that perhaps nowthis moment or the nextwas the one appointed from all eternity in which speech would return and he stood petrified by expectation perhaps a call might rouse the sleeping soul he started as his own hoarse whisper grew to a roar in the echoing dome that should wake the dead then as the sound died ineffectually to silence the desire to crack the old mans skull at all costs returned the kernel might take care of itself something of this must have showed in his face for suttu coming in behind him passed softly to the bed and raised a menacing hand only for an instant then she sat down on the edge and laughed well did he tell you a brutal question for the answer would be dinned into his ears by the echo and he knew it all too well already come outside daughter he said with a curse one cannot hear ones self speak in this chattering place they sat down on the topmost step of the low flight leading to the tomb the heat of the sun was over but a scorching air struck up from the bricks making suttu fan herself with the corner of her veil no wonder men coveted her thought her companion eying her askance she grew handsomer every day suttu he began taking the plunge boldly peace is better than war give me half the gold and i am content let it stay in the family suttu whose familymine or thine she asked scornfully tis the same lo is not murghub thy brother since he is thy mothers son though he be but a poor natural lay not that to her charge retorted suttu flippantly she made no mistake in me hussan coughed down his impatience well well i care not i came not to chop words it is the gold suttu i mean to have some of it what gold i know of none i have seen none then have i see he felt in an innermost pocket and showed her lying in his palm a broad goldpiece they make not such pieces nowadays where that came from there are more she turned it over and over in her long brown fingers aye tis old didst steal it from him then a backward toss of the head indicated her meaning nay he gave it wherefore for thee suttu when thou wast a child give it me back stop what dost thou this she cried shrilly seizing his clutching hand by the wrist in a grasp firm as a mans while in sheer bravado she held the coin high above her head i will give it back to the old man and see what he thinks of thee for keeping it what wouldst fight for one goldpiece fool and lose the chance of lakhs by my death yea yea i know thou art not my heir in death though thou mayst have hold on me alive hands off or i will fight too and shahbash comes to his supper he is a devil when hungry her tone was still mocking the grasp on his wrist firm but not straining her temper in control as yet but she meant mischief if mischief was to be and for the life of him hussan could not help admiring her thou art a shedevil he said sulkilya shedevil and no woman i bore a son to your son anyhow she retorted quickly and her frown warned him that he had gone too far if thou wilt but listen not till i have laid this offering in the saints hand she interrupted imperially with a gesture of disdain hussan kicked his heels savagely as she marched over the platform and entered the tomb he could see her stoop and lay the coin in the indifferent palm resting beside the still body she came back much the better for this seriocomic interlude for her dramatic instincts were strong and she played her part of independence vigorously well she began quite graciously settling herself down on the step beside her fatherinlaw if peace be better than war what price hath peace the accountant leaned over to her eagerly halveshalves in everything save liberty that is all thine own for an instant she felt tempted then her natural waywardness returned and if i claim the whole war and that to a woman without gold she gave an irritating chuckle bah it may come any day shahbash may find it the old man may speak the very possibility of her words being true roused his anger speak he will never speak again a rattle behind made them both turn with the alertness of those who live among snakes suttu was on her feet in a second without a cry the accountant let loose a yell of dismay and in his recoil rolled back a step or two where he lay clutching at the bricks wildly for the old saint was sitting up on his bed waggling his bald head over the coin he could not have looked more ghastly had he risen from the dead the great moment was upon them this thought came first to both spectators and they were too uncultured to conceal it tell us where cried suttu as she stood yea tell us ere you die echoed the accountant as he lay not a very warm welcome back to life but the old man though he raised his head at the cry understood nothing the dim eyes passed the covetous faces and rested on the familiar landscape darkening beyond the door of his tomb then the nerveless hand slipped from its restingplace on his kneeslipped slipped till with a clink and a roll and a rattle given back a thousandfold by the dome the coin fell upon the stone floor gone he whispered goneyea gone forever but the look of life in his face had carried suttu back to her childhood and her arms were already round the failing figure as she turned such fierce forbidding on her companion that he shrank back silent it is the last chance he whispered after a time i care not suddenly the bald head fell back on suttus breast the chance was over they sat all through the night waiting for a sign and none came before the dawn broke the old saint and his secret had gone together into the darkness hussan as he walked cityward felt that fate had done him a good as well as an ill turn he had made no compact with suttu and now that the grandfather was out of the way he could sue for guardianship at once and unmask a battery he had been keeping in reserve and shahbash disconsolate over the cold curry he had actually forgotten to eat in the hope of hearing his old master speak once more made gruesome faces over his coming task the gold for sure was not hidden under deen alis rolypoly so he would have to find a restingplace in it for the last incumbent without greed of gain to beguile his labour only suttu did not think of the future but of the past when the old man had been her willing slave iii the dates were ripe great drooping bunches of them hung under the swaying palmleavesrosepink and purpleblack yellow and brown manytinted like some rare agate shahbash gorged himself on the sicklysweet fruit and every one far and near grew visibly fatter but deen alis arabian dates were too valuable for home consumption and suttu only awaited the new moon in order to summon the pluckers and driers to prepare the fruit for market shahbash with a sigh at the shortness of opportunity ate all the more and thought of little else yet the four weeks since the saints death had not been uneventful the kazis son and the accountant had joined issue in their desire to see suttu worsted as yet however there had been no overt act to begin with the native of india does nothing in a hurry in addition none gauges better than he the indisputable advantage of an old lie over a new one it is like port wine depositing a crust for itself out of its own sediment finally even a false claim acquires dignity by being preferred deliberately moderately all these considerations had coincided towards inactionas yet but a day or two before the new moon matters changed suttu coming at dawn from her hut saw a sight which literally took her breath away three of the tallest stems in the nearest clump of palms were swaying under the weight of men clinging to them by clamps and a rope passed round their waists below the freshly gathered fruit lay in heaps under the fingers of women busy in sorting it and carrying it in baskets to a drying enclosure already fenced in by hedges of plaited leaves in a word datepicking was in full swing had she by chance given the orders in her sleep incredulous of her own sight she roused shahbash who still lay snoring on the raised platform of the tomb he was on his feet in a moment and shouting thieves loudly as the only explanation swung himself down like a monkey and ran gesticulating with windmill arms towards the trees his ugliness even when familiar was phenomenal seen by the datepickers who as usual were strangers employed by a big contractor it appeared supernatural and the women taking him to be nothing more nor less than the demon in charge of the grove flung down their baskets and fled screaming the men would doubtless have followed their example had it been possible but rather than run the gantlet of the dancing yelling creature below they dug their clamps tighter and held on in mortal terror of what would happen next suttus more tardy appearance led to an explanation from which it appeared that the pickers had been sent by a contractor who had formally bought the crop from one hussan the accountant leave them to me mai suttu shrieked shahbash in an ecstasy of rage over this calm appropriation lo i will give them a crop of blows if they come down if not let them starve and drop like bats in the cold i am in no hurry he squatted himself on the matting and helped himself to the gathered dates with both hands but suttu saw further than the immediate present and knew a protest must be raised and that quickly she turned at once to that confidence in the power of personal appeal which thank heaven still lingers in india despite western attempts to strangle it with red tape and smother it with sealingwax yea watch thou she cried while i go to the big sahibs house and cry for justice he listens to the poor wah wah assented the clingers but see us safe first o mother let them be said shahbash confidentially else they may make away with the dates they have picked lo they are safer there till the police come so there they clung while the fakeerni her indignation increasing at every swinging stride made her way to the deputycommissioners bungalow he was a small fair english lad put in chargewith many instructions to telegraph to headquarters if he saw signs of the millennium or another mutinyduring the absence on three weeks leave of a senior man he was just mounting his polo pony in order to keep his hand in by chivying a ball round a stick when wronged womanhood appeared and flung out a pair of remarkably beautiful arms for justice perhaps the fact that the complainant was superbly handsome and struck a most impressive attitude had something to do with the readiness with which he turned to the redcoated orderlies for a translation of her patois petition tis suttu the fakeerni and she comes to tell the protector of the poor that contractors are feloniously picking her dates send and stop em and andwhat the deuce is the right thing to do oh yes tell the police to report as usual then as he rode off he nodded affably to suttu take comfort mother ill see to it he had been swished at harrow quite an incredibly short time before but he did the part of providence neatly while men for whom he had fagged were enjoying the inestimable privilege of sitting on a vestryor the knifeboard of an omnibus conveying them citywards to act as copyingmachines for the term of their natural lives suttus apparent triumph however dwindled in shahbashs eyes to ignominious defeat when the police refused permission for any one to pick the dates until the petition of hussan for the land on behalf of his son murghub should be decided what has that idiot to do with my land cried the fakeerni indignantly lo there is no drop of saints blood in him he is of the second marriage the policeman sniggered i know not mother but this i hear that hussan saith otherwise and the kazi is with him and births and marriages are ticklish things to date if the kazi be not friendly suttus heart throbbed if the kazi were indeed her only refuge she might have to face the storm in the open o thou with the yellow trousers on thy legs and wisdom in head and heart moaned shahbash dost mean that these datesdeen alis famous datesare to be food for parrots while i he sat in the sand clasping his stomach rocking backwards and forwards a ludicrous spectacle of woe yet there was tragedy in the comedy that evening when supper consisted of a few milletcakes and a tray of watery piluberries which suttu had gathered from the jungles he looked at the ripe dates overhead and felt that the hour of apostasy had come after the barmecidal feast he took his mattock and went to the graveyardnot to dig but solemnly to consider which of suttus two enemies should have his services dawn found him returning from the kazis house with the black bottle full of rum and the remains of a perfect feast of bakkar khana tied up in a handkerchiefboth of which he hid carefully all that day he did nothing but vaunt the delights of a sheltered home combined with rich food especially to a womanmore especially to a woman who had nothing to eat but piluberries and millet cakes suttu smiled at him indulgently lo god did not make me all stomach she said i eat the air and the sunshine and i like to see the parrot people and the squirrel people eat my dates even if i cant shahbash gave a rumble of despair and bolstered up his uneasy conscience by telling himself such views were unnatural accursed is a grave ordered asked suttu in surprise when that evening after supper the dwarf shouldered his mattock who is dead the saddlers son leastways he was so nigh his end today that his people gave me warning it might be wanted and like as not they would eat oaths had it been bespoke in form for they are keen to quarrel aye aye if lies were satisfying my belly wouldnt be empty he disappeared into the soft balmy darkness grumbling and mutteringto come back circuitously to the hidingplace of the black bottle he would need that for consolation aye for forgetfulness before midnight brought the bribed watchmen to guard the dategrove then sooner or later after that some ones cries well why not suttu would not be the first woman who had been carried off to a rich marriage and had lived to tell the tale cheerfully still the thought of those cries when the kazi and his friends came was disturbing shahbash took a great pull at the bottle it would bring the fairy and the fairy was unfailing consolation meanwhile suttu sat on the steps of the tomb too much disturbed by this outrageous claim of hussans for sleep the grounds which he would put forward were easy to guess he and the kazi would postdate the second marriage and antedate murghub the idiots birth so as to make him out her full brother besides they had money for evidence she had none and the neighbours were unfriendly her only help lay in the lord and that she knew had nothing to do with a court of justice still it was as well to omit nothing which might be of use so she brought out the trestleshaped stool on which her grandfathers copy of the koran lay and began to chant an additional chapter of holy writ as a kind of bribe to favour as she rocked herself backward and forward her lips busy with the long rhythm in which the unknown words quite lost all identity her mind was busy over the time when she had learned it all with tears and trouble from the saint stern on this one point how fond he had been of divinationsand suttu paused in the middle of a pious apothegm to recollections of her grandfather compiling datenames for his neighboursnames that is to say which by the values of the composing letters would give the date of birth what if her own name sutara begum was one of these and the idiots also that would be proof indeed perhaps shahbash she had started to her feet when she remembered her chapter in some trepidation since half a bribe was no bribe she would just go on chanting till shahbash came home it could do no harm and might do good her round full voice echoed back from the tomb and out into the datepalms wah if she were really after all a pious one and not a bad walker said one of the watchers to the other his companion clucked a denial thchu tis likely she knows the kazi is to be here tonight that is womans way suttu chanted and chanted till she grew hoarse then she stood up and listened the night was still and silent not even the distant thud of the mattock so shahbash must be on his way back she waited with the little oillamp in her hand eager for her question then impatience gained the mastery and still with the oilcresset in her handfor the new moon gave little light and snakes were commonshe set off swiftly through the palms towards the cemetery shahbash she cried but nothing stirred or answered as she picked her way through the short graves suddenly she was brought up sharply by something at her feetsomething she had deemed another grave it was the dwarf stretched fast asleep on a white sheet his grey hair was twined with jasmine blossoms and a black bottle lay empty by his side he had been dancing to amuse his fairy that was no uncommon affair but whence had he got the inspiration and the greasy remnants of a feast which the light of the lamp disclosed what villainy had he been bribed to commit something she felt sure even if it were nothing more serious than a failure to fulfil the duties of her freehold by having deen alis bed ready for the saddlers son if it were that she seized the shovel and swinging it over her head brought it down on the ground where shahbash had outlined a grave with a thud which set her arms tingling the soil was hard indeed and surely that was twelve oclock chiming from the court gong not much time left but softer spots were to be found than the one shahbash had chosen she took up the oilcresset again and wandered round to the extreme edge of the graveyard where it merged into the sandier common thud thud the strokes of the mattock echoing through the night made the kazis son smile as about an hour after midnight he crept alone to the tomb a man who is the prey of a purely animal passion does not have his ears boxed for nothing and his idea of revenge went further than marriage no one would heed suttus cries for help this time and the watchers were in his pay thud thud suttus respect for her henchman increased at every stroke she was well into the grave by this time digging round and round methodically though she ached all over yet if she died of it that grave should be ready what was that metal on metal the surprise sent a tingle all through her then she was down on hands and knees groping in the loosened soil yes it was the treasure at last and no one no soul alive except herself must know of it she looked round hastily into the darkness and silence there was no fear of interruption now there might be afterwards her best plan was to finish the grave so as to obliterate all trace of the spot whence she had taken that heavy brass pot and then but not till then to go home quietly the next instant the thud of the mattock began again a lucky decision for the kazis son surprised at finding suttu absent was beginning to suspect treachery from the silence when the digging recommenced shahbash then meant to keep faith and not seek safety in flight but suttu as the spoiler sat beside the friendly watchman he asked himself if the lies he himself had circulated so diligently about the religious were true and she had an assignation elsewhere he gnashed his teeth over the thought and his own rejection a step my lord it was a step whispered one of the guardians and the kazis son crept towards the hut he had not entered it before being assured it was empty but now thinking suttu might have seen him and slipped into the darkness for safety he felt his way through the door and so on by the wall then a yell burst from hima cry once heard never to be forgotten snake snake the watchmen heard it and came slowly feeling their dark way with sticks lest where one snake was there might be two suttu heard it also and lamp in hand ran back to the hut knowing that friend or foe was in deadly peril something huddled up writhing moaning clasping one hand with the other shapeless convulsed by fear lay upon the groundsomething that flung itself before her and yelled for a charmthe saints charmfor mercyfor helpfor anything thou she cried thou what dost here she knew well enough and she thrust him back savagely never mind that now mother whimpered one of the men give him the charm sure god gave such to the saints for all men and all men are sinners for mennot for dogs go houndgo and die i have no charm for thee the wretched creature struggling from the hands of the watchmen who strove to set him on his feet caught her by the ankle save me save me to be thy friend i knowi can savei he sank down helpless foaming at the mouth from abject fear suttu paused there was something in that view of the case if anything could be done if by chance by the light of the lamp she examined the bitten finger closely and an odd look came to her face it was near the door breasthigh by the sticks of the thatch thou wast bitten she said as she hastily concealed the wound under a bandage yea yea thou knowest the charm mother suttu the charm i swear to be thy friend the fakeerni looked contemptuously at her writhing lover swear by thy sons head fool naught else will satisfy me when the only oath a native will not break had been pronounced suttu stood up with a laugh the charm is worked mir sahib thou wilt not die of that bite then she checked herself and with the same odd look on her face assumed a graver tone lo i will work the charm as for theego home swift as thou canst call the barber let him bleed thee to faintness take kala dana and sulphur to the full eat naught for two days live righteous and look not on the bite for a month then give a hundred rupees to the saints shrine footnote ipomea seeds tis all right master whispered one of the men there is no fear of the bargain when payment follows cure lo thou art better already and by this thou shouldst have been worse had not the charm worked hurry hurry lest harm come from disobedience when they were quite out of sight and hearing suttu took the lamp went to the door of the hut and chirruped from a hole in the wall a pair of bright eyes looked out the brahmans say true she chuckled and ram befriends those who befriend his favourite shahbash would have had me tear the squirrels nest down but i love the chattering things she had little time however to spare for amusement at her own trick the grave had to be completed the treasure brought home by dawn her arms ached worse than ever from their short rest and there was a grey glimmer in the east before she judged that her work would pass muster then she removed all shahbashs belongings to the side of the grave leaving him still in a drunken sleep upon the bare ground finally lifting the brass pot which was carefully luted over with hard clay she carried it to the hut shut the door and by the growing light through the chinks began to open up her treasure the pot was full of farthingsnothing but farthings she sat and looked at them hopelessly what did it mean why should any one take the trouble to bury farthings the puzzle was beyond her and when a gleam of real sun warned her that time was passing she hid the pot under a pile of brushwood and stepped out with a feeling of relief into the open air the world was ablaze with the clear uncompromising light of an indian morning the parrots were wheeling round the blue dome and a squirrel sat on the top of the thatch chirping over a date stolen from the disputed crop suttu thought of the kazis son physicked bled and hungry her laugh echoed out among the palms and she felt more comforted than when the night before she had sought solace in chanting iv shahbash sat up and opened his mouth with a tremendous yawn then he opened his eyes and at the same moment reached around for the black bottle its absence woke him thoroughly and the further discovery that he was on the bare ground made him instinctively cry thieves before he was alert enough to notice the sight of his belongings on the ground some little way off rising slowly for he was stiff in his limbs he stumbled towards them conscious only of a racking headache memory of his own treachery had not yet returned and when he all but fell into a newmade grave on his way to the black bottle his mind seemed to him a perfect blank and he stood transfigured before this evidence of an industry which he could not remember he sat down helplessly on its edge dangling his legs over the side and peered into it critically without doubt if that was his handiwork he must have been very drunk indeed the mere force of habit made him slip into it and seizing the mattock begin to trim the shape suddenly he gave a yell and the next moment was up on solid earth again clutching at something which had rolled out of the last spadeful of earthsomething which had clinked and glittered undoubtedly for all that it was only a farthing his face fell still a farthing was money and pointed to money ah how pleased little mother suttu would be the thought transfixed him again this time by excess of memory what had happened to her what had he done what cursed fate was this that he should find money on the very day when he had given up hope and faith his trembling legs would scarcely support him as driven by the necessity of knowing the worst he stumbled towards the hut wondering how he should ever face the saints rolypoly or how he would endure life without suttus laugh to lighten his labours what was that echoing among the palms surely surely it was her laugh were the fiends playing tricks with him or hope literally gave him wings for as he galloped forward the sheet he had thrown round his shoulders spread out on either side and his matted hair still bound with chaplets blew round his head like an aureole suttu standing on the steps laughed louder at the ridiculous figure gambolling towards her uttering little cries of joy if he had looked like a whipped hound a minute before he was like a cur restored to favour now in his delight quite forgetting the necessity for caution till suttu sternly asked him to explain then inspired by elation he lied magnificently was there no just cause for joy when he had found the treasure the treasure thou hast found it cried the fakeerni paling before the fear lest she had overlooked the real prize wherewhat treasure the saints treasurelakhs on lakhs listen o incredulous o suspicious and eat shame last night urged by the virulence of thine enemies i vowed a mighty vow for the accomplishment of thy desires caring naught for my own ruin i spread a cloth for my fairy setting it well with flowers and dancing to please her but when she came allured by my graces i spurned her yea i trampled her under foot i took my heart and hers out of our bodies and ate them before her face show me the treasures i cried rescue my little mother suttu from the necessity of marrying a oneeyed pockmarked man or i set no more cloths for thee lo thou shouldst have seen her clinging to me like a weanling child but i would none of her then she grew wroth saying she would neer return but i answered who cares think mai suttui shahbash said that to my fairy for thy sake and thou hast suspicions nay smite me but i said more i saidwhat did i not saytilltill she smote me on the forehead soand i died yea i died as much as a man may and yet live sososhe dug a grave for mefor she would not the jackals had my beauty yea a grave see you it was not much of a gravea poor grave such as a womans hand could make lo my heart aches for the blisters there must be go on liar said suttu calmly and let the blisters be they will heal without thy lipsalve may i eat dirt if it be not true then towards morning being chastened by blisters her heart melted so she buried the treasure instead of me that is how it came about suttu could not resist a smile but the treasure foolthe treasure shahbash dancing round her flourished a coin which she snatched from him hastily lo she cried in tones of disappointment tis only a farthing only a farthing echoed shahbash ironically hark to the incredulous aye but it means gold close at hand dost not know that wise men put pennies when they take pounds so that the jinn who guards the treasure may find the tale true when he counts the coins suttus hand went up swiftly to her forehead she gave a little cry dost mean they put farthings in place of gold aye sure a coin is a coin to the jinn and when the last gold bit is gone he sits guarding a pot of farthings till judgment ho hoha ha his mirth left suttu smileless a potoffarthings she muttered slowly then a light broke in on her and she threw up her hands exclaiming gone aye he said it was gone and we thought he meantgone yea it is clear gone gone gone what is clear what hath gone asked shahbash curiously the need for caution came home to her tis clear thou art a fool she said and my trust in thee is gone why cannot folk leave me alone she continued querulously i only ask peace and quiet and then to the dwarfs horror and amazement she suddenly began to crymai suttu crying like any other woman tis but the piluberries he whimpered did i not tell thee they were watery diet apt to turn acid and destroy the courage but there shall be no more wild meats for thee mai suttu the treasure is found it was indeed all that day the fakeerni sat wondering what she had better do but if she was quick to carry out a suggestion she had no head for the weaving of plots and plans the pot of farthings represented a few rupees but not enough to purchase witnesses and conduct a case in court the kazis son would at least not give evidence against her but even the breakdown of this particular claim would benefit her little she must have something to live upon and what is more nothing but the hope of discovering treasure would keep shahbash faithful to his salt or induce the accountant to come to terms towards evening she strolled over to watch the dwarf who had been digging the grave deeper and deeper longer and longer art going to bury a saint o shahbash she asked with a broad smile from the trench behind the growing mountain of soil came grunts and groans then a verse of the koran mingled with something suspiciously like curses she sat down on the pile and looked over the level stretch dotted by mud hillocks with here and there a masonry tomb on one of these a squirrel sat perched hard at work on a peachstone which some wayfarer on the adjoining path had flung aside suttus keen delight in openair sights and sounds kept her watching the dainty little creature as it shifted the prize this way and that in its deft fingers so as to bring its teeth to bear on the hard shell it worked as hard as shahbash she thought with another of her broad smiles and deserved the sweet kernel no another squirrel had caught wind of the affair and came pirating along with tail full set lo twas a play to watch up and down round and round the peachstone dropped here snatched up there now in this ones possession now in that until finally the newcomer sat in the place of the old gnawing at the hard shell and twisting it about with deft fingers suttu with her chin on her hands watched the second as she had the first and after all there was no kernel in the peachstone nothing but a shrivelled skin which had once suttu stood up clapping her hands shahbash shahbash she cried the dwarf stuck his head out of the grave well mai suttu what is it now she turned with a flaunt of her petticoat a flinging out of her round arms twas the other shahbash i meant but tis all one leave digging and go and call hussan the fatherinlaw i have made up my mind it was ten years after these events that the english boy who had stayed proceedings in the datepicking returned to the district as deputy commissioner gratitude she averred was her first reason for appearing in my garden with a cunningly plaited basket of deen alis fruit afterwards a mutual fancy between her and my young barbarians led to confidences when she came over with all sorts of odd toys made out of palmleaves and supplies of young squirrels for the children she was still undoubtedly handsome and the indisputable possessor of the tomb and the datetrees the graveyard with its rights of alms and treasure had passed into the hands of the village accountant in consideration of a monthly pension of ten rupees it was in answer to a query why she kept so many tame squirrels that this tale was told and you had no difficulty in persuading your fatherinlaw none huzoor god gave the bait the fool swallowed it the farthing shahbash found bought him greed and all it was better than fighting when the kazi would not swear to the marriage and our names were birthnames he signed the stamp paper gladly and the perquisites have gone up again so he hath lost nothing shahbash a big broad smile came to her face he digs and his stomach is always full what more can he want the squirrels are quite happy over the peachstones while they are gnawing shahbash and the fatherinlaw think the kernel is inside that is all i know it is not so we are both content when i left the district on promotion suttu came out as i rode past the bluetiled tomb on my way to the river with a great sheaf of lotusblossoms in her arms a tame squirrel reared from the perennial nest in the thatch peered from the folds in her veil with furtive bright eyes the parrots circled screaming round the ripening dates and but a minute before my horse had shied from a karait curving back to the prickly covert the well known setting seemed a part of that familiar figure may the lord have the huzoor in his keeping ever she said decorously as became a fakeerni but her smile seemed to dim the sunlight as with a gesture full of grace she flung the lotusblossoms in my path that was my last sight of suttu at a girls school i it was a large square block of a building which had once been somebodys palace not very old that could be recognized by the odd reminiscent air of a genoese palazzo which clung to it proclaiming the influence of some italian adventurer in the mogul times in those days doubtless its blank arcaded walls had risen from a terraced orangegarden but now the surrounding slums of a big native city ended abruptly at varying distance in an irregular brickstrewn space where buffaloes were tethered to eat street sweepings and their refuse in its turn was set out to dry in fuel cakesthat being the last resort of matter in india where poverty and greed fight for the uttermost farthing of utility besides the buffaloes and the refuseheaps the space in its longest angle showed the inevitable weavers warp twined in and out of tigergrass stalks stuck slantwise in the dustinevitable because it is never absent from an open space in a native city sometimes solitary like a huge worm impaled and left to dry more often tended by two chattering fates one on each side whose tongues gabble an accompaniment to the whirring bobbins tied to long sticks which dance a ladies chain through the grassstalks as the bearers walk swiftly up and down the long length of growing warpup and down with an outward swirl of a full petticoat and a veil bulging backward as the free brown arms twist and twine a common sight a picturesque one withal seeing that it shows a good figure at its best sometimes beyond these two fates you may see clotho spinning her lacquered wheel but not often as a rule she hides in narrow alleys where set well over the central gutter on a stool she can discuss past present and future with half a dozen neighbours at a time for the rest the building was distinctly imposing like a palazzo it was tunnelled by one single high archway leading into a central courtyard decorously circled by orangetrees in tubs above these again was a further likeness in the three tiers of graceful arcades surrounding a square of deep ultramarine sky there however the resemblance ended a genoese palace is sacred to silence and shadow this was set apart to sunshine and sound excepting on a gala day when the philanthropic great ones came down to distribute prizes then it burst forth into carpets awnings curtains and even the alifbeywallahs alphabetclass in the first story bit their tongues to keep them still that was the noisiest story all day long the inmates chanted letters in high childish voices while the monitors stood over them like the parent bird ready to drop a fresh titbit of knowledge into the clamorous mouths upstairs in the primary department the babel had lost its first barbarous simplicity the makers of it did not always understand what they themselves were saying and the uncertainty of all things had damped their infant lightheartedness higher again in the third story quite an academic silence prevailed among the girls working away at euclid algebra and all the ologies and they had learned an automatic thrust forward of the arm towards the teacher worthy of a british board school this never failed to please exotic philanthropy the connection may not have been quite clear but this particular branch of knowledge was invariably looked upon as a sign that education was really at last beginning to leaven the mass of deplorable female ignorance in india perhaps it was certainly this school with its courtyard devoted to the dhoolies in which the pupils were carried to and from their lessons and its three stories of different standards formed a perfect ladder of learning the lowermost rung being the listless lazy group of bearers lounging in the gateway with the female chaperons until four oclock chimed from a hundred gongs in the city then they earned a monthly pay from the government by carrying the climbers of the ladder back to their homes in decent seclusionplaying as it were the part of prince hassans carpet in transporting them into another hemispherenay more another world at any rate from algebra and the exact sciences to a cell of four walls and if fate were kind a few square yards of flat roof open to the sky something of a mental somersault therefore it was perhaps as well in one point of view if not in another that many of the claimants to genteel seclusion who were comfortably carried by a paternal government to their own doors could on arrival set aside the convenient pretence and go about to see their friends with the more simple and less costly protection of a veil ari sister said a young dissipatedlooking lounger in the gate there is that baby awake again go chundoo and call fatma the woman addresseda big brazen lumpwent yawning and stretching to stand on the bottom step of the arched stairway then she called into the clamour above fatma fatma the baby is awake her hard tones echoed up the arcades but the singsong went on without a break after a while however a pattering step came down the stairs bringing into view a child of about ten with a sharp old face her blue trousers were rent at the knees her skinny hands inconceivably smeared with inkthere was more ink than handand the coarse cotton cloth she wore as a veil was frayed worn and dirty beneath it the odd little galloon of plaited hair on her forehead showed sunbleached and rumpled despite its tightness a competent observer could have told at once that she belonged to the cashmiri quarter and to either a povertystricken or a bereaved house no mothers fingers had been at that plaited hair for weeks where is peru she began shrilly still coming down the stairs gambling and dicing or snoozing and sleeping how am i to win scholarships if my days are lost over a baby ai sluggard is that you art not ashamed of thyself so passing through the knot of jeering men into a dark recess in the entry till her rating ceased over a yearold baby whimpering on the floor on a ragged quilt peace peace my son it is i fatmayea it is fatma thy fathers sister the babys fat yellow legsfor it was one of those fair cashmiri children who look sickly among the brown oneswere astride her curved hip the whole balance of her thin bare body against its weight as she paused once more among the men to fling a parting gibe at the sluggard ai teri nani tis thy baby i supposenot mine a roar of laughter greeted the words in which the girl joined not because she quite understood its cause but because she was quick enough to see that it was at perus expense not hers the veil which nature draws to protect childhood counts for little among the men and women busy in drawing one to conceal their own unnatural vice but fatmas hoary knowledge of evil did not extend to a double entendre she repeated her sally in childish ineptitude till peru with a curse bade her begone and take the boy to his mother tobah but she hath a tongue murmured another lounger pucki burri pucki ripe or readyvery ready assented chundoo shaking her head wisely tis time thou hadst a husband for her o peru not i who is to bake bread and take the child tis ten rupees a month for the other remember and fatmai swear itis a good sort for all her tongue meanwhile the object of their remarks had begun to climb the stairs with her heavy burden she had to sit down every now and again to rest for she was but a poor scrap of a thing illfed from her birth she paused longer than usual at the turn of the stair whence you could see both ways along the firststory corridors one and one make twooooo one and one make twooooo chanted the infant classes in full choir over their first table one and one certainly made two and two were heavier to carry than one fatma clutched her burden tighter and toiled up the steps once more leaving the clamour behind her ari is that babe hungry again queried a tall girl flashing past the next landing plumaged like a parrot in red and green babies seem hungry things im glad i havent one as yet she was a bride kept from her husbands house in order to enjoy a scholarship fatma out of breath said nothing but leaned against a pillared shaft the baby having seized on her inky thumb was sucking at it contentedly for india ink is sweet and sticky fifteenth page second paragraph among the lower animals the maternal instinct falls little short of that displayed by the human race even in the family of aves the female during the period of incubation fatmas foot was on the ladder again for the babe having sucked the ink from her thumb demanded something more satisfying oh how quiet it was up here in the long matted corridor one seemed to have left the stress of life behind through the doorways leading into darker rooms you could see groups of girls and women squatted on the floor over their low desks here busy over pen and ink here murmuring from books more circled round the terrestrial globe an odd company some wrinkled and old with shaven head and white shroud others dressed in the same fashion but fair and fresh hindu widows these seeking solace for death in life endured or yet to come a young sikh wife or two ablazeears nose and foreheadwith jingling gold set thick with jewels and here sharper than any with finger pointing to the pole a small bengali girl who had been married these seven years gone and looked a perfect child all this interested fatma not at all she had seen it too often her goal lay in the end room among the secondyear students who sat on benches find the value of b in the following equation a square plus x squared equal ax plus b read out the teacher from her desk as fatma entered whereat she promptly added in english bother that baby it must be remembered that the b representing baby does not enter into equations at girton or somerville i wonder you dont give it a bottle hoshiaribi continued the teacher sternly as a delicatelooking young woman rather overdressed and overscented took the child from fatma with a sigh and retired to a corner fatma breaks them on purpose replied the mother sullenly she says they disagree with him yea tis true assented fatma gravely they give him a pain in his inside then he cries and i have to sit up since hoshiaribi is always tired and peru is too lazy teacher looked at the little sharp face and was silent that household consisting of disreputable goodfornothing peru who gambled away the five rupees he gained by helping to carry his wife and other students to and from the school shiftless hoshiarbi who spent half her scholarship of ten rupees on her clothes and fatma whose eight annas a week for cleaning the writingboards seemed to keep the whole going was a perpetual puzzle to the english lady even without the child and with it she felt quite relieved when hoshiaribi came back to her equation minus the baby the afternoon sun was slanting in bars through the closed grass chicks making the floors ringstreaked it was close on four oclock the tide of learning slackened at full flood downstairs among the little ones first to go there would only be time to chant one and one make twooooo a few times more so fatma sat down in the sunny sleepy corridor with the baby in her limited lap and as she sat thinking heaven knows of what she jogged the base of its skull backward and forward on the palm of her supporting hand in approved native fashion she did not know that it conduces to slight concussion of the brain and consequent coma convenient to the nurse but she knew mother always did it this odd little woman of ten knew most of the oldfashioned oldestablished ways of the world she lived in and when the value of b had been discovered she saw hoshiaribi and the baby into the folds of a white domino and so on their way downstairs to the husband the curtained dhoolie and the oblong room up two flights of stairs in the cashmiri quarter then she came to linger sturdily yet unobtrusively in the corridor till teacher coming out busy over a mass of papers nearly fell over her gracious me child what do you want why arent you downstairs perhaps fatma had been rehearsing her petition while she was nursing the baby anyhow she had it clear and pat huzoor i want promotion to the primary department it is such a long way to carry the baby to hoshiaribi and he sleeps not at all among the infants we make too much noise and peru goes away gambling and forgets him so i get no time for study thus when hoshiaribis scholarship ends next year we shall be destitute since perus money goes in quailfighting and we cannot fill our stomachs on eight annas incontrovertible facts every one of them have you read your grammar through fatma shook her head oh no huzoor but the baby could sleep in the upper primary and then miss sahib i could soon read it now i am always on the stairs another incontrovertible fact teacher had visions of the big yellowlegged baby going up and down the ladder of learning on fatmas curved hip that however could not possibly be held equivalent to a pass from one department to another yet the childs face was deadly earnest a sudden sympathy and compassion brought a promise to consider the matter but there are already three babies in the primary shrilled the mohammedan head of that department a portly lady with voluminous skirts trailing behind her and red betelstained teeth there was no one in the school from the top story to the bottom who was the equal in deportment of mumtaza mihrunnissa begum whose father had been munshi to some deadandgone mogul to begin with she could silence every one with persian epithets and the pebbles of her polished speech hit hard these may providence protect but god hath sent this proof of his bounty to a handmaiden who is secondyear student what are we to reduce this gift of the most high to a standard beneath its birth let hoshiaribi out of her plenty appoint a wetnurse or let its amiable aunt supply it with maw at four annas to allow her a primary pass without due qualification in my poor thought is nonregulation and in addition a bad precedent mumtaza mihrunnissa bowed her sleek netveiled head and threw out her podgy fat hands as if deprecating her own opinions for all that fatma stayed among the infants and spent most of her time on the wide stairs with the yellowlegged baby while peru joked shamelessly with chundoo on the sunshiny steps and hoshiaribi in the academic silence upstairs worked a crewel antimacassar between the equations it suited her indolent comfortloving nature ever since she entered the school nearly sixteen years ago she had been in receipt of a scholarship of sorts at the beginning influence may have had something to do with her good fortune for her mother was only a poor goodlooking cashmiri and her reputed father dead but since then she had justified her selection if not clever she was studious and quite understood that learning meant livelihood in the good old days when the one great object was to catch and keep a scholar this might have gone on indefinitely but now under new rules hoshiaribis scholarship would cease in a year whether she passed or did not pass then she must become a teacher or starve on perus five rupees the prospect was not pleasing it would be a very different thing having to worry over thirty unwilling pupils in a poky little room spending part of your own pay in bribes so as to get the grant for attendance and then never knowing from day to day if some neighbourly spite would not result in empty mats on inspectiondays but if you pass suggested a hindu widow in her class you can go on as i am doing into the medical school that is two years more scholarship and certain employment afterwards tis all very well for you muttered hoshiaribi sullenly you only came in three years ago i have been here all my life i like it i dont want to go home and nurse the babies i dont want to work the committee paid me to learn and i have learned i will learn anything else they like why then should they take away my scholarship how foolish you are said the little bengali you dont seem to understand what a scholarship is perhaps i dont retorted hoshiaribi flushing up my fathers were not scriveners and quilldrivers since creation like yours my people are poor if i go home i must spin and grind corn i will not i tell you i will not that is an end of it then you must teach i dont want to teach i want to stay here and learn be quiet girls reproved the english teacher do stick to your lessons and remember why you come here think just think of the money that is being spent on your education hoshiaribi gave a triumphant glance at the bengali girl that was it they had paid her to learn and she had learned the rest was an injustice ii a loud resounding slap another and another a torrent of irrelevant abuse in a strange tongue then something which is the same all over the worlda fit of hysterics hoshiaribi as she stormed and sobbed and laughed might have been any spoiled overwrought young woman in any country that was an end of everything after slaving for months after doing without a new bodice in order to pay the ungrateful imps after cozening and flattering their stupid cowlike mothers it had come to this that sultani on whose performances hoshiari relied for a fair inspection had divided four thousand one hundred and seven by six thousand three hundred and two she had not only tried to divide itshe had divided itwith a quotient of fiftysix and a remainder of five thousand and three it was too muchtoo much in every way with peru lounging all day at the central flirting with chundoo fatma thinking of nothing but the babies the gold edge on the dress she must wear at the wedding next week wanting renewal and inspectionday next month she propped herself up against the whitewashed wall at one end of the room sultani the injured prize pupil at the other and the two sobbed vindictively across the intervening space while a connecting circle of alphabetlearners whimpered in sympathy with some one which they scarcely knew for they were mites of babies not six years old any of them the women up and down the central stair which served also as a sort of drain and dustbin came attracted by the hope of a scene to discuss the whole aspect of the affair without the least reserve peru was a bad lot and it was sheer tyranny of the sirkar to have refused hoshiar a scholarship after all these years at the same time she was a poor flighty creature and had no business to slap their children the latter train of thought becoming accentuated by the arrival from a neighbouring tenement of sultanis mother was it for this her daughter had been bribed away shamelessly for a neighbouring missen where if they did read the bible and try to pervert the scholars they made up for it in prizes was it for this that baseborn brat of a baseborn mother had taken one rupee a month out of hoshiars own pocket these two questions were the theses of a controversy which spread like wildfire till it embraced the personal history of every one present and the room was a seething mass of excited women bordered by a whimpering circle of small girls until a little figure came rushing up the stairs and forced itself into the thickest of the clamour it was fatma returning from her daily marketing her already scrimped veil was further abridged by all the corners being utilized as bags for her various purchases and as she flung out her skinny brown arms in the small space still left between the combatants and turned first to one side and then to the other in vociferous reproach her weighted veil swung out leaving her body quite bare it was not much bigger certainly no fatter than it had been eighteen months gone when she had struggled up the ladder of learning with the yellowlegged baby ari mothers ari sisters she scolded in her thin childs voice this is unseemly this is a deplorable word have you forgotten this house is a school you come here to learn not to make beastlike noises what a bad example does not shame come to you the fateful phrases which had so often reduced the infant department to tears fell powerless and fatmas own imperious temper asserted itself she turned like a whirlwind to the alphabetlearners they were her special charge they at least should obey her come my daughters she cried let us leave this scene of infamy this is no place for us people come let us go the circle stood up instinctively they adored fatma besides the chance of escape was welcome she thrust her new nephew a babe of three months who had been squalling patiently in a corner into the biggest girls arms seized on the yellowlegged one herself and so full of dignity headed the little procession the women touched by the passionate delight in childrens ways which is so marked among them fell back with sudden laughter ai dil aziz wah the little marionettes see how they go like old women heartscore are we so wicked look at my amma fuzlinot four i swear and grave as a judge tobah tobah go not little lives we are sorry see we bite our tongues we hold our ears so squatting down standing aside reaching over the women chattering their amusement let the babies pass and as for fatma she was pucki burri pucki god knows why but the bairns were set to obey her this ones miriam not four till baisakh leaped out of bed at her first call as she came her morning rounds for the pupils and that ones janet had been known to refuse her breakfast if fatma said it was late ayepucki burri puckifor good not evil and twere well others were more like her so with side sniffs they pattered up and down the stairs to their several abodes leaving hoshiaribi sulkily exhausted sultani and her mother as they went casting glances of final scorn at the odd little row of maidens ranged along the gutter in the sunshine piping away the incontrovertible fact that one and one make twooooo while fatma and her babies sat opposite on a doorstep and led the chorus so that was an end of the incident for one day unfortunately it was not the first of its kind and hoshiaribi had almost made up her mind that it should be the last she lay feeling a perfect worm as any woman east or west might have done after the turmoil kicking one heel petulantly over the side of the stringbed on which she had flung herself and looked at the map of asia and the map of europe which hung on opposite walls with equal abhorrence she hated everything everybody the last six months since her failure to pass had sent her as a favour to the lowest pay of a branchschool teacher had been sheer misery to her for her husbands neglect she did not care save in so far as it gave her complaint a sound basis she had been betrothed to him and so she had married him but the six years since she had lived with him as his wife had only taught her that she could set her duty to him aside without reproach for the sake of ten rupees a month and that he was quite content with this arrangement she looked once more round the long narrow slip of a room with its mud floor its smoky rafters its singleshuttered window two feet square giving on a close alley then she thought of the cool matted corridors of the genoese palazzo the leisurely studies the ease of ten rupees compared with six and rolled over face down on the bed whimpering she hated teaching but it was that or starvation at leastunless some one came jingling up the stairs heralded by a strong smell of musk hoshiaribi set up frowning for all that content to be interrupted since meran bibi reputation or no reputation was at any rate able to talk at least she knew something of the world beyond that swarming yet deadalive cashmiri quarter for she had been showpupil for years at another branch school knew the three first readers by heart and after a somewhat tarnished girlhood had married a policeman consequently she was not a woman to be scorned in the quarter just because folks tongues had cause to wag she was a buxom person with oily hair great bosses of silver tassels in her ears and a perfunctory veil of manchester hitched on to the very back of her head and drawn tight over her high bust finally she had the usual shrill voice in which she could always tell her gossip of the latest fassen in the cutting of a bodice or the number of suits in a brides trousseau for she came of a tailor family and spent all her days in gadding about despite her pretence to the purdah an institution which is as a rule only inviolable when exotic benevolence seeks to interfere with it she and hoshiaribi fell on each others necks in an elaborate stage embrace and then crouched up side by side upon the stringbed after a time however hoshiaribi moved to put her head out of the window and call to fatma below send those brats awayit must be close on fourand make some tea my head aches surely when the creator made women with his right hand his left must have been busy over tea these two groups had it sickly sweet cinnamonflavoured in little basins with an english flag and union is strength upon them in gay colours yea tis true hoshiaribi a star of emerald with a red centre three crinkles of gold lace like a hearts comfort in pattern on the breast and two rows of seedpearls round the collar then the bridal dress to begin with a full skirtfor look you the newest fassen is six breadths gored so on and so on while the map of europe winked at the map of asia and fatma after making the tea was kneading as for dear life at the dough of bare flour and water which with the smear of some curd was to form the household dinner thou couldst see it easily continued meran and thou deservedst something to cheer thee after those senseless fools come i could take thee by the mori gate a step from here so into the gardens lord how they smell of orange blossomslike any bride then we could come home by the badami bazar to think thou hast never seen these things and thou so cleverone who has learned wisdom of the sahibs wah it tickles me merans peal of laughter crackled like thorns and hoshiaribi flushed up i could have gone had i wished peru should not stop me but i have not chosen peru why i tell thee hoshiaribi he will marry the widow chundoo tchut what matters it if thou art not a fool slaving away to no purpose look you they wanted me to keep school not i come hoshiaribi twill do thy head good i have to buy new tinsel for a kurta and the bazar is worth seeing a fair for noise with the criers selling sugarcane and fresh fritters the shops full of jewels the people crowding the soldiers marching up and down the memsahibas in their carriages and above all the wooden balconies with the girls in white nodding and smiling but the great ones like chandni of delhi stand up and salaam as the big folk go by yet she is naught to look at thou wouldst be twice her match for looks wert thou not so pale half an hour afterwards fatma was alone in the room the babies were asleep so she had taken out a sort of lapstone and was busy punching gilt thread into stars through the front of a shoe upper that by rights was perus hereditary trade which he had deserted in favour of dhooli bearing and a fixed salary of five rupees a month it came therefore more naturally than anything else to fatma and so when the babies left leisure she earned a pice or two by sweating for an old woman and her crippled grandson who lived up the same stair and were employed by a big shop but for these odd earnings life could not have gone on at all what with hoshiaribis tea and perus inroads for dinner or supper when he was short himself there he was even now coming up the stair lazily fatma had put away her lapstone ere he arrived and was ready to greet him with calm contumely even while she set two cakes a toasting in the embers and brought out the green leaf of curds if the one was his right as master of the house the other was hers as mistress and she exercised it fully hoshiaribi being away with mai rajjun who had a new baby for fatma had no scruples about abstract truth when face to face with the absence of a wife and the presence of an inquiring husband with that same unconscious knowledge that it was the right thing to do which had made her jog the babys cerebellum to keep it quiet she lied cheerfully to avoid possible disturbance peru accepted the explanation with a like indifference to its truth to begin with that same indifference to all save appearance is a common feature among husbands and then peru would not have been exactly sorry to feel cause of complaint it would have balanced his own indiscretion briefly he had married chundoo two days before and had come to break the fact to his first wife there must be something painfully bald about such a statement to european readers when fully one half of harrowing modern fiction is based upon the axiom that thingumbob having married soandso cannot possibly marry whatshisname also it takes the starch out of a story when a hero can have as many wives as he likes and his religion counsels four the facts in this case were extremely bald chundoo the chaperone an elderly widow had taken a fancy to the handsome young scamp and having been appointed doorkeeper to a new female hospital thought it more respectable to have a man of her own then dhoolibearers got six rupees at the hospital instead of five at the school that sordid as it may seem was why peru had news to tell the reason for his telling it was this he knew perfectly well that hoshiaribi would never consent to live in the same house as chundoo and so his responsibility for her maintenance would cease as he could plead poverty against any claim for separate alimony as for her pay as a teacher that if central school gossip said true would not be for long but fatma would look after the babies somehow such were his thoughts as he sat watching the childs odd little figure busy over the cakes which he did not want seeing that his new bride had given him kababs and bakkharkana for breakfast he had a sort of affection for fatma who was the only relation he had in that part of the world he did not mean her to starve and if she could not manage it would be easy to give a rupee or two on the sly what he did want was to keep chundoo in a good temper by showing conclusively that hoshiaribi had no hold on his affections to be sure he had shown this illegally for some months back but now law and order demanded something legitimate so he would respectfully command her to come and live with chundoo and when she refused be quit of responsibility for polygamy is made for the virtuous not for the vicious suddenly fatma looked at him sniffed and looked at him again thou hast been to a weddingwhose she asked suspiciously in truth an odour of orange blossom and attar began to be apparent in the close room peru coughed hesitated it was a good beginning and might save him a scene with his wife so he began hm commented fatma then thats an end of bread for your stomach god be praised that is how it struck her little imp of sin cried peru seizing her half roughly half jestingly by the shoulder keep a quieter tongue in thy head or ill find a husband to gag thee she gave a shrill laugh of scorn and twisted herself from his hold a husband indeed then chundoo will take the babies ai budzart think not i do not understand let be they are my babies not thine and thank god i go not to bed hungry this night she sat herself down on the floor as she spoke and began calmly on the cakes she had been toasting go my brothergo back to thy chundoo she said eying him disdainfullyfrom the crown of his head to the sole of his foot dissolute idler was writ all over himgo we have no need of thee then her dignity gave way she leaped to her feet scattering the broken cakes upon the floor and the echoes of her plain speaking followed him downstairs and flooded up into the room where lalu the cripple sat with a ray of sunlight glittering on the gold thread he was laying on the leather heaven save her husband he muttered goodhumoredly then he sighed perhaps the thought that he would never have even a shrewish wife oppressed him when his grandmother died he would be quite alone in the dark room with the glittering thread which seemed to make the darkness more dingy and dreary he was a young man of fiveandtwenty who might stand years of imprisonment in those four walls withheaven be praiseda scrap of roof open to the sunlight beyond that is to say if he could pay the rent he looked down at his fine supple hands and smiled knowing that so long as they were left there was no fear if only the rest of him had been to match instead of marred twisted helpless tis gods will he said half aloud as fervently as any christian for there are saints of all creeds and this poor cripple up three flights of stairs in the cashmiri quarter was one of them then he took to thinking tenderly of the odd little girl downstairs whom his grandmother did out of the uttermost farthing poor little soul when he was alone he would at least be able to give her what was due meanwhile fatma downstairs was nursing her childish yet all too comprehending wrath against peru for hoshiaribis return would she not be angry it would serve peru right if she went off straight to chundoos house and clawed her the room with its one small window darkened early fatma put the babies to sleep and went out into the alley to watch eager to give the first words of disaster after a time she ventured round the corner no one a little farther no one down the next turn no one still perhaps she had chosen the other way back up the now pitchy stairs to the dim room no one there save the sleeping babies fatmas wrathcooled rose again against the loiterer had time to cool again into dismay she knew well enough young as she was what merans guidance might mean in the badami bazar for all that she waited patiently crouching on the stairs peering down into the darkness watching listening for the shuffling footstep of a veiled womanwatching and waiting stolidly without fear or blame such things were and neither peru nor hoshiaribi counted for much with her save as extra appetites for dinner when ten oclock chimed from the police station gong at the mori gate she went back to the room and drew the bolt of the door all was dark save where a ray of moonlight shone through a chink in the shutter she stole over to this and standing in the bar of light undid a knot in the corner of her veil one two three annas some pice and a few cowries if the worst came to the worst and hoshiaribi did not come back that would buy a maw at the gimcrack shop round the corner so she cuddled up on the bed beside the babies contentedly iii one and one make twooooo two and two make fouroror that is enough my daughters said fatma royally miream and anna will play with mohammed ali janet and kareem will take ahmad hassan for a walk down the alley and back again the rest of you will sit still and think how good you are going to be tomorrow the little largeeyed gentle mites ranged solemnly behind a row of inkpots primers and writingboards did as they were bid decorouslyfor the organization of mussamat fatmas school was excellent its discipline first class the cleanliness too of its primers its pens and its writingboards was quite abnormal not because of abnormal neatness but because none of these things were ever used they were there because that was part of the game of school and fatmas school was emphatically a school with the learning left out to be sure the pupils chanted their letters and asserted the gospel that one and one make two all the world over but after that education went down the bypath of learning how to sit still and do as you were bid yet somehow the wee girlies liked it well and their busy mothers liked it better still in that crowded quarter of evil repute it was something to have a creche where for a few hours the little ones with a tempting jewel or two were safe from the avarice of any passerby and then fatmas pupils gave no trouble at home so the school throve and though educationally of course it was a miserable sham it gave great satisfaction to all concerned fatma finding sufficient payment in the general goodwill of her neighbours and the constant relays of nursemaids she secured she had plenty of time now for the golden stars and since lalu the cripples grandmother had died fatma not only got full price for the work she did for him but earned something besides by cooking his bread and doing his marketing when she did her own an excellent plan said the neighbours since mussumat fatma aged fourteen was as sedate as a greatgrandmother and poor lalu for all his kind face and clever hands was not to be reckoned as a possible husband for any one the only thing over which the women shook their heads was this lack of a husband for the girl who though she was a little crooked perhaps with hauling those big children up and down stairs had not like lalu lost her right to be married what excuse could that rascal peru offer to his conscience for his neglect of the natural guardians first duty he and chundoo and hoshiaribi flaunting away in the badami bazar were no better than pigs of infidels it would serve them right if fatma were to appeal modestly to the elders and let herself go to a husband for the beggarly five dumris the law demands then peru would have to support his boys and would not even get compensation in the price of the bride but fatma herself scouted the idea she had seen enough of husbands and would never marry she had her babies and her school and then there was always lalu who was as wise as any saint and as good as any father to the boys she used to leave them in his charge when she did her marketing for this was after hours when her little schoolmaidens had gone home and as for hassan ahmad the yellowlegged baby of two years past if ever he went amissing fatma knew she would find him cuddled up among lalus helpless legs watching the gold thread loop itself into dainty patterns very different from her coarse crooked stars and listening contentedly to lalus musical voice intoning some versicle of the koran he knew as many as a moulvi she used to say proudly for all that she repulsed with scorn his suggestion that she should teach some to her pupils ai tobak mian lal khan dost forget mine is primary girls school it is not a missen or an indigenous school we do not teach such things only letters and tables and such like she did not care to confess that she herself knew none of the versicles which even the poorest girl ought to know well well perhaps thou art right mussumat fatma he replied all learning is good as he sat at his work he used often to pause and listen with a smile to the chorus of childrens voices insisting on the fact that one and one make two after all it did not differ much from the creed he had somehow extracted from the sonorous arabic phrases which were so constantly on his lips what was was what would be would be meanwhile life was brighter for him because of fatma and the baby hassan ahmad cuddling close to him and the childrens chorus echoing up the stairs it was easier for fatma also when she had closed the door at ten oclock one night nearly two years ago and counted out the money in order to buy a maw she had thought of nothing but the immediate morrow now when she barred it she closed it deliberately against all interference peru at first had come prowling round to see how matters went and hoshiaribi had sent inquiries from the badami bazar fatma had given both a cool reception she was quite happy quite content the babies did not belong to those budzarts they belonged to her so by degrees they had left her to her own devices and for the last year she had seen or heard nothing of them it was a stifling afternoon in august the dry heat which had baked into the bricks with the june sun had boiled out of them again with the scanty rain of july into a sort of sodden vapour like the hot breath of some evil creature the alley smelled horribly even the inhabitants spat as they emerged from the dark drain of a tenement stair which all the sweeping in the world could not keep clean the very water spilled on it as the woman carried the chatties full to their rooms seemed to dissolve the dirt and give it greater freedom when those on the groundfloor sprinkled the entry for the sake of coolness the stench rose to the roof and in and out the highways and byways of the city cholera played pranks with the peoplehere today gone tomorrow biding its time till on some steamy dull morning folk would wake to find it in earnest the sickness was at haiyatuns yesterday rajjun would say to fajjan it took the cousin who came from umritsur the police were burning clothes and sulphur as i went by this morning it is tyranny when the lord is over all yea and they carried mai jeswants man to the hospital and the doctors never left him but he died all the same look you tis gods will and the two women grinding at the mill ground on the one might be taken and the other left before the day was out but the meal was wanted for the survivors supper people all over the world die silently from pluck or pride or piety but not all of them die as these do casting no shadow of blame either on the heaven above or on the earth beneath one has to go to civilized lands and to a people who profess a faith which proclaims its triumph over the grave before we find the fear of infection producing a selfish panic fatma having attended the central school during an epidemic had views on sanitary subjects and the procedure due to the dignity of a primary school she fumigated her maidens solemnly with sulphur she had covers to the waterpots and confiscated melonrinds with the utmost rigour this proved a vast amusement to the squatting circle ari muallama would come a little pipe juntu hath a bit of pumpkin in her veil i saw it then would ensue a sort of hunt the slipper beset for each with delicious tremors lest after all the contraband morsel should be found in your possession until some one seized by shyness or sudden virtue would give it up to be burned fatma on a sultry august afternoon had just been playing the part of grand inquisitor over a gnawed fragment of cucumber when a big heavybrowed woman pushed her way unceremoniously into the room and sat down on the bed with an air of possession it was chundoo fatma had last seen her gossiping on the palazzo steps and something told the girl the visit boded no good her heart gave a throb her usual courage seemed to leave her so this is thy school began her sisterinlaw lord what a farce but that is over i have come for thee because thy wedding is settled at last the dates will be brought tomorrow so thou hadst as well return with me tonight twill save trouble the studiously careless tone of undoubted authority had its effect there was nothing incredible in it marriage in fatmas world meant coercion she had seen most of her contemporaries handed over to a husband without even a pretence of consulting their wishes iiwant no husband she faltered utterly taken aback chundoo laugheda nasty laugh wah illah so girls say ever tis pretty behaviour and thou hast said it the thing is settled by peru asked the girl quickly by peru who else look you the scoundrel is in jail nay why shouldst start it was his appointed end and serve him right wasting my substance to a shadow he robbed a peasant in the serai treating him with liquor after englis fassen well he is there for two years and hath repented him of the evil and bethought him of his duty so i have found thee a husbandhonourable if somewhat old but thou god knows art a grandmother so that matters not and he can afford to pay for a young wife and keep her in plenty so send these brats away and the woman i have downstairs will take them to hoshiaribi their father being in jail they are her charge not mine come chicken there is no time to lose she laid her hand on the girls arm as fatma stood stupidly staring at her the touch seemed to make her realize the situation for she darted with a cry to where her babies sat in the charge of the first class perhaps the little nurses gazing with that stolid wideeyed dislike at the strange woman who spoke so roughly to their teacher thought that the latter sought their protection they gave it anyhow in a second chundoo was surrounded by a mob of twenty mites full of shrill cries and ineffectual beatings of tiny handsineffectual till the tiniest giving way to the natural eve slipped down and deliberately bit the enemy in the calf chundoo yelling with pain slapped right and left fatma her fear gone before this attack on her pupils flew to the rescue such a scene had not been enacted within those walls for two years before five minutes passed even the stairs were blocked by infuriated mothers when chundoo had been dragged off the kotwal followed by half the matrons in the alley fatma sat down dazed and dryeyed between her two charges that bite had saved her she would not have to go that evening perhaps not even tomorrow but afterwards girls had to be married and peru could marry her to any one he chose even the neighbours when they heard about the husband would side against her and it would be of no use to beg mercy of peru in jail that was the very reason why they had thought of marrying her the money would be useful to keep chundoo comfortable and yet she would not be bothered with the boys as she would have been had peru been free now hoshiaribi their mother must keep them but chundoo would get the dowry what did it matter who got it if she must marryand if peru said she must she must there was no help even the neighbours would side against her a rapping on the floor above reminded her that she had forgotten lalus dinner poor lalu who would look after him when she was gone drearily and still dryeyed she hitched the twoyearold on her hip and with a pile of doughcakes and pease porridge in her hand toiled up the stair behind hassan ahmad who climbed the high brick steps on allfours slowly methodically it was almost dark in the room above and lalus voice came kindly from a shadowy corner trouble no further mussumat fatma i was loath to knock yet knew thou wouldst be vexed to forget set the food downso sure thou hast enough today without my service she gave way to tears then and crouched down on the floor suddenly an image of forlorn crushing grief o lalu lalu peru is going to marry me and what will become of my school and what will become of my babies and what will become of you o lalu hassan ahmad had toddled over to the cripples helpless knee and mohammed ali half asleep buried his head on the girls thin breast there was no sound in the room save her sobbing and a passing rustle as if something in the shadows had tried to move and sank back to the old position again after a time the response came feebly ai my sister cry not marriage is good it is the lords will and peru hath the right perhaps for the first time the cripple hesitated in his creed to say sooth it seemed odd to put peru on the lords side yes he hath the right therefore i cry lalu is there nothing to be done lalu canst thou not help at all lalu in the shadows looked down at his dexterous hands then covered his face with them they were good for nothing else a girl must marry where she was bidden and even had the rest of him been as face and hands there would have been nothing to be done nothing to be said what chance had a cripple a girl and two babies against the will of the lord represented by law backed up by principalities and powers by custom and chief courts by wisdom and civilization cry not my sister cry not marriage is honourable in all so by degrees fatmas sobs ceased before the inevitable come hassan ahmad she cried it grows late tis time for sleep he sleeps already replied the voice from the shadows twere pity to wake him sister i will carry mohammed ali first and then come back her old decision and motherliness showed even through her utter dejection lalu gathered the boy closer and half mechanically hummed the chorus he had so often heard fatma use as a lullaby yes one and one made two and two and two made four but only if god willed it so not otherwise stoop down little mother and i will lift the boy to thee he said when fatma feeling her way through the dark paused as her fingers touched lalus knee she felt his fine hands linger as he drew them from the burden he laid in her armslinger almost caressingly one and one and two and two are what he chooses to make them remember that my sister not so lalu in school they are ever the same the big teacher said so one and one is two all the world over he sighed sitting crouched up in the dark then he called after her peace go with thee mussumat fatma and peace be thine lalu echoed back from the stairs the next morning the whole alley was being censed a group of policemen were standing round a bonfire of beds and clothes over which the flames licked blue and clear as the brimstone was scattered on it fatmas room was empty so was lalus so were several others in the high pestilential tenements of the quarter the cholera had grown tired of playing at school it had taken arithmetic and education and creeds and customs all into its own hands and settled the problem its own way two and two were not four but none and only chundoo called heaven to witness that she had been defrauded of the remuneration justly due to those who possess a marriageable female relation the rest of the neighbours said it was gods will in a citron garden this is a very idle taleonly the record of five minutes in a citron garden not a terraced patch set like a puzzle with toy trees such as one sees on the riviera but a vast scented shade unpruned by greed of gain where sweet limes mandarins shaddocks and bloodoranges blended flower and fruit and leaf into one allsufficing shelter from the sun there are many such gardens in india lingering round the ruined palaces or tombs of bygone kings this particular one hid in its perfumed heart a white marble mausoleum where the red and green parrots inlaid themselves like mosaic among the tracery for they are decorative birds and being untrammelled by prejudice regarding the position of their heads lend themselves to many a graceful topsyturvy pattern girding the garden was a wall twenty feet high bastioned like a fort but despite its thickness crumbling here and there from sheer old age invisible too for all its height from within by reason of the tall thickets of wild lemon on its inner edge four broad alleys sentinelled by broken fountains converged to the mausoleum high above a marble reservoir where the water still lingered hiding its stagnation beneath a carpet of lotusleaves from these again narrower paths mapped the garden into squares each concealed by the dense foliage from the next it was a maze of shadowy ways edged by little runnels of water and bordered by roses and jasmine with here and there a huge white draecena usurping the path day and night the water ran clear and cool to flood each square in turn till it showed a shining lake wherein the roof of fruit and blossom lay reflected as in a mirror a garden of eden like it tenanted by a woman and a snake famous also for its forbidden fruit nowhere did shaddocks grow so regardless of possible danger to the world the greengold globes weighed the branches to the ground the massive flowers burdened the air with perfume for all their solid somewhat stolid look they are fragile flowers gather a spray as gently as you can and only the buds remain the perfect flower has fallen so in a citron garden it is well to purge the soul from karma or desire in order to reach the nirvana of content in whichso say the buddhistslies the full perfection of possession naraini the gardeners granddaughter had different views she stood at the beginning of the five minutes beneath a citrontree one dimpled brown hand held the branch above her and as she swayed her body to and fro leisurely the flowers dropped into her stretched veil she was not unlike a citronblossom herself like them arrayed boldly in saffron and white like them looking the world in the face with calm consciousness that she was worth a look in return finally her world was theirsthat is to say these few acres of scented shade as yet naraini knew no other though the next day she was to leave it and her childhood in order to follow the unknown bridegroom to whom she had been married for twelve years the incessant throbbing of a tomtom the occasional blare of a horrible horn in the ruined arcade which was all that remained of a royal resthouse proclaimed that the marriage festivities were even now going on beyond the crumbling walls from all this naraini being necessarily excluded she had spent the morning in receiving the female visitors with simulated tears in order to impress them with her admirable culture thereinafter relapsing with them to shrillvoiced feminine chatter until the heat of noon stilled even the womens tongues then driven by an odd unrest she had slipped away to the cool alleys she knew so well even there busying herself with preparations since the flowers she gathered would be needed to strew the bridal bed it was no new task every year an old distiller came in blossomtime to set up his still beside the well then in the dewy dawns she and the old grandmother beat down the blossoms and when sunset brought respite from the heat naraini used to watch while the flowers were crushed into the pan and luted down with clay as if into a grave and a grave it was to beauty the first time she saw the yellow mash which was left after the sweetness had trickled into the odd assortment of bottles the old distiller brought with him she had cried bitterly but a whole bottle of orangeflower water as her very own had been consoling and the fact that the label proclaimed her treasure to be genuine old unsweetened gin did not disturb her ignorance every year afterwards the old man had given her another bottle and as she had always chosen a fresh label she had quite an assortment of them in the shed which served her as a playroom and now being nearly sixteen she was about to leave other things besides that row of bottles labelled encore dry monopole heidsiecker and chloric ether bitters she was not alarmed she had taken a peep at her future husband that morning and satisfied herself that he had the requisite number of eyes legs and arms for the rest men were kind to pretty girls and she knew herself to be a very pretty girl it is hard to convey any impression of the girls state of mind to english ears simply because marriage had never been presented to her as an occasion for personal choice she had been happy hitherto the possession of a husband ought to increase that happiness if fate sent her a pleasant motherinlaw the man himself was a trifle since men were always kind to pretty girls that formulated so plainly as to rob it of all offence was narainis first and last argument for content as she stood swaying in the shadow some one came down the alley she recognized him at once it was the bridegroom and the demon of mischief which enters into eastern girlhood as causelessly as it does into western suggested that she had him at an advantage he had not seen her since she was three years oldcould not possibly recognize her besides what brought him there an intolerable curiosity mingled with a pleasant conviction made her stand her ground perhaps she knew that the spot occupied by her was the only one visible from the roof of the arcade and drew her own conclusions perhaps she did not it was true nevertheless and the bridegroom having caught a glimpse of something attractive had taken advantage of the general sleepiness to climb over the ruined wall for a closer view for he was of those who are very kind indeed to pretty faces he it must be remembered had caught no consolatory glimpse of his bride people told him she was beautiful but that was always said but here was undoubted good looks so despite his weddingday on the morrow he slipped into the citron garden intent on a lark no more refined word expresses his mood so clearly naraini however neither shrieked nor giggled at the sight of a stranger she simply drew her veil closer and went on gathering citronblossoms he paused uncertain of everything save her entrancing grace was she only a servant or did he run risks in venturing closer naraini meanwhile behind her veil gurgled with soft laughter pleased at being able to test the value of her beauty on the man she meant to rule by it so they stoodshe in the shadow at one end of the alley he in the shadow at the other between them the scented path bordered by the runnels of water slipping by to bring a deluge to some portion of that little world some might have called it a pretty scene instinct with the joy of youth others might have turned their heads away praying to be delivered from the world the flesh and the devil naraini thought of nothing save her own laughter the garden seemed asleep save for those two as with the cruelty of a chase waking in him as in a cat stalking a mouse the cruelty of success waking in her as in a snake charming a bird the distance between them lessened suddenly with a burst of high childish laughter the veil full of citronblossoms was flung in his face and naraini was off down the alleys while he with anger added to admiration was after her the walls echoed to the soft thud of their flying feetdown one path up another round by the tomb scaring the parrots to a screaming wheel confident in her superior knowledge she paused on the topmost step ere scudding across the causeway to fling back a handful of flowers lingering in a fold he set his teeth hard if she tried short cuts so could he and he was round the next square so fast that she gave a little shriek and dived into the thickest part of the garden whither the water was flowing and where the beasts and birds and creeping things innumerable found a cool damp refuge his blood was upthe jade must be caught and kissed if only in revenge the flutter of her saffron skirt at the opposite side of a square made him try strategy he crept into the thickest undergrowth and waited something else waited not a footfall off but he did not see it his eyes were on that saffron flutter pausing advancing retreating pausing again naraini had lost the bearings of her pursuer and like a child playing i spy was on the alert for a surprise suddenly came a cry as she caught sight of him a shout as he bounded out both lost in a yell arresting her flight and his as if it had turned them to stone he stood with the wide nostrils and fixed eyes of ghastly fear clinging for support to the branch above him whence the flowers fell pattering to the ground on his ankle two spots of blood bright against the brown skin across the path a big black rope of a thing curving swiftly to the roses beyond snake snake her cry echoed his as she ran back to him but he struck at her with clenched hand go womanshedevil thou hast killed me curse thee oh curse thee for beguiling me it has bitten me holy gunga i am dead and i was the bridegroom tis thy fault i was the bridegroom he had sunk to the ground clasping his ankle and rocked himself backward and forward moaning and shuddering in impotent fear naraini stood by him there was no hope the big black rope of a thing did its work well yet even so anger was her first thought it was a lie tis not my fault why didst come why didst follow and if thou art the bridegroom was not i the bride then something leaped to memory she threw her hands above her head and beat them wildly in passionate despair and horror he is dead he is dead and i am the bride the words rang through the garden and pierced even his grovelling fear as he turned to fly he clutched at her skirts and dragged himself to her fiercely the bride then the widow my widow thou hast killed me but thou canst not escape me a widow a widow a widow his face was terrible in its fear its regret its revenge she fought against him desperately but his hands held fast shifting to her waist till he forced her down to the dust beside him where she crouched silent like a young animal terrified into acquiescence thou shalt see me dietis thy faultthou shalt see me die he muttered again and again so they sat side by side in the grip of death his head on her bosom his hands bruising her wrists his eyes full of despair and regret on her face the sunflecks shifted over them the citronflowers fell upon them as the afternoon breeze stirred the branches and even when the swift poison loosed his clasp naraini was still a prisoner to the dead body lying with its face of desire and disgust hidden in her lap she was a widow the citronblossom had fallen that night there was weeping and wailing instead of feasting in the garden and at dawn the women put bowls of sweetened milk into the scented thickets to propitiate the holy snake lest having chosen one victim it might seek a pair perhaps as far as happiness goes it might as well have claimed naraini also after a time to be sure life went on as before the old distiller came and naraini shook the blossoms for him into her widows shroud the sweetness of them was no less sweet as it trickled into the old gin and champagne bottles but naraini got no share of it what have widows to do with the perfumes of life this is an idle tale of a five minutes tragedyperhaps none the less of a tragedy because it is true nur jehan long agoso runs the storyin the days of king akbar mid the pearlytinted splendours of the paradise bazar young jehangir

broidery of flowers sat a girl half child half maiden dreaming oer the future hours wondring simply yet half guessing what the harem women mean when they call her fair and whisper you are born to be a queen curving her small palms like petals for a store of glistening spray gazing in the sunny water where her rippling shadow lay lips that ripen fast for kisses slender form of budding grace hair that frames with ebon softness a clear oval ivory face arched and fringed with velvet blackness from their shady depths her eyes shine as summer lightning flashes in the dusky evening skies mihr

headman of a circle of villages then youll give me a character wont you and say im a firstclass zaildar not a man of thems done half so much as old shurfu to please the sirkar why ive brought you full forty suspected ones that isnt bad as a haul look you forty suspected ones present and gone bail myself for them all and a word sahibfor your ear aloneif youd like me to bring a few more just to make a round fifty on paper and show that the works to the fore bismillah they never shall say while old shurfu is one of the crew that his district sahibs schedules were shaky for want of a budmash or two footnote bad character and what do i think of the system why just what the presence may choose but a good cattlethief nowadays must look after his ps and his qs there are many more folk to be squared and the hire of the bail to be paid but it makes the lads three times as careful and raises the style of a raid still the game as a game is no more for your reign has been death to all sport een a cattlethief thinks like a banker and scarcely gives honour a thought tis mere money grubpennies and farthings what i in my youth you have heard was a notedo fie on the presence it shouldnt believe such a word there are twentythree schools in my circle i pay all the government fees ive made a canal and a garden ive planted some thousands of trees ive headed the lists and subscriptions ive tried queer new crops on my land not a village of mine owns a dungheap my mares are all government brand not a hobby his district sahibs ridden but shurfu has ridden it too though the number of sahibs has been awful and every ones hobby was new well i dont mind a glass since theres nobody nigh you wont tell ill engage true the prophet forbids but he didnt know brandy and wasnt my age when a man turns of eighty there aint many sins he has strength to commit so his daybook can stand a few trifles aye wine wakes the memry a bit as for fuzla weve all heard of fuzlathe best cattlethief in punjab pooh you dont mean to say he neer met with a match on this side of chenab i could tell you a storywell half a glass morebut id best hold my tongue so mian fuzla had never his match come thats good why when we were both young what the deuce am i saying jehannam be mine but i cannot keep still ill tell how i swam the chenab in full flood yes by allah i will mian fuzla had squared th police on his side of the stream as one can with good luck but my cowards were cautious and hadnt the pluck of a man so mian fuzla got up in the bottle and sent me a message to say he had fiftythree head of my cattle and when would i take them away now the waters were out so the boast was scarce fair but i took up the glove and with mokhun and dittu to help that same night crossed the river above while they thought all secure but it wasnt so dawn found us stealing along with a herd of a hundred she buffaloes all of them lusty and strong well we made for the river through tamarisk jungle and tussocks of grass and narrowpathed tangle of jhau that would scarce let a buffalo pass with our thoughts on the footsteps behind till the first level streak of the light brought us down to the stream and by god it had risen ten feet in the night twas a broad yellow plain shining far in the rays of the sun as it rose and a cold wind swept over the flood that came hurrying down from the snows with a swift silent current in eddying swirlsnot a sound not a dash save a sudden dull thud as the bank undermined tumbled in with a splash then we looked at each other in silence the looks of the others said no but i thought of that challenge of fuzlas and made up my mind i would go though i knew that the odds were against me so bidding the cowards turn back with a few of the beasts on their traces and try hard to deaden the track for twas time it was time that i wantedi drove the rest down to the brink but the brutes wouldnt take to the water they loved life too well not to shrink so i took a young calf from its mothertwas cruel but what did i reck and butchered the brute with my hanger and fastened my pug round its neck then i dragged it right into the water and buoyed it up well round the throat with a bundle of grasses and reeds that would keep the dead body afloat i thought of that challenge of fuzlas then turned and struck out like a man while the mother leaped after her young one and all the rest followed the van the flood swept me down like a leaf and the calf swept me farther down still but i knew twas a life or death struggle and breasted the stream with a will while the hope i could lead the beasts on till twas safer before than behind and the fear lest mian fuzla should win were the only two thoughts in my mind it was half a yard forward to half a mile downward yet still i made way while behind in a long single file the black heads of the buffaloes lay till i knew we had reached the big stream and that now there was no going back then i gave one faint shout and i cast off the dead calf and let myself slack so we drifted and drifted and drifted i strove to recover my breath but a numbness came over my heart and i knew i was drifting to death as the big heavy beasts were swept past by the terrible force of the stream and the whole world seemed slipping away as i swam on alone in a dream then i wondered how fuzla would take it and how many miles i had come or guessed what the people would say when days passed and i never came home till it came to me as in a dream that the current was setting in shore and after that sahib it is strange i could never recall any more only this i can tell you we measured it after from starting to end and the distance was over ten miles by the straight without counting the bend so mian fuzla was beat and sent me a pugri with knots which his women had tied and the song of the crossing of shurfu is known through the whole countryside wah illah how my tongue has been wagging and i the zaildar but in sooth tis dull work for old shurfu compared to the merry mad days of his youth ji salaam and whatever you want send for shurfu the zaildar and sahib youll remember that fuzla once met with his match on this side of chenab songs of the people i plough song bitter blue sky with no fleck of cloud ho brother ox make the plough speed for the dear hearthmother with care is bowed as the hungry little ones round her crowd tis the buniyas belly grows fat and proud when poor folk are in need sky dappled grey like a partridges breast ho brother ox drive the plough deep for the wind may blow from the north or west and the hungry fledglings fall from the nest or the dear hearthmother fold hands in rest ere harvests ripe to reap clouds driving up in the teeth of the wind ho brother ox guide the plough straight for the dear hearthmother feeds halt and blind while the hungry little ones garlands bind round the tree where the dread one sits enshrined on whom we poor folk wait merry drops slanting from south and east ho

sheltering boughs gather and reap death is but sleep golden grain ripens though lovers are dead lips long for kisses but mouths must have bread blazing brass of the sky at noon broad bright face of the harvest moon slow stars wheeling to meet the morn toilers asleep on the sheaves of corn stealthy snake with the lifted crest poisoned prick in a tired breast gather and bind fate is but blind golden grain ripens though dear ones may weep love longs for gladness but toil must have sleep kine kneedeep in the glistening straw flocks of birds round the threshingfloor clouds of chaff from the
