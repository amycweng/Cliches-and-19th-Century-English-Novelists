coincident exclamations and their sequent apology were separated by a crash followed by a pause during which the two cyclists who had collided picked themselves out of the dust unhurt and looked quickly at their machines finally turning to each other with a smiling bienveillance born of relieffor there was no denying that the affair might have been serious and they were both conscious of sin it was my fault i was looking at the view said one of the two young men candidly he was a trifle the taller the broader and distinctly the better looking but they were both excellent specimens of clean wholesomelooking british manhood curiously alike also not only in feature but in resolute adherence to the conventional type but so was i returned the other his voice was the pleasanter not perhaps so resonant but with more modulation in it besides your machine is damaged and mine isntoh by george i hadnt noticed the pedal he added following the others look he bent for closer inspection then gave a laugh which was but half rueful in truth he was not altogether dissatisfied with this justice of providence about equalso well cry quits he said it means walking for us both said the other with a shrug are you going my way he nodded towards the blue depths of the valley which from this gap in the wavy outline of rolling hill where they stood dipped down to the distant sea that lay halfway up the sky like a level paleblue cloud the gap was the summit level between east and west as such a meetingplace for much water and many roads one of the latter meandered backwards over the wide stretch of pink bellheather and tasselled cotton grass which told of a catchment bog where even in fine weather the mountain mists dissolved into dew and the dew gathered itself into dark peaty pools like brown eyes among the tufted lashes of the bents and rushes and on either side of this central track two others curved down the rolling moor north and south to turn sharply behind a patch of gorse and boulders to join hands all three for the steep descent before them as if afraid of solitude in this new venture whence indeed had come the collision between the two cyclists each intent on a suddenly disclosed view there is no other wayexcept back on our tracesback to blackboroughgood lord came the reply the first speaker smiled so you are a blackberry alsowell it is an awful placeone can hardly credit up here that all the soot and dirt is onlysay a hundred miles off here one can breathe he looked as if he could do more than that as finally shaking himself free of the last speck of dust he prepared to start left nothing behind i hope said the other glancing back hullo theres a letter tumbled out of somebodys pocket in the stramashyours or mine it lay address upwards between them and the taller of the two with a brief mine picked it up and put it in his pocket his companion stared at him look here he said holding out his hand youve made a mistakethat letter belongs to meim edward cruttenden it was the others turn to stare the deuce you are whymy name is edward cruttenden they stood thus staring at each other with a sudden dim sense of their own similarity until the shorter of the two shook his head whimsically this is confusing he remarked in a tone of argument lets sit down and have a pipe over itwe shall have to differentiate ourselves before we start out into the world together almost at their feet a tiny trickle of water scarcely heard in its soft bed of sphagnum moss told that already the descent had begun but this was stayed a few feet further by a rocky hollow in which the stream gathered and brimmed so that as you looked out over the shallowing pool the rushes which fringed it stood out against the far distant blue of the sea beyond and there seemed no reason why the little lakelet should not take one wild leap into the ocean and so save itself many miles of weary journeying through unseen valleys on the brink of this pool their backs against a convenient boulder their legs on the short sweet turf that was kept like a lawn by the hungry nip of mountain sheep the two edward cruttendens rested smoked and compared notes somewhat dilatorily since the afternoon was fine and the effect of a sinking sun on moor and fell absolutely soulsatisfying lets differentiate our names somehow said the pleasantvoiced one lazilydid your godfathers etc do anything more for you than edwardmine didnt the other shook his head something in his handsome face had already differentiated itself from the amused curiosity on his companions thats awkwardwe shall be driven to abbreviations you shall be ted and i nedboth dentals but philologically uninterchangeable so theyll do for the present well ted since you are twentyseven and im gone twentynine and my father died before i was born we cant be complicated up as longlost brotherscan we ted turned to him frowning sharplyno butbut what put that into your head i ned laughed a laugh as musical as his voice but with a quaint aloofness about it as if he himself were standing aside to listen the position isromantic and novels have it so always as if it were not frankly impossible in this england of ours to dissociate one man from another by breedwere hopeless mongrels kin to each other all round birth counts for nothing so lets quit itupbringing ted interrupted shortlyii never knew my father and my mother died when i was born so did mine said ned softly there was a pause in which the luring wail of a circling plover who deemed the intruders too near her nest became insistent and seemed to fill the mountain solitude with a sense of motherhood until once more the musical critical laugh struck in on it come as shakespeare says theres sympathy for you so far we start fair educationi was at eton and i was a bluecoat boy interrupted ted again and something in his tone made ned look the other way and idly busy himself in trying to dissociate a tender trail of ivyleaved mountain campanula from its coarser companions in the turf a better education i expect he said at last though i admit the yellow stockings must be devilish stillhe paused settled himself yet more comfortably in his cleft and with clasped hands behind his head relapsed into smoke and silence even the plover convinced of their innocence had ceased her wheeling luring wail so desultorily sometimes in thought only sometimes by question and answer they sat trying to dissociate themselves from the tie of a common name and before them the afternoon sun slowly sinking towards extinction in the sea began to send level rays of light to fill up the valley with a golden haze in which all things lost their individuality finally ned sat up and knocked the ashes out of his pipe about equal i should say except of course for money that means we are unequal in all things remarked ted shortly you cant deny it a clerk as i am out for a whitsun holiday with ten pounds to spend on it in his pocket isntisnt in the same week withwell what shall i say a man who employs clerks suggested ned with a smile ted gave an impatient shrug as you will however you come by it you admit having a hundred pounds a hundred and ten i should say interrupted ned who was counting a handful of loose gold and silver ive a hundred in notes besides however that neednt be a difficulty the level golden sunrays flashed on a curved gold flight as a bright new sovereign flitted duckanddrake fashion over the brimming pool at their feet then disappeared leaving a circled series of ripples like a smoke wreath on its shiny surface hold hard i sayyou knowhere stop that will youdont be such a blamed fool there was imminent danger of a struggle in reality when a voice from the road behind them said with a mixture of appeal and authority do not quarrel see you my good fellows but tell me the cause of your disagreement and i will advise to the best of my ability the speaker also a young man of some thirty years was tall and dark with a jaw which should have been strong from its length but was curiously marred by the almost feminine softness of contour which belied the blue shadow of a hardshaven beard for the rest he had a fine pair of fiery dark eyes set close to the thick eyebrows which almost met on his high narrow forehead it was the face of a saint or a sinner preferably the former but whichever way the face of an enthusiast youre a parson said ned ceasing from horseplay and eyeing the rusty black suit so we will refer to you sir since you are bound by your cloth to agree with me and say that money is the root of all evil apprised of the cause of dispute the reverend morris pugh of the calvinistic methodist church in the valley below sat and looked doubtfully first at the loose gold and silver then at ned cruttendens critical blue eyes both appealed to him strongly the poetry of his race leapt up to meet the one the inordinate valuation of even a penny also typical of his race reached out to the other dont say it might be sold and given to the poor said ned with a sudden smileto begin with the remark has been appropriated by judas and then its such a rank begging of the question poor or rich the point at issue between usmy friend over there being a bit of a socialist is of course a bit of a mammon worshipper alsois whether gold isis a sovereign remedy i say not it doesnt touch the personal equation which is all we haveif we have that so i contend that neither i nor the world at large would suffer if i made ducks and drakes like this another curving flight of gold ended in a swift whitwhitter of lessening leaps and a final disappearance but this time the detaining hand was morris pughs his eager face held no doubt as to his desire though his mind evidently hesitated over a reason for it you really sir ought not he began then paused why asked ned quietly ted answered because it isnt really yours you never earned it ill bet and the wealth of the world is labour ned emptied his handful on the turf and interrupted him i give them up there they are your sovereign remedies what are you going to do with them why spend them to please yourselves of course as i was doing as every one does so i repeat it wouldnt matter a hang to the world or any of us three here present if i were to make a third sovereign would have followed the other two but for the arresting power of a new voice perhaps not but it would be a most distinct injury to one peter ramsay md so just hand it over will ye close behind them stood a sturdy thickset man with bright redbrown eyes and bright bronzered hair he had evidently come down one of the steep mountain sheeptracks leading his pony for it stood beside him now its hoofs half hidden in the moss while it stretched its inquiring muzzle towards the glittering pile of sovereigns as if suspicioning them as a new kind of corn welcome sir so far as i am concerned replied ned calmly but it isnt in any lack of claimants that our difficulty lies we have in fact too many our reverend friend wants the shekels why he would be puzzled to say since he preaches that they have no purchasing power for the one thing needful my namesake over there wouldnt be averse to them though he holds the possession of gold to be a crime i never said so broke in ted hotly excuse me it follows inevitably from your premise of equality that gives the coup de grace to lawful personal possession of anything since to possess means the having and holding of something extraneous to the personality whereas if every personality has an equal amount of any one thing that thing ceases to be a possession and becomes part of the personalitywhich of course is mere hairsplitting as for you doctor you also are illogical health and life are the goods you desire yet money is no remedy for disease and death practically i am the only one with a leg to stand upon i am a pleasure seeker pure and simple so as this gives me pleasurehere goes the third curved flight of gold finished his remarks so pointedly that silence fell upon all four as they looked out on the golden light haze which finding a mistwreath in its path had driven it all transmuted into gold to blot out both land and sea leaving nothing visible save that foreground of rippled brimming pool set in its fringe of rushes the peewit fearful once more lest the new comers should have keener eyes wheeled and wailed the pony dissatisfied with the sovereigns nosed and nibbled reflectively at the coarse grass and the delicate campanula ill tell you what cried ned suddenly his face showing a half scornful amusement let fate decide which of us needs money most he took out a pocketbook as he spoke and withdrew from it a sheaf of bank notes theres a hundred here and i dont want itthathe pointed to the cashwill carry me through for a week so my namesake and i could start fair together for a holidayif he chooses ill leave this therefore on deposit there is a convenient cleft in the rock over there and my tobaccopouch will keep out the damp he produced the latter also and began leisurely to exchange contents while the others gasped but sir you can never mean began the reverend morris pugh finding his voice firstto leave money here so close to the roadthink of the temptation to us certainly interrupted ned dryly but to no one else it is ours to take when we think the worldthat is of course ourselveswants itbut mind youwe are to say nothing about the taking to any one else in the world of course we agree to treat it aslet us say a sovereign remedy therefore were to use it only toto cure what we cant cure without it or think we cant cure amended peter ramsay with twinkling eyes my prescriptions are personal matters between me and my conscience the idea is fetching an unappropriated balance hardly unappropriated remarked ned caustically it is apparently hypothecatedas you scotch call it doctorto philanthropy for i suppose charity mustnt begin at home why not put in ned theres really no limitation of object or time any of us may withdraw the deposit tomorrow without notice to any one if he possess a solid conviction thatthat he cant do without it do you all agree there was a pause its dd rot said ted cruttenden at last sulkily but on those conditions i agree the reverend morris pugh looked abstractedly over the golden haze in which the whole world was hidden money is the root of all evil he began bosh interrupted dr ramsay springing to his feet im game i shall take that money if some of you arent too previous for the first real necessity ned cruttenden sprang to his feet also and laughed so will i if i can only make up my mind as to what constitutes a real necessity the two stood challenging each other then the redbrown eyes under the shaggy bronzered eyebrows softened not much ill allow very often bare life ned stooped to secrete the tobaccopouch murmuring il faut vivre pour moi je nen vois pas la necessite then he looked up there it is gentlemen very much at your disposal and now namesake we can start fairfor our walk to the first blacksmiths shop anyhow five minutes afterwards the golden haze had usurped even the still unrippled pool and the cleft in the rock while the four young men on the downward path were lost to view utterly chapter ii owen jones who in his leathern apron might have been a moyen age smith looked up and said something lengthy in welsh whereupon the eager alert little crowd which had gathered round on the chance of a new emotion echoed something else in welsh smiled nodded and looked sage well said ted impatiently the smith having no english the office of translator was taken up by morris pugh who with a certain appropriative courtesy had shown them all the beauties of the way with pardonable pride informed them effusively and charmingly of his past life his present opinions told them of his widowed mother with tears in his eyes of his clever young brother whose ambition was parliament with a thrill of pride in his voice and had finally introduced them formally to the smith as an elder of his chapel in about halfanhour they will be ready he says and see you owen jones is an excellent workman indeed here he raised his voice and looked round for approval none better i am sure no indeed assented isaac edwards who another elder had come from his merchants shop over the way to help on the general interest there will be none better than owen jones from pembroke to pwlhelli the largeness of this proposition suited the hearers it reflected credit on themselves their clan their country so the quarrymen off duty from their piles of slaty shale among the oak woods and the boys off school this saturday afternoon smiled and saluted quasimilitary fashion as the two cruttendens moved off to seek tea in the little inn where a cycle club sign was nearly hidden in a massive cotoneasterall red berries and white blossomswhich covered the walls from roadway to gable here they bid goodbye to the reverend morris pughs good offices he was due ere long in chapel for choir practice and prayer meeting as he said so the unction came into his voice which was noticeable whenever he touched on his profession it was as if some necessity for shibboleth arose in him as if some claimnot altogether naturalhad to be considered indeed he had lingered a moment to say that prayer was needful everywhereeven in the peaceful hamlet of dinasprayer for some outpouring of the spirit this whitsuntide week there had been no special manifestation at present but one might come any momentthe lords mercy being nigh to all them that feared him let them remember that so having said his word in season he changed his manner wished them good luck heartily and thus left them to their own company for the scotch doctor who had also proved a pleasant acquaintance had branched off at the bridge some half a mile up the hill from the little hollow in which dinas hid itself modestly among the trees but you could see where the bridge lay because of the startling redandwhite school beside it which looked as if it had sprung like diana from joves brain fully armed for education out of the bare hillside ted looking through the inn window as they waited for tea saw it and the problem as to why it had been built so far away from the village a problem which morris pugh had evaded recurred to him i should say because the sitebelonged to some one said ned coolly these things will happeneven to boards they are part of our commercial standardcaveat emptor and in this case the purchaser being the publicwell we dont think of the public as our neighbour no the public is an ill dog in temperance walesespecially amongst the calvinistic methodists the parson though is a good sorthe didnt fancy the subject not as he fancied the welsh motto over the door laughed ted by george how he let out about foreign languages and wales being a conquered country i had to drop reason and the norman invasion or thered have been a row he was awfully like ffluellenwhat a genius shakespeare was yes he understood and you dont i tell you wales is the most ripvanwinkleish place in the world you can go to sleep in a fifteenthcentury farm and wake up the day after tomorrow in an intermediate school ive been in india and it reminds me awfully of the national congress but i like it though it is fatiguing to any one with a hankering after fact still if there was a little more waterthere is none in summer time you knowand a little less rain a little more right and a trifle less righteousness it would do very well righteousness echoed ted theres enough of that anyhow two four six eight eight belfries to how many souls in the villagefour hundred all told thats only four chapels the others are sunday schools ill betthe macleods must have a boat o their ain then theres the churchthat ruin up yonderitll have a school too but teds attention was diverted i say he remarked thats a ripping girl she had come out of a cottage a little way from the inn to intercept morris pugh and was engaging him in a lively conversation despite his hurry she was tall dressed in black that glinted and the fact that her hair was in curling pins did not interfere with her very voyante good looks hm remarked ned coming over to see reminds me of last mondayi mean bank holiday doesnt she the sarcasm was just but it brought a faintlyannoyed flush to his companions face he knew himself to be a lower bred man and the other edward cruttenden had a trick of reminding him of this and of certain other facts which given fair choice he would probably have forgotten so the village was left to its own devices till tea was over when he took his pipe to the window again barring the prices which whip an international exhibition he remarked this would be a jolly headquarters spot that big hilleye of the world the parson called it didnt heis ripping this time the word lost its inherent triviality before the dignity of those receding curves of sunshine shown by shadow which swept up to the lightsmitten crest of the great mountain personally remarked ned drily i find the view of the smithy morenow dontit isnt the least good fussingits the village teatime and not all the kings horses but ted and his bad words were off hammering at the closed doors and finally running the smith to earth having tea comfortably on an oak dresser hung with lustre jugs it was a very small but highly decorated cottage this of the smith showing uneducated artistic cravings in many things in a harmonium endless cheap photograph frames china enormities a few glazed certificates in welsh to one myfanwy jones and here and there a priceless bit of staffordshire ware then ensued a deadlock for the smith scenting coercion flared up instantly in welsh and ted conscious of breach of contract grew abusive in english till suddenly from above came a full high voice i will come down when i have finished dressing pray sir accommodate yourself with a cup of tea then followed shrill welsh exordiums to the smith which resulted in a cheerful smile as he reached down another cup ted took it also a piece of bread and butter feeling he could do nothing else and as he sat waiting the feminine voice continued upstairs a conversation which apparently had been going on when he had burst into the cottage though he had been too illused to notice it if you do not want the hat alicia edwards you can oblige by replacing in the box but you will be dowdy beside the other girls at choir holiday and mervyn will not look at you twice no indeed and it is but oneandtwenty shillings dirt cheap be wise and buy see you shall have it for a pound and you can pay when you marry mervyn mary choked a softer more emotional voice ah i only want him to look at me ah myfanwy i do you think he could if you do not care for the height in front you can wear it hindside before it is even just so fashionable went on the first voice regardless of sentiment put it on child and dont be so foolish what is a pound and you a pupil teacher there you look beautiful now give me my hat pins i must go to that man downstairs a froufrou of silk petticoats on the ladder stairs which led up from a corner of the living room made ted look round he saw first a pair of manystrapped beaded black shoes with superlatively high heels next an interval of trim black openwork stockings finally in a tourbillon of laced silk flouncings over which it let down a trailing black satin dress a vision in which ted at once recognised the girl in curling pins or rather her apotheosis for she was now glorious both within and without her beautiful figure was literally cased in a tight bodice which looked as if she must have been melted and run into it ere it could be so guiltless of wrinkles the heavy lace yoke with which it was made showed the whiteness of her skin beneath it a whiteness which held its own against the double row of false pearls about her neck for the rest she was planned laid out developed in exact accordance with a paris model in a shop in one hand she held a most irresponsible creation which ted almost diagnosed as a hat though it had neither crown nor brim and in the other a perfect sheaf of long blackheaded pins she smiled at him with frank favour and saying carelessly the smith my father will attend to you sir when he has had tea passed on to a little mirror on the wall placed the irresponsible creation on her tumultuous yet disciplined waves of hair in the very last position of which any sane creature would have dreamt and proceeded apparently to stick the long pins through her head seeing however in the glass teds face of angry consternation she flashed round on him tartly yet condescendingly it is no use trying to hurry dinas they are country people not like london or blackborough this is not williams and edwards or such like place i can tell you the name of the biggest drapery firm in blackborough gave ted a clue to some of his perplexity i see he said slowly thats how you come to beyou are in the shop of course arent you she was by this time dexterously rolling back her veil preparatory to tieing it behind her chin held down to keep it in position so her dark eyes had full play as she retorted that she was second in fact in the mantle departmentbecause of her figure she displayed it lavishly in manipulating her veil smiling the while at her own consciousness of perfection ted smiled also the big bold beautiful animal was distinctly fetching he said something to that effect which made her giggle you should pass your time coming to choir practice she said challenging him again quite frankly when after much shrill welsh with her father the latter stuck to two hours as his shortest limit for repair i sing in chapel when i am on holiday still my musicmaster was the great taleisinthat is his bards name of courseand alicia edwards here has won so many times in competition the last sentence introduced a girl who had just come downstairs with a display of white lace stockings and thereinafter a blue dress surmounted by an extremely smart hat possibly the one over the purchase of which myfanwy jones had spent her eloquence the girl was fair and pretty but there was about her that marked lack of personal grip on her surroundings which is so noticeably a result of eleven years and more of strict board school life for alicias father had marked her out as a pupil teacher when she joined the infant class at three that had been her ambition till she secured the position at sixteen now at seventeen at seventeen she blushed and giggled when myfanwy went on she will sing with mervyn pugh our ministers brother he is a very good looking young manjust so good looking as you to which obvious challenge ted said something which changed the giggle to a titter after which he left them feeling a trifle uncertain as to the result of a reference to ned he found him lying flat on his stomach on the bridge which spanned the stream again a little further down the village watching so he said for even a shadow of a trout in the deep pool below it a pool which after the long spring drought was only connected to the next one by a mere driblet of water do echoed ned looking up at ted with a twinkle in his eyes excelsior of course he waved his pipe towards the worlds eye still shrugging high shoulders in the sunshine and away from miss myfanwy jones who was standing with alicia edwards at the gate of her fathers neglected cabbagepatch buttoning her grey suede gloves with a hook from her silver chatelaine her face showed beautiful unconsciousness though her eyes were on the alert ted hesitated then from a larger cottage emerged the reverend morris pugh very spick and span accompanied by a younger man evidently by his looks the handsome mervyn but the forehead fringe which after the fashion of young wales he wore was too much for ted it looked exactly as if it also had been in a curling pin and feeling vaguely that he would rather not be seen by ned in its company he laughed said excelsior by all means and led the way taking off his hat to the charmer as he passed five minutes afterwards pausing for breath their first spurt upwards done the village lay behind them looking solitary in its close cohesion of cottages and trees but from the church all ivymantled amid its wide graveyard a bell was clanging and across the grassy mounds dotted with stones a tall figure in a black cassock and a biretta cap made its way to the vestry door the voice of one crying in the wilderness remarked ned but he has the bell ringer for congregation and even miss myfanwy jones will come back to the old churchyard in the end as her fathers have done for a penny funeral then he laughed i shall never forget my scotch groom he paused ted eyed him curiously well he said oh nothing only his criticism on a welsh funeral was scathing there was no a drop o whisky an they asket me tae pit inter the brod insult on injury so laughing they made their way upwards through black land and bog through thickets of unimaginably tall brake and over sparse closebitten knolls the sheep flying in disorder from them like a routed army a stonechat starting from the gorse giving them a momentary thought of gamea thought no more and the sunshine mounted with them chased by the shadow so that it came upon them by surprise when they reached the summit to see the valley below them veiled in soft purple and the sun itself not far from setting behind an ominous low level of cloud which lay far out to seaward it has taken longer than i thought said ned stretching himself flat on his stomach but there is plenty of time plenty echoed ted crosslegged like a turk as he knocked out the ashes of his pipe on a stone weve done the gingerbeer woman anyhow remarked ned after a pause she comes there he pointed to a hovel of stones a few hundred yards further along the plateau from the llangolley side seven am till seven pm during tourist time the innkeeper said i wonder how she spends her day then half to himself he added as if this wasnt meat and drink enough for any one it should have been far and near cleft by the purpling shadow from below the higher hilltops dissociated themselves from the lower ones shining rosy resplendent giving back the sun its parting gift royally yet yielding bit by bit to the swift storming uprush of shadow another and another picket of light stood broke fled from the foe to some higher refuge until the last steadfast post of the worlds eye remained alone above a world of shadow remained alone a vantageground of clear vision above the wide cup of amethyst hills in which the floodtide of the sea lay prisoned so still so serene so silvery lulled to unresisting sleep as a captive bride might be by love for the surpassing beauty of those embracing arms beyond over the broad belt of darkening ocean the sun was just dipping into the bar of cloud leaving a flame upon the sky we must wait and see the last of it said he upon the grass suddenly and the other nodded up and up breathlessly crept the light on the patch of bracken in the hollow rallying round a spur of rock flying for a fresh stand across a shaly slope so holding its own for an instant against a scarp driven over the ledge neds hand went out to touch it but found it behind him so turning swiftly he saw the last flicker of sunlight resting ere final flight on a yellow placard ginger beer d he started to his feet damn it all he cried fancy finding that ultimate sixpence here sixpence queried ted rousing himself from a day dream ah i was thinking of the hundred pounds you left over yonder it really is dd rot you know whats to hinder my claiming itwellsay tomorrow morning youve time now if you wish it assented ned and if the thunderstorm as he spoke there came a quiver of light far out over the hidden sea it seemed to come from below the threshold of the visible world like the sudden gleams from the beyond which at times irradiate the mind of man with some infinite message ted turned round startled at the greyness that was fast settling down on hill and sky we had better get down as sharp as we can he cried hastily taking his bearings i think if we try to the left a little we shall get down the rocky part before dusk makes going difficult once again however the short cut proved the longer way the path grew more and more hopeless until after scrambling down an almost precipitous corrie they found themselves brought up on a jutting spur by a thirty feet drop as the only onward way itsits muttered ted as he satisfied himself they must go back worth it remarked ned for the jag of rock on which he stood overhung a wilderness of grey shadow and grey water the grey hills watching the grey water recede from the shores leaving behind it still greyer patches of sand that rose roundly from the level reaches of the ebbing tide he stood long after ted had started upward watching also and thinking how like these billowy sandbanks were to a drowned womans clothes some goddess of the earth surely lay dead there her body compassed by the hills i say arent you coming came his companions shout we havent time to lose look there a vivid flash of lightning shot beyond the deep bank into the rolling clouds that were coming up swiftly with the rising wind and more quickly than one would have expected a low mutter of thunder caught the crags in monotonous echoes go on ill soon catch you up shouted ned in return and he did so for there was a lightness a certain stress of action about his every movement which differentiated him from his companions more deliberate steadiness the wind rose at every gust and in the fast growing dusk the sheep sought shelter behind rocks and boulders for the night yet still the downward path could not be found we had best follow the stream yonder said ned at last it will be longer but it will take us down eventually and i dont want to camp out with my pipe in that storm the first drop or two of rain emphasised his advice but it was no easy task to follow it with the mist closing in on all sides then darkness came bringing a perfect deluge with it they could scarcely see the stones at their feet except when with the sudden summer lightning the whole world of hill and dale and sea was revealed to them for a second then shut out again as if in obedience to the immediate rollcall of the thunder but they were young and it was soft warm rain so with many a slip and tumble and many a laugh they made way somehow pausing at length to leeward of a large rock to light a fresh pipe and look at the time half past ten exclaimed ted whod have thought it he spoke joyously for his pulses were bounding with the vitality due to the exercise of mind and body i should replied ned im beastly hungry howeverhere a brilliant flash gave them the world again i believe thats the bottom down there the vision of a stream in flood surging through a lowlying wooded valley not far beneath them was certainly the bottom but it was nearer twelve oclock than eleven ere they found level footfall and that only on the brink of the stream to cross or not to cross became the question they referred it to the next flash of lightning a long wait in the darkness for the storm was passing the rain had ceased when it came it showed them an oasis of field a clump of trees and something amongst them which might or might not be a human habitation the point was settled however the next moment by the sudden twinkle of a wandering light quite close on the other side it stopped dead at their view halloo then retreated evidently at a run to reappear nevertheless almost immediately in company with a remonstrant voice clear pleasant decided boggles it said there aint no sech things as boggles ive told ee so a dozen times adam and i wont ave it said so there why martha woman im none fur sayin twas boggles fur sure it might a bin a screech howl but lud elp uswhats that the light was evidently snatched at and held aloft then it came forward a step and the voice rose in angry scorn get yer gone you lazy goodfornothin welsh libetynes i tell you shes gone and right glad was i to get quit o her an impident lass that frivlous her ead wouldnt old nothing but you young sparks i beg your pardon called ned interrupting the flow of wrath but we have lost our way and being drenched through want to know well i never came the voice its owner grasping the situation at once here adam man take the light an show the gentle folk across the ford an ill just run back and see to things five minutes later escorted by an applecheeked man of about fifty they were entering a cottage where the fire had evidently been newly brushed up a kettle put on and a few hurried touches added to already existing tidiness by an applefaced woman forty or thereabouts she bobbed them a truly primeval curtsey dear sakes gentlemen you must be through to your vests adam set a cheer for the gentle folks man adam and me was just after the hifer sir shes down calvin an they lays like lead on me till its over that they do an adam is such a heavy sleeper but there two of a sort cant live together no they cant this calm philosophic treatment of him brought a halfconscious giggle from adam and she passed on to treat of other subjects in like manner the village hm not much of a place for sleepin in an a good mile anyhow with the bridge locked better a hayloft to yourself than some of them cottages as for supper they wouldnt get nothin fit for gentle folk to eat she could see what shed got an meanwhile adamd show them the loft and bring em over pillows an blankets theyd dry easy in the hay while the clothes hung andy on the rafters or adam could bring em back to the fire when he tuk over supper not but what it was perhaps better to ave somethin to put on in case o fire a quarter of an hour afterwards having made a most excellent meal of cold beefsteak pie and tea which they were assured was better to keep a chill off than beer they duly put out the lantern with which they had been bidden to be real careful because of the yay and listened to the clear dispassionate voice saying as its owner passed the loft you go ter yer bed adam an sleep while you can shes passed midnight and it wunt come now till dawn but i aint the mind to sleep they lies too heavy poor dears that woman said ned from his blanketed bed in the hay ought to have been a field marshal or a prime minister there was absolute conviction in his voice chapter iii they found the summer sun had been at work for some hours on the stormdrenched world ere they woke to the lowing roar of the heifer from the neighbouring cowhouse motherhood had evidently come to her at dawn bringing its wider outlook its larger self and sure enough when they scrambled down from the loft they found at the foot of the ladder penned in by an old door a big black bullcalf lustily answering anxiety by assertion the cottage over against them howeverit formed part of a long range of farmsteadings which stretched right away to the stream they had crossed the night beforeshowed no sign of life the door was closed the windowblinds down the inmates were most likely sleeping sound after their broken rest so their clothes being still damp the two young men went up stream to a long deep pool and spreading them out to dry in the hot sunshine had a morning bath thereinafter drying themselves in the same fashion on a grassy bank whence looking up the valley they could see the mountains closing in on the narrow strip of level pasture behind them the downward view was absolutely shut out by the farmbuildings above which showed a yew tree and by a dense clump of rhododendrons which trended away until it met the other wooded hillside of the little glen i believe we are really on an island remarked ted critically appraising the values of some willows and elders which higher up beyond the pasture fields seemed to betoken another channel of water a desert island said ned busy over the intricacies of cold water and a razor from his shoulderwallet we are reduced to the makeshifts of primitive manhood what more do we wantand all without that hundred pounds i never slept better than i did in that hay small blame to you with feather pillows and best whitney blankets and as for moneywe shall have to tip these people i suppose halfacrown will do ahem replied ned somewhat doubtfully but it was beastly late you know very but that wasnt our doing they were up with the hifer however lets put it at three shillings but my dear fellow consider the beefsteak pieit was simply the best pie charge it to appetite said ted rising ready dressed supple clean and strong three shillings is ample come along if youre ready and let us get off im keen to start he looked it but the starting was not so easy for though on trial the door of the cottage was found to be on the latch only no one could be made to hear lets leave the tip on the table suggested ted impatiently my dear fellow replied ned i wont go without seeing the general and thanking her for that excellent pie besidesthink how she simply scooped us up last night like halfdrowned kittens and set us going again i tell you sir that ifit being saturday nightshe had suggested washing my head id have submitted meekly as i used with old nurse why i dreamt about frilled drawers all last night ted was irresponsive a word had arrested his attention saturday he echoed thoughtfully then today is sunday first sunday after whitsunno trinity sunday of course the shortest night in the year and midsummer nights dream all combined how time flies what luck gloomed ted i shouldnt wonder if the smith were to refuse us our cyclesthey are like that in these wild partswhat beastly bad luck here ned who had been prospecting at the back of the passage opened a door suspecting it to be possibly a coalcellar but he fell back from the sudden blaze of almost blinding sunlight which poured in from a long low absolutely empty room which stretched away on either side over boards scrubbed to whiteness to a wide oriel window at that on the lefthand side stood a parrotperch beside which was a tall girl in blue engaged in making a white cockatoo with a yellow crest talk gimme a sixpence it muttered hurriedly as the bit of banana turned away with the girl at the interruption so for a second or two they stood the two young men smitten helpless by the extreme beauty of that girlish figure framed as it was by the great sprays of white june clematis and great trusses of scarlet ivy geranium from the garden beyond the window gimme a sixpence gimme a sixpence reiterated the cockatoo in guttural allurement then the girl smiled you must have been very wet last night im afraid she said in an absolutely perfect voice true pure sweet the real voice of the siren which none who hear forget the two at the door who stood bareheaded almost doubting the evidence of their own eyes gave an audible sigh of relief this was no vision then this beauty of womanhood pure and simple with softly smiling eyes and yet they glanced at each other doubtfully and the three shillings in teds palm seemed suddenly to become hot and scorch him impossible to offer three shillings to perfection thank you yesi mean noi mean that we were wet quite wetbut now thanks to the kindness of your ned paused much as he admired the general he could not affiliate to her this radiant creature ted becoming conscious vaguely that here was something new to him something which held possible danger to his outlook in life remembered his hurry and came to the point we are very much obliged and so if you please as we are about to start we should likei mean if you here absolute terror lest ted should really offer those three shillings to the glorious creature in the first flush of a womanhood which seemed to ned to be worth the whole world made him step forward holding out a shining sovereign weve really been most awfully comfortable he said apologetically and if youif you wouldnt mind giving this why she exclaimed all eagerness snatching at the coin i believe its a sovereign fancy that a whole sovereign ned felt outraged at her indecent haste and at the back of teds brain lay an instant regret concerning the three shillings he would then only have been responsible for one and sixpence instead of ten shillings suddenly she held the coin up to the window laugheda rippling laugh like running waterand handed it back again thanks for letting me see it i hadnt seen one before but as grandfather says it blocks the sunlight just like a penny youyou hadnt seen a sovereign said ned feebly she shook her head we dont have money in this house grandfather doesnt hold with it not hold with it echoed ted argumentatively but you mustyou must pay your debts and we want to pay ours her face grew serious ah you want to pay something thats marthas business here martha these gentlemen want to pay you a sovereign at an inner door the figure of the general appeared with floury arms and her prim bob curtsey hope the hifer didnt disturb of you gentlemen she said cheerfully but really there aint nothing owin let alone a sovereigns worth but there must be something and we tried to find you before but you were asleep protested ned in an aggrieved tone asleep lord save us laughed martha why adam bein that sound after the calvin i was over to the loft myself three times afore i come in to my stove but there aint nothin the yay was ome grown and welcome seeing twas but beddin stuff at best and none spoilt for use by humans sleepin on it a faint chuckle showed her sense of superiority but there was the beefsteak pie began ned marthas giggle increased twouldnt never ave kep sweet over sunday sir so the pigs ud ave ad it if you gentlemen adnt that was an unanswerable argument will you please take it back said the girl imperiously holding the gold out in the easy clasp of her finger and thumb but there was the teaand the pillows and the blankets protested ted severely she turned on him swiftly dont you hear martha doesnt want it and i dont want it so if you dont want it also wed better give it to cockatua for im tired of holding it here cockatua is a golden sovereign for you the birds great yellow crest rose with greed as it grabbed at the prize but fell again at its first hasty bite the beady black eyes showed distrust it turned the coin round and bit at it again then again finally with a guttural murmur of gimme a sixpence it dropped the sovereign deliberately into its bread and milk tin every one laughed martha however checking herself with a hasty drat them scones theyll be burnt as black as the back o the grate and disappearing whence she came her voice calling back in warning to miss aura not to forget the masters message aura questioned ned quickly thats not a very appropriate my name is aurelia she said quite frankly and the message is that grandfather would like you to breakfast with him i think you had better she added still more frankly for you mightnt get anything in the village its sunday you know they glanced at each other mechanically though each had decided to accept the invitation so she led them through the kitchen where martha was bustling about over her stove into a hall this further house had evidently been joined on to the back of the cottage by the long room in which the cockatoo lived we breakfast in the verandah said aurelia turning to the left into a large lowroofed room lined from floor to ceiling with books but containing no other furniture save a chair and a writingtable the glimpse afforded by the open halldoor showed them that teds surmise had been correct they were on an island for to the right of the garden a stream after dashing over some rocks disappeared behind the high wall enclosing the orchard which filled up the end of the valley while as they passed on through the book room a lawn lay before them sloping down to a deep still pool a pool shadowed by surely the biggest yewtree they had ever seen its great arms spread themselves out and bowed to earth by their own weight found a fresh foothold for another upward spring until the one tree seemed a grove here in a sunny square formed by the joining of house and steading walls they found a breakfasttable and beside it in an armchair an old man with a thin face and florentinecut silverwhite hair excuse my rising gentlemen he said in a high suave voice his nervous hands gripping the chairarms in rather a helpless fashion but i am somewhatmore or lessof a cripple at timesi suffer from rheumatism and last nights rain might have made us rheumatic also but for your kindness began ned politely not at all not at allmartha does all that sort of thing wellan excellent creaturereally an excellent creature but alas quite devoid of intelligence said their host and his large restless pale blue eyes which from the smallness of his other features dominated his face took on a remonstrant expression that was curiously obstinate yet weak yes he continued absolutely devoid of brains one of those hewers of wood and drawers of water by desire and determination who stand soso infernallyin the way of true socialistic development but by the way i am forgetting to introduce myself i am sylvanus smith presidentbut stay aurelia my child fetch the syllabus of the socialistic congress from my writingtable that will be the best introduction and here comes martha with i presume breakfast we generally have a parlourmaid butthe remonstrant expression came to his face againmartha is somewhat hard on maids sheshe doesnt believe in perfect freedom of soul and body so the last left yesterday inin a flame of fire the young men of the village ned laughed we know about that sir we were taken last night for lazy goodfornothin welsh libertynes mr sylvanus smith appeared shocked i really must speak to martha he said in an undertone adding aloud well martha what have you there the question was provoked by the setting down of a silver dish among the fruits nuts and other vegetarian diets on the table and there was a certain tremulous authority in it the subservience of marthas bob was phenomenal bacin an eggs sir an theres more ter follow if required the authority dissolved into an illassured cough as a rule remarked mr smith helplessly we do not allow meat but lor sir put in martha beaming wasnt it jest a providence as me and adam had left that bit o beefsteak pie seeing that strawberries an sech like are but cold comforts to stummicks as has bin drenched through by storm there could be no reply but acquiescence to this proposition so the strangers began on the bacon and eggs mr sylvanus smith breakfasted off some patent food and aurelia ate strawberries and brown bread and drank milk they seemed to have got into her complexion and hairat least so thought ned the clematis wreaths the great bosses of the scarlet geraniums hung round them the great yewtree shot out fingers of shadow claiming the lawn and actually touching one of the jewelled flowerbeds while behind these tall larkspurs and lychnis their feet hidden in a wilderness of bright blossom rose up against the rows of peas and raspberries in the kitchen garden and the green of young apples in the orchard against this paradise of flower and fruit they saw aurelia like any eve beautiful healthful gracious smiling and they lost both their hearts and their heads promptlyfor the time being at any rate they looked at her by stealth in the long silences which were perforce the fate of mr sylvanus smiths guests for he could talk and talk as he wrote well of the future of socialism and the happiness of the many oblivious altogether of the happiness or unhappiness of the few that was being worked out in his immediate neighbourhood that did not trouble him in the least whether from happiness or unhappiness past present or to come the two young men were singularly silent as after being piloted by adam through the rhododendrons and across the drawbridge they left the island paradise behind them that was a beautiful garden said ted very remarked ned then they were silent again but they thought persistently of aurelia of her beauty her unworldliness her curious frank dignity and the shrewd commonsense she had shown in every word she uttered the road to the village led through a wood at first a woodas such welsh mountain woods are at midsummerall lush with fern and bramble and great drifts of foxglove envious of each others height and holding their heads higher upon the narrowing clefts until some very ordinary spike gaining a vantage of rock outtops the rest and so lords it over all then after a while the wooded slopes closed in to rock here the divided streams rejoined each other with a quick babble of recognition and as if out of sheer good spirits gave a gladsome leap or two ere settling down to race hand in hand through a ravine but a few feet below the curving road finally a precipitous bluff blocked the view but round this at a sharp turn ted paused hullo he said why here we are again they were at the bridge by the crossroads where they had parted with dr ramsay the day before on the bare hillside stood the school deserted this sunday morning below them lay the village over yonder was hidden the hundred pounds of floating depositteds eyes sought this out immediately over there still shrugging that high shoulder of his in the sunshine was llwggdybrydd disclaimingso ned thoughtall responsibility for their last nights adventure a real midsummer eves dream indeed and tonightmidsummer nightwould the adventure continue it was two oclock was it he said for dinner asked ted irrelevantly he knew the hour perfectly but he wanted to discuss the question two oclock if the cycles couldnt be got corrected ned gravely of course replied ted impatiently and we will go and ask ned suddenly burst out laughing why the deuce should we ask youd rather dine and so would i thats simplicity itself besides we can go to church or chapel and confess the sin of omission meanwhileif you like ted looked at him with gloomy virtue of course we must askat any rate i shall he replied haughtily he felt in his way exactly as his companion did that is as if every atom of life in him had been stirred to its depths but conventional morality and solid fact meant more to him than they did to ned the smith mercifully was kind it had been too late to finish repairs on saturday they must wait over till monday so in a blissful state of relief they sat on the bridge parapet again and watched the country folk come in to chapel the calvinists take the cake in dress remarked ned half the big drapery shops in blackborough belong to them im told and they give a percentage to their assistants so i expect misswhats her namejones is responsible for half the hats here ye gods what a superstructure for one soul as he spoke he watched a carrottyhaired girl with a brickred burnt face who wore both inside and outside a leghorn hat a wreath of crushed roses shaded from beetroot to carrots myfanwy said ted lightly is equal to the burden here she comes with the parson and miss alicia has the beautyboy mervyn how happy could both be with eitheri wonder how they grow those curls he spoke with lazy scorn but by and by the sound of partsinging instinct with swing and go roused him for he had sung in a choir all his life and after vainly trying to persuade ned to accompany him he went off to listen leaving the latter stretched out full length on the parapet watching for invisible trout after a time however the old churchyard in its turn attracted neds lazy interest and he strolled off to examine the tombstones they stood cheek by jowl and to judge by the dates on many must represent a perfect battlefield of dead if all the parish came thither to rest some lettering over a low round arch of a sunk door in the church arrested him fourteen hundred and fiftytwo no wonder the place looked ruinous and that he had to step down into the porch here his eye took in various framed regulations in red and black signed gawain meredith rector evidently the reverend gawain was high and was that a smell of incense he set aside the curtain and stood under the organloft here surprise held him motionless everything was so new so gilded so flawless there was a blaze of red and white on the altar before which a tall figure in red and white attended by two acolytes knelt reading the antecommunion service from them scattered sparsely over regulation oak benches was a surpliced choir four boys on either side coming down as it were to meet a huge brass lectern and a red embroidered faldstool but the congregation six or seven may be in dark corners or rather since some one must play the organ eight no for the celebrant after giving out a hymn strode to a harmonium close to the pulpit and thereinafter upborne by his strong baritone a longdrawn sacramental chant wavered in the aisles and died away in the rafters of the roof what then of the organ ned turned crept up the stair without waking an old manthe bellringer no doubtwho was asleep in his longaccustomed seat beside the blowhandle and found himself before the usual redcurtain screen seating himself on the organ stool he looked out unseen on the church below it was quaint there was the reverend gawain in the pulpit giving out his text there came a mighty rushing wind and looking out over his church as if it had been full instead of empty there were some said the preacher who expected signs and wonders direct from the almighty but the great rushing mighty wind was the teaching of the church which had begun on whit sunday and would go on throughout the year it was a mighty voice indeed sounding in the ears of all his parishioners even those who were absent and it spoke through him their priest responsible to the church for the soul of every man woman and child in the parish of dinas seven minutes by neds watch of unbounded authority of absolute priesthood of the middle ages ned watching the dignity of the reverend gawain merediths denial of the passage of time became admiring and he was such a fine figure of a man the old type chief medicine man druid archbishoparchangel if you willalways the same in all ages ned wandered off into thoughts such as men of his type have had since the beginning of time and was roused from them by seeing the priest holding a huge sacrificial brass platter awaiting the sheepish sidesman at the chancel steps by all that was holyone pennyonly one the sidesmans own but its poverty was covered the next instant by the rectors sovereign well done to the rector what an imagination what a magnificent makebelieve something in neds innermost soul leapt up to meet this escape from deadly reality it deserved a recognition yes as the man couldnt play himself out of church he wouldthe organ was there in sudden impulse he laid an awakening hand on the drowsy sexton blow he whispered strenuously blow i tell you for all youre worth the man halfasleep obeyed ned opened the keyboard and not knowing his instrument put on full diapason thus when the last amen had echoed out from the rector for the choir appeared to be dummies and the cope and the brass platter began to follow the little white surplices the whole procession paused in amazement as with many a note dumb many a dissonance overborne by the full burst of sound handels lift up your heads oh ye gates crashed into every corner of the old church crashed for the first two bars then the pressure on leaky bellows yielding wavered and sank ned realising his failure was down the loft stairs through the graves and over the back of the churchyard wall where he lay convulsed with inextinguishable laughter at his own mad prank before curiosity followed the amazement in the church as the last breath of air escaped in a longdrawn pipe from a stuck note in the treble it was some time ere seeing the chapel folk coming out he made his way round at the back of the rectory wood and joined ted whom he found enthusiastic about the singing and glad to have heard the reverend morris pughs hwl the bardic note it was really rather impressive that constant iteration of the aflat and even to one ignorant of welsh gave a feeling of something being desperately wrong of something needing desperately to be set right but there had been no outpouringnothing out of the common you should have said ned and paused what asked ted nothing except that it must be about time for us to be going backto paradise chapter iv aurelia in a blessed white frock looking like a botticelli angel was in the garden talking to old adam she received their halfhearted apologies for return with a fine superiority of course she said we all knew you were coming martha was unkind enough to kill a beautiful white chicken for you and there is raspberry tart and curds and cream oh yes and i made a spongecake for tea so you ought to have enough im sure now before we go in i do want to find my ourisia coccinea and adam has mislaid it now adam do think and please dont say the underground mice have eaten the label for im sure they haventit would be a miracle you know if they did here she turned to her companions with shining eyes you see adam believes in boggles and miracles and all sorts of queer things though he isnt welsh and today there was a miracle in church a miracle echoed ned flushing slightly and wondering more she nodded yes the organ that hasnt sounded a note for ever so long played of itself or rather griffiths morgan the sexton says he was awoke by the archangel gabriel nonsense interrupted ned with spirit itit couldnt have been that is what adam says replied aurelia smiling adam tell the story yourself twaint much story miss aura put in the old gardener but twas how as this rector he bin preechin of the roarin rushin wynd an as he coombed down the chauntrey steps as might be the pope o rome with that there brass platter it let loose quite suddint a wynd indeed a rushin and roarin an heavenly notes all adyin away to twanks like the last trump folks were greatly put about even passon himself didnt know what to make ont till griffiths morgan as sleeps on the bellers andle through being accustomed to it as a lad said he was woke and bid blow by the archangel gabriel whereupon passon give it im for sleepin and says as he must a laid on the notes somehow but i says says i that nothin but true miracle ud ever make the brokenwynded old orgin give out sech a rare ollerin but theres no such thing as a miracle adam declared the girl and the next moment was on her knees peering into an aster patch why there it is she cried oh adam how could you adam stooped over the border in simulated astonishment why drat my garters this was his most extreme form of words so be it well miss tis true miracle how that pranniel stuff comes up libel or no tis the lords doings as dont call em by name see you but adam did said ned relieved as the necessity for confessing that he was not the archangel gabriel vanished before this change of venue what adam asked aura oh i suppose you mean the one in the bible only grandfather doesnt believe in it you know it couldnt anyhow be this one she continued her eyes shining with laughter once more as they moved across the lawn leaving adam shaking his head over the ourisia coccinea for when he digs my borders he begins by collecting all the tallies into a heap then he puts them back again at regular intervals in a row its very funny you know but terribly confusing each spring i have to rack my brains to think what each dear thing means as it peeps up of course that is interesting in itself buthere her eyes grew clearer lighter as she looked up for sympathyit is rather sad to make mistakes i dont like dreaming a campanula is white when it is blue blue when it is white i think one is as beautiful as the other laughed ted yesthen her eyes sought nedsbut it is hard always to lose what one has learnt to expect he smiled back at her but said nothing so as they strolled over the grass she every now and again giving them a glimpse of the secluded busy life she led for she and her grandfather never went into the village except perhaps to judge at some competition concert the bell rang and crossing to the verandah they found mr sylvanus smith less crippled as the day went on but urbane and talkative as ever while martha with her little bob curtsey was waiting to take off the covers and they feasted like kings on the chicken and raspberry tart and the weak rough cider which martha made and mr smith drank for his rheumatism seemed to get into their heads with the wine of life as they sat and talked and watched aurelia against the background of flower and fruit oh cupbearer save the wine of life what gifts canst thou bring quoted ned suddenly under his breath a fine poet hafiza very fine poet remarked sylvanus smith who appeared to have read and remembered most things but he lacks the true human spirit he fuddles himself into content with mystic unrealities and misses the great individual claim of each soul to freedom and equality so unlike byron very assented ned dryly still the conversation did not languish and when dinner was over they adjourned to another large room opposite the library which was also empty of all things save a grand piano an armchair and a music rest here ned settled himself down to accompany ted and aura as they sang and finally with apologies for not being so much at home on the piano as on the organ persuaded mr sylvanus smith who turned out to be a passed musician into trying a brahms sonata for piano and violin and here martha coming to announce tea found them still happily busy over the great piles of music that were ranged along the wall it was when ned lingered to close the piano that aura lingered also watching him quietly but she made him start and blush violently by saying with a smile you were the archangel gabriel werent you taken aback as he was his eyes met hers with a reflection of their confidence i was but how did you find out i dont know she said a faint trouble coming into her face that is the worst of it it was when we were running through the messiah something in your mind touched mine i think it happens sometimes doesnt itandand it isnt altogether pleasant she drew herself away from him instinctively but he followed her why he asked she flashed round on him because i dislike being touched there was a silence finally he asked curiously ought i to tell adam why should you he loves miracles and it will give him something to talk about besideshere she laughedit was a miracle you know to make the old organ sound at all perhaps replied ned relieved of the necessity for confessing one of the many sudden impulses which were always getting him into trouble they found martha by the teatable looking very rakish and young in a coat and skirt and a sailor hat which however did not prevent her from as usual masking her supremacy by subserviency the gentlemens rooms were quite ready for them and as she was going through the village could she leave any message with the smith thanks no replied ted curtly for he had noticed auras confidence with ned and hadhe scarcely had time to think whyresented it but i think cruttenden that if we do avail ourselves of mr smiths kindly offered hospitality we must start at dawn picking up our bicycles by the way as you please ted replied ned carelessly but thanks all the same martha i hope there will be no more miracles in church thank you sir retorted martha cheerfully but i dont old with church nor yet with chapel neither as i keep tellin of adam they makes people think too much of their sins an is is but what we cooks call second stock at that sir for takin im fine an wet adam do is work like a real britonyes he really do with which testimonial to adams worth she bobbed another curtsey and was off for her panacea for all ills a spin on her bike i suppose said ted after a pause in a somewhat awed voice that adam is marthas husband aura bubbled over with quick mirth marthas husband oh dear no why she is always at me not to incline to no man no not if his air be ung round with gold and just think of adams little cropped head her laugh was infectious and so martha shares thethe family dislike to gold suggested ned slyly mr sylvanus smith rose to the fly at once we do not dislike it sir gold has undoubtedly its appointed place in the world but it happens to be in its wrong place so i disregard it and pay all my bills by cheque martha makes out the lists for the army and navy you know explained aura quickly its rather fun unpacking the boxes when they come there is no doubt continued mr smith in a tone of voice which suggested an effort to be strictly original that as now administered money is the root of all evil our hoarded millions instead of as they should bringing equalitycomfortable contented equalityto the world separate man from his fellow man by a purely artificial distinction they bring about class antagonism and are a premium on inept idleness hear hear said ted i quite agree with you sir if these millions were equitably divided they would be a premium on idle ineptitude instead laughed ned lightly if you gave a loafer the same wage as a working man i for one would loaf it is the better part if any one were to offer me a golden sovereign at the present moment miss aura she arrested the teapot in the middle of pouring out his second cup and glanced up at him in smiling horror and i never gave back the one in cockatuas bread and milk tin dear me what should i have done if you had gone away and left it ill remember it after tea but after tea found them still laughing still talking still sitting silent awhile listening to the song of a thrush which as the day drew down to dusk sat on the bent branch of the old yew to sing as surely never thrush sang before so the moon climbed into the sky and the flowers faded into the ghosts of flowers each holding just a hint of the hues it had worn by day what a pity it is to go to bed at all said aura suddenly leaning over her grandfathers chair and laying her cheek on his thick white hair for we seem to have so much to say to each other dont we he winced slightly since for once he had forgotten the absorption of his later years and had let himself be as he would have been but for the tragedy which he had fled into the wilderness to hide for he had seen his wife starve to death and his daughter sell herself for bread while he struck down by rheumatic fever had waited for the tardy decision of a law court the verdict had come too late for either too late for anything but decent burial for a poor young mother and flight if possible from himself but though he forgot sometimes the tragedy of seeing his wife die before his helplessness it remained always to blur his outlook to make him what he was a halfcrazy visionary and tonight he had forgotten he had laughed at trivialities and told trivial stories of the thousandyearold yew tree and the druidical legends connected with the summer solsticethe real midsummer night though st johns day came later but now remembrance came back and he rose we have talked too much he said almost captiously and these gentlemen have to leave at dawn we wish them good luck dont we come aurelia my child so they had said goodbye but five minutes afterwards as the two young men sat silently finishing their pipes they saw her returning over the lawn holding the sovereign in her raised right hand it seemed to them as if the whole world came with her as rising to their feet instinctively they waited beside the cool dark pool full of the black shadows of the yew tree full also of marvellous moonlit depths going down and down into more and more light the air was heavy with the flower fragrance of the garden the round moon large soft mild hung in the velvety sky not a breath stirred in earth or heaven her very footstep on the turf was silent which of you gave it me she asked you are so much alike at first that i forget they were silent uncertain what to claim what not to claim she smiled is it a puzzle you want me to find out but really i expect it came from you both yes from us both assented ned her eyes were on teds face which was good indeed to look upon but she turned swiftly to ned ah it was you of course yes it was you she said holding out the coin he took it without a word it seems a shame to go to bed this heavenly night but you have to be up so early there was regret in her voice why should we said ned impulsively let us roam the hills i have done it before now alone she stood looking at them both her face mysteriously bright and you she asked of ted he laughed i feel like it tonight anyhow ah she said nodding her head you are a wise man goodnight and pleasant dreams they watched her pass in her white raiment across the lawn taking the glamour of the night with her and leaving them with an ordinary moon shining on an ordinary garden then ted gave a short laugh and flung himself on the turf again resuming his pipe whats the matter asked ned imperturbably nothing i was only thinking of all the gassing you let out yesterday concerning money why it meanseverything hang that sovereign to your watchchain man and then you can tell her a romantic tale when a whitt whitt whitter followed by a sudden sob among the shadows and lights of the pool told of one more duckanddrake as if that made any difference he continued sardonically you have plenty more of them so far as im concerned it makes some difference retorted ned with spirit that particular coin wont be put to baser uses there was a pause broken only by neds vain effort to get his cheroot to draw suddenly he flung it aside edged himself out of the shadow into the light and faced his namesake look here cruttenden he said ive got something to explain to you becausewellbecause i want this thing to be fair and square between us the fact is that though my name is edward cruttenden all right i have the misfortune to have been for the last two years most unexpectedly lord blackborough lord blackborough echoed ted slowly whywhy youreyoure my masterthat is to say im one of your clerksandand youre the richest man in the midlands i believe i was a year ago but money doesnt stick by me i wasnt brought up to it yes i became lord blackborough against my will by the death of my uncle a cripple who inherited the baronybought by screws chieflyfrom the original purchaser who had a fit on hearing that his only son had shot himself over a woman a squalid story and the distinction between us is as you see a purely artificial one i quite agree with your lordship interrupted ted my dear fellow replied lord blackborough you will oblige me by not being a garden ass the fact is we have a considerable likeness to each other outside in which you have distinctly the advantage youre taller broader briefly the better looking as to the inside we differ somewhat but there again you have the qualities which make for wealth and i havent i can see myself a poor man in my old age then we tumbled off our cycles together in an equal way in a still more equal way we have tumbled intolet us say this garden of eden now why shouldnt we remain in it on equal terms because it is impossible you are lord blackborough and i am your clerk but why should we not remain the brothers cruttenden in this remote impossible repeated ted angrily anyhow let us think over it we agreed didnt we to spend our holiday together well let us talk it over and if it is feasible come back ted laughed bitterly a clerk hasnt so much holiday as a lord ive had my week while you yes of course dont please go off at a tangent like our host we have got to work this thing out somehow for unless we dowelli wont come back alone so you would always have that between you and your nights rest do you understand ted nodded sulkily he had liked his companion before he knew he was a lord and now all the englishmans love for one that strange modern inversion which grants quality to title instead of as in the beginning granting title to quality was mixed up in the thought of future friendship with one who would who could be such a friend of course i could buy you off or turn you out now dont fume i wont interfere with your personal liberty if i can help it i really am in deadly earnest it seems to me we have been given a lead overthat there is something behind all this however that is neither here nor there so far as you are concerned he sat for a moment thinking when can you get your next holiday he asked abruptly i believe i could get a week at christmas admitted ted grudgingly lord blackborough sprang to his feet like a schoolboy and laughed how will eden look under snow jolly i expect you dont mean began ted rising also yes i do i mean that so far as im concerned we shall say goodbye to ittill christmasat dawnthe dawn which will so soon be coming good heavens he added his eyes on the horizon of the hills his voice softening infinitely why am i going to bed who knows perchance to dream goodnight ted could hear him going on with the quotation as he strolled over to the house thereinafter there was a light in one of the upper windows and then darkness he himself sat for a while thinking over the queer chances of the last few days it was like a novel not like real life that hundred pounds for instance lying out on the hillside ready for any one who chose to take it there had been plenty of chances of a hundred pounds even in his life had he felt any immediate necessity for them but he had not his life on the whole had been pleasant enough fond of football cricket cycling rowing he had not thought much of the delights of moneygetting but now a hundred pounds well laid out for instance on that investment about which his old school friend a clerk on the stock exchange had written him only last week might well be a thousand by christmas it held him fast that hundred pounds thinking what could be done with it by christmas it might win him aurelia for if in other ways equality could be kept up why shouldnt he have a fair chance he was the better lookingif that counted for anything then he had another advantage though he was long past much of the old mans antiquated socialism he was keen on more modern ideas a radical of the most forward type politically whereas lord blackboroughwhat was lord blackborough well he was a very good fellow anyhow yes he was a good fellow though he was right in saying money didnt stick to him how could it when he left it so to speak lying about ted knocked out the ashes of his pipe and after a space another light showed in one of the upper windows then it went out and the window eye was shut but what of the eyes within were they shut or open who knows were their owners asleep or awake conscious that they had reached a crossing of the waysthat one path led up to the rugged mountaintops the other into the smooth valleys who knows the moon shone softly behind a haze of midnight coolness rising from the earth to blur the clear circle of her heavenly rim there was a breathlessness in the very stillness of the night that was broken only by the distant wailing of the lambs newseparate from their mothers hark what was it they were calling faint and far away what was it aura aura aura up in the corries setting the tall brackens aquiver high on the birch woods hidden in their silver higher still among the tumbled rocks of the eye of the world what was that passing was it white and dim a wandering sheep looming large upon the moonlit mountainside as it sought to answer the cry or this midsummer night when the spirits wander was it a restless wraith seeking it knew not what or was it aura herself free and fearless among the hills aura aura aura the faint fardistant call sounded from the valley from the corries from the birch woods from the rocks the shadows lay so still so soft yet that one surely movedmoved upwards aura aura aura was it aura or only the echoing sound of the calling lambs still soft equable serene oh misty mountain moonlight what didst thou hold and in the garden across the lawn where the girls feet had lain was that curved shadow a snake making its way to the black and white shadow of the druids yew tree oh misty moonlight of the valley what didst thou hold as the faint faraway cry echoed between the hills and up into high heaven did they meet and hold converse face to face upon the mountaintop those wandering lights and shadows on the mountainsides or did they wander searching for something until dawn and find nothing dawn at any rate came soon as ned had said it would the moonlight changed swiftly to sunlight the heifer lowed for her bullcalf a sleepy chaffinch chirruped his challenge to the coming day and ted cruttenden coming into the verandah from the library saw ned entering it from the music room while at the hall door between them stood aurelia blushing at being caught so early she was in a loose white overall girded in at the waist with a leathern girdle and her bare feet were shod in sandals goodmorning she said without any trace of the blush in her voice see what i have found under the old yew tree grandfathers chair had torn the turf and there it was do you think it can be the snakering grandfather told us about the flat beadlike stone she held out was no larger than a sixpence but it had a hole through its greenish semiopaque lustre i think it must be said ted passing it on to ned you will have all the wealth of the world wasnt that what it is supposed to bring but i dont want money she said the wealth of the world is not all money smiled ned handing the stone back to her there is love she laughed merrily i dont want that either no not if is air be ung round with gold they waved a goodbye to her from the turn of the drawbridge till christmas said ned cheerfully till christmas replied ted cheerfully they found the village early astir miss myfanwy joness holiday having come to an end she was starting for williams and edwards with a pile of empty dress and bonnet boxes which alicia edwards the reverend morris pugh and the adonis mervyn were packing into the village shandrydan it is most kind of you gentlemen to be up so early said myfanwy dispensing her smiles impartially it is no use asking you mr morris she said throwing a little flavouring of regret into her voice you are too busy and too good but if mr mervyn comes up to town i trust he will call on me mervyn whose front lock looked exactly as if it had just left a curlingpins care nodded at her approvingly that would be jolly fun he said i have to go up for an examination in september goodbye then till september goodbye alicia as she kissed the latter she whispered that will be a guinea to your account for the hat you said a pound protested alicia that was for cash child and what is a shilling but two sixpences and you shall pay when you are married see you chapter v would anything stop those waves except a cornish coast thought helen tressilian as she watched the greenblue solid water slip over a halfsunk rock and with unabated strength send up against a higher shelving mass a fortyfoot column of reckless spray and the sky was so blue the sun so hot bringing out all the aromatic odours of the cliff herbs how sweet they were it would almost be worth while to be a humble bee to work so busily among the purple thyme she let some heads of it she had picked fall on her lap with a little listless gesture yes to work instead of droning out the days to work as herbert the dead young husband of her dreams had meant to work it was seven years since she had lost him in italy whither they had gone on their honeymoon for his health so he lay there dead through the breaking of a blood vessel dead without a goodbye dead under the blue sky amid the orange blossoms while she after her mothers death kept house for her father sir geoffrey pentreath and still on her roughest serge suits she wore the conventional muslin of widowhood round her throat and wrists and in her heart in her heart she had set up such a fetich of bereavement that the idea of a second marriage was unthinkable yet it would have been advisable the death of her only brother in south africa sent the few farms which was all that remained of the great pentreath estates to a distant cousin and for long years past sir geoffrey had had no ready money poor father it was the thought of her which made him she glanced to the left over a great scaur of tumbled rocks like some giants house in ruins gave a little shiver and buried her face in her hands poor father yet how could he and how could he be mixed up with all those fateful hateful people with money who brought their chauffeurs to the old servinghall at the keep those chauffeurs were the bane of her life for what should she give them to eat some one from behind clasped her wrists close and held her hands still on her eyes guess said a sepulchrally gruff voice my dear ned where have you come from she answered gaily how did you find out asked ned blackborough seating himself on the thyme beside her as if any one but ned cruttendeni cant help the name my dearwas ever quite so hoarse by george nell he said looking seawards it is good to be here thats what one always says isnt it when the visible body of the lord is transfigured before ones eyes as it is now you know ned i do not agree with your buddhistic notions she said a trifle severely beg pardon theyre not buddhistic but im always forgetting you dont likethough you will some day meanwhile i want to ask you a question and as the butler told me you would be on the coast somewhere youve a most superior set of london servants just now nell to keep the chauffeurs company she interrupted shrugging her shoulders one mustbut dont lets talk of itits sickening and so you came to the old place to the old place nell he repeated looking at her with criticising eyes of kind affection and thinking she looked as though she stood in need of physical and moral backing i always think of you here looking out to sea just under betty cams chair he nodded his head backwards to the scaur of tumbled rocks if you get looking so long nell you will be seeing ghostly thingslike she did she was your ancestress you know and it isnt safe he spoke tentatively but she evaded him you said you had a question she asked what is it only if you have room at the keep she laid her hand on his in swift reproofwas there ever a time when there was not room he smiled true but unfortunately iveive a second self now ned she stared at him oh ned how could youwithout a word who is she it is a he my dear we collided together and found out our respective names were the same but of that anon and there is a scotch doctor tooa rattling good fellow one peter ramsay whom we picked upbut of that also anon meanwhile these are at the crooked ewe regaling themselves andwell i cant leave them you see for theyre my guests butbut we could dine with the chauffeurs you know dont be silly ned of course you must come theres still room in the ruins for the familyand you wont mind she broke off suddenly and looked out to sea tired nell he asked quietly how you fuss my dear cousin who could help fussing she said without looking at him we could live so comfortably father and i on what we have got if it were not for this craze of his to make money for me ah ned i wish you had never lent him that fifteen thousand it was nearer twentyfive thousand but that fact lay lightly on ned blackboroughs mind i believe it to be an excellent investment he remarked coolly though i own i didnt know what he wanted it for at the time and you dont know now she broke in passionately there it standsdespicable utterlyfacing the seathat sea she pointed to it appealingly ned looked out to the clear horizon so definite yet so undefined where a liner after taking its bearings from the lighthouse far away to the west was steering straight up channel it seemed to glide evenly between sea and sky and yet here the thunder of each wave filled the air with sound ay a sea not to be safely faced by anything despicable you are letting this beast of an hotel get on your mind nell he said after a pause after all half the white and coloured cliffs of old england are so desecrated dont excuse it she interrupted almost fiercely its inexcusable when i think what jeff would have saidjeff who loved every stonedear old jeff she broke off and hid her face in her hands curse south africa said ned under his breath she looked up after a while you see she began more composedly what stings is that it is all done for me and ififty pounds a year would keep me going as a hospital nurse and i shall never be anything else ned never i lost everything for myself seven years ago and what i have belongs to others and there is so much in the past for which atonement should be made you dont belong to the pentreaths you see but they were a wild racebetty cam as you reminded me think of her why ned when i see at night that hateful place all lit up with electric light and shining far far out to sea i feel as if we were doing it all over again luring ships to the rocks my dear nell what an imagination youve got expostulated her cousin she pulled herself up have i but it is so useless and it seems to get worse and worse since mr hirsch came in he is at the keep now arranging for a light railway and oh ned the place where we used to picnic as childrenyou remember of courseis all placarded as eligible buildingsites ned whistled and looked out to sea as he had said the white cliffs of marine england were so disfigured everywhere but that did not bring much consolation for the destruction of absolute beauty well he said i only hope some one may think them so and that the hotel is crowded up to the garrets its got to be for the farmers and the little shopkeepers at haverton who put their piles into itbecause my uncle didwill expect a dividend and the others too she added bitterly you know mr hirsch has floated it its quoted on the stock exchange now and they are going to run up select jerrybuilt villas with the money they get on the new shares as they ran up the jerrybuilt hotel with mine laughed ned a trifle uneasily well my dear child i hadnt any intention of building itbut its thereand let us come and look at it it cant help can it being in a lovely spot cant it she said coldly but i try to forget its existenceit gets on my nerves apparently he said quietly and so it would on yours she retorted if you lived within hail of it and nothing else was talked about day and night but therelets leave it alone you can see it on your way to the crooked ewe we shall expect you to lunch of course thanks he replied andand i think youll like the scotch doctorhe is so awfully keen so full too of his work at blackborough he is housesurgeon i think to some hospital there her face a moment before almost sullen in its obstinate objection lit up at once not st peters she cried how interesting why it is the best they say in the kingdom and i mean to have my training in the childrens ward there you look rather as if you ought to go there as a patient nell he replied shaking his head and you are a perfect child still i wonder if you will ever learn what she asked quickly yourself he laughed as he started up the scaur betty cams chair lay at the top a huge slab of gneiss with another forming the back bearing no particular resemblance to a chair at all still there it was that betty cam the witch used to sit and after lighting her false fire fling her arms about and mutter incantations till deadly storms arose many are such stories current on the wild west coast and still firmly believed of the people none perhaps better authenticated than this that on the nights of fierce souwesters a glow of light could still be seen at betty cams chair and that more than once the ghost of the ghostly indiaman which with all sails set had sailed one awful winters night straight up the bay straight over the cliff nipped up betty cam and sailed away with her right over far dartymoor to hell had been seen pursuing the same extraordinary course ned felt as if he could have put other folk aboard for that trip as cresting the hilltop he came full in sight of the seaview hotel he sat down promptly on the chair and gave a low whistle of dismay cams point as he had known it that gorsecovered promontory sheer down in purpling cliff to the bluegreen sea was gone in its place was an ineffectual attempt at aat a teagarden winding walks here winding walks there meandering toward aimless summerhouses kiosks bandstands which were recklessly scattered about the bare soil for it was bare gorse would grow there or scented purple thyme or any of the innumerable small aromatic herbs which the southwest wind loves but grass and most garden flowers were helpless before the constant breeze which instant in season and out of season swept over the point laden with salt and even in this flat calm june weather making the steel guyropes of the flagstaff hum like a hive of swarming bees as for the seaviewye gods the pestilential obviousness of that namehotel if it also were not guyed by ropes it looked as if it would be the better of it what was it standing on the very edge of the cliffitaliangreekgothicor a swiss chalet there were reminiscences of all in its medley of inconsequent towers gables battlements balconies a lunatic asylum built by the patients utterly irrational utterly out of touch with its surroundings of earth and sea and sky yes quite antagonistic to the little fishing village in the bay below to the supreme fairness of the coast trending away westward in headland after headland above all absolutely unfit to face that wide waste of water so smooth so silent on the far horizon so restless so clamorous in its assault on the near cliffs you could hear the angry roar of the waves on the rocks see the weatherstains on those thin walls and as he watched a strange thing came about in every wide window of the huge facade a blaze of light showed and round the arches hung with lamps in the teagarden a multicoloured flash shone for a second and then went out again they must be trying the electric light then he laughed suddenly it tickled his fancyapt to be vagrantto think how this gigantic modern sham full of false civilisation full of lifts lounges bars wintergardens a real uptodate twentiethcentury substitute for a home engineered on the latest american lines must look to any homebound ship passing up channel a beacon distinctly but a beacon warning the world against what trinity house and betty cam had better settle it between them he muttered to himself as turning at right angles he set off over the moorland to the crooked ewe where peter ramsay and ted cruttenden were awaiting him he had picked up the former crossing over from cardiff to ilfracombe and finding he had a few days to spare before taking up his new appointment ned had asked him to come on with him and see the prettiest part of cornwall and perhaps stop a night with his uncle sir geoffrey pentreathif there was room he wondered rather how helen had found this room as he looked round the long lunch table but as his uncle confided to him half of the guests belonged to the hotel there had been a committee of ways and means and several peoplenotably mr robert jenkin who was sitting next helenwere over from wellhampton for the day yes that was mr hirsch at her other side a most able man but rather too near his bete noire mr jenkin to show to advantage as a matter of fact mr hirsch was making himself extremely disagreeable to his enemy by insisting on keeping the conversation at a much higher level of culture than any to which mr jenkin could aspire for he had begun and gone on with life for a considerable time as a local ironmonger then fortune had favoured him and he became the local millionaire remaining still however so mr hirsch declared the petty tradesman the latter was a very clever very dapper little german jew with nothing to show his ancestry and his age except a slight foreign lisp and a still more slight tendency to size below the last button of his waistcoat a tendency which gave him more concern than it need have done since it really only showed in profile for the rest he was inscrutably goodnatured money stuck to him and his many kindnesses never interfered with his keen eye for businessor beauty it was helens handsome melancholy face which had been the secret of his interest in sir geoffreys venture on the principle of opposites it is to be supposed since he was a frank pagan a bon viveur born so he talked lightly of rome and a few of the crowned heads of europe with whom he had a bowing acquaintance but finding this rather too interesting to mr jenkin he settled down on bayreuth and gossiped parsifal becoming after a time really engrossed and saying almost with tears in his eyes ah my dear lady how i should love to show you it he felt seriously sentimental in truth the remark was as near a proposal as he had gone for quite a number of years we intend mrs tressilian put in mr jenkin not to be outdone to get the yaller peking band down from the halls durin our seasonjulyaugust itll play durin meals an after dinner in the pirates pavilion an im sure mrs tressilian the conductorhe aint really a chinaman maam the pigtail bein only a thing to catch onha ha ha that aint a bad joke is it hirsch pigtails a thing to catch on toha ha ha mr hirsch surveyed him with distasteful wonder you dont wear one do you mr jenkin he asked suavely his foreign accent coming out as it always did when he was annoyed no sir i dont snapped his adversary but as i was sayin maam im sure if you had a hankerin after any particular tune hed play it i dont know about percival but his repertoire of cake walk is the first im told in europe meanwhile ned blackborough was taking stock of the rest of the company on the wholequeer the wrexhams he knew of course she went in for spiritualism and he for spirits both good enough sorts even at that but the bulk smelt distinctly of money and his uncle ned had not seen him for over a year and he was frankly taken aback by the change in him his face weakly handsome as ever hale still in its thin ruddiness had lost the cheery look which had survived even the death of his only son who had died as a pentreath should this and such vague comfortings regarding rest and being with his mother and of the youthful company whom the gods lovecomfortings with which humanity has always met bereavement had not only been on his lips but in his heart he had always been an optimistand now anxiety sat on every feature the man was haggard and what was this grievance against helen which made such sentences as mrs tressilian will have her own opinion no doubt or you must ask my daughter i cannot answer for her quite noticeably frequent in his conversation as he sat listening while his nextdoor neighbour a very talkative and a very deaf lady assured him that her motor which she had bought in paris was the only one of its kind in england and that it was absolutely entirely shakeless and noiseless lord blackborough had time for cogitation they were very smart people and it was a very smart luncheon champagne patedefoie en aspic liquers and cigarettes on the lawn a new regime certainly for the kindly old keep where as a boy he had spent his holidays with his aunt his mothers sister yes a new regime especially if the chauffeurs were being similarly regaled downstairs and what a fine old place it was set so deep out of the way of the wind in a hollow of old pines and oaks and yet so close to the sea that even now the hollow boom of the atlantic waves sounded against the shrill voices of those smart women as a bassoon sounds against a violin ay and in the winter souwesters the rush and hush of the sea blent with the rush and hush of the leaves he could imagine betty camhm that was helens fault for being so tragic he looked round for her and saw her talking to dr ramsay ted also was well employed hanging on mr hirschs lips as he spoke airily of bulls and bears ted if he didnt take care would become a zoologist also so thought ned blackborough as he wandered away from the lawns that were still kept smooth and green towards the wilderness of garden beyond and the thought of money bringing the thought of aura he smiled lit a cigar and went still further afield to find a certain peach tree that used to have peaches on it the others were happy why should he not have his share of enjoyment as a matter of fact however helen and dr ramsay were not enjoying themselves at least she was not for he had met her assertion that the one wish of her life since my husbands death seven years ago being interpolated with the usual note of resigned reverence in her voice had been to be a hospital nurse with a dubious shake of the head i wouldnt if i were you he said slowly i rather doubt your being fit for it one requires a lot of stamina she stared at him almost haughtily but i am very strong i assure you she replied with a smile of great tolerance i daresay i look palefor the cornish coast but oh i am very strong physically perhaps his scotch accent gave the qualification great precision then mentally she almost gasped mentally no he replied quite calmly excuse me she remarked but i really do not think you know me well enough do i not he remarked his brown eyes smiling into hers you forget that i am a doctor and mrs tressilian your nervous system is at the present momentmind you its no blamein absolutely unstable equilibrium unstable equilibrium really dr ramsay my dear lady he said i have been thinking all lunchtime that if you would only allow yourself to be hypnotised you would be clairvoyant i shouldnt wonder if you would be able to project yourself and think what that might mean why you might give us a clue he paused quite excited and what has that to do with nursing she asked coldly it makes for a temperament that is toowhat shall i call itunpractical you have a gifta great giftbut it is not for nursing you are too sentimental and how do you arrive at that conclusion she asked interested in spite of herself excuse me he touched the muslin cuff she wore with a hand she could not help admiring it was so shapely so strong so skilfullooking albeit so small for a man of his height yet her eyes flashed a quick challenge at him you mean that it is sentimental and unpractical to mourn those one loves i do not agree with you the sunlight glinting through his eyes turned them almost to amber there was a world of gentle raillery in them at which however it was impossible to be angry to wear your heart on your sleeveyes he replied ah mrs tressilian believe me you are lost to the world what a wife you would have made with your ardent imagination to some grovelling slave tied down as i am by the nose to the body of things but that is another story and so is clairvoyance though in your present state im convinced you could see the point at issue remains that he paused well she asked almost eagerly he laughed my patients say i prescribe paradise when i beg them not to fash themselves but there is one thing i have found out i cant tell you why but worry stops the working of the vital machine it gets into the cogs somehow and clogs the wheels then you fall back on reserveforce and having exhausted that feel exhausted we doctors nowadays are helpless before the feeling of hustle we prescribe restcures but you can worry as much perhaps more on the flat of the back the remedy lies with the patient and you have so much imagination mrs tressilian used cheerfully it is the most valuable therapeutic agent we have ah here comes your father some of the hotel people want to take us all back to tea and i expect he is coming to ask you about it she looked at him steadily but he showed no consciousness and she turned to meet sir geoffrey feeling baffled she had known about and had meant to avoid this tea but something in the very directness of dr ramsays unsought diagnosis roused her to show him its incorrectness anyhow she found herself rather to her disgust not only going to the hotel but going in the front seat of mr hirschs motor and once in the wide southwestern verandahwhich was built so close to the perpendicular cliff that leaning over the balustrade you could see nothing but the seawhile the salt wind clung to her cheek like the fierce kiss of a lover bringing with it an unwonted flush of colour she was forced to admit that the place had its charms that it was not all vulgarised there was laughter and music of course both of them loud about the teatables but at the further end comparative peace reigned around the couch of an invalid lady whose little girl was apparently a great friend of sir geoffreys he was always so good to children she remembered with a pang picturing herself as she was at little maidies age the childs mother amy massingham was very darkdark with those large lustrous eyes and very white teeth which suggest indian blood and she must have been beautiful before languor and pallor had come instead of rich colour and vivacity still even at her best she could never have touched the exceeding brightness and beauty of her little daughter maidie she was incomparable a little vivid tropical bird flitting about sir geoffrey chattering her small round face glowing with brilliant tints sparkling dimpling her teeth showing in a flash of smiles that seemed to irradiate her body and soul while her cloud of dark hair still golden bronze at its curly tips floated about with her she was like a ripe pomegranate yellow and redbrown in her dainty little yellow silk frock perched now on sir geoffreys long lap she was stroking his soft moleskin knees and swinging herself backwards and forwards rhythmically and when daddie comes from india she insisted we wont go way and leave oo sir geoffley will we mumsie weem goin to stop at seaview always an always an always aint we mums amy massingham smiled gently she did everything so very gently that she failed as it were to do anything at all her impact was not strong enough to move any fixed object well my precious it would be delightful and dear sir geoffrey is so kind isnt he but im afraid dadda cant manage it you see mrs tressilian darling old dick is only home on short leavereally only to see mebut his people will want to have him first thing oh mumsie wese goin to have him the firstest thing of all protested maidie who was now on the floor fondling the big curly retriever who was always sir geoffreys shadow for his shipll pass over thereright over there dont you see mrs tsllian she was by this time leaning over the balustrade beside helen and looked up at hersuch a sparkling brilliant little maidwith fearless eye something in the childless womans heart went out to her and beyond her again to the grave far away under the orangetrees of the man who was dying when she married him if she could have had such a childit had been better perhaps supposing we were to put up a signal here saying mumsie and maidie waiting for you wouldnt it be fun she said smiling will you do it said the child quickly she shook her head it was only supposing maidie she replied the little brilliant creatures face fell oh i wis you wouldmake em stop right here just this corner i want him to stop an then id go on the ship too an sail an sail an sail she had forgotten her disappointment in the new idea that is what the world does generally thought helen and yet i suppose you love your father dont you maidie she asked suddenly the child looked at her gravely normous much she replied repeating her stock phrase an i love sir geoffley normous much too we re goin to live together an im to be his darlin for ever an ever an nay aint we aint we and she flung herself into his arms as he approached them an unreserved joyous bundle of curls smiles and dimples his face relaxed from the hard look of pressing anxiety it had worn all day he caught the child up tossing her like a feather above his long length then cuddling her close to kiss for ever and ever and aye he echoed never fear maidie im yours to command then he set her down and turned to his daughter helen he said ive some business here which may keep me awhile youll drive back with hirsch of course she did not meet his eyes but kept hers far out at sea i think not father she said gently i want to walk home with ned i have something to say to him sir geoffrey looked at her resentfully ned has found a sick indian friend upstairs and wont be availableyoud better go she turned round then no father i cant it isnt fairon him even coming here she broke off and turned to the sea again he came closer hesitated nell he said almost pitifully cant youto please me he really is a good fellow at bottom i wouldnt ask it otherwise it would free mefrom you dont know what and my god in london half the pretty women one meets are married to such awful bounders it is because mr hirsch isnt a bounderbecause he really is in some ways a good fellow she said that i will noti can walk back with the others he stood looking at her with anger and affection in his eye for a moment then strode off to say goodbye to mrs massingham i suppose your husband may drop in any moment he said cheerfully any moment she echoed we are so excited maidie and i this morning we saw such a big vessel passing right away on the horizon the manager thought it might be a transport maidie looked up and nodded her cloud of curls but it wasnt you see she said for sheshere she nodded again at helengoin to signal stop here that was only supposing maidie supposing an supposing an supposin free times free is free quoted maidie slyly just you wait an see yes wait and see laughed sir geoffrey goodbye little one next time i suppose daddy will have put my nose out of joint and you wont have anything to say to meeh she grew crimson to her eartips never never never she cried stamping her foot wilfully wes goin to live together for everaneveranaye the bystanders laughed at her sudden passion and sir geoffreys thin ruddy face actually flushed a still deeper red all right little lady he said halfsheepishly never you fear ill keep my promise for ever an never annaye chapter vi the london footman was rolling out the dressinggong as if he had been apprenticed to a bronze when ned blackborough returned from his sick friend at the seaview hotel but he took no heed to its warning and turning down a side passage sought a room in the older part of the house where as a rule his uncle was to be found and sure enough there he was seated at his socalled writingtable and turning round a trifle startled pen in hand at the sound of the opening door but neds quick eye detected neither paper nor ink the pen then was a mere shelter against the unlookedfor visitor it was a quaint room full from floor to ceiling of the man and his immediate forbears that succession of sir richards and sir geoffreys who had inherited the everlessening estate of pentreath for the last two hundred years fishingrods guns huntinghorns and duelingpistols testified to their amusements a tin box labelled pentreath estate records to their occupation and a complete set of the annual register and gentlemans magazine to their literary tastes there was a weighingmachine also and in a glass case the sword presented to the then sir richard by prince charlie for the pentreaths were always on the losing side in everything yet they had always held their heads high in the past but now sir geoffreys haggard face looked as if it had been seeking refuge in the hands one of which he held out in kindly greeting so its you nedlike old times im glad to see you back again my boy and im glad to be back sir he replied paused and then feeling there was no good in beating about the bush made a plunge ive got something to say to you sir we are leaving tomorrow morning and i may not have another opportunity he paused again not much time before dinner said sir geoffrey consulting his watch but fire away going to get marriedeh perhaps said ned coolly but this is about the hotel damn the hotel whats up now never was curse more heartily or more hopelessly given wellgo on i dont know who is responsible for installing the electric light but it isnt safe the wires are always fusing they keep it very dark but my friendwho is a bit of an electrical engineer himselffound out when he was awake last night sir geoffreys face was hidden by his hand again as he interrupted ned with a short laugh oh thats itwhy they always krab each others workalways andand your moneys safe enough now the place is insured i wasnt thinking of the money sir cried ned outraged i was thinking of all those women and children sir geoffreys face came up from his hand full of such passionate resentment that ned was fairly startled by gad sir he cried and what right have you to suppose i dont think of them night and day sirday and night then his eyes finding neds he stretched out his hand towards him in almost childish helplessness oh ned ned he said you cant think what a relief it is to talk of this withwith one of ourselveswithwith a gentleman instead of a cursed money grubberthough i will say this for hirsch he isnt a cad then youve known of this before sir said ned slowly i see known my god ned what havent i known since the devil entered into me to start this thing i wouldnt tell you ned for i knew youd be like helen but i told the heir and he liked it all he wants is money and iall i wanted was to make somethingjust something for helen after poor old jeffwent hed have looked after her you seethe pentreaths have always kept our women wellalways cared for them but he died ayhere his trembling lip stiffened itself died as a pentreath should for his queen and his country in the pause that ensued ned thought bitterly that he had died in an attempt to hold the yeomanry of england from showing the road to the rear that was the truth and behind that truth what a record of ignorance ineptitude greed of gain nothing for nothing not even patriotism was the modern motto a cheap loaf and a disintegrated empirecaveat emptor even in the face of war you cant believe it all ned went on sir geoffrey speaking now with less passion but more eagerness as if his memories brimmed over until youve been through with it i meant it all to be above board but it wasnt the jobbery was awful every man just clamouring for money a gentleman oughtnt to touch a thing like thatits pitch ned he has to keep in with builders and masons and plumbersoh my godthe plumbersall thinking of nothing but pay pay pay ah kipling knew the game when he wrote that refrain for englands heroism her patriotism it will go down to the ages ned as one mans insight into what we english are becoming he was walking up and down the room now restlessly they were all bad but jenkin was the worstand he ought to have known it was his nephew who put in the electric plant youll say i ought to have struck ned and so i ought but your money was gone ned and theirs too poor devilsa lot of the farmers and people only put in a few pounds because it was my idea you see it had to go on and what did i know about seasand and secondclass putty it isnt gentlemans work and thats a fact but the jolly old atlantic knew sharp enough and sent salt through the plaster and seaspray through the concrete then when we were in a bad way and jenkinpettifogging tradesmanall for saving every penny i met hirsch between ourselves ned he began by fancying helen and iiwell he isnt a cad you know and half those men one meets are yet their wives dontdont seem to mind he paused and looked at ned blackborough appealingly but he was inexorable hardly the man i should have thought youd have chosen sir as the father of your grandchildren sir geoffrey took it full in the face without flinching no he said simply i suppose not but ive gone down ned gone down terribly i sometimes wonder if sheif your aunt i mean would know me again ifif i saw her he took a turn or two without speaking then gave an afterthought excuse which made ned smile and yet feel inclined to curse but there mightnt be any children you know what good would they bethe old place has gone from the pentreathsgone utterly let me seewhere was i oh yes hirsch came and saw it and said it was the finest site in britain and so it is theres not a better for health or beauty than cams point so he put us on our feet again and spent an awful lot on what he called colour wash at least it seems an awful lot to me and jenkin was wild but we had to run it or the new company wouldnt have caught onwe have to make it fizz you seebut i wish to god id never beguni wish to god id never begun he was still walking up and down muttering to himself and meanwhile asked ned in spite of his supreme pity what is to be done the wires may fuse any momentso charteris thinks sir geoffrey caught at the doubtits not so bad as thati dont think its so bad when the seasons over and the new company secure we shall put a new plant in and insure the place properly and meanwhile we are awfully careful i was two hours there today myself seeing what the workmen had done and it was quite a little thingput out in a moment but you dont know anything about electricity do you sir asked ned quietly and i thought you said it was insured sir geoffreys face reddened yes in a way hirsch insured when he came in he wouldnt put his money in without it would he put his wife and children in i wonder asked ned bitterly but i still dont quite understand about the insurance sir geoffrey fidgeted ill get hirsch to explain its all right i believe though but theyll insure anything nowadays if you pay a decent premiumany mortal thing he paused and stood the image of hopeless perplexity and thenrather to his reliefthe dinner gong sounded good lord and im not dressed he muttered wed better go but as he reached the stairs where they divided he held out that friendly welcoming family hand again sayingthanks ned its been such an awful relief not to be thinking of money i suppose when one comes into so much as you have thatthat you dont think of it any more was it so ned blackborough wondered hardly for mr hirsch had millions and still thought of more no he personally had been tired of money for some time caveat emptor was an excellent legal if not absolutely moral axiom but when men allowed your millions to confuse the issue in their treatment of you thenthen one could wish the millions were not in the equation and of lateever in fact since he had left the floating deposit and had seen aurahe smiled at the remembrance of her standing framed in scarlet and white handing back the sovereign with that peremptory take it please why should not he and she go forth in the wilderness in their sandalled feet to forgetand to remember that was life to forget so much and to remember so much that one had forgotten he pulled himself up after a time from the unaccustomed line of thought or reverie telling himself it was all nonsensesheer nonsense yet it was attractive suddenly the words go sell all that thou hast recurred to him making him wonder if it were a hard saying or no for the moment he felt inclined to obey it literally they were halfway through dinner ere lord blackborough appeared at the table to begin with he had wired to his valet for dress clothes and accustomed to the routine of good service had expected to find them in his room they were not however and only by the help of a tearful little cornish maiden at whom all the racketty job servants from london were swearing profusely as she fled about trying to do everything at once did he discover his suitcase in the servants hall where two lordly chauffeurs accosted him scornfully as some ones belated valet he escaped from themand from the cook who solemnly drunk was using inconceivable language to the entree she was dishing uponly to find that his man had forgotten to put the studs in his shirt whereupon he also cursed as he broke his fingernails over the job and yet all the time at the back of his brain the thought of aura lingered and in the front of it his uncles face so foolishly childishly helplessly wanting money what else had the old man expected but chicanery when he dabbled in the pool it was nothing but a clutching whirlpool of hands trying to grasp at a golden sovereign in the centre every one clutched he as much as any one then with a jar his mind reverted to the shade of many a tree he had seen in india where men lived and apparently lived happily possessed of nothing but their souls devoid of all things save the inevitable garment of flesh the shade of a botree this certainly was not it he thought as with a smiling apology he slipped into the empty place and found himself in the battleground of a heated discussion a trifle dazzling surely these lights and flowers and fair women helen looked well in white at the head of the table between mr hirsch and dr ramsay and thank heaven she had left off weepers in the evening what a difference there was between lace and stiff crimped muslin and how young she looked the rapidity of thought is immeasurable the velocity of its vibration untranslatable in terms of mere human flesh and blood these thoughts and millions of others suggested by the whole entourage which in a second became part of ned blackboroughs lifeexperience passed into his mind and left him free at once to listen to his cousins gay heres ned ill appeal to him do you think it fair that we women shouldnt have votes we shall have to settle our terminology first helen he replied in the same tone what is fair i presume what mrs tressilian considers to be right that isnt fair if you like she retorted fair isshe paused exactly so laughed peter ramsay is there an outside standard or is there not that is the question mr hirsch who always wore white waistcoats in the evening they were not so becoming as black ones answered it of course there is a standardthe general consensus of opinion made up of units suggested dr ramsay quite so retorted the financier but it gives the limit of safety between certain lines you can negotiateeven on the stock exchange ha ha his laugh was curiously explosive and shook him from head to foot but surely there is a standard said helen softly there is a standard which collectively we accept helen it comes back in the end to our personal verdict im afraid said her cousin and it is curious how that verdict varies he continued addressing mr hirsch you i expect believe in the law of supply and demand now i feel somehow that if i were to charge a thousand pounds for a glass of water which a distracted husband wanted for his dying wife i should be doing a detestably mean thing even though the man was quite willing and able to pay for it there was a pause that is rather a stiff example said ted cruttenden but theoretically a man surely has the right to get the best price he can for his wares without that axiom commerce would come to an end what would the world be without it i wonder remarked dr ramsay supposing it was made penal for any one to take more than ten per cent profit i should be a pauper laughed mr hirsch his bright eyes dancing that would not suit me at all why i should have nothing over to give away and my charities cover my sins imagine it a world where there was no coup where your brains were of no use to you pah he poured himself out a glass of water abstractedly and drank it as if to take away the taste he was in great form that night the rebuff of helens refusal to drive home with him having acted on his abundant vitality much as the attempt of a rival on the stock exchange to limit his freedom of action would have done that is it stimulated his determination to do as he chose and the others seemed in high spirits also so that even ned forgot the very existence of the seaview hotel until some one said laughingly that there must be electricity in the air or magnetism or hypnotism and suggested a seance of some kind no cried lady wrexham who posed as being well in with the psychical research society let us crystal gazeor stay a magic mirror only a little ink in the palm of the hand mrs tresillian it so often comes off when im in the room and im sure you could scry i see it in your eyes helens caught dr ramsays instantly almost resentfully but he was silent perhaps im a witch also who knows she said speaking at him old betty cam was an ancestress of ours wasnt she father and she was the devils own warlock but you shant be disappointed lady wrexham there is a real magical crystal that came from thibet somewhere in the house i will find it for you tomorrow or rather today for it is past twelve oclock time for every one who isnt a witch to be in her bed surely there was a decision about the remark which would not be gainsaid so the ladies some with some without lights dawdled upstairs like wise and foolish virgins calling down jokes and goodnights to the men on their way to the billiardroom while ned blackborough seizing his opportunity waylaid mr hirsch and begged for five minutes in sir geoffreys den about the hotel echoed mr hirsch when ned broached the subject pardon but excuse me if i change my cigarette for a cigar there is always so much to be said concerning that business he spoke with a smile but his face had hardened at once and ned listening could not but admire his companions uncompromising directness he was aware of course he said that the money sir geoffrey had invested was a loan from lord blackborough and therefore he treated him as a shareholder a large shareholder with absolute freedom well mr hirsch had found sir geoffrey in difficulties and had helped him why because having a great penchant for mrs tressilian he was glad to be of use the hotel would practically have to be rebuilt at present its condition would disgrace a jerrybuilt villa near london and they had perpetrated this inconceivable sham in full face of the atlantic but it was always the way when such schemes were not properly floated at first there never was enough money to allow for the inevitable leakage then little men had little ways and the methods of a tuppennyha penny ring like this had been were simply horrible but the site was gigantic absolutely gigantic and if you could only get rid of that bloated mechanic jenkin and his gang you could make anything of it but they were incurably vulgarthey had wanted a gramaphone in the hall they allowed one in the stewards room the words reminded ned that as he walked up to the hotel lost in admiration of that marvellous sea surging against the sheer cliff he had been greeted by shrieks of laughter and the sound of a double shuffle done to the latest music hall catch on and he smiled hirsch was right it was incurably vulgar who was it who said that since nowadays he had to choose between solitude and vulgarity he chose the former mr hirschs cigar had actually gone out in his irritation but he was alight again and went on regarding the insurance yes he had made a temporary arrangement to secure his own money and sir geoffreys and a little over you could secure anything nowadays by a high enough premium in fact the best thing that could happen now if he might be excused for saying so waswas a fresh startwithout jenkin the hotel would practically have to be rebuilt anyhow at the end of the season meanwhile regarding the electric light it was badthat was jenkin againbut they were exercising extreme care and could do no more but supposing began ned my dear lord blackborough said mr hirsch with a curious smile as he arose and pulled down his white waistcoat i never deal in suppositions as a business man i cant afford it i know this has been worrying sir geoffrey who has oldfashioned ideas of responsibility butah here he comes i was just saying sir how disturbed you were this morning about the slight alarm at the seaview last night but as i told you it really lessens the odds of its occurring again to make any fuss just at present when you need to get all the money you can in order to start the thing fair would be suicidal i dont in fact see that we are bound to do any more than we are doing there is a certain risk in all large buildings as badly supplied with water as this one is but surely one must credit people with eyes caveat emptor lord blackborough caveat emptor that immoral but comfortable piece of wisdom is the backbone of all reasonable speculation goodnight if i may ill have some whisky and water in the billiard room on my way upstairs ned came back from the door and looked at his uncle well sir he said what is to be done sir geoffreys face was a study of irresolution lets leave it till tomorrow ned he said at last the night will bring wisdom but i expect hirsch is right he has a wonderfully clear head and i only wish that helen i would leave helen out of the business if i were you sir interrupted ned angrily it was intolerable to think of her as possible part payment as he lit his candle and made his way to the old wing among the ruins as she called it he told himself that he had half a mind to buy out all other interests and spend an extra thousand or two in throwing the whole gimcrack building over the cliffs and it was all so useless helen didnt want the money she was craving to live on an hospital nurses pay ned said a voice at the door just as he had taken off his coat let me in please i must see you it was helen herself her eyes were blazing bright her face was pale she had flung a white shawl over her bare shoulders yet she shivered ned she said swiftly thank god youre here you must come with meyou will wont you put on your thick shoes and come as you are it is quite warmthere is only a fog come he echoed come where she seemed a trifle confused and passed her hand over her forehead down to the point of course they must be warned warned of what what have you heard i didnt hear i saw ah do come quick i ought to be there you know showing a light she spoke in curiously even tones and for an instant ned thought she was sleepwalking or dreaming one of those deadly dreams of excessive hurry in which no matter what you do thought leaves the labouring body far behind you saw it but where and what she was silent for a second looking at him halfdazed then she spoke quite naturally it was in the crystalthe one they brought from thibet he said i could and so i saw suddenly her whole bearing changed fire fire fire the cry loud and clear came as she turned and fled he after her down the dark passage led by the glimmer of her white gown had she gone mad or had she really seen something there was a little outside door once the postern gate of the old keep which opened at the angle of the wing and the main part of the house he followed her through that losing her almost immediately in the dense white fog which clung to the damp walls the windows of sir geoffreys study were open and as he ran past them following the path he heard something which sent the blood in a wild leap through his veins it was a furious insistent ringing of the telephone call bell which sir geoffrey in his first delight with his new toy on the point had put in so that he might be constantly in touch with the workmen then something was wrong what as he spurted ahead towards helens ghostlike figure seen in the clearer atmosphere beyond he asked himself how she could have known where are you going he called breathlessly that isnt the way to the hotel she turned for a moment then ran on her voice coming back to him it is the lightthe light on betty cams chairthe light for the ship helen helen go back what good can you do let me go and see he called striving desperately to overtake her but she was as swift as a hare and so dimly seen too dodging about among those huge boulders and everywhere the seafog hung thick helen helen his cry came back to him but no other sound did he hear save the rising roar of the waves as he neared the cliff right ahead of him rose betty cams chair well if she was going there he would catch her up then and he would seeyes he would see from there if anything was wrong for a moment he saw her above himon the skyline was it and if so why was the sky so clear was there a glow great god there was a glow in the sky and at her feet helen helen he cried as he sped on tell me what is it there was no answer but the next instant he had gained the crest and could see it was fire but fire seen through fog the strangest sighta huge vignette a magiclantern slide sharp in the centre fading to an aureole close as they were he could see nothing save dim shadows in the blaze of light the ship the ship it is coming so fastoh so fast said a monotonous voice beside him helengood god how ill she looked all unlike herselfwas seated on betty cams chair pointing with her right hand far out to sea nell he said swiftly come i cant leave you here and i must get down at once the roads just below us they will need all the help as he spoke he knew some was coming for a live spark showed swift curving through the white fog where the road should be racing like a great fuse to the heart of a mine it must be a motorhirschs most likelythank heaven he was at least a man of action yes that was his voice coining back as the light flashed raced disappeared for gods sake be calm sir weve done all we could well do all we can not true not true except the last helen he cried roughly your fathercome did she smile he did not wait to make certain but leaving her dashed down the hill halfway he turned doubtfully hoping she had followed him but already almost lost in the mist he saw the lonely figure with the faint glow about it still seated on betty cams chair as he dashed on again a curious shuddering boom rolled through the fog he wondered vaguely what it was but his whole mind was set on that nebulous circle of flaming light he was nearer now the vignetting grew sharper towers and balconies began to loom luridly beset by tongues of flame it must be all on firea wide sweep from end to end again that shuddering boomwhat was it my god could helen be right again and was it a ship in distress as he ran he counted ten twenty thirty forty fifty fiftyfive sixty a ship a ship indeed was there to be no ending or horrors he was on the upward rise now the aureole had gone he could see the flames leaping while the crowd stood still a large crowd thank god so they must be all out surely he met a man running back calling as he ran a ship in distress on the rocksthe lifeboatmore help needed there come are they all out he shouted and the man nodded as he ran a relief indeed he slackened speed as more fisherfolk ran past him back to their work their trade all out my god what a relief no by heaven there was a sudden stir in the crowd and high upon the furthermost seaword balcony as yet untouched by the flames a little white figure showed bending over the balustrade and calling to some one below the answer reached him making him leap forward all right little lady im coming there was a struggle ahead of him a tall figure breaking loose from hands that would have held it back and then his uncle for gods sake he shouted as he ranthink of helen the voice arrested sir geoffrey for a second and ned never forgot the look of that scared kindly distraught face he saw for a moment i am thinking of her came the answer then the pause ended ned was after him without a moments consideration life seemed so small a thing to him that he could not stop to think of it but ted cruttenden sprang forward also to hold him back the fates did that however for as he would have plunged into the burning house the upper hinge of one of the wide hall doors gave way and as it swung inwards with a crash just touched neds forearm and snapped it like a bulrush as he staggered ted had hold of him you cant he said he knows every turn and may do it yet if the stairs stand its madness for you and my god theres mrs tresillian why did they let her come we didnt tell her on purpose ned dazed with a pain he had hardly located had only time to wonder stupidly how she had managed to change her dressshe wore a coat and skirtbefore she was beside him clinging to his unhurt arm father she said ned where is father he shook his head doing his duty i suppose he muttered i tried to follow but got hurt try to keep calm if you can nell theres a chance still yes a chance if the fireproof stairs were fireproof she stood quiet silent only once he heard her say to herself why did i waitoh why didnt i come at once so the minutes passed and the crowds of camhaven fisherfolk giving up hope of more excitement here tonight sought it elsewhere though already a murmur had come out of the fog that there was no immediate danger a big ship was on the sunken rocks and had established communication with the shore that was all and still the minutes passed and ned stood holding helens hand in his yet there was no sign of returning feet upon the fireproof stair a little breeze springing up had drifted the smoke southwest obscuring the balcony so they could see nothing those who knew her began to look at her with pitying eyes then in an instant something in which all else was forgottena sharp sound like the crack of a rifle a quick upburst of sparks then a great crash and for a few moments silence and darkness the roof had fallen in ill take her home lord blackborough said peter ramsay for all her height lifting her easily you will be wanted here mr hirsch i may use your motor broken replied mr hirsch who was as white as a sheet the tears almost running down his cheeks i drove it myself and i didnt understand but the wrexhams is here my god what a frightful thingshrecklich schrecklich his voice shook these things were not in the bond yet one bond had been kept for in an hours time when the flames had eaten their full of the frail thing which had dared to usurp cams point they found sir geoffrey halfway down the stair caught in a trap between two gaps in what had been scheduled as a fireproof staircase he held the child in his arms her head wrapped in his coat to preserve her from the smoke nestled close upon his breast for ever never annaye that promise anyhow had been kept as a pentreath should have kept it chapter vii early dawn in a house where the newdead lie unheeding whether it be darkness or day dawn when those who have seen the light of life fade from a beloved face watch the slow sunlight steal once more over the edge of the world and claim all things for its own yet watching alone how peaceful such a dawn may be when one can face death not as a thing apart but as a part of life when there is no need to cloud its kindly form with sentimentalities when we need not drug ourselves into disregarding its dignity by some narcotic of belief in life to come when it is enough to feel that this life has passed where all life goes in the old keep however where the master lay dead in his study among his fishingrods and guns as they had left him till the inquest should be over there was no one near enough to the dead man so to watch for helen was still unconscious in her room upstairs dr ramsay whose hands were full with many claimants on his care spoke of a severe nervous crisis which had evidently been coming on for some time her best chance was this semicataleptic state from which she would recover in her own good time so she lay in her simple white room on her simple little bed and the dawn stole in slowly through the open window bringing the dayspring song of birds with it but she was not there she might have been with her father for all the bystanders could tell ned his face drawn with pain from the fractured arm over which dr ramsay had instantly looked severe but for which ned refused to lay himself up absolutely until certain necessary details had been arranged looked in and envied her he had told the doctor of her visit to his room and his wild sternchase of her to betty cams chair and of his wondera wonder that grew as he thought over itas to how she could possibly have got home changed her dress and come on in the wrexhams motor in so short a space of time still she had done it evidently she had done it the doctor had replied guardedly and there in the stress of many calls the subject had dropped and yet as ned went about giving orders in hopes of lessening anxieties and distress he was remembering the strange unkenned look he had noticed on his cousins face was it possible thatno it was impossible anyhow he had no time to think it over as yet the rollcall of inmates had thank heaven been on the whole satisfactory only two had failed to answer mrs massingham and curiously enough his friend charteris who had arranged to leave the next morning when his attack of indian fever should have passed away the only man who knew of the danger it was a coincidence certainly as for mrs massingham the fright must have brought on one of her heart attacks else there was no reason why she should not have escaped taking maidie with her it had not been a good life anyhow but what an awful homecoming for the husband he might arrive that very day but it would be better if he did not not for a few days till the whole thing body and soul alike should have gone out of ken for ever then there was the ship it was a transport from india a bit out of its course through having damaged an engine it had mistaken the fire for the lighthouse further west and had struck lightly on a sunken rock just off the headland beyond cams bay it seemed none the worse and would most likely float off in the next tide or two as the wind strengthened in the meantime that would entail another funeral as they had had a death on board that night so much mr hirsch told ned when the latter went to see him about wiring to the office of the new company ive looked to that he replied curtly and i must get all these a perfect pile of forms lay beside him off at once only the nuisance is my motor is damaged ted cruttenden is cycling with mine began ned mr hirsch looked up quicklyyou will be careful wont you i wont foul my own nest more than i can help said ned bitterly thats right and you know mr hirsch was still writing hurriedlyi dont believe it was the wires at all it certainly began in the back premises and they tell me the cook was dead drunk after dinner and half the servants as wellthey were dancing breakdowns to the gramaphone that doesnt take away the taste burst out ned passionately or take away the responsibility for having put such a ghastly monstrosity on that point before that sea under the stars of heaven mr hirsch looked up with the surprised kindly look an elder gives to a child who has suddenly burst out crying over a broken toy you really ought to go to bed lord blackborough he said all this is so exhausting to the nerves i shall do so when i have sent off my telegrams was it the roll of the double r which made ned inclined to kick mr hirsch it was a relief when ted cruttenden ended the conversation by entering in the silent unobtrusive way which people adopt in the house of mourning messages ready he asked mine are mr hirsch has some i suppose you wanted to be off its a shocking bad road to haverton remarked ned full of illhumour as he left the room i shall not go to haverton though said ted i shall save time by cycling to wellhampton five miles further but theres an allnight office and it seems a pity to waste time till eight oclock good nodded mr hirsch though here he gave one of his short explosive laughsi am in no particular hurry i must give jenkin timegood lord what a relief to get rid of jenkinahem he pulled himself up hurriedly and went on writing it was the first time ted had come to close quarters with a millionaire a millionaire too of european reputation as a financier more than as mere money seeker and the effect was stimulating it roused his admiration his imagination he stood at the window waiting and watching mr hirschs headit was growing in truth a trifle bald at the crownas it bent over his papers and thinking what it must feel like to possess the art of transmuting baser things to gold i will give you a sovereign began the great man condescendingly one is in cipher and that costs the change in stamps if you please i have many letters to write typical of the man thought ted cruttenden while mr hirsch noticing how careful the young man was in discriminating between his and lord blackboroughs telegrams but putting them into different pockets smiled you are metodical i see he remarked with just that faint slur over the th which occasionally told he was not english it is a great gift in business ted smiled also and flushed with pleasure since mr hirschs praise was worth having and so then and there almost as if some chemical affinity had manifested itself between the molecules composing his brain and mr hirschs he made up his mind to try and follow his example he was no fool other people succeeded why not he as he rode off his mind was full of this new determination and yet one short week ago he had thought himself uncommonly lucky to have pushed himself so far up the ladder as to be in receipt of a hundred and fifty pounds a year for it must not be forgotten that he was nomans son his mother had refused to give his fathers name when she lay dying and her people seeking to trick her asked what name the child should be called she had smiled derisively at them edward cruttenden of course had been her reply the latter being her own name a common enough one in the black country ted had thought all this out many times yet it came back to himwith no rancour against his mother but a good deal against his unknown father on this fine june morning as he made his way across the high cornish tableland dipping downwith both brakes oninto some steep combe and thereinafter climbing out of it again pushing his bicycle if he had only begun earlier to think about making money he would have had a better chance with aura no doubt at his age hirsch had been operating on the exchange and promoting companies promoting operating these were words indeed but it must be uphill workso was this last combe for it was to be one of those hot june days when the freshness of dawn is gone in half an hour and the very grass has no trace of dew on it he sat down at the top of the hill and drew out his handkerchief in order to mop his face in doing so one of mr hirschs telegrams came out also and fluttered to the ground it was the one in cipher and as he glanced at it he found that by a pure chance he knew it or something very like it his little friend and admirer in the stockbrokers office was an expert in ciphers and had shown him several thisone of the easiestamongst the number he could not choose but read the first word buy buy that was curious he should have expected it to be sell buy what buy seaviews all below five shillings hirsch he sat looking at the words for some time puzzled then rode on his mind busy with the problem but the puzzle remained until as he was going into the telegraph office at wellhampton he met mr jenkin coming out then the memory of mr hirschs laugh of relief at getting rid of jenkin which he had hardly noticed at the time came back to him jenkin apparently was to be given time to sell while mr hirsch was to buy it was a straight leadover what if he were to follow it even to the extent of but a hundred pounds his heart gave a great throb he felt as a man might when put on a horse for the first time and the reins given into his hand who was to prevent him going where he choseexcept of course the horse he returned to the keep by breakfast time but for a wonder he had no appetite since he was of that healthy strongnerved sort to whom even personal sorrow comes as an expenditure of force which requires recuperation and there was no personal feeling in this tragedy except for blackboroughs share in it for that he was unfeignedly sorry he however had been finally ordered to his room by dr ramsay who was too busy to speak to any one the wrexhams left early followed at intervals by the other guests and the keep settled down into the slack collapse which always follows on the excitement of a catastrophe the servants seemed to remember they had been up all night mr hirsch was the only person who was really awake but ted did not somehow care to see mr hirsch though as the day wore on and the latter went off once more to cams point ted took down some telegrams which had come for him and watched him read them anxiously they seemed satisfactory but by this time ted was telling himself he had behaved like a fool in sending that wire to his friend on the stock exchange the desolation on the point where workmen were still searching for any traces of mr charteris body made him still more depressed so he strolled over to camshaven thereby letting himself in for additional dreariness since just as he abutted on the little quay he saw one of the transports boats disembarking a coffin the dead officer of course poor chap to die like that within sight of home was rough luck he stood with bared head watching the guard of honour form up and prepare to take the body to the church where it was to lie until directions came by wire from the relatives you dont happen to know the name he asked of the local pilot who was close beside him not for sure sir he replied tho i did hearm say massinham same name as the poor madam they people burnt in her bed las night massingham echoed tedthat is very curious it was indeed mr hirsch coming back to the keep half an hour afterwards was quite pale and called for a whiskyandsoda before he could explain to dr ramsay the extraordinary coincidence of major massinghams body being brought in for burial to camshaven where those of his poor wife and child already awaited him as it were but he mr hirsch had seen the captain of the transport and everything was quite simpleterribly simple major massingham had come on board at bombay ill but had not however let his people know of his illness as he expected the voyage to set him up he had unfortunately taken a chill off gibraltar pneumonia had set in and in his delirium he had constantly talked of his wife and child and begged not to be buried at sea the latter idea had been quite an obsession with him almost the last words he spoke being not at seanot at sea that had been two hours before the ship struck and when they discovered there was no danger it had seemed another curious coincidence to ensure poor massinghams wish but the whole affair was here mr hirsch became quite unintelligible in his admixture of english and german it is certainlycurious assented dr ramsay thoughtfully very curious but it is just as well he should come home deadthe news would have broken him by the way i dont want lord blackborough disturbed there is a nasty splinter that will give trouble and he was in such pain i ordered a sleepingdraught indeed here he smiled i am thinking of a sleep myself till dinner time i also yawned mr hirsch mein gott tragedy is fatiguing off the stage as well as on it and this poor major massingham himmel es ist unbegreiflichauferlegbar and he went off to his room looking a perfect wreck aged by ten years for deep down below the hard shell which grubbing for gold requires his heart was soft and these things were uncomfortablethey were not in the bondthey belonged to a spiritual life in which he had no part they weighed heavily on ted cruttenden also for he had the englishmans innate antagonism to anything which hints at the unknown anything which might suggest a wider outlook than the one he already possesses but the hundred pounds he had adventured following mr hirschs lead weighed on him still more heavily why had he been so impulsive at the most he could gain three hundred and what would mr hirsch say if it were to come out not that it mattered since he was not likely to see much more of mr hirsch for he must go back to blackborough next morning so after a time he also sought his room and a rest dr ramsay however was deprived of his for looking in while passing to see how lord blackborough fared he found him not only wide awake but greatly excited by the news which a servant had brought him curse the fool said peter ramsay vexedly i made sure you would be asleep yes it is extremely curious but what does it mean doctorthats what i want to know burst in ned what is it this strange something which every now and again seems to show us a solemn shrouded face and then disappears in mocking devilish laughterin charlatans tricks dr ramsay shook his head if i could tell you that lord blackborough iwell for one thing i should be the richest man in the world all we doctors can say is that there is somethingsomething which can be explained away if one chooses to explain it away but the explanation isnt scientific it is easy to say a man is mad because he believes himself to be the emperor of china but what about the question why does a man think he is the emperor of china when he is mad we have got to answer that and show what it is which induces delusions and hysteria and why hypnotic sleep causes certain specific alterations in the body corporate as it does but weve only just woke up to the fact that we stand on the verge of some great discovery weve only just begun to question the nerve centres and see the incalculable power of suggestion now take this case of your cousins he continued eagerly whatever it may or may not be it is certain that i suggested to her first that she was mentally unstable second that she might be able to project herself then lady wrexham slips in with her crystalgazing suggestionandand the thing is done there is something else said ned slowly almost reluctantly which mightwe were talking of old betty cam in the morningshe and iand i told her it wasnt safe for her to be always watching the seai warned herin joke of courseof her hereditary here he broke off impatiently but it is of no use talkingthe thing is franklyimpossible hardly that remarked dr ramsay dryly we have to learn apparently that many things are possibleat times ned looked at him curiously one wouldnt credit you with such beliefs ramsay he said i dont credit them myself replied the doctor shortly personally i wish these phenomena didnt exist they complicate the equation of life tremendously but they are there it is no use dismissing them as hysterical manifestations that only alters the title of the problem and we have to refer to the phenomena again under the heading what is hysteria of one thing i am certain remarked ned suddenly with conviction it was not helen altogether as she is now whom i left in betty cams chair last night i have been going over the whole incident in my mind and i am conscious of having had a sense all through that there was something unkenned something not quite real the question is put in dr ramsay how much she will remember when she wakes and that cannot be very long now for she was much more normal when i went in to see her last two hours ago i shall look in again as i go upstairs i hope she will remember nothing said ned quickly peter ramsay shook his head it may be everything you cannot possibly tell he broke off as a knock was heard at the door and a voice said may i come in my god he continued there she is it was indeed helen who entering as he held open the door passed swiftly to her cousins side poor ned she said her face on which showed the marks of recent tears full of a grateful affectionate solicitude how foolish it has been of me to leave you to bear the brunt of it all but i am all right now and shall manage he ought to be in bed oughtnt he she continued her eyes narrowing a little as they met peter ramsays her whole expression showing for an instant a halfpuzzled pain as if she sought for some memory of past trouble i am sure you think sodont you i think so very much indeed mrs tressilian he replied your cousins arm poor arm she interrupted softly that was broken before i came downi was asleep i suppose when they called meit seems so strange that i could have slept and i seem to have forgotten everything except the awful suspense then the awful night on the pointbutbut you couldnt have saved him ned it was the stairsif only they had been fireprooffor he knew every turn ii have been down to see him ned and he looks so peacefulso content you see he had done all he couldall a pentreath should have donesoso it is best and now dear you really must go to bed i can manage nicely i will send to meet the massinghamspoor soulshow terribly sad and how inexplicable it all is inexplicable indeed they looked at each other silently she evidently knew all that they knew but of what they did not know she also knew nothing the interval between the time when she had passed upstairs to her room joking and laughing with the others and her first sight of the halo of fire had simply lapsed into a great suspense it was as well dr ramsay admitted to himself and yet he felt annoyed for looking at helen tressilians face he recognised that his chanceand the chance of science was over in all probability that would be her one solitary intrusion into the unknown dimension which whetted his curiosity so much she was normal now she might conceivably marry some deserving idiot and settle down to half a dozen children she might even become a nurse all things were possible to the calm selfpossession with which she insisted on rest for them both so in an evil temper he followed her advice meanwhile ted cruttenden after wandering about aimlessly uncertain whether to bless or curse himself for his mornings work had also sought rest and was asleep dreaming of aura aura as he had seen her in her blue linen smock and sandals aura as he could picture her in pink satin and diamonds which was the most beautiful the most beautified he scarcely knew when he felt inclined to bless himself it was because he could picture her in the latter when curses came it was because he regretted the former so to him in troubled slumber came a knock at the door come in he called drowsily then sat up with beating heart on the edge of his bed feeling for his slippers with his feet he did not know that the dapper little figure at the door was to him mephistopheles that he was about to sell his soul to the devil but he was vaguely conscious of an approaching crisis in his life soh my young friend you have bought sea view shares why the room was growing dark there was a wide interval of shadowy light from the windows between the young man as having found mental and bodily foothold he stood coatless defiant as if prepared to fight fate and mr hirsch decently robed for dinner and with as ever the large white flower of a blameless life in his buttonhole through the open window the mellow pipe of a blackbird full of the glad song of wood and dale forced its way insistently the memory of it lingered with ted always in after years that joyous invitation to the wilds always seemed to sound in his ears whenever a question of choice arose now though he heard it he was too busy to heed it why he echoed i bought them sirbecause ii believed in you there you have it in a nutshell and why did you believe in me ted having recovered his confidence gave a short laugh upon my soul i dont know i did itthats all then you had no private intimationyou had not overheard anythingyouit was unvertraute gutno more you gave me a lead over yourself you know replied ted argumentatively you said jenkin must have timeand the rest followedi couldnt help knowing the cipher could i a faint chuckle came from the gloom by the door soh you have prains mr cruttenden i ought to be angry i ought to tell you many things but i have searched long for one to believe in me i need him let this beyou have won three hundred pounds i give you this per year as my clerk you accept it was all over in a moment the blackbird ceased his song and as ted cruttenden hurriedly dressed for dinner his head was in a whirl this was a chance indeed by christmas he might stand on more equal ground and after christmas his fancy ran riot in pink satin and diamonds but when he left with mr hirsch next morning the latter was in a towering bad temper lord blackborough was a fool he had refused to listen to reason and mrs tressilian was no better they had both of them declined to be mixed up any further with the hotel and would not even let him buy them out the insurance had no doubt been made in accordance with business principles but he will divest himself of every farthing in two years if he goes on being so verdammlich gerecht yes i give him two years to be a pauper said poor mr hirsch and then his eyes positively filled with tears as he considered how all his efforts to secure a competency for helen had failed chapter viii it was early autumn and aura was standing in the garden looking more like a botticelli angel than ever for her face was mutinous the very curls about her temples and ears all crisped and goldedged as she defied even the sunlight she was engaged in an argument with martha who in mr sylvanus smiths brief yearly absences on the work of the socialistic congress still attempted an authority which she had once held undisputed well i wouldnt not if it was ever so asserted the worthy woman her face aflame with righteous indignation mr meredith the rector he know his part an being unbaptized there wont be no funeral so whats the use of flowers auras eyebrows almost met in a sudden frown you dont mean that they will refuse i dont know nothin miss haura interrupted martha only what i hear tell i dont old with baptism nor yet with burials specially the penny things they has hereabout i dont want no halfpence to help bury me i aint like the folk nowadays as is that restless they dont know where theyll lie much less where theyll go to when theyre

there an now the rectorll object to a unbaptized except in the odd corner where they puts the fellow deceased no it aint the sort of thing for you to be mixing yourself up with miss haura them lovely liliesd be ashamed o your taking them to that gurl gwen aura bent her head caressingly to the great bunch of goldrayed japanese lilies she held i am taking them to a dead baby she said quietly the lilies wont be ashamed of it and with that she turned on her heel superbly leaving martha speechless to watch the blue linen smock cross the lawn and disappear behind the rhododendrons a glimmer of it showed like a bit of heaven among the birchwood beyond the bridge ere the older woman found her tongue and going over to where adam was weeding beetroot confided in him you mark my word adam bate she said solemnly miss haura the h was always added on such occasions as a point of ceremony ll marry the wrong man sure as eggs is eggs adam looked up aghast the wrong un why sakes me she aint got never

in the face ill tell her so when i gives it in fur bilin with which remark he chuckled and settled down to his weeding once more for fifteen years he had made ineffectual attempts to court martha and nothing now would have surprised or taken him aback more than the faintest success on her side martha kept up the conflict with external spirit but with a certain sneaking admiration also for his pertinacity as she went back to her kitchen she also chuckled blushed like a babby she murmured an he wrinkled like a bad batch o bread ill tell him that there beetroots bled when he brings it in aura by this time was out of the woods and cresting the brackenpatched hillside the silly welsh sheep alarmed even at her gracious presence fleeing from the tussocks and rocks far ahead of her with grunts and whistles such as no other sheep in the world can make the lilies on her arm brought a passing sweetness into the fresh morning air and as she carried them her thoughts were busy with what martha had said to her what did it all mean her arms which in all their young and vigorous life had never held a child closed tenderly round the flowers as if they had been the body of the dead baby poor little babe to come into this world unsought to leave it to be quarrelled over the motherhood which was hers by right of her sex wakened in her strongly she laid her soft cheek caressingly once more on a white petal then in sudden impulse she kissed it softly poor little childie but gwen had loved it and it had not minded being unbaptized it had not even minded its fatherlessness neither had gwen but then she poor soul was what people called wanting wanting in what not in motherhood certainly aura had often seen the two playing together on the sunny banks about the shepherds cottage the toddling baby with its fists full of its mothers curly hair both faces aglow with laughter and with love and now the child was dead poor gwen aura accustomed to look at nature with clear eyes and utterly untouched by conventional conclusions felt a wellspring of sympathy rise up in her heart such a pretty baby too as it had been more than once she had paused in passing to watch it and wish that she too had so delightful a plaything thinking that with so abiding an interest in them the hills and woods the streams and flowers of her secluded valley would suffice for her life and now it was dead her eyes blurred with tears made a misty halo round the cottage tucked out of mans way in a little hollow among the hills a desolatelooking little cottage gardenless fenceless a mere human habitation set down beside a spouting spring which day and night night and day splashed on in highpitched feeble querulous iteration as she came up to it a black shadow showed on the doorstep and through the mist of her unshed tears she recognised it as the figure of a man it was indeed the reverend morris pugh coming away from consolation he paused at the sight of her as any man well might and over his keen celtic face swept a wave of enthusiastic approval his hat was off his smile shone out brilliantly excuse me he said i am the minister and this is kind indeed those beautiful lilies they will surely comfort the poor mother and teach her to trust in the mercy of him who considers the flowers of the fieldsitit is a christian act there were almost tears in his voice aura looked at him and smiled but i am not a christian i brought them for the baby she said simply morris pughs eyes narrowed i am sorry and they can do no good to the child god has taken him vengeance is mine saith the lord i will repay gwen has to learn her lesson poor child you meanauras face had grown a little palethat the childs death isis a punishment it is done in lovethe lord loveth whom he chasteneth he replied gently and you have told her so something in the girls tone made him reply on the instant she did not need the telling she knew it already she knew it already aura passed him like a flame of fire and entered the cottage eager with her purely human consolation but the note of preparation within struck a chill to her very soul old mrs evans gwens mother sat in a black dress with her bible before her at the receipt of custom the door between the livingroom and the bedroom was half open and through it lying on a table covered with a white sheet was a tiny still uncovered form in a white gown aura could see the little dimpled hands folded so sedately on the little breast it sent a great pang through her to think of them so quiet and gwen what of her i have brought these lilies she said almost apologetically to stout mrs evans i should like to give them to gwen if i may mrs evanss english being of the smallest she sighed rose and saying pliss you come this way ushered aura with her armful of lilies into the bedroom in the further corner of it her apron over her face sat gwen rocking herself to and fro and muttering under her breath she drew down the apron at her mothers touch and quick sentence in welsh and so sat staring across the body of the dead baby at aura her face was more vacant than distraught its pink and white prettiness seeming to hide the tragedy of grief which must surely lie beneath it i have brought these said aura laying one of the lilies beside the dead child with a cry fierce as a wild animal gwen sprang to her feet snatched at the flower tore it shred from shred and flung them to the corners of the room stand back englishwoman she cried in welsh her eyes blazing with sudden wild distracted passion leave us alone we are accursed accursed we want no flowers here then she clung to her mother and wailed oh mother take it awaytake the child awayi do not want it it is accursed god has taken it away and it must go let her take it if she wants it take it away and bury it out of sight i must forget my sinmy sinmy sin beth nai beth nail gwae fi beth nai the mingled sobbing of the two women roused in an instant to the very highest pitch of unrestrained emotion smote on auras ears turning her to veritable stone she understood enough to grasp the drift of what she heard and with a quick pulse of pity for the quiet rest thus rudely disturbed she bent and kissed the claycold child then turned without a word and left the room not to be long alone however the elder woman recovering her selfcontrol as quickly as she had lost it followed her into the sunshine beyond the low door and arrested her with mingled tears and apologies gwen she said in quaintest english and welsh was a mad iolinjust a silly nonsensethough it was just true the child wass better to die it was not as the nother onehere she looked sorrowfully at a fiveyearold who was busy making mud pies by the waterspout and shook her headthat one wass two shillin and sixpence a week yess indeed because her daughter wass for ever in the good shentleman placiss but gwensilly nonsense gwenshe could pay nothing she was not all wise aura staring out into the sunshine which happed the whole beautiful worldexpanse of hill and wood in its magic mantle looked in the womans really griefstricken face in slow almost incredulous wonder you mean thatthat she hesitated pointing to the childthat your other daughter in service pays you half a crown something in her voice made mrs evans mop her eyes with her apron still more strenuously it is the price she protested there is many askiss three shillin mrs jhones and she have two an mrs daviss an and gwen gave nothing the words seemed to aura to burden the sunshine she turned swiftly to go feeling the need of escape but the ladiess sobbed mrs evans would be given a shillings or so when they be comning yess indeed a shillings or so aura wheeled the lilies still in her arms i have no money she cried her voice ringing with passionate scorn i never have any money thank god so with quick springing step her whole young soul aflame with indignation she was off breasting the hill leaving the hollows behind her wishing with all her heart that she could have carried the dead baby with her to call it accursed to count it unbaptized the darling lying there so peaceful so still so waxen so like the lilies ah if she could only take it away from all the sordid thoughts what burial would not her fingers compass there on the bosom of the kindly earth for it and for the lilies how soft it should lie how flowerdecked yes the great white petals should shield the little white face from the touch of the close damp earth and it should sleepsleepsleep the tears ran down her cheeks silently as almost at the limit of her young and vigorous pace she passed on passed upwards pursued by the one overmastering impulse to get away to find some safe restingplace for what she would fain have carried but by degrees her thoughts became calmer she began to see the whole pitiful story and put her finger intuitively on the points of offence for she had seen little of the world and knew still less of its ways she thought of the lowing heifer and its bullcalf of the second brood of young blackbirds over whose first flight she had but that morning seen the parents so excited and then she thought of the fatherless unsought child whose only worth was the bringing of twoandsixpence a week to its grandmother truly her grandfather was right money was a curse but so were other things the religion for instance which told poor gwen that her child was accursed that its death was a punishment poor gwen seated in her threadbare black with her apron over her head so unlike the girl in a blue cotton dress who used to tumble about on the thyme banks with her boisterous rosycheeked baby it was pitiful that cry beth nai beth nai gwae fi beth nai rang in auras ears as she sat down at last among the rocks of a sheepshelter on the crest of a hill here in winter the southwest winds howled and swept the bare braes wasting their force against the lichenset boulders behind which even the shearling lambs could lie snugly but in this early autumn the sun baked into the closecropped turf and mushrooms grew in clusters where the lambs had lain it was a favourite outlook of auras for it gave over the widening estuary and the sea beyond beyond that again the setting sun for it was growing late and the autumn days began to close in she sat there on the wild thyme thinking making upas the young do almost unconsciouslyher mind about many things reaching forward to the future vaguely with certain new thoughts regarding it in her mind and all the while watching the great pageant of the death of day enact itself out in the west it was a lurid sunset full of flames of deep purplestained clouds it was a pageant of passion selfexistent selfdestroying yet it was beautiful she would sit and watch it to the end she would see the anger and the threat of it pass into grey calm when the sun had gone so she sat on the lilies still in her lap until she was roused by a step by one word gwen she turned startled to see the startled face of a young man behind her it was a beautiful face the sort of a face which women love and in its quick amaze there was almost a hint of appeal of hope for fair hearing the girl grasped the situation in a moment he had been misled by her blue dress he had thought she was gwen poor frail gwen who was not all wise yet still had been wise enough to keep this secret of hers he turned with a halfmuttered apology in another instant he would have been gone but auras strong firm fingers were on his wrist she looked at him from head to foot judging him then with one swift sweep of her other hand she struck his handsome face full with the fading lilies she still held coward she said go your task is done the flowers broke softly on his warm flesh and blood leaving no mark but her words seemed to shrivel him he slunk away she watched him disappear down the hillside then with a sob she flung herself face down on the short turf crushing the lilies to their death and cried as though her heart would break chapter ix the little village of dinas was in a turmoil considering its small size and the extreme peace of its situation happed round by everlasting hills and so cuddled close to the very heart of calm creation it held an extraordinary capability for fuss the hot celtic blood would get into the hot celtic brain at the slightest provocation and it had risen from the subnormal of rural life to the feverheat of a revolution over a baby whom some one had refused to baptize and some one else had declined to bury the rector relying on the middle ages had pointed to the nettlegrown corner reserved for those whose salvation was doubtful the whole calvinistic body forgetful of election and predestination had fled as one man from the authority of the bible to that of the burials act radical religion and religious radicalism had once more met in grips and the guarantors of the little telegraph station in the village breathed freely by reason of the wires that were sent and that came from the princes and powers of darkness and light all over the country the result was of course that foregone conclusion of these later daysa compromise the churchyard belonged to the parish the burial service to the church and so with a curious falter at its innermost heart because of the absence of the rectors familiar surplice and biretta the village had signalised its victory by a triumphal following of gwens baby to the grave not of its fathers but its mothers as they gathered round the coffin which looked so tiny far away down in the greasy black earth the sound of day of wrath that dreadful day sung by the rector at his usual evening service floated out from the church to join morris pughs indignant militant prayer to the almighty but the peaceful little dead child slept undisturbed by either yet the rector honest man had no illfeeling at all but rather a profound pity for the lamb of his flock who had been lost through ignorance on his part for had he known of its illness nothing would have prevented him from storming the shepherds hut and claiming his right as rector indeed but for the necessity for reprobating the scandalous withholding of one of the churchs sacraments from an innocent soul because its parents were blameworthy there is small doubt that he would have asked no questions and buried the small dead body decently and in order as it was he came after service was over tall and cassockgarbed to stand beside the tiny mound of newturned soil which broke the lush green of the churchyard make the sign of the cross over it and pray a little prayer for mercy nevertheless he went back to his study and his ecclesiastical histories a harder man for the incident his bishop had not upheld the authority of the church he hadin all reverence be it spokenhedged and the rev gawain meredith was too priestly soul and body for hedging with heretics for there was no mincing of words about him the wesleyans were possibly schismatics all other dissenters were heretics and the calvinistic methodists the most distinctly dangerous heretics with whom he had to deal they reminded him in their social religious and political organisation of the jesuits whose history he was studying he had a reluctant admiration for their determination to force means to an end and he saw plainly how much capital they would make out of his refusal to bury the body elections to the parish council were coming on and he had already made himself unpopular by questioning the expenditure so he read the paragraphs concerning the babys burial which he found waiting for him on his study table in the weekly local with a setting of his thin lips they might turn him out of the council if they choose but while he was in it he would do his duty by the ratepayers morris pugh had read these same paragraphs in manuscript they had been sent to him for revision and he had returned them without a word of comment yet he had felt a vague regret pluck at his heart he was an enthusiast pure and simple those chiefs of his party who seized so quickly on every point of vantage were enthusiasts and something more he felt ill at ease though in attempting to get at the truth concerning gwens fault he had acted almost at the instigation of his elders isaac edwards and richard jones stern fathers of the village had been inexorable and so gwen once the pride of the choir despite her being light in the weighing had been practically excommunicated not that there had ever been any intention of such excommunication being permanent or of its injuring the child but spasmodic croup waits for nothing and soso the middle ages and the burials act had come into conflict this however was not the only cause for morris pughs uneasiness oddly enough the disturbing element was the hundred pounds which ned blackborough had hidden in the cleft of the rocks the last two months had been one long temptation to go and take it at all coststake it and say nothing and yet his soul revolted from the very idea the constant conflict however had forced him into clearer thought and he had shrunk back in horror from much that he saw in himself and others the greed of gold how it riddled all human life it even touched the next for it was the mainspring of religion money money there was a perpetual call for it half the spiritual life of his flock was due to the efforts of those who had built the chapel and who workedfor god no doubtbut also to get five per cent interest on their mortgages yes the souls for whom christ died were bartering them for gold o for something some voicing of the great spirit to stir them to a nobler commerce this was his desire his constant prayer and he had grown haggard and anxious over the stress of both the last two days also had brought a fresh anxiety mervyn his brother had returned from a months visit to blackborough curiously moody curiously unlike himself that is the earnest clever lad who for years had been the pride of the village the joy of his mothers and of his brothers heart no doubt his failure to pass the examination had discouraged him but was that all it did not really matter he was young yet had another chance and meanwhile could go on as he was earning enough to keep him as clerk to the village councils and boards so as morris pugh holloweyed pale lingered at the grave of the little child which he had just committed to the dust whence it had come there was no stability in his thoughts they wandered on dreamily until suddenly as a flash came the certainty that one of the many mourners who had but a minute before been looking down on the tiny coffin was father to what it held and he had stood there silent unrepentant yes it must be so for poor gwen was no wanderer her own people sufficed for that limited life he covered his face with his hands and turned swiftly almost to stumble over his brother who stood behind him his face was haggard also and morris looked at it with a quick dread clutching at his heart therestheres nothing wrong is theremerve he faltered the lad flushed crimson only youve trodden on my toe thats all he answered bending low to brush off the dust of the grave which his brothers foot had left on his boot i beg your pardon replied morris pugh slowly then the remembrance that he was pastor here as elsewhere made him add i was so overcome by the horrible thought that the father of that poor child must have been herebeside us merve but the lads face was up again he looked his brother calmly in the face i suppose he was but what is the use of bothering about it the things over he glanced at the grave as he spoke and looked back at his brother almost impatiently oh for gods sake morris let her bei dare say itit was a sort of mistakehe maynt have meantbut anyhow the things done with done echoed morris how can it be done without repentance mervyns handsome eyes narrowed his lip set and how do you know he doesnt repent if thethe baby had lived it might have been worth while but now he smiled suddenly dont worry any more about it theres a good chap mother will be waiting tea for us and you have all those envelopes to send round this evening morris pugh winced under the reminder yes tomorrow was collection sunday and each household of the faith must be provided with an envelope addressed to it in which the offering must be enclosed thus enabling those in authority to trace home any inadequate donation oh would the time never come to the church of christ when the elect would need no such precautions against cheating their god for that was what it meant his whole soul sickened as he thought of how each one of his flock would weigh the balance between this world and the next and yet a good collection was the vivifier of spiritual life without it how could extra preachers be paid for and the religiosocial work of the community be kept up it was late ere all the arrangements for the morrow including a reception and prayermeeting in honour of the reverend hwfa morgan who was to conduct the morning service were over but even then morris pugh had not finished his work that was to wrestle through the night in prayer for divine guidance for divine help and all the while the slow certain stars wheeled in their appointed courses to meet the dawn the dawn that came true to its appointed time there was a stir in the village of course to begin with there was the excitement of a new preacher would he come up to his reputation and would the performance of the village choir be satisfactory then as all the outlying members of the congregation came in from the distant farms early there was the additional excitement of hearing and giving gossip as one of the yearly functions too collection sunday was a festival for fine clothes alicia edwards wore hers an entirely new getup which remembering myfanwys look at mervyn and having in mind various penny novelettes in which jealousy played the principal part she had ordered from another shop in blackborough for she was becoming reckless at heart she was an excellent creature but her education had been against her she had learnt so much that was absolutely unnecessary for what she wanted to make out of life what did it matter to her whether she could reel off the names of the claimants to the crown of spain during the war of succession all she really desired was love sentimental not overpassionate love life without emotion was to her an empty life other girls feeling as restless as she did might have defied home authority and followed say myfanwy joness lead but she was too dutiful and in addition she had a reputation to keep up the reputation of being the best girl in the village her father of whom she was desperately afraid talked of a training college for teachers she held her peace and lived feverishly for the moment that at any rate was productive of emotion so she put on her finest clothes and went down to meet mervyn at the chapel door and greet him with a sprightly challenge and a little quiver of her lip not that she was really in love with him any other of the stalwart young men who cultivated the same forehead curl would have done as well if he had been attracted by her and called her his darling and asked her to be his wife for all her education had left her womanwoman pure and simple there was quite a crowd at the chapel door a general excitement over the thought of the new preacher though to many a bent old man and worn old woman the great event of the day was in the envelope safely tucked away in the bibles they clutched so confidently for realising that this might be their last donation they had given their ransom for the skies isaac edwards fussed round keeping a watchful eye for the doubtful members of the flock and the reverend hwfa morgan a tall young man who might have looked sensual but for his exceeding pallor spoke to the favoured few giving them a taste of his fluency he was extraordinarily fluent his periods swept along soundfully and brought forth many encomiums in the brief period between the services for the evening hour had been put forward to the afternoon in order to allow the outermost outsiders to get home ere dark and thus have no excuse for absence so the westering sun shone full into the bare whitewashed chapel when morris pugh as a preliminary to his final appeal stepped forward and the reverend hwfa morgan stepped back for the moment there was the difference of two worlds between their faces as morris gave out a wellknown welsh hymn a little sudden thrill seemed to vibrate in the humanityburdened air of the packed chapel what was it the quaint modulations rose and fell in wide compass now high now low would the spirit of the lord speak in a singing voice the thought was no new one it had been in morris pughs mind as he had listened of late to the ofttold talewhich grew in the telling of the mysterious music in the church on trinity sunday but no the hymn died away to its amen and there was no sign so he began his address and then suddenly his eye caught a figure by the door a figure in black close veiled surely it was gwengwen the sinner and then he spoke again he had passed the night in prayer he had eaten nothing the whole body and soul of him was in deadly earnest whether there was something more than this or not that in itself has to be reckoned with especially with an emotional audience so as he spoke of the dead child an old woman her face seamed with wrinkles seemed to feel a halfforgotten tug at her breast and began to weep an old man straining with almost sightless eyes for some glimpse which might make the young flexible lamenting voice more earthly less heavenly followed suit then the golden haze which filled the chapel seemed to hold a radiance and close to the speaker alicia edwards gave a little halfsuffocated cry and tore as if for breath at the laces round her throat and still the insistent strenuous voice held to its high protesting pitch of passionate reproof its cadence was the only sound no what was that from the figure by the door a soundthe merest shadow of a sound just as i am without one plea the welsh translation of a sinners joy was familiar and a thrill individual yet collective ran through the chapel as turning every one in it saw gwen her whole face sodden with tears transfigured into angelic light and peace and joy as she sang save that thy blood was shed for me the strenuous mans voice failed suddenly before the exquisite sweetness of the womans but only for a moment a voice less strenuous yet still a mans joined in the singing then another womans so by ones and twos and threes the message of certain salvation grew from a whisper to a storm of sound o lamb of god i come and then then while morris pugh stood white trembling almost appalled the reverend hwfa morgan sprang forward with a shout of hallelujah it swept away the last barrier of reserve with cries and groans the congregation leapt to its feet or grovelled in the dust speak to them man speak to them the spirit is upon you urged the reverend hwfa morgan as morris pugh still stood paralysed by the realisation of his prayer so he essayed to speak but the power did not lie with him it lay in the soft almost unearthly harmonies of gwens voice and mervyns and alicia edwards followed by those of many a young man and maiden over and over again some wild welsh chant pitted itself against prayer or preaching or even the earnest confession of sin from some sinner and always with the same result a victory for the service of song against that soothing background even time itself seemed lost the evening drew in wet and stormy the necessity for closing the chapel doors burdened the pent air still more with mans great need of forgiveness the miserable ventilation which sanitation allows to churches and forbids to theatres made women faint and strong men turn sick while every now and again a burst of unrestrained laughter or sobbing told of nerves strained to the breaking point it was nigh dawn when by the light of a pale moon obscured by drifting stormclouds morris pugh turned the key in the chapel door with a trembling hand the reverend hwfa morgan and isaac edwards were waiting for him on the wet glittering steps that is over he muttered slowly in welsh over echoed his brother cleric if the lord will it has just begun from it will spread a wave of revival you and those sweet singers his excitement was too much for him he reverted to english yes indeed we will have a collection isaac edwards slapped his thigh with an inarticulate ejaculation morris pugh he said his voice quivering with regret we have forgotten it god forgive us we have forgotten the money chapter x you might have known if you hadnt been in a dream muttered mervyn pugh as he sat his face hidden in his hands nothing can be done without money nothing and it wouldnt have mattered if it had not been for this cursed meetingandand the rector dont curse him merve broke in morris pugh who stood with the look of one newly awakened near the window gazing out vaguely at a rising star which lay on the distant hilltop like a visitant from heaven even as he looked his mind all confused and blurred the novel thought came to him that with such high and holy messengers at his command the creator need not have condescended to send such farthing dips of wandering lights to mark his elect as some which had been manifested during the revival for a month had passed since gwens singing of the hymn had electrified the little congregation at dinas a month during which what had happened morris pugh looking at his brother saw that past month as in a dream indeed he as the preacher forgetful of everything save his mission and those four voices gwens soprano alicia edwardss contralto mervyns tenor and hwfa morgans bass blending into every message of penitence or peace which emotion could desire so they had gone preaching and singing rousing an almost frenzied response wherever they went and all the while i dont understand yet he said slowly why was all this money required mervyn echoed the all with halfpathetic scorn a hundred pounds doesnt go far in running a revival he said savagely one must start the thing why even before we left dinas gwen and alicia had to get their clothes they couldnt go in what they had got and there was music wanted one had to get a chorus and the men couldnt sit up all night and work all day morgan and i talked it all over for some one must look after practical things you know and i said i would finance it till the subscriptions came in its no use your looking like that morris any fool would tell you money had to be got somehow for the time and it would have been all right but for this row with the rector that isnt my fault morris pugh started as if he had been stung no it was mine he said i am the elder i ought to have considered mervyn rose quickly and going over to his brother laid a caressing hand on his shoulder now dont morris he said using a common welsh endearment let us forget ourselves for a while i suppose it was wrong but here his lip quivered it musnt injure the work my god how awful that would be he flung himself on the chair again and stretching his arms out over the table positively sobbed he was a prey to every emotion every feeling that in this moment of anxiety and bewilderment swept over him for he and his brother had come home but half an hour ago full of elation from a successful meeting at the other end of the county to find that the rector ousted member of village boards and councils had insisted on a scrutiny of the accounts ere making over office next day and mervyn knew that the balance would be a hundred pounds short the hundred pounds which had been paid over by the central fund for educational purposes and which should have been deposited in the post office bank when it had come in a month ago he had not done so however because on emergency he had borrowed the loan of the use of it for something else to do him justice that was all he had meant once the revival was fairly started the monetary question could be allowed to crop up but without money in the background to make it possible to pose as having no regard to money how could the very committees which would work the business properly be called into existence at the time he had thought of nothing but gods service and even now he felt little remorse his sense of conversion was too strong and the whole month of incessant irritation of every possible religious emotion had left him a pulp so far as actual facts were concerned and as a rule the village accounts went on and on endlessly he lifted up his hand and smote the table impotently great heavens what was to be done that hundred pounds must be replaced somehow as he thought of how it had been spent he felt vaguely uncomfortable over an item which had gone to pay a small bill of his own contracted in amusing myfanwy jones at blackborough he felt ashamed of that but he had no shame for other things in the further past a curious fanatical exultation filled him as he thought how marvellous were gods ways and how men and women sinners utterly might stand in all innocence together and proclaim infinite mercy inscrutable mystery almost incredible secret tie of forgiven sin which made the voices thrill and blend and this must end unless there was money they had but a few hours and even hwfa morgan was not there to help with advice he would not return till morning so there was only poor dreamy morris absorbed in the personal issues there was but one issue that there should be no setback to the overwhelming success of the revival for it had been successful beyond measure in works as well as words in dinas itself the cotoneastercovered inn might have put up its shutters for all the liquor sold at the oncefrequented bar there was no swearing or quarrelling from one end of the parish to the other even the snaring of their neighbours rabbits for sunday dinner ultimate crime of a welsh quarryman had ceased and these were but the outward and visible signs of a great inward and spiritual grace a sense of perfect personal peace had fallen upon the mass of men there were no more anxieties no more fears heaven and its golden harps were within the reach of all and looking forward each personality could see itself surviving death and going on unchanged for ever and ever and aye so the grave had lost its victory each trivial soul was safe the result in pure morality not only in dinas but throughout the whole countryside was unquestionable even those who disapproved of such emotional excitement or who like the rector viewed with disfavour all outpourings of grace except through the appointed channels could not deny this and were driven to darkling hints as to the staying power of such religious feeling only martha going down in state to order the usual gross of matches at the village shopthe carriage arrangements precluded their purchase with all other things at the storesfell foul of the whole business lock and stock and barrel to isaac edwards whom she found singing hymns while he did up the pound package of sugar in which the paper heavy blue was included in the weight not that it was his fault that this was so it was only one of the usual tricks of a trade which on a small scale cannot possibly be run straight youll excuse me she said with a sniff but it strikes me as youre all a deal too free with the almighty but there once folk stops making their reverences to the gentry taint long ere they get to noddin at their creator an you dont go to the bible for your crowdedup nightwatches mr edwards king david an he oughter know says mornin evenin an noon at night e watered is bed with is tears an was still like a decent gentleman there wasnt none of this notcominhometillmornin business and how folks as as to work hard for their livin does it beats me ill set up agin most but im a pore piece next day an wouldnt ask a full wage of anybody not i and as for the young folk you mark my words mr edwards gels is gels an boys is boys whether they stands in a kirk or a mill as the sayin is an theyll find it out for theirselves poor sillies by an by if them as is past youths hayday dont harvesthome em before lights out so there an you can send up a gross an a half o matches if you think that not bein o your way o believin i shall ave to arden myself to brimstone so she had departed but her warnings had been as chaff before the wind while the harvest was being gathered in the floodtide of popular opinion lifted even the wildest extravagances as well as the most sober actuality and carried them with it whither remained to be seen and now morris pugh standing at the window looking in dull amaze at the star which had by this time dissociated itself entirely from earth could not think what would happen now everything on which he had any grip seemed to have gone since that day a long month ago when his voice had failed before gwens voice he had like the star dissociated himself from the material world altogether he had given the rein to his emotions he had lived in the clouds never asking or thinking how alicia and gwen came to be dressed so becomingly never inquiring how the expenses of railway tickets hiring placarding advertisements notices in the papers all the thousand and one absolute necessities for a successful meeting were defrayed so the truth came upon him with deadly force morally a far stronger man than his brother he could not for the moment get beyond the actual fact of fraud how could mervyn have taken the money how could he well said the latter at last rising to pace the room impatiently nervously cant you suggest something the money must be replaced somehow we darent risk anything what can be done and in the next few hoursoh it is maddening to think how many would be willing to lend it if we had only time to think even of the thousands who have hundreds and hundreds of pounds to fling away on a fancy and this he paused arrested by his brothers face what is it morris whatwhat makes you look like that for answer morris sank to his knees and covered his face as if in prayer i thank thee o my god he murmured this hast thou prepared aforetime o ye of little faithof little faith what is it morris repeated mervyn curiously the last month had done its work on him also he was prepared for all things all signs and wonders you might tell me he added after a pause no morriss face came up from his hands full of triumphant transcendental exultation no that is a secret between me and my god but the hundred pounds is found it is found i tell you oh marvellous most marvellous truly he moves in a mysterious way his wonders to perform hallelujah hallelujah for mervyns words had recalled to him in a flash the halfforgotten memory of ned blackboroughs hidden money and his mind attuned to miracles supersensitised to the direct dealings of providence with man leapt to the conclusion that the hundred pounds so idly so carelessly flung away on what appeared a mere fancy was in truth a heavenly provision against this urgent need the thought explained so much the devil of greed within him which had urged him to take the money for his own usethe gradual unfolding through this temptation of the desire for some outpouring of the spirit here were more marvels than he had time at present to consider the great fact was sufficient that in the wilderness the table had been spread it was wrong to take the money merve he said his face suffused with a heavenly joy we must not forget thatwe must weep and pray over that but it was for his service and he has forgiven usthe money is found but whenthat is the point began mervyn anxiously it must be by tomorrow morning and it is late you will wake to find it on the bible by your bedside my brother interrupted morris solemnly and then we will give thanks unto the lord for he hath done marvellous things come to supper now our mother will be anxious at our delay leave the rest in his hands the moon was riding high amid the stars when morris pugh closing the door of the sleeping cottage behind him with a whispered benediction on its inmates started for his climb to the gap where ned blackborough had hidden the hundred pounds the night air struck chill for it was late october but he was in far too exalted a frame of mind to consider such earthly things as overcoats or comforters his exaltation indeed would have seemed incredible even to the self of six weeks ago for despite his enthusiasm he had been hardheaded and practical enough now enervated by constant use of his emotions it seemed to himfull to the brim as he was by right of his cymric birth with imaginative fire poetry passionthat he was going up into the mountain alone to meet his lord and receive a gift from his hands he felt as moses must have felt on pisgah as st jerome felt when the last sacrament was vouchsafed to him those last few weeks had made an ecstatic out of the enthusiast he saw nothing but his lord he heard nothing but the call to come marvellous most marvellous yes of a truth for about himto him unseenlay the great marvel of the real presence in the world above him the marvel of the real presence in the skies and stars but the stones were to his eager feet but stumblingblocks the glory of the starlight and the moonlight was but the halo of a concrete heaven still it was very rapture worth in itself a thousand times the petty hundred pounds which had called it into being put into bald english here was a man going to take money which he wot of in order to save his brother from disgrace translated into the terms of emotional religion here was a sinner about to find salvation the night was very clear very cold the stars sparkled brilliantly aloofly there was a suspicion of frostcrackle in the thick covering of dew which lay like a filmy gossamer quilt over the grassy uplands the startled sheep left a darker track of dewdespoiled herbage behind their flying footsteps there was no cloud upon the sky whose velvet darkness seemed devoid of light save for the unhaloed moon and the sharp shining stars but morris pugh saw none of these things he had found what he soughtwhat all religions seekthe self that is not yourself he had found it through an abstraction of the mind not through the manifold face of matter but the sense of finality of universal oneness comes in a thousand ways and he felt it fully he could have sung in the gladness of his heart even while his stumbling feet bruised themselves over the unheeded stones the little rushfringed pool by which he had sat with the others asserting that money was the root of all evil lay so still so shining so set that it also might have been frostboundlike the heart of man before the mercy of the most high had touched it the root of all evil morris smiled he knew better now there was nothing evil in the holiest of holies money was a great gift so as if before an altar every atom of him soul and body thrilling with high expectation he knelt before the cleft in the rock to receive what had been given his very hands trembled not unto us lord but unto thy name he murmured softly then came a pause his fingers feeling the cleft found it empty empty incredible impossible a great amaze took him he stood up and stared vacantly at the receding whiteness of the dewcovered moonlit steeps empty then what became of of everything he had been so buoyed up by certainty he had been so sure of himself and of his god he sat down on the frostwet grass after a time and tried to think but his mind was in a maze he followed one path of thought after another always to be brought up by that barrier of feeling that he had been fooled or he had fooled himself had it not been for his previous exaltation his exultation he might by degrees have accepted the situation and considered which of the three other participants in the secret had been beforehand with him but there was no question of being beforehand with him if what he had feltnay had knownwas true they had been beforehand with god how long he sat he did not know it came upon him by surprise to hear the voice of a shepherd calling to his dogs he looked round and lo it was long past dawn he must go back and tell mervyn that he had made a mistake or was it someone else who had been tricked when he arrived at the village the first early hour had passed and folk were already beginning the days work ah what would mervyn say and what would he do it was terrible to try the latch of the cottage find it open and know that his brother must be waiting for him waiting so anxiously but there was a respite mervyn was not in hwfa morgan had arrived early the woman who tended the house said and they had gone out together just as she came in to light the fire morris sat down beside it vaguely relieved hwfa morgan might think of something meanwhile the warmth of the fire was comforting he must have been very chill his blood seemed to rush and bound through him like a melting river he was startled from a halfdoze by mervyns entrance and he stood up unsteadily i am sorry brother he began but ii mean some one has failed mervyn interrupted him curtly its lucky i didnt trust to youbut it is all rightthe things settled hwfa morgan turned up this morning and as you hadnt come back we talked it over and he suggested taking edwards into our confidence so we went over to him and he saw it would be as dangerous to his interests as to ours if there was any fuss so he consented to take our securityyours too of coursethat he shouldnt be a loser and gave me a voucher of deposit all right it can only be a question of a fortnight or so for once a central committee takes over the revival regularly our expenses will be paid but the voucher began morris mervyn interrupted him impatiently his naturally high colour heightening itself considerably oh yes of course hehe antedated it luckily there had been no other deposits for three weeks so the numbers on the counterfoils worked all right and it doesnt really matter to any one does it he spoke a trifle defiantly no replied his brother with an odd sound between a sob and a laugh i dont suppose it matters toto any one ii think ill go to bed mervei must have got a chill on the mountainsii dont feel well but there is the meeting expostulated mervyn it wont go without you morris shook his head i should be no use mervynii cant even think and then strong man as he was he broke down into sobbing chapter xi a whirling spin and din of machinery filled the air all around was endless revolution above was the ceaseless curiously slow progression of the driving bands those heavyfooted transmitters of elusive incomprehensible force and below under the great iron framings which held half a million machines in position were men and women grimecovered fluffcovered dustcovered according to their trade all moving about like automata with deadalive hearts and hands attending on some marvellous adaptation of mechanical power devised by those sane human hearts and hands out of their own powers pulley and lever and inclined plane with all their endless derivatives were hard at work for blackborough was the biggest manufacturing centre in the kingdom and blackborough was in the middle of its days work and then suddenly a clock struck another given moment of eternity had passed the wheels stopped the throbbing air grew still then from a thousand wide gateways humanity began to stream forth to flood the streets the stream was thinner less continuous than usual for it was saturday therefore payday and tallies had to be made up at the cashiers desk so they came out by twos and threes counting their gold and silver for half blackborough the past six days had resolved themselves into pounds shillings and pence she wont be ere likely o monday sniggered one of two girls their hair already in curlingpins against the evenings outing as they passed a wearylooking woman whose thin shawl failed to conceal her figure and whose heavy foot dragged over the greasy pavement wot ever did she go and get married for an to sech a drunken fellar too she was a goodlookin gel and ad a good time four year back oh shell be at it agin in a months time none the worse giggled the other girl pertly she lost er two fust an this un ull go too youll see just as well and they comin so rapid my they is fair beasts they husbands but id see mine futher fust i would and then as they hurried home to dress they fell to discussing the new hats which were to do the real trick with their boys on sunday when a long cycle ride was to end in a midnight train a late supper and after that bedif there was time even in their mill garb they helped to swell the general tendency to lark and titter in the streets but in truth those same streets were a somewhat curious sight on saturday afternoons when with money in its pocket humanity was at last at leisure to be human to loiter to laugh and to make love for the upper crust of blackborough societythe old redsandstone section labelled court in the social stratification of the postal directorymade a point of rural weekends so leaving the human pie free from any covering of culture it was amusing to watch advocates of realism would have found pictures and to spare amid the overdressed girls whose weeks wage had been squandered on their finery in the undersized boys prematurely given to ogle who had spent theirs on football bets and cheap cigarettes and as the daylight died down the squalor of it all showed still more clearly beneath the flaring gasjets especially in the market streets where all the weeks refuse of the great city was exposed for sale warranted sound while buyer and seller alike winked over the warranty purple heaps of flyblown meat labelled prime cuts in the butchershops battered tomatoes on the barrows with best homegrown flaunting in green and gold lettering above them genuine butter fresh eggs and selected dairyfed pork jostling each other in a booth such is the market which centuries of civilisation have provided for the poor and the endless crowd passed and repassed with money in its pocket lingering in groups about the gin shines at the corners giggling cursing gossiping quarrelling each person treading on the heels of the next and leaving no human footfall on the oozy pavement only blisters and scars only the certainty that some living thing had walked through the mire and carried some of the dirt away with it fine turbit fine fresh grimsby turbit shouted a man with a barrow as he turned down a darker bystreet a phosphorescent glimmer shone from his pile of stale plaice as a testimony to eternal truth peter ramsay house surgeon to st peters hospital round the corner making his way thither on his bicycle followed on the glimmer vaguely interested as to whether that semiputrescent fish bought for sundays breakfast would send him a new patient its fresh is it asked a wistfullooking old woman from a doorway smell it laidy there aint no extry charge retorted the coster surlily the old woman shook her head that test was too stern she comes from cornwall she murmured to herself so twud put her more in mind o ome nor liver wouldnt it there was a chink of coppers behind peter ramsay as he rode on thinking that some folk ought to be punished for trying to ptomainepoison the kings lieges but his mind was full of something else and before five minutes were over he was looking down on a sleeping boy and wondering vaguely for the hundredth time if he or the other doctors were right would an operationnot a known one of course but one based on new linesbe of any use or not he would dearly have liked to try in truth here in the spick and span ward amid those who had been brought in sickened by that outside squalor it was difficult to realise any lack of hygiene any lack of fair dealing yet that lack had left its mark on the sleeping face of the boy it lay with a cunning elusive look on its sharp features among the white pillows what a shutting of the door when the steed was stolen it all was looking at him critically preternaturally sharp preternaturally diseased in mind and body as he was it seemed to be a life not much worth saving and yetif it could be saved the upright wrinkles on peter ramsays forehead corrugated the transverse ones as he told himself it was useless to think of it here in vienna it would have been different he had already so far as in him lay encouraged the performance of a critical new operation the very next week and one was enough at a time he was very keen very confident this young surgeon fresh from his life abroad ready to criticise even his superiors if they seemed to him oldfashioned for his hands reaching out into the darkness around him had felt the touch of somethingsomething that he would not lose touch of though it eluded him so he followed it fast almost heedlessly this boy if he had had time or money then suddenly he smiled the thought of ned blackboroughs hidden hundred pounds came to him as it had come more than once during the last few months here was a case for it only unfortunately he had not the time for private work still it was odd what a backing that hundred pounds had been to all sorts of daydreams why it should be so was a psychological problem since after all it was but a paltry sum and in all probability it no longer existed for him for there had been distinct greed on at least two of the faces which had watched its concealment it had no doubt been appropriated long ago so the boy must go out comfortably fitted with regulation crutches to live possibly two or three years at the outside and yet he bent regretfully tracing the twist of the body beneath the bedclothes then looked up at the lingering of a passing footstep good evening mrs tressilian i beg your pardon nurse heleni am always forgetting because you will not remember she replied with a smile then her eyes grew soft she bent over the bed in her turn can nothing really be done for him doctor he is so very patient there was something about this woman peter ramsay felt which took him away as it were into a desert place apart with nothing in it save himself truth and a listener he had felt it from the moment he had first seen her and he had told her the truth even then it was another curious psychophysiological problem which evaded dissection and analysis so he had evaded her ever sincecarrying out her promise to herselfshe had appeared as a nurse in the hospital now nearly five months ago but the spell remained nothing he replied halfspeaking to himself and following up his own train of thought nothing at least that will be doneand it would be but an off chance anyhow she caught him up swiftly then there is a chance peter ramsays face became a study in cynical reserve he turned away my dear lady he said havent you been a nurse long enough to know a doctors convenient formula while theres life theres hope to his annoyance as he moved on to the door she moved also i am off duty she remarked as if she had not appreciated his slamming of the door in her face so it is no breach of rules to tell you that i have had a letter from ned blackborough he is coming back from the mountains of the moonthat was about his last address i believebut his arm is still troublesome i should like to show you what he says they were in the vestibule now and dr ramsay paused he rather admired her pertinacity and matched her coolness with his own certainly may i come in nowor stay you will want to go out i expect will you look in at my diggings after dinner i might be able to give you a cup of coffee if you will i have no doubt the matron will allow me she laughed goodbye for the present dr ramsay as he sat waiting for her in a room which beggared description by its untidiness he felt distinctly nervous but he was becoming accustomed to the fact that she had a disturbing or rather an exhilarating effect on his nerves he was a trifle irritated at the fact a trifle irritated with her because she had fulfilled his predictions she was quite normal and she made an excellent nurse he had had to admit so much but it was not her natural metierthat wassomething very different possibly he was right at any rate helen entering the room stood absolutely aghast at its utter lack of comfort she had been learning much about peter ramsay of which she had had no idea when she came into touch with him in the hospital to begin with he was much younger than she had guessed him she doubted if he was much older perhaps not quite as old as she was herself clever as he was he had most of the doctors battle for name and fame before him and there was a carelessness of public opinion a certain roughness of very solid truth about him joined to an utter disregard of his own comfort or that of any one else except a patients which made her feel that here was a man who above most men needed a strong capable tactful woman to look after him privately if he was to succeed publicly and though the sick adored him and every one admitted his skill he was not one of those men who appeal to the world at large he was too swift too incisive no young woman would darn his stockings because he was a dear the very maidservants could leave his room like this i dont expect its good he said ruefully pouring her out a cup of coffee but im not up to these things my mother spoilt me she died three years ago she was a widow and i was her only son helen sipping at her coffee told herself that explained a good deal he was capable enough professionally butthe coffee was execrable it isnt very nice she admitted and why doesnt the housemaid oh i cant have my things touched he interrupted with a frown adding as if to change an unwelcome subject so the arm is stiff im sorry we shall have to try electricity theres a place in london he was off on some new cure his red bronze eyes shining his whole bearing full of confidence and vitality she waited till the subject was exhausted and then put down her cup fixing her eyes humorously on his face and now please about that boyno in the queens wardi came to speak of him you know peter ramsay faced her half angrily then he smiled of course i knew though i dont see why you wish to find out my opinion possibly because i have an idea that your opinion may be right she replied coolly what is it you wish to do something quite new i expect he frowned there you are mistaken itor something like ithas been done at vienna by pagenheim what do you know of pagenheim i beg your pardon i was forgetting that women know everything nowadays yes mrs tressilian by pagenheim he was my master she knew that knew also that the great surgeon had sent him back to england as his best pupil well she said after a time if you wont tell me i will order the wiener hospital blatt i shall see all about it there i suppose this time he laughed out loud you are very persistent so i will save you the trouble of finding out in which number it is reported when he had finished she sat looking at him for a moment feeling a sudden motherly desire to help this curiously capable curiously inept man whose strong white surgeons hands showed themselves firmly gripping each other beyond frail frayed wristbands but surely if you hold that there is a chance of life for him she began he rose and resting his arm on the mantelpiece looked down on her mentally and physically life he echoed what is life worth to him and how do you know that what we call death ends it mind you im not speaking from my own beliefsthey arewell not much belief is positiveim not but you mrs tressilian why do you and your sort hold this life so dear and why are you all at the same time in such a blessed hurry to get another hour or two of it in which to do something when you believe in a fuller better life beyond death it isnt logical my mother used to say that when she taught me a threeyearold about cain and abel i refused to give blame to the former on the ground that he had only sent abel to heaven that should be your position and yours oh mine is simple to a doctor life is merely the converse of death and death is the devil we cannot prescribe for a corpseor for the matter of that levy a fee for so doingand that is the end and aim of doctoring why should you say those things dr ramsay she asked quietly you know you never take oneat least you would take none from me he flushed slightly because i did nothingand you were an interesting case i levy a big fee of experience mrs tressilian but concerning this boymy colleagues are against me and he shrugged his shoulders i dont think the world will come to an end if no goes out of it i shouldnt mind if it didit isnt worth much but are you not bound she persisted you have no right to judge what his life might be a doctors duty is to save life and defy death at all costs his face softened immensely you have got it quite pat mrs tressilian that is my duty undoubtedly butbut i cant afford to do itas yetand after all there is plenty of timewe have a few centuries of evolution before us yet but youyou yourself she asked scanning his face eagerly i he answered i am a temporary aggregation of molecules or let us say electrons by and by we shall find another word to express the infinitely littleor the infinitely great here a shrill whistle from the speakingtube made helen start and peter ramsay smile that ill bet will be the infinitely little he leant over to listen and his face hardened i must goan old man apparently in a fit brought in from the street goodbye mrs tressilian ill try and save his life anyhow she lingered on in the room for a while after he had left it laying an orderly hand almost unconsciously here and there and feeling that had she dared she would like to have gone into his bedroom beyond and seen if there were any buttons on the back of his shirts she remembered having heard him ask the matron for the loan of a safetypin that looked ominous he meanwhile going hastily into the surgery saw a whitehaired figure lying flat on the table and having the gift of swift diagnosis called as he entered prop him up pleaseanddresseramyl sharp held back thus by swift help from sinking down to perfect rest the weary heart rallied and after a time the old mans set face wavered he opened his large paleblue eyes and looked about him then the doctor looked about him also hullo cruttenden he said you here i brought him in replied ted cruttenden he was speaking to some workpeople in the street when he collapsed if you know his friends you had better send for them to take him homehe ought not to go alone the patient was by this time able to smile lying back on the pillow he looked extraordinarily frail and refined and his voice urbane to a degree matched his appearance friends he echoed i have none i left friendship behind mewith other thingsyears ago then if you know no one youd better stop here suggested peter ramsay brusquely i said nothing of knowledge sir replied the old man i know many and every one knows me i am sylvanus smith dr ramsay glanced swiftly at ted cruttenden as if to refresh a casual memory sylvanus smith he echoed oh yes i remember then you live near dinas and have a beautiful granddaughterandand you know cruttenden mr sylvanus smith sat up and flushed a delicate pink excuse me neither of those qualifications have any bearing on the question i am president of the social congress and i do happen to have a slight acquaintance with this gentleman i have to thank you sir i saw you amongst my audience and i presume not at allnot at all interrupted ted if you like dr ramsay i will see him home as he said the words he knew that here was a stroke of luck without in any way infringing on his compact with ned blackborough here was an opportunity of ingratiating himself with auras legal guardian he would be a fool not to take it a fool not to make the very most of it and yet when a whole week afterwards the old man leaning out of the through carriage to wales in which ted had placed him duly fortified with papers and egg sandwiches shook him warmly by the hand saying then you will come to cwmfairnog at christmas the words brought a distinct feeling of meanness to the hearer ned blackborough would have to go alone to the inn that was not what had been intended but then the whole business was absurd he had a great mind to back out of it altogether and here the swift thought came that from what he had seen of mr sylvanus smith a lordling would have scantier grace than a commoner so that it might be as well if ned a twinge of remorse had to be stilled by the recollection that everything was fair in love and war and by heavenno one could love aura better than he did no no one of course he would have been a fool not to take the luck sent him and he was a still greater fool to feel that there was in it any stealing of a march on ned blackborough what would hirsch say for ever since he had given himself up soul and body to that great man he had formed a habit of referring to him as his standard of conduct the result here was that ted positively blushed at his own scruples no ifthere was any unpleasantnessit would be better to end the compact and let them each do their best on their own footing his was very different to what it had been five months ago there was nothing now to prevent his being as rich as ned blackborough or in the future having such a title as his for at bottom all things were a question of money that he had learnt from mr hirsch a quick wave of eager ambition sent the young blood tingling to the fingertips he felt glad he might have to fight fair for the girl he loved besides it would be so much fairer on her she ought not to be deceived this highly moral thought brought with it such a sense of conscious virtue as sent him back to his office thinking deliberately how hirsch would admire aura when he saw herin pink satin and diamonds of course chapter xii ned blackborough had been to the mountains of the moon at least so he told his cousin when he drove her out from the hospital to new park the very day of his arrival at home call it the mountains of the moon my dear he had said it sounds definite and may mean so muchor so little this was about a week before christmas it gave promise of being a hard one for a slight sprinkling more of frost than snow lay on the roads and the horses roughened hoofs echoed cheerfully through the keen air it was exhilarating helen felt after those long months at the hospital broken only by dull constitutionals she had begun these by setting her face always to the country but after a time the long rows of workmens houses the dreary muddiness of gravel sidewalkings the intolerable admixture of bricks and bakers carts had driven her back to wander aimlessly through crowded streets there she could at any rate see civilisation pure and undefiled by attempts after the garden of eden so this was joy the hedgerows were black with unutterable soot the sky was grey with smoke but the birds were twittering among the smutty hips and haws and overhead a flight of cawing rooks made the grey seem light by their blackness she looked round for sympathy to ned and was struck by his face youre looking awfully well ned she remarked what have you been doing to yourself you look a perfect boy he laughed having a good time i found an old manbut that passes meanwhile i expect i shall require some healthful calm my manager tells me the business has been going to pot since ive been away i shall have to interfere myself i expect but that wont be till after christmas hows ramsay getting on helen looked a trifle stiff you had better ask him yourself you will see him when you drive me back i only know that he has resigned his appointment so he wrote me had a row apparently with the governing bodythat was ill advised very said helen coolly but then dr ramsay has no tact and is a very obstinate person is that new park you know i have never been here before ned blackborough shot a faintly amused glance at her it is new park did you ever see an inheritance more calculated to make a man cut his throat it was indeed unexpressibly dreary in its long pompous facade of regularly recessed windows each with its sham pilasters and heavy entablature it always seems as if it had a sick headache and it gives me one to look at it its a fact added ned as helen laughed it is positively more hideous thanthan the sea view hotel i hear by the way they have rebuilt that have you heard anything more of hirsch since then helen gave a fine flush he comes down to blackborough on business and i have seen him he is really frightfully distressed because i will not let him pay back that money last time he nearly wept he wept because he could not understand paraphrased ned it is not his fault it is astonishing how little sense of abstract justice and fairness people have as a rule theyre so set on mercy and lovingkindness that they forget the eyeforaneye the toothforatooth ideal well here we are the house is not quite so bad inside but it is pretty awful it was though it had been built and upholstered to order regardless of cost still there was a certain comfort in the dull red flock of its walls the dull red fleece of its floors and when once you reached it the fire lit up the marvellous expanse of priceless tiles and steel and ormulu and bronze cheerfully enough dont try and sit on any of those chairs said ned theyre screwed to their places i believe heres a basket one of mine and will you pour out tea yet it was pleasant enough sitting there by the fire in the growing dusk and neds heart gave a great throb as he thought of aura in her blue smock walking unconcernedly over the priceless pile carpets as if they had been kidderminster and she would be right when she was there all other things sank into insignificance its terribly big said helen you ought to marry ned i suppose i ought he replied solemnly but his thoughts were simply running riot over the suggestion it is too big for one and then he saw a vision of a blue smock held confidingly by a little toddling child and something in him seemed to rise up and choke him so that he had to get up and walk away from his cousins curious eyes so to change the subject he began hurriedly i didnt tell you did i about that old man i met in the desertright away from everybody i dont believe he was real but he was a wonder if you talked herbert spencer with him he replied with nietzsche there wasnt anything he didnt seem to know and that he hadnt dismissed as not worth knowing and yet he knew nothing if you hurled an example at him he was floored it was all pure thought he never did anything else but think you see he was one of their holiest men and he had sat in the same place for fifty years you have been back to india ned she exclaimed you know you have and i sent all my letters to algiers he came over to her and sat on the arm of her chair as he used to do when he was a boy they were forwardedat intervals he remarked coolly have you never nell wanted to run away for a bit and find yourself naked out in the open and then airily he began to hum that graceless ditty of young subalterns at pekin when the embassy had been relieved and the summer palace occupied and the allied army amused itself with burlesques on the vanished foe fancy me in this frosty weather posing as venus among the heather fancy me in the altogether at my time of life really ned exclaimed helen unable to repress her smiles you are the most ridiculous boy but if i am to see the domain it is time i began i must be back by five oclock they were but just in time when he set her down at the hospital and sought out dr ramsay he found him writing for dear life his face positively aglow with vitality and fire smashing em up asked ned after the first welcome was over and he had lit a cigarette peter ramsay shifted the papers a trifle shamefacedly yes he replied it isnt a bit of good of course but it relieves my feelings and hurts theirs how did it come about didnt mrs tressilian tell you well i suppose i have been a bit of a fooland yet i dont see quite what else i could have done i tell you blackborough there isnt a spot in england on which you can tread firmly without crushing a vested interest take for instance that pint of beer business i suppose you know that every one in this hospital is entitled to one pint of beer a daytyphoid fever patients dying patientsthe whole stock lock and barrel of nurses doctors porters and such like if the beer isnt drunk its at any rate paid for think of the vested interests that means so when i suggested retrenchments and took the trouble to lay the german and even the scotch figures before the governorsit costs a third less at least to run a patient in scotlandthere was the devil and all to pay andand some one made disparaging remarks about porridge and so of course there was a row then about the operation peter ramsay got up and began to walk about the room and his voice became more argumentative you see it was done and the man died well i wrote an account of it for the medical paper at vienna and some one got hold of it and translated itwell not quite fairly you see it was a question whether a certain lesionbut thats a technical detaili hadnt approved at the time and i said so and they made out i asserted the man had been killed through incompetence all i meant was that it wasnt a fair test of the feasibility of the operation and it wasnt i tried to smooth them over but as i said at the time one must tell the truth sometimes ned blackborough interrupted with a sudden laugh did that smooth them over not in the least replied peter ramsay quite seriously and they wouldnt have it either that the translator was a fool and did not know german so i resigned there is never any good in trying to work with people who arent satisfied none assented ned succinctly and what are you going to do go back to pagenheim if nothing else turns up one can live on wuerst over there and no one thinks thethe worse of you as they do here my time isnt up till february but ive offered to go at once if they like new park is at your disposal youre awfully kind if i goperhaps but something may crop up as ned blackborough drove round to keep his appointment with ted cruttenden at his office he told himself joyously that anything might crop up these next few weeks had been to him for long so full of possibilities that the whole world seemed to him capable of launching out into incredible action of kicking over the traces even of conventional chance his greeting of ted cruttenden rather took the latter aback for he had been carefully preparing for the interview how are you will the suit you on the thit suits me ted coughed and looked a little embarrassed for the inward conviction that to be quite fair the invitation to cwmfairnog ought not to have been accepted came back with the first glance at nedsat his friends face still it was no use shirking the subject so he buckled himself up for his task it will suit all right he replied boldly you had better write for a room at the inn ii am going to cwmfairnog cwmfairnog echoed ned incredulously yesim going to stay withwith sylvanus smith for all his boldness he had hesitated and ned blackborough fastened on the pause why didnt you say with aura there was a trace of scorn in his voice which ted resented hotly because the old man asked me when he came up here i know it doesnt sound quite fair lord blackborough but one cant help luck he felt ill and i happened to be there and i had to look after him then he asked me to come and stop and so of course i accepted you would have done the same if you had been me ned blackborough was silent for a moment then said perhaps oh hang it all broke in ted if you are not satisfied you neednt feel bound in any way in fact i have been thinking a lot and i have come to the conclusion that your plan isnt quite fair on her i think she ought to know and id much rather she had her fair choice you see neither she nor her grandfather really care for money ned blackborough smiled i see he said grimly on the whole i believe you are right then he thought for a moment or two so be it each for himself and the devil take the hindmost but we will stick to time and place and if you want a day or twos extra leave i ted blushed a little this time iiam not employed by the firm any longer lord blackborough he said hurriedly you have been awaybesides a clerk on a hundred and fifty would hardly come to your ears but the fact is thatthat mr hirsch offered me three hundred ned blackboroughs face took on an expression of amusement i begin to understand so you are on the high road to opulence now i wonder why he did thatyou shall tell me in the trainfor i must be off as ive some business to get through before closingtime the business appeared to amuse him also for the expression did not fade from his face as he drove to the public library hunted up a book on wales then drove to a houseagents and gave an order and finally stopped at those general entrepreneurs williams and edwards and gave another myfanwy jones catching sight of him on his way to the senior partners office volunteered a remark to the buyer in her department that she knew that fellow had seen him down at her fathers and was crushed by the reply him why he is lord blackboroughthe richest peer in england she brazened it out by saying get along but as a matter of fact ned was repeating much the same information in the office i am lord blackborough he was saying you need spare no expense only see that everything is well done the words had a marvellous dynamic power setting telegraphic wires and express vans and confidential clerks in motion the result being that when ned and ted who had travelled down third class together in very friendly fashion got out at the station nearest to dinas there were two very smart motors cars awaiting them if you will excuse me for a moment said lord blackborough to his companion ill just see my cousin mrs tressilianyou remember her of courseoff for plas afon ive taken it for three weeks and ramsay and some other people are coming down so we ought to have a good time then i can take you round in the panhard to cwmfairnog it will only make a difference of a mile or two for plas afon is just the other side of dinas you know ted waiting on the platform while helen another lady and a maid were stowed away in the covered car began to realise that ned was not going to forgo a single advantage it was to be check and countercheck on both sides it had been quick work and to get hold of plas afonthe show place of the neighbourhoodmust have needed money indeed some day he would be able to do that sort of thing if he chose but he would not choose he would never be such a reckless devil as blackborough yet he could not help admiring the go and fire of the fellow so you are going to play the prince over me he said when they had settled comfortably down under a priceless foxskin rug and ned was sending the motor up the hill full speed lord blackborough laughed not at all i had to check your move somehow i couldnt goas you goto mahomet so i had to try and induce mahomet to come to me you will decline my invitations no doubt but i shall have done my best personally he added i would much rather have stuck to the old plan anyhow we wont defile cwmfairnog with the smell of petrol well leave the motor at the bridgeyou can send for your things afterwardsand walk up ye gods how beautiful this country is in winter it was indeed the hills lay so still so soft beneath the paleblue wintry sky the distant ones greyly transparent the near ones showing rounded redbrown brackencovered lights against rounded misty violet shadows the very frost rime on each leaf each blade of grass looked soft and the gold of the slanting sunlight seemed to warm the very icicles which drooped from the high mosscovered fernclad banks showing where some trickle of water dropped from the hillside above but it was up the wooded ravines where the bare branches of the oak scrub followed each curving contour that the ineffable hues of blent shadows and shine showed to their fullest they were valleys of perfect rest deep blue in their depths jasper jewelled with crystals on their heights the footsteps of the two echoed sharply among the rocks their shadows blent into one preceded them yet the thought of both went further ahead still there were no flowers now but the brambles deadgreen and russet and gold still thrust out withered fruitbranches across their path the leafless trees gave clearer vision now they could see across the stream there was the garden the lawn and on it by heaven reaching down red hollyberries from an old tree was a figure in whiteaura herself ned gave a view holloa she turned round waved one hand then dropping her berries waved both the thought of the long round by the rhododendrons and the drawbridge was too much for them the parapet was low the stream lower still in a moment they were over it and racing to meet her like a couple of schoolboys she laughed to see them holding out both hands what a hurry you are in she cried so you have both come grandfather said you wouldnt but martha and i thought it wiser to get the two rooms readyand i was right her welcome disarmed rivalry and gave both the young men a desire to fall at her feet and kiss the hem of her garment but they repressed it of course we have both come replied ned imperturbably are we not the inseparable twoheaded fourarmed fourlegged monster edward cruttenden dont interrupt me ted i am coming to that by and by only missmissdo you know i dont happen to know your surname is it smith she shook her head with a smile grahambut every one calls me aura miss aura went on ned doubtfully she looked at him and her eyes twinkled put on the h please if you are going to speak like martha only it sounds better without any prefix for some reason or other both the young men found themselves blushing and their hearts beating much nicer assented ted with fervour but ned made an elision i was going to tell you that in addition to edward cruttenden i havefor my sinsto answer to another namelord blackborough she stared and frowned you mean she said slowly that as they put it in the books you are edward cruttenden lord blackborough edward cruttenden gibbs to be strictly according to debrett he answered meekly i had to take the name when i came into the title three years ago a distinct look of disappointment showed on her face it is a very great pity she said still more slowly then she added more cheerfully however i suppose it cant be helped only when i thought of you it was always as ned and ted she glanced at the latter and smiled so far as i am concerned there is no reason why you shouldnt continue he began no reason at all interrupted ned with the first note of rivalry in his voice let us remain ned and ted forfor this week at any rate this week she echoed looking from one to the other i dont quite understand then suddenly for the first time in her life she blushed it was extremely uncomfortable and she felt vaguely annoyed with both the young men so she turned to them stiffly will you come and see grandfather and have tea first or go to your roomsyou know where they are there was a pause broken accusingly by ted lord blackboroughi mean ned thank you put in ned with a laugh i can do my own dirty work if you please the fact ishe paused still fighting shy of that dear name i mean im afraid i cant stop if i had guessed butbut i didnt he shrugged his shoulders it is so hard to predicate perfection the fact is my cousin is living at plas afon for a fortnight or so and i must go back to herafter tea plas afon she echoed eagerly oh i hear that is such a lovely place how lucky you are then the personal aspect of the news made her frown a little dear me she said what a pity it spoils so much now i shall have to differentiate between you two will you come in to tea lord blackborough and mr cruttenden they followed her meekly feeling vaguely ashamed of themselves chapter xiii she is as straight as a yard o pump water an wont never brush forty again said martha up to her elbows in flour austerely but i wouldnt trust her for that neither no not with bate comin into his dinner wantin comfort he have a trick o blushin miss haura as sympathy might make a marryin onan i wont have it in the ouse but i thought said aura gravely for she was accustomed by now to marthas view of the new parlourmaid that bate gave parkinson no encouragement encouragement echoed martha bitterly no more he do why he dont even wink at her give her the cold shoulder constant but there shes o that sort miss haura as dont mind whether a jints ot or cold so long as its mans meat besides master ud need a woman folk to stand atwixt him and the funral if there was a smash in the motor for bate aint no manner of use when theres tears aboutes got such a feelin eart so thanking is lordship all the same for the kind thought id better stop at ome there was never any questioning marthas decision so aura went back to the drawingroom doubtfully it was a glorious day and ned blackborough had come over halfanhour before bearing both to herself and her grandfather notes of invitation from mrs tressilian to come over to lunch and see the show place the notes had evidently been all in order for though her grandfather had declined brusquely for himself he had looked at her as if he had just realised she was no longer a child and asked her wistfully if she would like to go and she without a thought had told the truthnamely that she would love it then had come doubts the last three days filled up as they had been by the absolute adulation of the two young men had brought her a curious innate but till then dormant sense that there were things which girls ought not to do and having much against her will admitted this to herself she became sternly scrupulous ought she or ought she not to go alone with lord blackborough in the motor she knitted her brows over the problem telling herself the while that she hated the world and every one in it then lord blackboroughhe had an uncomfortable habit of reading her thoughts which she bitterly resentedhad suggested martha and now martha would not come it was all such silly nonsense ned blackborough watching her troubled face felt that he could then and there have put his arms round her kissed her even against her will and carried her right away from everything and everybody from all conventionalities and princes and powers she was a perpetual temptation to him to cast aside what few moorings he had he was a man and she the one and only woman in the whole wide world and he wanted her it was a headlong purely emotional desire from whichcuriously enough it struck himpassion was almost entirely absent in a way despite his greater reserve there was more of passion in teds rational straightforward more normal love the very emotionality of neds feeling however carried with it content and certainty for he felt that nothing in heaven or earth could dim the halo of flame and fire in which he stood beside her so he could afford to be magnanimous then you had better take the fourth seat ted he said carelessly looking to where the latter his hands in his pockets was glooming out of the window at the motor which could just be seen waiting through the bare branches across the drawbridge he had already had a casual invitation for himself and his cycle thrown at him he felt like a bone to a dog but he had refused it pleasant work indeed riding in the dusty wake of a rival who was abducting the girl you loved at the rate of fiveandtwenty miles an hour in a panhard from every point of view he had decided it would be wiser to stop at home possess his soul in patience and keep auras grandfather in a good humour for the more he saw of aura the more he realised that her choice was likely to follow the lead of her environment he was very clearsighted very much in earnest the unconventionality of the position irked him and he heartily wished that he could quarrel with ned or even huff himas people always did on these occasions but that was out of the question he was bound to be friendly and fight for the girl fairly yet being what he was a man with a natural gift for business he could not help drawing up his prospectus as it were and counting up all his available assets his love had nothing of neds impetuosity about it so with all his real passion for aura he soon realised that it was wise not to show it too much it frightened her the brotherly tack ensured quicker confidence and of course sylvanus smiths liking for him was a great point in his favour regarding this he did not feel in any way mean for he himself liked the old fellow and found his somewhat antiquated talk interesting but this later offer of neds was another thing he looked round and accepted it heartily feeling however as he often did when he looked at neds face a trifle of a sneak for he was fighting impulse with strategy and he felt convinced that he was right in doing so he was nevertheless in danger of forgetting his role when aura made her appearance dressed for her drive she had a little conscious flush in her face the result of having for the first time in her life tried on and rejected various articles of attire so far as the dress and coat went she had no choice her method of life made washing dresses a necessity and for winter white was the only colour which would survive marthas vigorous washing so her serge toned to a decided cream by those same efforts after cleanliness was unalterable and the furs she had found in the boxes of outworn apparel which her grandfather had handed over to her on her sixteenth birthday were also a permanent asset she had no notion of their worthshe supposed they were sable she knew that when the darker longer hairs blew aside the inner fluff was exactly the bronze hue of her hair it was her headcovering which troubled her she tried a scarlet tamoshanter but flung it aside the contrast was too great a white one followed suit there was something wrong she knew not what finally a bronze brownspecked one made a faint curve come to her lips it matched the fur and somehow her face then she lingered with a halfshamed look by the chestofdrawers should she should she not she might at any rate take something in case so she stuffed a long fine lace scarf into her muff and ran hastily downstairs her advent brought a sort of breathlessness to the two young men ned evaded it by saying prosaically youll have to tie on your head with something i expect i have got something replied aura superbly and out came the lace scarf it was bewildering all the more so when mr sylvanus smith looking at her with that same wistful affection said half to himself your grandmother wore that my dear when she was married but there was no time for sentimentalities here was a young girl instinct with vitality to her very finger tips going out for her first ride on a motor going out for her very first experience of the world i have never been further than this before she said heaving a great sigh of content as the car turning almost at right angles sped over a bridge and curved towards the further side of the estuary everything now is new everything ive never even seen the hills this shape before and how strange our side of the valley looks who would believe that was cwmfairnog i dont believe i belong to it a bit she pointed to a pale blue shadow among the shining hills showing where the little valley sank to restful sheltered peace im sure you dont echoed ned joyously only i dont quite know where we belong tounless it is everywhere the we smote on teds ears disagreeably as he leant over from the back between them while the chauffeur honest man sat immovable in his corner as if he saw and heard nothing you belong to us at present he said laughing so take care you dont smash us up nedwe cant afford to lose her she laughed back at him carelessly that was exactly what she felt she was having a splendid time with both of them it was a drive never to be forgotten down here by the sea the frost had slackened its hold and in sheltered corners the grass was as green as at midsummer a robin was singing its heart out on a bramble bough where one pale flower showed rejoicing in the winter sunshine it looked colder in the sky than it was on earth for overhead a great white cloud drifted like an iceberg through a sea of palest bluea frozenlooking chilly blue is that plas afon im so sorry exclaimed aura as a swift turn in the road brought them to a sheltered bay almost landlocked by a rocky promontory covered with trees it needed but one glance at these to show you that here was art not nature but it was art mimicking nature in her kindest moods and bringing together from the four corners of the earth the glories of eastern and western forests of the south and of the north a few gold leaves still lingered on the spanish chestnuts the blue of the noble pine formed a background for the goldenbarked willow the silver cedar threw out its long arms across a scarlet oak and almost to the waters edge grew rare conifers and blossoming shrubs i believe you are afraid i am said ned steering for the portico whos afraid laughed ted from the back seat his eyes on the girl not you or i ill bet we sit free of this sort of thing keep your responsibilities to yourself ned once more aura looked back at him and smiled brilliantly she was not afraid but she felt oppressed yet how lovely it was a velvet lawn sloping away to the sea those unknown beautiful trees each standing sentinel over a portion of gods earth and in the sheltered nooks groups of tall grasses and hardy palms not a dead leaf every tuft of herbage in its right place and the gravel aura had never dreamt of such gravel before each pebble roundpolished glowing halftranslucent in the sunshine like an uncut gem she felt she could scarcely dare to walk upon the pretty things and it was a beautiful house too a real fairy palace yes it was like a dreama dream of great of exceeding beauty there was not a discordant note in it the man of whom ned had told her who had built it who had lavished a fortune on it and had then died in faraway italy leaving it to fall into the hands of philistines must have had what must he have had ah well he must have been rather like ned blackborough himself for plas afon fitted ned somehow in its fineness its elusiveness she turned her eyes to him and flushed for his were on hers thinking how plas afon fitted her and in truth it did fitted her all the more for the flush since she held her head higher and followed him with a still lighter freer step i am so glad said helen tressilian coming forward this is miss vyvyan aunt emthis is miss aura graham delighted im sure murmured a tall stately absolutely colourless lady who was engaged in making laborious needlepoint on a tiny piece of black lining about two inches square a tiny reel of almost invisible thread a miniature pair of scissors were also held in her left hand they formed her only individuality for the rest she got up at the right time ate her breakfast and made appropriate breakfast remarks and so lived through her day doing as the rest of the world did but these came down with her in the morning and went to bed with her at night held always in her white beringed left hand perhaps she slept with them anyhow they were an integral part of her waking life if any one thinking to be agreeable asked her how she was getting on she would smile gently indulgently and say that of course such work took time ned used to feel that it annihilated time altogether and could he have happened on it unprotected would for a certainty have annihilated it but it went with her everywhereeven in the motor something quite terrible has happened ned went on helen tressilianshe had given one look at aura and been satisfiedbut it cant be helped the smithbiggs have motored over from aberaronandandthey have brought mr hirsch i sent dr ramsay out with them to show them the garden butbut theyll have to stop to lunch theyre welcome retorted ned with irritation i shall lunch in the garden when theyve left it wehe looked at auraonly eat the fruits of the earth you know it was your cousin who asked me to lunch began aura gravely whereat ned laughed you have an appalling sense of duty he replied but i give in to it now as i see hirsch and co coming across the lawn if we slip out by the back we shall escape them till lunchtime anyhow aura looked at him doubtfully his responsibilities which were beginning to weigh her down seemed to affect him not at all are you going too mr cruttenden asked helen noticing a certain hesitation on teds part in truth he was undecided he wanted to see mr hirsch and at the same time he wished to be with aura of course he could see his chief after lunch but supposing they did not stop to lunch so ned blackborough had the girl to himself for a moment or two as he led her round by the back way through thickets of rhododendrons he felt triumphant as a man does when he sees an opportunity before him and then then he forgot everything in pure delight at her eager face in the joy of her enjoyment it is the most beautiful place in the world she cried at last and this is the most beautiful thing in it she was on her knees beside a tuft of red bronze tyrolean saxifrage out of whose close carpet of velvet the tiny silvergreen scimitars of the iris alata curved round guarding its broad purpleblue blossoms for they were in the wintergarden now not one of those crystal palaces of palms and hotwater pipes which answer to that name in the minds of so many no this was a real garden in full air but tucked away from every breeze that blows in a cove giving on the sea among the rocks above the small cleft of sandy beach on which the tide lapped lazily grew all the kindly green things innumerable which have learnt to do without the rest of winter sleep the winding walks edged their narrow way through great tinted carpets of saxifrage and sedums and many another sturdyleaved coverer of bare earth bronze and sage and golden brown and purple and grey with a few blue blossoms on a creeping veronica a few late primroses a few early winter aconites and through it over all was the fine scent of the winter heliotrope that clung to the crannies of the rocks or grew lush by the little stream which falling in tinkling cascades slid along the sand into the sea it was such a garden as every one with patience and care might have which none but the very few take the trouble to plant there was nothing in it to tell of wealth save an old stone sphinx jutting out by the steps which led to the tiny wedge of beach its plinth forming a sort of jetty beside which a boat lay moored that had the measureless calm of egypt in its eyes as it stood backed by the changeful sky the changeful sea i believe it sees me added aura looking up from the broad open face of the flower her own as open as beautiful and it has never seen me before that makes me feel less strange here where everything is newand strange it seems to me i have seen more today than in all my life before it is so curious what to see new things he answered smiling down at her isnt that the only thing worth having in lifeto be able to think when you wake today something may come to me which never came beforeto feel a sort of perpetual annunciation she stood up suddenly measuring him with narrowed eyes i do not understand she began he shook his head oh yes you do im sure of it sit down on the plinth there and ill try and tell you what i mean so with the sphinx above her she sat and listened it was not much he had to say only the halfwhimsical halfserious thoughts of a man who almost without knowing it had the seeing eye for the invisible the hearing ear for the inarticulate who felt vaguely that the best part of life lay beyond the boundary set to conscious life by the majority of men in formulated shape it was all new to her but something in her she knew not what found it familiar approved and her face showed her approval her interest i see she said slowly and the message is fear not i like that yes he replied absently clasping his hands over one knee and leaning back against the plinth to watch a cormorant that was coming back from fishing beyond the bar a solitary swift black speck upon the blue it would be good if one could get at it we risk life every day for what we call love or money but we are in a blue funk about the truth because the truth is that neither love nor moneyyou know dont you that i am awfully hideously rich ted told me you were the richest man in england the devil he did laughed ned i beg your pardon but that wasnt in the bond anyhow im beginning to feel as if i could with pleasure sell all that i have and followsomething else but you have no right began aura you cant shirk your responsibilities et tu brute he murmured pathetically my dear creature you havent any idea how i loathe being rich money doesnt buy what i likefreedom no confound it it is always getting in the way there he added resignedly as he rose i told you so there is that pampered powdered beast of a footman whom im ruining body and soul by my ridiculous claims coming to tell us lunch is ready andand we are enjoying ourselves he looked at her as he held out his hand to help her to rise she gave him hers frankly enough but drew it away hastily as if something in the touch of his gave her offence and a quick frown came to her face that has nothing to do with it she replied austerely you have no right to keep your guests waiting if i had your sense of duty ii should kill that fellow he remarked coolly as the footman stopping short at a respectful distance among the saxifrages said in the tone of voice in which a congregation echoes the responses in church if you please your lordship luncheon is served aura looked grave for an instant then she laughed she was never quite sure whether to take ned blackborough aux grands serieux or not she admired him however when entering the diningroom the glitter and clatter of silver the chatter and laughter of the guests and the consciousness that every one was looking at her to see who had made their host so late gave her a desire to run away he was so easy so selfpossessed withal so clearly determined not to let any one interfere with his plan which was apparently to sit beside her i beg your pardon helen he said cheerfully miss graham and i were in the winter garden will you sit here miss graham ah lady smithbiggs so glad youve come and how is sir joseph dont let me disturb you ramsay you fill the place better than i should is there room for me by you aunt em hullo wheres hirsch this as he circled the table brought him to a vacant seat beside aunt em but also next to aura to whom he said in an undertone theyll hand you things you can eat the butlers introduction of an elaborate silver dish with the mystic whisper brown bread and butter cutlets emphasised the remark and she helped herself decorously with a spoon and fork mr hirsch and mr cruttenden went off smoking somewhere replied helen ah here they come at last my dear mrs tressilian exploded mr hirsch in his strident voice i am overwhelmed but when one gets to talking about money there is always the devil to pay hirsch put in ned ah my dear blackborough wie gehts what an entrancing place why dont you buy it it is not for sale replied ned and its quite enough to hire it i assure you hirsch mr hirsch laughed in his loud unfettered fashion ah my dear blackborough you always pay too much for everything you are the sellers natural prey aura who had helped herself out of another silver dish to something which the butler called fraises a la creme en caisses because it looked to her like strawberries and cream gave a quick glance at ned paid for yes of course everything must have been paid for in an instant all her pleasure became transmuted to gold the very strawberriesstrawberries at christmas what must they not have cost and they had been got for her she felt hotly as if she were being bribed if you will finish your lunch came neds voice in an undertone we can start back as soon afterwards as you choose yes hirsch he added out loud i know im done all round but it amuses people and it doesnt hurt me the only use of money is to get rid of it i never mrs tressilian protested lady smithbiggs plaintively quite understand what your cousin means i dont wonder replied helen soothingly then smiled to herself for in truth the lady in question seldom understood anything but being the wife of a conservative manufacturer who stood for his native town thought it her duty to take an interest in social and political questions ned loves paradoxes but he really hates being cheated as much as any one i only meant lady smithbiggs put in lord blackborough gravely that i am quite willing to subscribeas i am sure sir joseph doesto all the great truths which underlie our commercial prosperity that is to say first that everything is worth what it will fetch and a trifle more for underhand percentages secondly that nothing can be called cheating in an open market thirdly that truth is the affair of the purchaser or his creator bah my dear lord blackborough laughed mr hirsch you would have a world without money it would be a pretty paradise but protested lady smithbiggs again her diamond earrings twinklingthey were so magnificent that they made one forget the redness and the fatness of the face against which they shone i really do not understand if you have no money how can you pay your bills i pay mine by cheque remarked ned with a sideglance at aura after her sudden desire to escape which his aside had checked she had become amused then interested by the conversation and now his allusion made her flush up then smile for she was beginning to realise that this curious world in which money played so important a part was really the world in which she had always lived she had not seen the token that was all but my dear ned said miss vyvyan placidly you cant pay everything by cheque the bank doesnt like cashing small sums i know when i send for my thread to honitoni have to send there you know it is so fine she explained to lady smithbiggs laying her hand on the tiny black roll which as usual was beside her plate i always have to send a postal order exactly so breathed lady smithbiggs with a sigh of relief so you are wrong lord blackborough why even the very children have pennies i used to think it rather dreadful their doing so much shopping for their mothers but sir joseph says you cannot train them too early to understand the real value of money and i am sure he is right for it is quite impossible to live without it that is a question which we ought to refer to miss graham remarked ned blackborough coolly i believe she has never even seen a sixpence if a bomb had fallen on the lunchtable it could not have produced a greater effect mr hirsch sat petrified his fork halfway to his mouth all eyes were turned on aura who bore the brunt with smiles for there was something of pure mischief in her hosts face which was infectious even ted over the way waited amused i believe she did once see a sovereign continued ned perhaps she will tell you what she did with it the girls face dimpled with laughter i gave it to the cockatoo dynamite could not possibly have been more disconcerting the cockatoo echoed mr hirsch automatically as becoming aware that the sole au vin blanc on his fork was dripping on to his waistcoat he dabbed blindly at the spot with his napkin andand may i ask my dear young lady whatwhat the cockatoo did with it he wouldnt eat it said aura and so interrupted ted rather viciously it was thrown into the stream aura turned swiftly on ned this was news did you she began so there it lies remarked ned as the beginning of a welsh goldmine make a prospectus out of that hirsch it would be as true as most of them i expect but i do not quite understand protested lady smithbiggs once more her pale blue eyes fixed vacantly on aura what you have never seen a sixpencehowhow dreadful that is easily remedied remarked peter ramsay i believe i have so much in my pocket anyhow stay a bit ramsay said lord blackborough miss grahams ignorance is not confined to sixpence she is generally unacquainted with the coin of the realm mr hirschs eyes were almost starting out of his head partly in admiration of the girl whom he now discovered to be exceedingly beautiful gott in himmel he muttered i believe i have half a crown an two shillings capital cried ned simmonds take the plate round and then bring it to miss graham admirable admirable blackborough mon cher you have imagination exploded mr hirsch fumbling excitedly in his pockets what luck i have a twoflorin bit and i swore at them when they gave it me ah young lady one does not often meet one so olda thousand pardons mademoiselle but at your age one need not be so afraid his goodnatured face was brimful of kindliness and honest enjoyment and aura responded to it you neednt be in the least afraid she smiled i shall be twentyone on new years day the information was welcome to at least two of the party and the others carried away out of the conventional for the time applauded the confidence soh exclaimed mr hirsch who was now busy with coins and a silver salver while the butler and two footmen stood behind him sniggering aha young lady you began a new era ah we must all send you awhat do you call etrennes in english to commemorate this extraordinarymein gott has any one a threepenny bit so with much laughter lady smithbiggs absolutely contributing from a very small purse a whole fiveshilling piece a complete set of coins was handed to aura with the companys compliments miss said the butler that ends your hours of innocence miss graham remarked ned blackborough gravely as the ladies left the room it did not end auras ordeal however for once in the drawingroom lady smithbiggs begged to be introduced in form oh i am sorry said aura innocently reaching up to the good ladys outstretched waggling hand but i always shake hands lower down is that the right way the question verged on the impossible since lady smithbiggs lived in the highest circles but she ignored it and all her good breeding did not prevent her descending on the girl with a perfect cataract of questions where did she live who was her father had she any brothers or sisters aura began to grow restive no she replied shortly then fearing she had been too incisive added i have often wished i had i should have liked them helen tressilian coming to the rescue looked at her with soft approving eyes they would have liked you im sure i expect you are very fond of children the girl turned to her impulsively yesvery you dont know how often ive wished that i had a baby it was worse than the sixpence lady smithbiggs gasped her matronly breast heaved she cast a nervous glance towards her daughter who was providentially occupied in looking at miss vyvyans lacework my dear she said majestically you havent a mother so youll excuse me telling you that we dont say that sort of thing in society aura blushed a furious red why not she asked and her voice had a militant ring in it o ned ned whispered helen tressilian to her cousin as at that moment the gentleman entered the room for heavens sake take her away from us soon or she will be spoilt he grasped the situation in a moment im afraid we must be starting miss graham we are going to row you across the estuary and then we can walk home over the hills you have never been in a boat have you no said poor aura suddenly feeling inclined to cry it seemed to her as if she knew nothing and had seen nothing chapter xiv peter ramsay had come down to spend the christmas holidays at plas afon in a very bad temper both with himself and his world he was perfectly aware that he had been overhasty in his struggle with vested interests but what irritated him most of all was the knowledge that he had as it were cut the ground from under his own feet so that further fighting was impossible he could of course go over to vienna and learn a great deal under pagenheim but he would only have to come home again and begin where he had left off which was sillyintensely silly there are few things more annoying than the knowledge that you have given yourself away needlessly and that a very slight application of a drag might have prevented the applecart from being overturned the whole affair seemed now almost childish in its crudity what the deuce did it matter whether a hogshead or a pint of beer were drunk or if one patient the more died instead of living to die in due time of something worse he was glooming out of the window over such thoughts as these when helen after seeing lady smithbiggs startdespite her lunchin a terrible fuss lest she should be too late for tea came back to the drawingroom aunt em as always had discreetly retired to her room whether for work or sleep none knew so they were alone it was for the first time and helen seized her opportunity for she had something she wished to say to him so she crossed to where he stood his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets ned tells me you have made up your mind to vienna she said kindly there was a sort of forlornness about this strong capable man which always touched her i have mrs tressilian he replied somewhat defiantly i shall go to pagenheim and find outthings she smiled and come back i suppose to give no in the queens ward a chance of life if any one will provide me with a private hospital meanwhile mrs tressilian he answered for i dont see my way to it otherwise she flushed a little eagerly as if the conversation were taking the turn she had desired i am so glad you say that dr ramsay she replied for it helps me to say something you know i have left the hospitalat least i am not going back now i have to live somewhere where matters little anddespite what you thought oncei am quite a decent nurse a good one ifif i am keenly interested if i were to take a small house outside blackboroughor anywhere elseandand make a regular surgical ward out of one room would youwould you try that operation he stared at her but why on earth he began for many reasons she interrupted hastily chiefly because i confess to feeling a responsibility or my lack of it he put in dryly im afraid not mrs tressilian it would cost too much to be frankyou havent the money neither have i money she echoed a trifle scornfully oh it isnt a question of money ned would find that i have spoken to him and he is quite ready to help peter ramsay became very stiff that is extremely kind of him and it is extremely kind of you also i am only thinking of no she interpolated warningly i am perfectly aware of that fact he replied but may i remind you of anotherthat no is only one out of say a million who are very possibly better dead and out of the way my cutting him about might be a selfish pleasure my duty might beeuthanasia she looked at him vexedly i do not dictate to you a doctors duty she said with spirit but i know that a nurses is to save life and defy death at all costs have i got that quite pat he smiled you have an excellent memory mrs tressilian he replied andand i am grateful for the suggestion but it is quite out of the question perhaps when i return from vienna i may be able toto do my duty at present i ought to be starting for my walk over the hills lord blackborough has promised to pick me up at dinasthe motor is to meet him thereand as this is my last day are you leaving us tomorrow she asked quickly for an instant he felt inclined to confess that he had had no previous intention of departing before the new year but he swallowed his vexation at his own hasty decision and said rather lamely i am afraid i musti ought just to give a look round the london hospitals before i go abroad i suppose it would be better she assented sarcastically i have always understood that they are really not bad except for the beer he answered coolly and left her but though it was easy enough to dismiss helen and her suggestions in this cavalier fashion he could not dismiss a feeling of irritation at her implied disapproval the faintest hint of it always roused resentment in him and a desire to make that disapproval utterly unreasonable so as he breasted the hills intending to walk over their summits and when time was up drop down on dinas and the motor his thoughts were busy with the possibility of fitting in no in the queens ward with his plans for the future there was always the hidden hundred poundsif it still existed he had a great mind to see if it did since he was so close to its hidingplace would he have time he looked at his watch and then gave a glance seaward the estuary now at flood tide lay silver in the winter sunshine and not more than halfway across it he could discern a slowlymoving black speck the boat of course if that were so he would have ample time and for a smoke also he sat down and watched the small black speck wondering what had delayed those three it seemed to be going faster now but even so there was time and to spare an hour and a half at least ere they could possibly crest those further hills and drop down into the valley and thenthen by the computation of experience it would be at least an hour ere ned blackborough would tear himself away peter ramsay had rather a contempt for love it was to him a physiological disease the violence of which argued a lack of selfcontrol and the beautiful girl who had never seen a sixpence though very charming appeared to him to be a most unsuitable wife for any man for his idea of a wife was distinctly some one who could comfort and coddle andwithout open wordsprevent one from making an ass of oneself yes he had made an ass of himself but concerning no there was no reason why he should not take his own way after all there was nothing but life the metaphysicians would put thought first but it was ergo sum cogito not the converseat any rate to commonsense nothing was susceptible to absolute proof except life and death and they probably were mere conditions of matter as he looked out the light waves from the faintly declining sun were turning the invisible vapour about the higher hills into a filmy mistveil which seemed to hang between him and the distant view his eye seemed to detect in it a ceaseless shimmer an almost imperceptible vibration that was it truly the motes in a sunbeameven he himself for that matterwere but transient aggregations of the atoms in their unending dance of life and death what would they hive into like swarming bees a man or a mousewho could tell only the master of the ceremonies in this dance macabre so the question of life or death was already settled for no though so far as hepeter ramsaywas concerned it depended on the existence or nonexistence of that miserable pittance of a hundred pounds but all the sanctions all the mental and moral backings of humanity depended on something which could not be proved to exist he rose with a shrug of the shoulders put out his pipe and started on again life or death seemed to him to hang on that hundred pounds he did not much care which the odds were distinctly on death as he turned ere dipping down into the valley which lay between him and the gap he gave a last look at the silver shield of the estuary the boat must have reached the shelter of the further shadowunless it had gone down life and deathdeath and life an even balance despite the surgeons skill despite even money as a matter of fact the boat had at last reached the opposite shore and ned blackborough feeling savage with himself and fate was standing by holding the rope taut while ted visibly triumphant was lifting aura bodily from the boat across the intervening yards of slush and seaweed he set her down gently with a frank thats all right and she looking up at him smiled her thanks im so sorry you hurt your arm she said to ned rather condescendingly it is lucky ted could row so well isnt it very lucky replied ned feeling aggrieved he had gone on pulling against that miscounted tide till he positively could no more and even now the pain of his illmended arm made him feel almost sick he had been forced to give in and though ted had been perfectly within his rights in failing to let aura know that the disability waswell not absolutely blameworthyhe need not have sculled so confoundedly well he had been a picture to look at bending easily to the long stroke while ned was idly steering we had better take the crudel valley said the latter as a byepath showed up a lonely glen it isnt half as pretty as this but it is shorter and we havent much time i delayed you horribly aura smiled tolerantly but we came along splendidly afterwards didnt we you know this country awfully well remarked ted feeling the urgent need of generosity i havent an idea where we are but ned was in no humour for patronage i happen to hold the mineral rights of the crudel valley in rather a queer roundabout way he replied they went with a property my uncle had bought in shropshirebut that is beside the point naturally with all the fuss there has been about the slate quarries lately i have had to know something as to the lie of the land when we first met i was down to see it so there is nothing wonderful in my knowledge ted stared at him by george then it is you who put a spoke in the wheel of that new company aura looked at him also and with quick disapproval is it you who have thrown all the people out of work she asked do you know some of the children havent enough to eatat least she added her look having brought her she scarcely knew why a vague doubt martha told me that the people were getting up a subscription for them ned laughed derisively and shrugged his shoulders you wont understand what i mean but there is a general election due next year the men have had other employment offered them if they wont accept it that is their own fault but i dont understand your objection began ted dont you interrupted lord blackborough i think that must be because you dont know good slate from bad they had passed on by this time into that most desolate of all places on gods earth a valley of unworked slate quarries a valley desecrated by mans needs yet needed not by man seamed scarred riven until scarcely a blade of gracious grass remained on what had once been soft sweet sheepbite set with heather shadowed by dense bracken thickets great moraines of debris not rounded by long aeons of slow yet certain grinding in the mill of god but fresh crude angled from the hand of man usurped the valley now on this side now on that turning the very roadway bordered by rusty rails to their pleasure a mountain stream released from long slavery spedexultantly freepast the low congeries of differently pitched roofs supported by iron pilasters beneath which cogwheels and bands levers and distributors stood immovable rusted into silence hanging halfway up a stiff incline of shale an empty truck hung rusted to the rails another full of split slate squared holed ready for homestead or granary stood in the wide stackingyard where thousands and thousands of these same leaves of slate looking like huge books were ranged in orderly piles how many homes how many churches how many barns and factories might not have been roofed in by these piles waiting idly for what for money ned blackborough stooped down and picked up a slate which had fallen on the truckway it snapped between his fingers and with a laugh he flung it aside bad stuff he said and that is better than most i tell you that this valley which is a valley of desolation now has been a valley of dishonesty from the very beginning his eyes seemed to catch fire and he turned to ted almost threateningly and you dont understand will you understand i wonder when i tell you that these quarries like many another have been in the hands of speculators from the very beginning some one who knew the slate was bad took to himself others who knew it also and between them they floated a company when the money had gone some other rascal bought the bankrupt stock and started another company and another and another and all the time these workmen whom you commiserate were hewing and splitting and taking their wages for what for money only for money what was it to them that the slate was bad that their labour was wasted and vain they got their money and now they wonder because when the lease of the last company was up i stepped in and said no this sham shant go on i claim my right and i wont be bribed by anybody he spoke almost passionately then laughed and with a brief i beg your pardon these things irritate me struck up a shady footpath which led over the hill i dont exactly see how it could have been done remarked ted argumentatively if they went bankrupt they must have had a valuator and then ive no doubt they had broke in ned impatiently but what i tell you is the long and short of it besides i dont consider the workman is to be blamed at all argued ted so long as he does his work fairly and gets his pay for doing that work no one has a right to find fault with him then think of the women and children aura whose face had grown keen over the discussion looked swiftly at ned awaiting his answer he in one of his worst moods gave it unhesitatingly my dear fellow what is the use of breeding up a race of thieves and swindlers with that he bent himself to take the hill at a gallop leaving those two agreeing as to the women and children agreeing also in a thousand superficial likings and dislikings born of youth high spirits and no small lack of thought but at a sharp turn amid the tumbled debris they overtook lord blackborough opposed to a small boy seated disconsolately on the ground in a puddle of fresh milk dotted with the remains of a broken jug while an illlooking collie dog yapped from the shelter of a more than usually large block of worthless slate it wasnt my fault explained ned ruefully that brute of a dog upset him trying to bark and run away at the same time the small boy having now realised his misfortune was blubbering in welsh i dont understand what he is saying said aura looking up at ted after bending over the urchin with english consolation do you he shook his head that is the worst of wild wales one cant be compassionate ned looked at them a trifle contemptuously hes afraid a boy never blubbers like that without cause and he isnt hurt here you he continued hauling the child up incontinently dont howl i go with you homecatredo you understandcatremam with which welsh smattering he dragged up the unwilling boy still blubbering towards a group of slate cottages which showed a few hundred yards away such desolatelooking cottages only to be differentiated by their straight lines from the masses of debris about them you go on he called back its straight over the brow of the hill and then you can see ill pick you up in no time but when they looked back from the summit there was no trace of him on the upward path there is no use waiting said ted oracularly by george what a relief this is he spoke in glad confidence as his eye travelled over gods good world untouched undefiled and yet in his heart of hearts he would not have scrupled at any desecration of nature provided it were in pursuit of gold nevertheless he responded at once to the fresh bright breeze on the wide undulating hilltops and the free glad joy in life itself as life came to him as they passed with springy step over grassland and bogland all acrackle with faint frost what did they talk about not love certainlyhe was too wise for thatthough love lay at the bottom of all his thoughts how your hand trembles she said laughingly as he held hers in crossing a brook he flushed a little weve been going such a rate he replied youre the best walker i know for a girl there was something in the qualification which set her at her ease i wonder what has become of ned she said once as they finally turned into the home valley and saw beneath them spread out like a map the familiar fields the sloping lawn the straight walks of the garden the cosy comfortablelooking chimneys all asmoke ted pointed to the skyline above them where for an instant a dark something which might have been a sheep and might have been a man showed then disappeared up in the clouds as usual he laughed ned is an awfully good chap but i wish he wasnt quite so balloony aura looked at him distastefully i like him best when he is in the clouds she said firmly of course here she became slightly reflective i dare say his being soso erratic might put one out a good deal and people like you would be more satisfactory to deal with still here she dimpled all overcome let us race down the hill and then we can be waiting tea for him when he turns up but there was no tea ready when ned whose ill humour had passed with his solitary walk arrived thank heaven cried ted who met him at the door will you like a good fellow fetch the doctor he lives beyond the hill mr smith is ill as he was before you can take the motor cant you from dinas no need ramsay will be there ill be back in no time was the reply so while ted helped martha with his experience and comforted aura as best he could thereinafter remaining to give peter ramsay a hand in getting the old man to bed ned kicked his heels in the drawingroom sickness with its possibility of death always made him a little disdainful and he had but a few stereotyped words of regret when the crisis having passed the three came in aura looking pale and troubled was he as ill before she asked her eyes seeking teds almost reproachfully teds sought the doctors not quite replied the latter these attacksit is as well to be prepared for them miss grahamtend to become more serious he may not i hope he will not have another for a long time but you must try and avoid any excitement he held out his hand to say goodbye theres no reason to be alarmed i assure you with care he may not have another forfor months he clasped the girls hand with strong steady grip and smiled but poor aura facing the one great reality for the first time stood white and silent only when they had gone she turned to ted i dont know what i should have done without you she said gratefully outside as the motor disappeared in the darkness dr ramsay was saying nearly the same thing it is lucky cruttenden was there and had an idea of what to do lucky too that i didnt give you up and go home sorry responded ned shortly hope you had a good walk excellent replied peter ramsay with a little laugh i satisfied myself that hills and dales and the round world generally were mere manifestations of matter and the providence didnt shape my steps anyhow chapter xv since the night on which poor morris pugh had sought in vain for gods providence upon the mountaintop he had not left his room for rheumatic feverthat curse of waleshad laid hold of him the mental shock also militated against recovery it would be almost impossible to overestimate what that shock had been surcharged as he was by religious exaltation he had been dashed from high heaven to earth and at first he lay stunned absolutely maimed then as feeling returned to his numb mind the desire to slip away and so avoid the necessity for thought was the despair of his mother who had come from the lonely hillfarm where she still was mistress to be his devoted nurse she was a woman of the true saintly type full to the brim of sympathies and sentimentalities as such not one to be burdened with the reality of doubt by degrees however chaos became order the fiat let there be light went forth and morris pugh enthusiast by nature began to creep towards it what although the socalled miracles in which he and many others had believed were unreal that could not be said of the effects of the revival they were everywhere manifest abundantly real thousands hitherto spiritually blind were now with open eyes following the straight and narrow way oh there was proof enough to show what power was at work as the reverend hwfa williams had said he found such small jests no inconsiderable aid in his rough and ready missioning there was proof enough for every thomas in wales and there was more work to be done so what mattered it whether he morris pugh the man to do it rose or did not rise to the height of sublime folly which had been his once there was work to be done and he must do it so on the last day of the old year after a weeks change at aberystwith he returned eager for the big revival meeting which was to see the new year in it was to be a great occasion for merv gwen and alicia edwards were back for a christmas holiday from their arduous labour abroad their presence in the little village must surely awaken the few sleepers that remained these would be gathered in their names added to the already long list of the elect even myfanwy jones who as usual had come down for a long weekend laden with bandboxes might follow the example of her father and come into the ranks of the saved that would be great gain for though myfanwy being welltodo might dress as she pleased the influence of that dress was not benign on poorer girls and there were so many points besides drunkenness and open immorality which the undoubted increase of faith did not seem to touch david morgan had sold his mare at wrexham for fiveandtwenty pounds an open market truly and it was a goodlooking beast for all that it had the staggers then the hole in the hedge through which evan rees sheep were in the habit of pushing their way to graze on a watermeadow belonging to an absentee proprietor was still unmended there were in fact many things which to morris pughs sobered sight seemed ill advised while some such as the midnight meetings held by mere lads and lassies could not be defended all these things must be combated but on this eve of a new step towards eternity that quaint eternity which apparently has not yet begun for the religious the work must be to rouse every dead soul to life the chapel was packed from floor to ceiling taken simply as a sight it was marvellous to think of the sordid lives lived from year to year begun continued and ended in the cult of the ultimate sixpence by which alone the struggle for existence could be maintained that many of those present were leading here before the lord they were at least seeking a higher sanction and yet morris pughs whole heart and soul went out in one vivid prayer for true guidance gwen on the platform was looking dreadfully ill she was wasted to a skeleton her feverbright eyes seemed larger than ever but they were steadier and her voice was even sweeter despite the hollow hacking cough which assailed her at all times save when she was singing those same eyes of hers had learned the trick of fastening themselves on one face but so had the eyes of all these practised missioners and even abel parry who was taking hwfa williams part as bass looked out steadily earnestly myfanwy jones felt the thrill of this though she was conscious that much of her physical sense of strain arose from the presence of mervyn pugh how very handsome he was and what a gentleman he looked after his three months of touring about the country in truth he had changed he was finer more complex for it had been impossible to lead the old simple village life in the hotels and boardinghouses where he had lodged he was different in every way and in becoming different he had almost forgotten his past self even the mental emotion of his first association with gwen in this work of salvation had passed he took it now as a matter of course for the rest seeing his way clear and urged thereto by those who had heard him speak he had almost made up his mind to the ministry yet not quite so and the sight of myfanwy jones robed in black samite mystic wonderful in the very first row roused recollections almost regrets for there had been no harm in their holiday junketing at blackborough they had only enjoyed themselves immensely a sense of something electrical in the air disturbed him from recollections of a man in a music hall who had ventured to comment on his companions beauty and he became conscious that gwen and alicia edwards were both looking at him there was a whole world of difference in the meaning of these looks but mervyn lumped them together as a control to his wandering thoughts he need not have felt that sudden sense of guilt so far as poor gwen was concerned her limited mind had long since relegated the stormy past to the devil she shuddered at the thought of it as she shuddered at the thought of him but mervyn was a soul which mysteriously she had saved in a measure this was true all unknown to herself she was largely responsible for the outburst of spiritual energy around her there was that in her which given freely as she gave it without measure and without stint was bound to force response and tonight wearied utterly yet elated singing against the doctors orders racked by a terrible pain when she drew her breath she was at the floodtide of her potentiality and she knew it beside thisthe joy and rapture of the stigmaticalicia edwards jealousy of myfanwy was trivial indeed but though much that was trivial lingered in the minds of many in the chapel there was a deadly earnestness in most of the faces which looked up to the missioners almost as they might have looked at a veritable transfiguration of their lord the toilworn the smug the rugged the sensuous the clever on all these lay a supreme desire yet a supreme content briefly they had what they wanted yet they wanted something more what an analysis of the minds of most would no doubt have yielded a large percentage of purely personal sense of salvation but there was more than that in the whole atmosphere of the little chapel as morris pugh stood up to give his first address since his vigil upon the mountain what it was who can say call it the spirit of god call it anything you please all explanations resolve themselves into a still further away what is it now all those days and nights of mental and physical torture through which morris pugh had passed had left their unfailing mark on him before he could even creep back into the old straight way it had been necessary for him to acknowledge that he had been at fault in seeking to dictate to the greater wisdom in looking for a sign when no sign would be given it had been a bitter struggle for him to lay down these his highest hopes but he had laid them down and he stood before his people humbled patient almost wistful but they were not attuned to this mood so as he spoke the electricitythe somethingin the air failed and silence passed to faint shiftings to louder shufflings practised speaker as he was he realised at once that he was not as usual holding his audience with an almost convulsive inward prayer for guidance he modulated his voice into the bardic hwl that marvellous maker of emotion amongst the welsh a cough yes a distinct cough followed by another and another mervyn looked anxiously at his brother this would never do experience told him that the unknown force on which the professional missioner relies was oozing away so without more ado he gave the signal to gwen and straightway a hymn softly persuasively sung in the perfect harmony of four exquisite voices arrested the wavering attention of the crowded chapel emotionally musical to the nth degree the audience needed no more in an instant the atmosphere changed and as morris pugh resumed his seat the waves of sweet sound seemed to stun him with a sense of failure verse after verse those waves grew to almost tumultuous chorus seeming to monopolise with their vibration even the small amount of stifling air left to each pair of human lungs so through that human chorus halfdrowned by the glad summons to eternity came the passing of time as the church clock struck twelve the sound stilled the singing for a second and mervyn a genius in emotion seized on the propitious moment let us pray he cried falling on his knees let us pray for our brothers and sisters who are still in bondage without an instants hesitation the congregation of the elect followed suit leaving the few standing uncertain amongst them myfanwy jones her face showed a sudden fear not unmixed with resentment but mervyn had leapt from the platform and was beside her his face brilliant ere she could decide on either do not go he whispered passionately listen the door is openwe wait for you we want you myfanwy the girl turned to him a faint tremor showed in her full lithe figure her lip trembled another moment and she would have given way but that moment brought another factor to the equation of assent yes we want you myfanwy we wait for you it was a girls voice and myfanwy flashed round on it superbly selfpossessed thank you much alicia edwards she said in clear tones but there is no need for you to wait at all i am going and go she did with her head held high a sphinxlike calm of malice in her face the froufrou of her silken skirts heard above the sudden silence which fell upon the chapel it had needed but this example to make other hesitants follow the congregation taken aback looked for guidance and got it from gwen i will not let thee go she chanted in still clearer higher tones as she threw out her hands to those retreating souls yea i will not let thee go except thou bless me where thou goest i will go thy god shall be my god follow follow the cry was caught up readily as all her cries were when as now her nervous equilibrium was disturbed so on the heels of the retreating few the many swept out into the chill frostbound moonlit night the utter peace of it its cold indifference disturbed by no questionings struck like a knife to morris pughs heart as he followed also uncertain whether to accompany his flock on their midnight visitations or go home to pray in secret for the salvation of sinners he chose the latter and as he closed the door of his room the rousing chorus of a revival hymn echoed out under the stars of heaven making him think sadly how far away these were for all their brightness they seemed so also to aura who at that momentlooking as if she might have stood as illustration to keats st agnes evewas standing at her window in the moonlight four days had passed since her grandfathers sudden fainting fit and he was quite himself again he had even been able to see mr hirsch who had called in his motor and peter ramsay after delaying his departure a day or two had left there was nothing more to be feared for the present and for the future a peaceful unemotional life was all that was required so well in fact was he that ted had obeyed an urgent summons from mr hirsch and much against his will on this last night of the old year had gone over to him at aberafon it was a bore he felt and yet the last few days of closer companionship with aura of her natural inevitable reliance on him had made him leave her with a lighter heart you will be sure and come home tomorrow she had said and the word home had brought a great tenderness in his reply of course i shall be sure she felt glad of the assurance as she stood there looking out on the hillside where everything in the midnight moonlight seemed as if carven out of stone for her grandfather had been captious that evening absolutely refusing to give up his annual habit of sitting up to see the new year in and he had been annoyed at parkinson the parlourmaids failure to appear when as the clock struck twelve the personnel of the establishment were expected to wish and be wished long life and prosperity gone to a revival meeting he had echoed querulously a singularly inadequate excuse she might have read her bible at home but i will speak to her tomorrow to which martha had replied austerely it aint no good speaken sir ive spoke till im dumb and it aint her bible shes wantin but er best at for shes that frivolous at forty in the dry as beats me wot she must a bin in the green an bate ud a gone toooh yes yer wud bate so it aint no good speakinonly i told im plain bate says i you know as youre a deal too lightearted to go cadgin about with a orse and cart when theres liquor andy an that aint in it for temptation with a midnight meetin with the likes o her for company as makes me sick to cook for em an what is the shine in them hot stuffy revivals beats me i wouldnt go to one of em no not if i was anged for it id just say to the cart drive on the dramatic finale had made aura laugh she smiled at the remembrance of it now but then she smiled at the remembrance of many things in the last four days how kind the world had been to her a faint clatter in the back premises made her smile again martha must be waiting up till the light had gone from her room in order to play that ridiculous game with stockings on which ned had insisted on this new years day which was her birthday also oh how kind they had all been she could not spare one of them she blew out the light and the pulsing of the stars seemed to find an echo in the pulsing of her heart suddenly she leant out to stretch her warm young hands into the frosty air over the flower graves in the garden over the whole wide glistening world a happy new year to you all dear people she whispered such a happy new year five minutes after having smiled drowsily at the sound of marthas stealthy footsteps outside her door she was asleep to wake again however as the birds wake in winter long before the lingering dawn the moon was hanging like a silver shield before the window and sent a flood of light into the room but far away in the east on the edge of the hill there was just that faint paling of the sky which tells that when the sun rises it will rise there dawn or no dawn she was broad awake and the next instant stood by her open door there was the stocking crammed full as ned had threatened with chocolate creams and a pile of parcels on the floor she picked them up and putting them in the warm nest she had just left began to undo them by the light of the moon what had they given her these kind people a white chiffon motor veil that must be from mrs tressilian who had raised an outcry against a scarf of mechlin being used to such shallow purpose a silver ring tray set round with every conceivable coin of the realm she did not need the card slipped into the red morocco case to tell her this was from mr hirsch a bookher heart gave an answering throb to the starshinewas from ted he had promised her a shelley and this what was it it must be the semisurgical instrument for pruning roses of which dr ramsay had told her and that was all for neither martha nor her grandfather would give in to stockings yes it was all another halfashamed feel over the darkling floor of the passage assured her of this and she turned to the shelley even if ned had considered the chocolate creams sufficient she had this now she could read the context to the lines which nedyes it was nedhad quoted time like a manycoloured glass stains the white radiance of eternity it was lighter at the window she passed to it and leaning the heavy volume on the sill knelt down to search for the adonais but she turned no pages for there outside on the windowledge broadfaced clear openeyed an iris alata stared up at her from its carpet of saxifrage the most beautiful thing yes that was itand he had given it to her the poetry which another man had written slipped to the floor unheeded she was absorbed in what this man had brought her she knelt quite still for a time her hands slightly clasped feeling dazed at something in herself which respondedwhich gave backwhat what was the overmastering desire to crush the unconscious flower to death with her kisses she rose suddenly and began with haste to dress herself she must climb the mountaintops as she so often did in the dawn light and find some answer as she slipped silently through the house she paused once or twice wondering if she heard something no her grandfathers room was quite quiet but once in the hall the sound became indubitable some one was singing outside singing softly it is true but still singing the village children no doubt but they must be stoppedthey must not disturb her grandfather the next instant she stood looking with amazed anger at a group of five people who kneeling on the ground were singing under their breath some wild welsh hymn which rose and fell plaintively persistently one of these figures she recognised it was the parlourmaid parkinson this must therefore be the tailend of the revival meeting for she had heard that such visitations were not uncommon parkinson she called severely her young blood in arms at the intrusion what are you doing there get up at once and go into the house parkinson whose prim face was blurred with tears whose hat was awry whose whole appearance betokened a stormy night of emotion made a protest that this was an appointed time yes retorted aura with a swift stamp of her foot the appointed time for doing your work go and clean the silverit wants ityou foolish womango the foolish woman rose and sneaked away leaving aura to face the remaining enthusiasts who had combined the seeing of the new convert home with the singing of a hymn at this stronghold of the devil until he felt auras clear eyes upon him mervyn pugh had not remembered the possibility of recognition it may be indeed that he scarcely knew who the girl was whom he had once mistaken for gwen but now at her first glance he knew all too well so it is you she said slowly as he rose and feeling that his best chance lay in boldness faced her whywhy have you dared to come here to pleadto pray for you he began but was stopped by the fire the scorn of her you dare to pray for meyouyou coward yes i called it you once i call you it again coward and you too gwen she continued for warned by something in the youthful accusing voice mervyns fellow in the past had risen also and with large feverbright eyes was eagerly scanning their faces in the hope of understanding what her limited knowledge of english did not allow her to follow then suddenly the sight of the poor wasted body the recognition of the poor distraught soul overbore auras anger and she stretched out her hands passionately oh gwen gwen my dear she cried go home and forget all this go home and lay flowers on your dead childs grave and think of it and pray that he its father may be forgiven his cowardice a little startled cry came from alicia edwards abel parry sang on ignorant of english gwen looked at aura then at mervyn giving to each the same slow patient smile of forgetful forgiveness and then in that high piercingly sweet voice of hers she began in its welsh version the hymn which had heralded her spiritual mission just as i am without one plea save that thy blood was shed for me she paused arrested by a little soft cough then with a strange look in her wide wistful eyes she sank to her knees and stretched out her hands blindly mervemervefachmerve anwl y the rest was lost in the gurgle of the blood which poured from her mouth aura was beside her in a moment dont raise herher head on my knee socall marthayou mandont stand gapingand you woman unfasten her dressthat is better it seemed an interminable time though martha was already up and dressed ere aura saw her running from the back and all that time the stain on auras white dress grew larger and larger lord sakes muttered martha a blood vessel this comes of making free and she not fitparkinsonfor the parlourmaid had followedyou run for your turpentine without the beeswax theres a dearyou sit as you be miss haura and you there whats your name them icicles we must stop itif we can there was an ominous ring in the last words and it was not long ere auras face blanched almost as white as the one upon her lap as she realized that if the life blood was slacking it was because the tide of life itself was ebbing this was death she had never stood close to it before her young eyes looked fearfully through the hush of life to the unknown so the minutes sped alicia edwards gave a sigh of satisfaction for the bleeding had ceased but aura feeling the faint death tremor which reunites the vibration of life to the vibration of the starshine looked up her fear gone in grave wonder i think she said softly she is dead go you into the house my darlin an change that there poor dress ill manage now choked martha ever ready with her tears aura looked down with a faint shiver at the crimson stain so that was the end of love chapter xvi it was not more than six hours ago that aura had looked at neds iris had sat in the dawn with gwens head in her lap yet it seemed to the girl who had never seen death before who had never before realised what love meant as if whole aeons had passed over her head in truth they had for love and death make up life since birth comes to us without remembrance the morning had passed by in dizzy haste there had been much to do and do quickly so that her grandfather should not be disturbed by even knowing of the tragedy this was the more easy of compass seeing that since his last seizure he had not been coming downstairs till late so ere he appeared there had been time for folk to come and go time even for old adam to rake over the gravel disturbed by so many feet there was no trace in fact of what had happened when aura passed by the spot on her way to the hills parkinsons persistent hysterics had been the most troublesome factor in the problem of concealment but martha had at last losing patience locked her away in one of the cottage bedrooms and left her there with the callous remark shell come round by herself and if she dont oo cares who indeed did care about anything martha and adam went about their work as usual her grandfather knew nothing even ted was away aura felt terribly lonely for the first time in her life the more so because it seemed to her as if part of her very self had rebelled against that other self which for oneandtwenty years had lived such a frank clear life for all those years she had carried no burden but now love and death claimed to come with her she could not separate them even in her thoughts one seemed to her destruction of the body the other destruction of the mind so when leisure became hers at last she took up the thread of life where it had been broken by the intrusion into it of gwens death and started to climb the hills as she would have done at dawn it was her natural instinct always other girls might shut themselves up in their rooms to think might sit with their feet on the fender and dream she had to go out to feel the fresh breeze on her face before her mind would work at all as she sat on the rocky sheep shelter whither her feet had taken her almost unconsciously since it was her favourite outlook the winter sun beat down on her fiercely warming her through to the heart she could feel her very veins pulsing their rhythm seemed almost to sing in her ears how warm it was but in the shadows behind the big bouldersay and in the tiny shade of each blade of grass each twig of bracken the frost still lingered white for the air was freeezing sunshine and frost fire and ice that was exactly what she felt like herself she was half fire half ice for a fierce virginity of mind fought desperately against the intrusion of that glad new impulse of selfsurrender she had felt when she saw neds iris that she supposed was love but what was that sort of love worth if it brought death with it toto herselfto her mind she felt indescribably smirched and stained as she glanced at the fresh white serge skirt she was wearing she seemed to see on it still that crimson blood it was horrible it would be there always for her scarlet as sin no matter how white as wool it seemed to others poor gwen that was the end of it all she had no doubt yielded to love had she had any terror of it at first had she also felt the degradation of it so as she sat more dreaming than thinking a voice called her she started to her feet remembering in a flash that other mans voice which had called gwen in that very placethe man whom she had called cowardwhom she had smitten with the lily she held it was not an opportune moment for ned blackborough who having come over to cwmfaernog with congratulations had after hearing from martha of the tragedy followed the girl straight to her favourite outlook with the sort of instinctive knowledge of what she would do which he had always seemed to possess at the present moment this was in itself an offence to aura what right had he to pry into her mind what is wrong he asked checked in his quick sympathy by the expression on her face another offence since what right had he to know anything was wrong nothing she answered curtly only i came here for quiet and it seems as if i am not to have it he stared at her for a second then with a shrug of the shoulders turned to go thereby bringing to her a pang of remorse since when had he not been courteous not been kind his quick return therefore and the reckless obstinacy which showed on his face relieved her a cat may look at a king miss graham he said coolly i came to say i was sorry i am and as i fail to see that your birthday has any monopoly over new years day i will wish you many happy returns of the latter may your temper never grow worse she had to smile the sudden outburst of truth was so like ned when anything occurred to ruffle or disarrange the smooth covering of convention thank you she replied quite frankly feeling curiously at her ease i did not mean to be rude but i know he said simply and paused and she knew so well that he knew that though her lip quivered for a second she said no more there was no need to say more it was so curious to have him sitting there beside her now that he had come all the trouble had gone she was once more absolutely at her ease and thanks also for the iris she said after a pause feeling glad to escape from the tragedies of life it is jolly but i wish you hadnt dug the poor thing up i did not dig it up he replied coolly you didntthen how i wired to covent garden for another and it came down in charge of such a superior person that i almost had to ask him to dine so the most beautiful thing in the most beautiful place in the world remains beside the sphinx as he paused as what she asked he had come halfprepared to speak of his love and there was about her face today a curious halfforlorn puzzled look which made him feel inclined to take her in his arms and kiss it awayas a remembrance of you naturally he replied she sat down on the nearest stone feeling just a little dizzy and clasping her hands across her knees stared out at the pale blue misty valley and the pale blue winter sky beyond but why should you want something to remember me by she said slowly i shall always remember you without anything her freedom from conventional cloakings in speech was at all times a trifle disconcerting and he felt inclined to reply that is very kind of you or make some other banal remark of the sort which might bring convention back then he cursed himself for a low beast and followed her unconsciousness as closely as he could perhaps i wanted to remember the exact words you said he suggested but you do remember them she answered aggrievedly that is what i complain of you remember every little thing i sayand it is most uncomfortable i cannot think why you should he took his fate in his hand cant youi can it is because i happen to love you she sat still for a second then turned and looked at him with narrowing eyes i dont see what that has to do with it you knew what i was thinking about the very first time we met and you could not possibly have been in love with me then her seriousness made him laugh outright it was the most delicious piece of comedy to be sitting there talking of his love as if it did not belong to him while his pulsesstay were they bounding or had they quieted down to a curious content i am not so sure he replied gravely there is such a thing you are doubtless aware as love at first sight not for sensible people and i think we are sensible she argued grudgingly i know at any rate that i was not in love with you for a long time afterwards the whole world seemed to spin round with ned then you areoh my dear my dear please dont she cried hastily drawing back from his outstretched hands i hate being touched besides that has nothing to do with what i want to find out why from the very beginning did you always understand that can have nothing to do with love not at least with love like gwensthe last sentence came thoughtfully in a lower key but our love will be different dear he said almost solemnly if you will marry me aura i will try to understand to the very endso help me god she smiled at him brilliantly and you wouldyou couldnt help it but that is no reason why we should marry it seems to me we have mixed things up somehow no that is no reason at all perhaps not he admitted following her thought then marry me for some other reason my dear she shook her head there is only one reason for marriage she said with a wisdom born of the untrammelled teaching of nature and if i were to marry youi should be afraidyes ned i will tell you the truth because you are certain to understandi should be afraid of loving you too much ii dont want to love like that he sat bewildered his passion dying at the hands of truth then he muttered half to himself feeling with a rush of shame how far he was from her how little he really understood her innocence of evil heaven knows why you shouldi am a miserable beastbut oh i hope to god you would my deari hope to god you would why she asked calmly and he had no answer ready so he harked back after a while to a lower level that is the most original reason for refusing a man i ever heard he said whimsically have you any others of the same sort she responded instantly to his mood plenty she replied cheerfully to begin with you are far too rich i am only just beginning to realise how i should hate to have moneybesides it is wrong you know i dont know he said dryly but it is quite easy to divest oneself of money i never find the slightest difficulty in getting rid of itso dont let that stand in your way it was her turn to laugha soft little laugh with a hint of reproof in it i dont expect you do ted is always saying you are reckless then there is grandfather you know he doesnt like you half so much as he likes ted the deuce he doesnt assented ned his sudden pang of jealousy softened by his sense of the comic but you are surely not going to marry ted in order to please your grandfather she looked at him disapprovingly i might marry some one worse ted is a dear he felt exasperated yes he is an uncommonly good fellow butyou dont happen to love him and you doat least i think you dohe felt that certainty might overpower his selfcontrollove me she took no notice of this but went on argumentatively then i dont think i like marriage in your rank of life with a poor man and lots of work and trouble and children it would be very interesting butlook at lady smithbiggs i dont know what sir joseph is like of course but she looks as if she led a dull life very assented ned back to smiles once more but i wouldnt if i were you take lady smithbiggs as a test case there are plenty of marriages he paused feeling it would be difficult with auras standard to adduce many examples but then he was prepared to chuck everything and go forth with sandal shoon into the wilderness if need be yes she was right it was hardly marriage that he wanted after all so for a time they sat and looked out over the pale blue mists behind which the hills loomed large seeming to lose themselves in the pale blue sky there must be something better said the girl at last oh ned there is something better better than love he echoed perhaps than some loves not better than mine dont people always say that perhaps he said it to gwen child he said swiftly dont think of thatthat was not love and it was not marriage either she replied softly but what you mean has nothing to do with what is called love with what is called marriagethat is what i mean too he shook his head that is too fine for me aura i want you i am not satisfied without you he was so close to her that he could lay his hand on hers ssh she said swiftly laying her other hand on his so as to detain it listen just below them in a sheltered corrie grew a great hollytree covered with berries that glowed scarlet against the distant blue on its topmost twig with flaming breast yellowed by the exceeding brilliance of those bloodred berries a robin had settled itself to sing and it sang of what of the berries beneath its feet of its distant mate or out of the gladness of its heart of life because of the beginning it did not remember of the end it did not know who can say but it sang and as it sang those two sat hand in hand forgetful even of what humanity calls love forgetful of all things except that they also were dreaming the dream of life did i not say so she cried exultantly when the song had ceased did i not tell you there was something better you had forgotten me and i had forgotten you yet we were happy because we were handclasped he answered swiftly because i touched you and you touched me she drew her hands away and a flush came to her face but dont you feel afraidas i do dont you want to keep what you love apartto keep it safeeven from yourself did he not was it not only this which kept him back from taking her in his arms and kissing her to the knowledge of what a mans love must be yes he said unsteadily constrained to truth by hers but there is a love which does not stain ill give it youif i can she looked at him with a vain regret in her eyes you couldnt if we were married and i couldnt anyhow ah no ned it would spoil it all spoil what he asked roughly for he began to feel himself worsted for the time the something better she replied gaily let us wait for that i really dont want to marry you ned i should hate it i knew that when i saw your iris then i wish i hadnt climbed up to put it on your windowsill and wricked my bad arm into the bargain he said sullenly her face grew grave did you climb up that was very wrong was it he replied shrugging his shoulders but im afraid im a very wrong person altogether at the present moment i feel inclined totobut what is the useyou wouldnt understand aura for the last time will you marry me no ned i wont then that ends it he said recklessly so goodbye she paled a little must you go one of us must he replied caught in fresh hope unless you change your mind that is impossiblebut you will come back wont you he looked at her full of impatience yet full of tenderness i believe i ought to say that i wont but then he held out his hand i understandapart from everything else in the worldwhat this love of ours her hand trembled in his for a second means to usboth i will go away foryes for two months and give you time to think then i will come back goodbye my dear i can only say it once morei love you for an instant as he left her she stood still her lip quivering then she called to him come back please i want to give you this she held out the bunch of winter heliotrope which had been fastened in her coat its faint scent had been in the air as he had sat beside her holding her hand it was too much the passion he had held back not unwillingly for so long mastered him this is foolishness he cried striding towards her you do love mewhy can you not say soyou might at least tell the truth something in her face arrested him the truth she echoed i have told you the truth i think i do love you and i am sorry and vexed and angry her clear eyes were looking through his as if she could see into his innermost thought but i will not marry you i am afraid do you understand what that means to me i am afraid of myself and for you for you deserve something better suddenly she stooped kissed the withering flowers she held dropped them at his feet and was off like a mist wreath down the hill he did not attempt to follow her he simply sat down again on the stone where he had been sitting before and swore to god that sooner or later he would marry her and then he fell to thinking of how once or twice in his life before he had caught a glimpse as he had just now caught one of that something better beyond the dream of life once when he was a boy watching the trail of silvery bubbles left behind it in the brown stream by a waterrat as it swam once again as a young man when he had paid half a crown for a penny bunch of violets and something in their sweetness had made him add half a sovereign to their price and go on his way then the present reasserted itself he could not possibly take this for his answer he must wait till the shock of gwens death had faded until aura became accustomed to the idea of her own love for himfor that she did love him he had little doubt it was briefly her love which had frightened her quaint compound as she was of nature and culture he would leave her to think it out for two months during that time he also would have time to make up his mind concerning many things he was becoming dimly conscious that life was resolving itself into the spending of money in order to escape from the responsibilities of having money into the fighting of money by money it would be rather interesting to let the fight go on while he raised no finger to protect his own personal rights if indeed he had any which he was beginning to doubt he and aura would be as happynay happier without money yes in the one thing worth having the one thing without which even life itself was not worth having money had no purchasing power whatever i am only just beginning to realise how i should hate to be rich auras words came back to him she need not fear if she would only consent to marry him he would chuck everything he possessedbarring a modest competence of courseafter the sovereigns he had chucked that june morning into the little lochan at the gap he had never thought of the hidden money since that day it had gone clean out of his head now as he stood up to try and locate the exact dip on the hills where it lay his own words came back to him neither i nor the world would suffer if i made ducks and drakes of these sovereign remedies he seemed to hear the soft whit whitter of the skimming gold and to see the blank look on the faces around him there were other ways of getting rid of gold however than by chucking it into a pond you had in this civilised world but to let your neighbour know that you had it in your pocket and it was sure to go so despite his refusal with a light laugh he started down the hill chapter xvii aura however felt bruised and broken as with slower heavier foot than usual she crossed the drawbridge and choosing the back way went through the cottage to the kitchen her first look at that sanctuary of shiny saucepans showed her that something in the nature of a domestic cataclysm had occurred during her absence for the kitchentable was littered with caketins and the materials for making cakes a savoury smell telling of cakes rose from the oven and martha herself with a hot flushed face was beating viciously at the whites of eggs which were to go towards a further making of cakes now such activity was marthas invariable method of showing that she had what she called a bit o time to herself therefore her invariable habit when she found herself once more monarch of all she surveyed and so presumably rather pressed for time has parkinson gone asked aura swiftly yes miss haura replied martha pausing to make a dive into the oven and come up therefrom still more flushed and still more determined shes gone bad barm wont never bake ouseholds as my mother used to say and glad was i to be rid of her for i shud a put her past afore long yes i shud and a got ung for it i spposeit aint any good lookin shocked miss haura for a

more flour to him as if he was a silly batch o bread but well do all right without er caps an aprons and so i told bate marthas face indeed wore a determination which augured well for domestic comfort but grandfather began aura anxiously he ought not to be disturbed whos a disturbing of the good gentleman snapped martha pore dear ell have is shavin water ot in future how they can stand brazen an ask wages beats me an she talkin o the waste o water being a crime against the companya water company winter time in wales lord sakesif she run the cold off as i bid her do though er pantry tap was

and if she screech there as she screeched here some one ll be in bedlam before morninan so i told bate this was the invariable epilogue to all marthas diatribes i suppose mr cruttenden has returned asked aura as nice as nuts an is in with master i reely dont know now i come to think on it what we shud adone this last week without im not but what is lordship she shot a quick glance at auralord sakes deary she cried you do look wearylike go up to your bed theres a duck an have a lie downone cant never forget the face o death till ones asleep death and his brother sleep the words were in auras brain as she went upstairs wondering why it was that now ned was no longer beside her she felt far more disturbed far more in a way ashamed about him than she had done when he was beside her yes even when he had been masterful and told her that it was all foolishness that she knew she loved him the house seemed so familiarly quiet and peaceful that the turmoil of her mind became all unreal to her surely the least honest effort must suffice to bring back her old fearlessness of outlook her birthday presents lay on the table amongst them teds shelley open curiously enough at the adonais her eye glanced at the verses became fascinated she stood reading until with a sigh of infinite satisfaction she closed the book over those words the one remains the many change and pass that was beautiful that calmed the soul gwens dead face came back to her now without any terror in it the sting of death was gone but lovethe love that gwen had felt of which she herself was not all unconscious what of that dimly darkly as in a glass the girl saw that to be noble it must be the antithesis of deathit must be birth but that was not the love of the world what had mervyn what had gwen thought of birth nothing if anything they had hoped to evade it they had tried to take the pleasure without incurring the pain they had not thought of anything but themselves she passed on to the windowsill and looked down once more on the most beautiful thing in the most beautiful place in the world but what was that really was it love standing between birth and death or was it something better something beyond both something of which but a glimpse could be caught during that journey between the cradle and the grave so for one brief moment as she stood looking at the iris she saw that something beyond birth beyond death beyond even love a shimmer came to the air her pulses caught the rhythm and lo she was no more the one was all and from the uttermost end of space came back the ceaseless wave of unity and then then the fear of death reasserted itself surely the flags of the iris showed limp the dear thing must not stop there without due foothold on the round world else would it lose the immortality of new birth so tired as she was she lifted it up saxifrage and all in both her hands went downstairs and so across the lawn to a place she wotted of where it might grow undisturbed by fear of old adams meddling fork there was a certain solemnity about her necessarily slow movements and she felt almost as if she were conducting a funeral and so in truth it was a funeral of her careless girlhood she was a woman now she had begun to understand herself yet as she laid the flower on the spot where she intended to plant it and went for her trowel the pity of the funeral hit her hard and when she returned neds blue eyes seemed to look at her appealingly from the iriss broad face his were such beautiful eyes she dug furiously forgetful of everything but her desire to bury until a step sounded beside her and she looked up to see another pair of blue eyes broader bolder looking down at her what are you digging said ted with a ring of aggrievedness in his voice a grave oh i beg your pardon dear i oughtnt to have said that i oughtnt to have reminded youbut ive been expecting you to return for such a long whileandoh my poor little girlim so sorry for it allit must have been horrible his normal sympathy brought her back to normal she realised as she had not realised with ned that after all she was but a mere girl who needed cossetting and comforting after the terrible shock of the morning it was horrible she replied with a little shiver you cant think how horriblesomehow after it all it is good to see you justjust yourself she felt indeed grateful to him for his size his solidity his undoubted affection perhaps unconsciously she was grateful to him for his failure to disturb her inmost soul it must have been awful he said his blue eyes showing all the kindness in the world i cant think how you got through with it as you have but you are so bravefar braver than i should bebut come dont let us talk or think of it any more dont let us spoil my last afternoon she stood up startled your last she cried in quick concern oh ted why is it your last he took a step nearer to her his face lit up with content im so glad you carei suppose its selfishbut i am glad yes i have to go hirsch has business for me in parismost important business and i must leave by the mail tonight even as he spoke his mind running on ahead thought with a different content of what this visit to paris might mean to them both if things turned out as he hoped they might must you she echoed wistfully it seemed to her as if every friend she had had was leaving and ted had been such a help to her during the last few anxious days how shall we manage without you she went on doubtfully grandfather will miss you so muchand i there were almost tears in her voice and ted felt a wild desire then and there to come to explanations but he knew it was wiser to wait i will come back at once if i am wanted he replied but i hope i shant be wantedat least not in any hurry for of course i shall come back again soonand thenbut i really havent time now i have to put up my things you see i stayed as long as i could with him thinking you would be sure to come in at once there was the faintest reproach in his tone an instant pang of remorse shot through the girl she had stopped talking sentimental rubbish to ned while hetedwas doing her duty i will go in to him in a moment she said hurriedly i have only to plant this flower she set to work hurriedly ted lingering to look down superciliously at the iris its rather pretty he said did you find it in the woods auras blush was hidden as she hastily filled in to proper dimensions the perfect grave she had previously dug no ned gave it me asas a new years gift ted half smiled thinking that if he had had as much money as lord blackborough he would have known better how to spend it on the girl he loved but of course if ned chose to be so niggardly in some things so lavish in others it was his own lookout i hope you liked the book the binding wasnt quite so nice as i should have wished he began aura interrupted him heartily i liked it ever so muchthanks so many and i shall always like it that is the best of bookssummer and winter they are always the sameshe became taken with her own thought and pursued itthey arent like flowersyou havent to watch for their blooming timeyou havent even to smell their scentyou havent to think for them of storms or slugs or frost and field micehere she smiled at her own alliterationsbut if you want them there they are ready to make you happy do you know youve been a regular book to me lately ted he flushed up with pleasure have i he said frankly thats good hearing ii wish i were your whole library once more he paused obsessed by that idea of the nightmail to paris as he went off to pack his things he almost wished that she had come in a little earlier but then he would not have had such an eminently satisfactory talk with her grandfather so far as he at any rate was concerned it was all plain sailing for the old man distressed at hearing of teds sudden departure had for the first time taken him into his confidence it was not exactly a pleasing confidence but it was only what ted had expected aura would be penniless since years before sylvanus smith had sunk all his money in an annuity which would cease with his death under the circumstances ted had felt that both the kindest and the wisest thing was to allay anxietythat tardy anxiety which was in itself but another form of selfishnessby speaking of his own love for aura and his earnest desire to marry her if she would have him of course she will marry you mr sylvanus smith had said with calm shrewdness who else is there for her to marry whereupon ted divided as to whether he was doing a magnanimous or a mean thing had suggested lord blackborough it had produced a perfect storm of incredulous irritation the bare idea was absurd blackborough like all in his rank was merely amused by a pretty face he sylvanus smith had only tolerated him as teds friend and he would forbid him the house in future no granddaughter of his should marry a lord briefly the old man whose life had been spent in preaching socialism and liberty in the abstract who denied the existence of social rank and proclaimed the right of the individual to independent action was ready to forswear both tenets and pose as a relentless parent of the good old type ted had forborne to smile and feeling really magnanimous this time had attempted to smooth over the old mans irritation which none the less he knew to be points in his favour so as he packed his portmanteau he whistled lightheartedly aura meanwhile having finished her burial went off to the bookroom where she found her grandfather as usual busy with pen and paper the writingtable drawn up to the fire the solitary extra chair in which ted had been sitting looking lone and outcast camped away in the open beyond the leather screen which in winter always surrounded mr smiths socialism and the fire he was looking a little flushed and she paused ere sitting down on the floor by the hearth to say anxiously you havent been vexing yourself i hope grandfather while i was awayii had rather a headacheso i went up the hills martha martha has been excellent as usual he replied on the whole she does parkinsons work fairly well though i could wish here he sighedthe absence of a suitable cap and apron is certainly to be deplored but she makes an excellent omelette he turned again to his work of writing a pamphlet on the simple life aura sat watching him as she had watched him as long as she could remember she was very fond very proud of him extremely well read curiously quick in mind he had taught her everything she knew and she was but just beginning to find out that this everything was more than most women are supposed to know she had found no difficulty in holding her own with ned and ted and dr ramsay and mr hirsch except so far as mere knowledge of the world went and that was not worth counting to her mind grandfather had had the best of any argument she had ever heard but then ned would never argue with him still he had not taught her all things he had never mentioned love or marriage or birth or death though these surely were the chief factors in lifein a womans life anyhow suddenly out of the almost bewildering ramifications of her thought she put almost thoughtlessly a question grandfather was my father fond of me mr sylvanus smith looked up startled and distinctly pale i had not the honour of your fathers acquaintance he said icily therefore i cannot say then he as it were pulled himself together and you will oblige me he continued by not asking any more questions of the sort i cannot answer them he went on writing but his hand trembled a little she had heard this formula more than once but after a time moved thereto by the new stress in her thoughts the girl rose and going up behind him stood looking over his shoulder grandfather she said i am not going to ask any more questions about the past i dont see that it matters at all i should like to have known that my father waswas glad of me my mother must have been i think though she died so soon but i should like to know what is in the future whatwhat do you expect me to do do you wish me to marry he turned round in his chair and looked at her helplessly that is rather a peculiar question my dear he said feebly but of course dont answer it if it worries you please she urged quickly but if you could speak of itit would be a great help vaguely she felt choky over the last words it did seem so hard to be left all alone in the wide world to face these dark problems itit is not a usual subject for discussion even between parent and child aura he replied but if you ask meyes i am extremely anxious for you to marry why the question came swiftly mr sylvanus smith put down his pen finally and turned his feet to the fire he thought for a moment of quite a variety of reasons because it was the natural end of woman but for years past he had laboured in vain to convince the world that marriage was slavery because he wished her to be happy but so many marriages were unhappy because he would have liked to see grandchildren about him but in his innermost heart he knew that a few months of life was all for which he had any right to look he decided finally on the real reason becausebecause when i die my child and that cannot be far off grandfather dont her voice became poignant with fond reproof he heaved a sigh and honestly felt himself heroic my dear he said grandly there is no use in deceiving ourselvesi may livebut on the other hand he waved his pretty white hand gracefully the conversation was beginning to interest him and though he had acquiesced in ted cruttendens desire to let the question stand over for the present he felt there could be no harm in diagnosing auras attitude the fact is my dear that when i die you will be very badly off in fact it is a source of the very greatest anxiety to me aura you will have nothingi mean no moneyand unless you are marriedhappily marriedi do not see how you can earn your own livelihood then i should earn it by being married she asked well hardly so butit would be a great weight off my mind aura soif you have the chance she stood still for a moment or two then once more seating herself on the floor this time at his feet she turned her face to the fire i have the chance she said at last in a clear voice lord blackborough asked me to marry him today i refusedbut her face was still hidden but a curious expectancy came to her whole attitude she seemed on the alert sylvanus smith who had sat up prepared to curse sank back in his chair to bless with a sigh of relief you refused him thank god my dear child youyou caused me the most painful alarm though i might have trusted your good sense to see that it would have beenaa most unsuitable marriage the alertness had gone would it she said indifferently yes i suppose it would she said no more though all unconsciously the iron was entering her heart the young glad animal heart which clamoured for pleasure still what her grandfather had called her good sense had shown her this unsuitability at once though his grounds for his opinion were most likely very different from hers at the same time it was her decision she had made it of her own free will there was no coercion about it she had made it and it was as well that others endorsed her action so she essayed a smile and turned towards him then i dont think i have any other chance of getting married just at present grandfather she said lightly but if anybody comes along she paused joking on the subject being a trifle beyond her the old man sat looking at her with real affection overlaid by the quaint sense of magnanimity which pursued him in every relation of life the result no doubt of his unquestioning acceptance of himself as philanthropic benefactor to the race should he or should he not tell her what he had just heard from ted something in the slackness of her attitude as she sat crouched by the fire something of weariness in the young face which as a rule was so buoyant with the joie de vivre made him decide on telling her there could be no harm in finding out how she was prepared to receive the suggestion he drew his chair closer but there you are mistaken surely has it never occurred to you thatthat perhapsmr cruttenden ted echoed aura no grandfather it is you who are mistaken ted and i have always been the best of friendsthe very best of friends but he has neveroh i can assure you he has never been the least never the least like nedi mean lord blackborough perhaps that stands to his credit remarked the old man chillily love is not shownbyby lovemaking but i am sure of what i say my dear becauseted as you call himthough in my young daysbut we will let that pass for the presenttold me himself that the dearest wish of his heart at this moment the door opened and ted himself lighthearted free eager to have what he could of auras company came in ive finished he cried so now for something better he paused conscious that the air was full of something more important at any rate was it better or was it worse mr sylvanus smith essayed a discreet innocence by a warning cough to aura and a hasty return to his papers but the girl was too much in earnest for silence her nerves overstrung by the strain of the long day during which almost everything to be learnt in life seemed to have been crowded into a few hours vibrated to this new possibility she rose instantly and advancing a step or two stood facing the young man with a new recklessness in her expression ted she said and there was a note of appeal in her voice grandfather has been telling me something i cant believe is it true that you also want to marry me for an instant surprised out of balance overwhelmed by the utter unconventionality of the question the young man hesitated yes or no seemed to him equally out of keeping then his passion for her came to the rescue and something told him that the question would never have been asked if the girl had not staked herself body and soul on the answer he strode across the room and took her by her outstretched hands i have wanted it aura he said and his voice vibrated as the whole world seemed to him to be vibrating ever since i saw you firstdo you remember he was drawing her closer to him unresisting though in her eyes there was a certain expectant dread you were standingsurely you remember his voice grew softerin the garden roomstanding in the sunlight with the flowers behind youand the cockatoo the sentence ended in the first kiss which had ever fallen on auras lips she did not shrink on the contrary she gave a little sigh of satisfaction and looked gratefully at ted yes i remember she said softly and ever since then you have been so good to me then you will marry me aura he saidyou will really marry me if it makes you happyif you really mean it and she turned to her grandfatherdoes it make you happy too he was busy with his pocket handkerchief and blew his nose ere he replied my happiness is assured ifif you he said no more for his memory was clear and there are some things which do not grow dim with years and one of them is the remembrance of love i am quite happy she said gravely and i think i shall always be happy with ted whereupon ted kissed her again and tried to realise that he was in the seventh heaven of delight as he was indeed though he felt rather rushed as he thought of the night mail to paris we have hardly time to get engaged decently and in order he said joyfully you will have to wait for your ring my darling my ring she echoed inquiringly whereupon ted laughed still more joyfully at her entrancing ignorance of the world and its ways but sylvanus smith who had been looking into the fire roused himself to touch a ring which he always wore on his little finger i have one here he said dreamily it holds her mothers hair my mothers cried aura gladly oh may i have it grandfather ted looked with distaste at the little mourning ring just a plait of bronze brown hair like auras set in a plain gold rim as a background to in memoriam in black enamel letters it is rather grisly he whispered fondly as he slipped it on to the girls finger but it will do toto keep the place warm by and by it shall be diamonds she shook her head i shall like this best she said it will remind me of and then she lifted her finger to her lips and kissed the little ring it would be hers always to remind her of love and death and birth that came between the two chapter xviii poor gwens death had caused quite a pleasurable excitement in the village there can be no question that to all save the immediate few whose natural emotions are involved most deaths bring a quicker tide of life to the living it has been said indeed that funerals are often the preludes to marriage be that as it may gwen despite her gift of grace had lived all her short life on such a different plane from the rest of the village girls that except in the little shepherds cottage amid the hills few real tears were shed over her dramatic death and it was so dramatic to die in full songto shed her lifeblood in trying to bring the glad news to other souls surely that must avail surely that sacrifice must turn those sinful souls to peace though they did not know it and for mr sylvanus smiths prospect of peace it was as well he did not both aura and her grandfather were special objects of intercession at many hundreds of chapels the very next sunday for the story naturally grew in the telling meanwhile gwen poor soul was laid with much fervour beside her baby the rector duly officiating for the old shepherd and his wife thinking of their own funerals to come held fast to tradition whatever else you might be in life death brought you back to the church back to the solemn old service in which dust is reverently committed to dust ashes to ashes nearly all the village attended for in a way it was proud of gwen there was but one notable absence alicia edwards was not there to take her part in singing day of wrath over her dead friend she was in bed or at any rate confined to her room for the dramatic death on new years morning had apparently been too much for her nerves the gossips of the village went in and out condoling with her and applauding her sensibility and retailing to her all the affecting particulars of the funeral the wreaths the remembrances from souls saved by the dead girls singing the excellence of the mournings provided by myfanwy jones and the apparently real grief of mervyn pugh who went about looking like a lost soul himself only over the latter statement did alicia edwards commit herself so far as to say with sphinxlike gravity i do not wonder mervyn and gwen were always friends yes indeed even at school they were friends looking back from her new knowledge concerning gwens past alicias only wonder was indeed that no one had ever suspected mervyn and yet who could suspect mervyn mervyn the pattern of the village mervyn among whose perfections her own facile heart had been entangled these many years past nor was she alone half the village girls would have given their eyes to secure him for their own and now that he had fallen from his high pedestal it seemed to her womanlike that she desired him more than ever that desire in truth was the cause of her seclusion she was not illsimply she could not make up her mind what to do onehalf of her asserted that she ought to denounce mervyn that it was wrong for her to allow him thus to play the hypocrite that it would be good for his souls health to do penance in sackcloth and ashes the other half found excuses for him beneath the cloak of consideration for the slur which would be cast by the unrighteous over the whole revival could it be shown that one of the most prominent in starting it wasso to speakan unrepentant castaway for repentance in such a case as this meant the confession for which the elders of the congregation had clamoured the lack of which had sent an unbaptized child to the happily infinite mercyseat of god alicia knew all this she had been well brought up well drilled by her father in the catechisms and in her inmost soula very conventional placid harmless soulshe was quite shocked at mervyns stonyheartedness for all that she could not make up her mind to denounce him she would give him time he knew that she knew his secret and that she was the only person in the world now who knew itat least of this world for the wild girl of cwmfairnog as the village had dubbed aura had not even attended the inquest martha had given her evidence and martha had known nothing so there was no likelihood of the truth coming out except through her alicia perhaps mervyn knowing this would come to her and unburden his soul undoubtedly if providence had not intended her to denounce the sinnerand of this as the days went on she became more and more certainit must have had some other purpose in making her the sole recipient of the terrible knowledge what purpose for to her as to morris pugh as to nearly all these traffickers in cheap marvels the impulse to see some hidden meaning some direct dealing of the creator with his creature man had become almost an obsession what purpose then could providence have had in thus choosing alicia edwards out of all the village to be this sole recipient the answer was easy that mervyn might come to her as a sort of mediator as he might have come to a father confessor so as the time wore on alicia waited for mervyn but mervyn never appeared not even after she came down becomingly dressed in deep mourning to sit in the back parlour and receive her friends myfanwy jones whose holiday had been extended over the funeral by reason of the many orders she had successfully placed for it looked in several times but there was not much love lost between the two nowadays so when on the morning after the funeral myfanwy came to say goodbye alicia was relieved she felt the influence of this big beautiful worldly creature to be malign and once it was removed she was sure that mervyn would surely return to the holder of his secret you will be going by the midday carrier said alicia cheerfully you will have a fine drive to llanilo whatever a beautiful drive assented myfanwy i was trying to make mervyn pugh take it with me for a change but he prefers to mope i did not know him such a friend of poor dead gwen she challenged alicia with her bold black eyes and alicia felt herself flush when people spend their lives together in holy work myfanwy dear she replied in a purring voice it is very close they grow to each other very close indeed if they spend their lives together anyway retorted myfanwy with a superior laugh they often grow very closevery close indeedsometimes too close but alicia was prepared for her and smiled sweetly you do not understand religion myfanwy as mervyn says it is such a pitybut we must hope for the bestit will come some day so will christmas replied myfanwy with a sphinxlike smile but i am not fond of waiting whatever you may be well goodbye dear do not be frightened when williams and edwards send in their billit need not be paid till you are married remember alicia paled the memory of that bill was more to her now than the mere fact that when it came it would mean a demand for money that she might manage but how about the claim on her character for it would be a big bill a record of much extravagance one comfort was that if she married mervynwhich seemed not so unlikely now as it had seemed a short time agohe would not be so terribly shocked or at any rate he would not be in a position to throw so many stones it was a lovely afternoon one of those early january days when earth and sea and sky combine to play a trick on the world and cheat it into the belief that winter is over the air too felt lighter more wholesome to alicia now that myfanwy jones had presumably left the village presumably because though alicia had not actually seen her go her boxes had certainly been in the carriers cart alicia had almost made up her mind that if the mountain would not come to mahomet mahomet must go to the mountain another sunday must not pass without an explanation between her and mervyn it would not be right to allow him to remain without reproof and exhortation it required a good deal of courage for she was by nature timid but by making a duty of it and assuring herself that his souls good was her only object she succeeded in bracing herself up to sufficient virtue for her task so feeling there was no time like the present she spent half an hour in making herself look as attractive as she could in her singing dressand that had been designed with considerable care for appearancesand set off on her mission she did not go straight to the ministers house which stood at the further end of the villagea most incongruous unhappylooking villa such as one sees by dozens in the suburbs of any large town all stucco bow windows and gable endsfor that might have provoked attention she branched off to the left and so going up the school road was prepared to make her visit on the return journey by going down a pathway which led from the school towards the house she had often returned from class thus with mervyn choosing the longer road for the sake of the handsome boys company the thought made her mind drift back to those long years during which she had been taught and had taught so many things what a relief it had been to escape from living by rule so much time for this so much time for that duty punctual as the clock dependent on the machinery certain to run down and stop unless it received some continual impetus from without that which cometh from without the words came back to her vaguely yes she had been taught so many things what had she herself learnt how many four shillings worth of stamps for instance had she not saved up herself or caused her pupils to save up every child in the village had a postoffice savings bank book they had been taught thrift but every one of the girls would do as she had donerun into debt over their clothesor at least put their money on their backs she was tired of it all she was hungering for her natural work she wanted to be the wife of some strong man bear him children and live immersed in household details that was her metier she felt drawn to that so as she turned in at the back entrance of the ministers house her heart was soft she felt in a sentimental mood the past was past most mens lives held something that was not quitewell quite respectablebut in this case there would be earnest repentance to make that past moremore presentable and then through the window of the diningroom she saw a group of two people standing their faces to the fire their backs towards her but there could be no doubt as to the skintight black sheen of the waist round which mervyns arm circled in all the security of possession it was myfanwysmyfanwy in her best dress also in a second all the hot cymric blood which lay hidden somewhere behind alicias almost phlegmatic calm had leapt up in resentment and almost before she realised what she was doing she had passed the entrance and stood in the room challenging those two the table was laid for tea there was an air of placid comfort of as it were collusion which gave the finishingtouch to her anger so you have not gone with the carrier myfanwy jones she said mervyns arm left the blacksatin waist hastily but myfanwy did not budge she simply threw a backward glance over her shoulder oh good afternoon alicia no i did not go mervyn and i are to drive over to llanilo in thomass waggonette as soon as we have had our tea in an instant it resolved itself into a duel between these two women for the possession of the man who stood his beauty somewhat blurred by anxiety looking like a fool between them but i have come replied alicia firmly to have a talk with mervyn aboutabout something so perhaps you will drive alone to llanilo myfanwy it might be better she fixed mervyn with an eye that held in it a world of entreaty besides some indignation his inward uneasiness felt the threat perhaps it would be better myfanwy he said helplessly we have much to talk over and arrange before we start again onon our work myfanwy turned on him like a flash will you hold your tongue mervyn pugh she said magnificently this is between alicia edwards and me then she turned back again to her adversary say what you will to him now alicia we are engaged to be married so you can say to me what you will say to him alicia gave a little cry of real dismay oh mervyn say it is not truethink of poor silly gwen but just dead she pulled herself up being in truth still but halfhearted in her desire to denounce myfanwy shot a swift glance at mervyn she was really and honestly fond of him and the idea at any rate which alicias words suggested was not new to her still no matter what she said to him about it in the future this was the time for defencequick ready defence yes she said gwen is dead so why should you drag her out of the grave poor soul let the dead past bury its dead alicia you learnt that in school i am sure and whatever happens i am going to marry mervynof that you may be sure it was then that alicia feeling the inward certainty that this was true that her bolt had failed of its mark gave the rein to denunciation but i must speak to him oh mervyn think she cried her voice ringing with a perfect medley of emotion you who have saved so many think of your own soul think how the soul of your child think how the soul of poor gwen cry out against you a mans step on the gravel outside made myfanwy start forward with a muffled exclamation be quiet will you you will be overheardyouyou will ruin him will you hold your tongue she cried but alicia was past worldly wisdom even with myfanwys strong hand threatening her she stood her ground and her voice rose let them hear let all the world know that mervyn pughmervyn the good the righteous is gwens seducer the father of her child then even her anger failed before the knowledge that morris pugh stood at the door listening with a muffled cry mervyn turned and flung himself down on the sofa his face crushed into the hard horsehair cushions vaguely he felt their hardness to be a shelter myfanwy looking as if she could have killed alicia moved to him and laid her hand softly protectingly on his shoulder do not fret mervyn she said coldly it will soon be over so for a space there was silence then morris pugh braced himself to the task which was his as pastor of these wandering sheep as you stand before your maker alicia edwards he said bringing his hand down on the table to grip it with clenched nervous force is this accusation true her answer was a sudden burst of tears dontdont ask me she sobbed is it true his voice insistent almost cold in its very insistence would take no denial yes the assent could scarcely be heard for the sobs morris pugh gave a sigh it was almost as if all that was human in him left his body with that long laboured breath for an instant afterwards he was the accuser the judge and youmervyn pughgod forgive you for bearing my fathers honoured namehave done this wrong without repentance you have stood by your childs grave and said never a wordnever a word even to me your spiritual guide although i asked you remember that i asked you and you have stood before the lord all these long months eating at his table drinking of his blood with this sin lying unconfessed in your heart and you and the partner of your sin have stood together before the great white throne your voices mingling in gods praise while your bodies mervyn started to his feet morris morris before heaven that is not trueno i am not so bad as that checked in the full flow of his superhuman blame the minister paused and something of the man came back to him i will say nothing of myself he went on ofof the shame but have you any excuse can you show just cause why i should not deal with you alasa thousand times alasmy brotheras a minister of god must deal with the unrepentant sinner with the hypocrite with the man who has defiled the innermost sanctuary of gods temple there was silence only round myfanwys full lips showed a certain impatience a weariness for this necessary fuss to subside and leave room for common sense so you have no excuse then prepare for the condemnation of the congregation prepare to be humbled to the dust before the lord myfanwy shifted impatiently what good will that do it will only humble the congregation came her clear full voice it will only be a paragraph in the papers morris pugh winced i thought of that before he muttered god forgive me i thought of it beforetoo much perhaps no he added firmly the shame must be faced yes mervyn it must be faced even if our mother and then with a cry morris pugh himself was on his knees by the table his hands clutching at its rim his head between them sinking to the very dust oh god forgive him oh god for my sake for her sake forgive himfor the sake of her many prayers and tears forgive him mervyn stood pale as death alicia her little part long since played sobbed softly in a corner only myfanwy looked at them all three almost with distaste mervyn is very sorry i am sure of thatit could not have been worth all thisthis fuss she said hardly but why should shame be faced whenwhen every one is dead and buried mervyn can go away the living and the dead are one woman in the sight of the lord replied morris his righteous wrath rearoused by her words mervyn may go if he likes but i his brother will denounce him before the congregation his lips his hands were trembling but his voice was firm mervyn sat down on the sofa again and covered his handsome face with his hands his mind was in a whirl its chief thought being abject remorse for his brothers sakefor his mothers it is best so myfanwy he muttered hoarsely goitit is all i can do forfor them now she took up her cloak and hat without a word there was no use in trying to persuade people when they were so exalted yes i will go she said but you are very silly mervyn come alicia you have done enough mischief for one day i am sure alicia followed her meekly feeling not in the least ashamed of the role she had played for these violent emotions were to her part of the religious stockintrade by and by they would quiet down mervyn would make a noble confession and eventually he would rise superior to all these troubles above all rise superior to myfanwy the girls did not say one word to each other as they went back to the village together any one meeting them might have judged them the best of friends only as myfanwy branched off to the smiths cottage she paused a moment to say with a smile some day i will pay you out for this alicia edwardsso mark my words you will pay may you be forgiven myfanwy jones retorted alicia with spirit i have but done my duty left alone by themselves the brothers reverted of necessity to more humble more homely relations the righteous wrath gave place to real grief the blank hopeless remorse to real regret by the time that the housekeeper came in to clear away the almost untouched tea they had both accepted the position in so far as it could be accepted there was nothing for it but to face this public confession and by so doing make what reparation could be thus tardily made mervyn indeed was by far the more cheerful when the time came to say goodnight he had barely had time to think the relief of having touched bottom as it were was great he felt in fact as a repentant criminal might do on his last night on earth as if the morrow which was to bring expiation must also bring pardon and peace they had spent the evening together on the highest possible plane of religious exaltation and it was mervyn who gripped his brothers hand and said courage out of the fulness of his emotion his face looked almost saintly as he said it an hour later indeed when morriswho had lingered near the dying fire beset now he was alone by almost unbearable grieflooked in to see if his brother were asleep he found him lying like a child smiling in his dreams morris gave a faint sob and mervyn stirred in his sleep mother he said hurriedly softlymother dear dear motheri must instinctively morris blew out the light he held lest it might wake the dreamer from his dream so in the moonlight he stood torn asunder by love and grief watching the dim peaceful form upon the bed suddenly he turned and closing the door silently behind him went downstairs once more outside the narrow walls of the house the moonlight slumbered peacefully upon the everlasting hills surely somewhere beyond the narrow walls of this worlds judgment slept eternal peace an instant afterwards the front door closed softly and morris pugh leaving his brother asleep had gone to find wisdom where he had often sought it of late in the temple not made with hands it must have been an hour later that mervyn woke roused by a pebble at his window he sat up with blurred consciousness wondering vaguely what it was until another pebble struck the pane and a voice cried in a soft whisper mervyn myfanwy by all that was strange then in a second the whole memory of what had happened came back to him but it came back to find him as it were a giant refreshed with sleep none of us are really the same for two consecutive hours and many a man will brave that in the morning from which he would shrink at night and there as he peered through the curtain was myfanwy sure enough beckoning to him to come down a sight sufficient to bring combativeness to any young blood even without those two hours of blessed rest in sleep mervyn she said when five minutes after their lips met in a long kiss i have come for you see how i love you to do this thing which might ruin any poor girls reputation you have done wrong my poor boy very wrong but so have many of the others who are so saintly and why should you stay to be prayed over by themby alicia edwards too i will not have it there will be no more me if you stop mervyn come now with me to blackborough the waggonette is waiting up the road at the bridge we can catch the three oclock mail at llanilo if you come mervyn i will marry you in three days at the registrars office but he gasped halfdrunk with her kisses halfstunned by his remembrances she stamped her foot you must decide i cannot stop here all night some one may come oh mervyn mervyn do you not feel that you were not made for this narrow life youyou are no worse than others and you have brains you can make money if you will in the world but not here those two hours of blessed sleep how they had obliterated that stress of overwrought emotion and how his young blood leapt up in assent but morris her instinct was keenand see you mervyn it will be better for morris too if you go why should he speak what is confession without a culprit come you can write to him from blackborough comeor there is no more me for you from tonight when morris pugh returned from the temple that is made without hands an hour later the house lay very still in the moonlight he paused at his brothers door to listen there was no sound so he passed on to his own room took his fathers bible his mothers picture the few odd pounds he had in the house and so passed downstairs again to the writingtable in the study where he had thought out so many sermons so many appeals to his wandering flock but it was neither a sermon nor an appeal which he set down on paper and left lying where mervyn would see it next morning rather was it a confession for this is how it ran wisdom has come to me among the eternal hills brother go your way be one of the saints in light i will go mine since i cannot stay and remain silent may god in his mercy preserve you always from the judgment of men and give you his grace it lay there all night with the moonlight shining on it then the moonbeams faded and the greyness of the false dawn found it lying there still but the breath of the real dawn winning its way through the door opened by the housekeeper who came to set the room in order tilted it into the wastepaper basket whence swiftly it made its way to the fire by the hands of tidiness thus mervyn would have had no chance of seeing it even if he had been there but he was not chapter xix peter ramsay put down the letter with a low whistle and stood staring at his halfpacked portmanteau then he took up the letter again and reread it there was no doubt about it the governing body of st helenas hospital for children offered him the appointment of resident physician at a salary of l a year but where the deuce was the hospital egworth that was one of the suburbs of blackborough the most desirable suburb for it stood on a hill and so above the smokepall of the factory city but he remembered no hospital there once upon a time some speculator had built a huge framework of a place that was to have been a hotel or a hydropathic or something of the sort on the site of the old manor house at the very top of the rise he remembered phipps folly as it was called with its cold deserted lookout of roughlyglazed windows but of hospitalsnothing it must be some small place yet still l a year was liberal if you would prefer to see the hospital before making a decision the authorities will be happy to show you over and i may mention that the governing body will be in committee on the th of this month and could give you an interview thus wrote the secretary the th that was today the letter had been delayed partly because he had changed his lodgings partly because he had run out of town from saturday to monday to see a friend before leaving for vienna of course he could put off his journey for a day or two and still arrive easily before the date he had originally fixed on the other hand as it was but a two hours run to blackborough why should he not go down by the oclock luncheon train and be back in time to start if need be by the oriental express in the evening no reason at all he would do this and he might find time even if st helenas proved to be a fraud to look in at st peters into the bargain st helenas hospital said the cabman at the station confidentially thatll be the noo one as the syndicate as bin makin out o phipps folly out of phipps folly so that was it quaint certainly i suppose so he replied they must have been pretty nippy about it cabbys face fell nippy he echoed nippy aint in it theyve ad workmen over from the states and fitters from germany an a regular cordon round the place to prevent union men havin a look in one thing is it must have cost em a pot of moneybutbut they done it and they do say as it is fust class and the old gardens a sight so pop in sir ill have you there in twenty minutes if youll give me three shillin the three shillings were promised and peter ramsay spent those twenty minutes in pleasurable excitement this was something out of the common if it had been well done phipps folly might be an ideal hospital and there was something stimulating something which stirred the imagination in this sudden development of course money could do everything but how seldom money was spent in this way for money in esse always had that postulate of more money in posse behind it there was only one man he knew a quick wonder was checked by the swift turn of the cab through the wide open iron gates while the new gravel of a broad semicircular sweep crisped under the wheels but there was nothing to tell of recent work in the green lawns with their old spreading cedars which lay between the two gates and the facade itself what an enormous improvement those wide balconies were and how useful they might be the whole place had an air of having been in use for years and as the cab stopped a hall porter in livery came alertly down the porch steps followed by a hall boy that was a trifle too much for a good thing no there was another cab driving in by the other gate which explained the boy peter ramsay paused to give a general look round certainly so far as the outside went nothing could be more perfect what a splendid playground for the children the garden would be sloping away in varying degrees of wildness to a real dingle at the further foot of the hill and that glass palace attached to the left must be a winter garden on this warm day the doors were open and dr ramsay could see swings seesaws rockinghorses tall flowering shrubs andyes birds actually birds feeding on the floor or flying about apparently content close to the porch against the halfbasement story he could see through the glazed doors rows of perambulators invalid carriages and advancing to meet him with welcoming wave of the tail was a magnificent newfoundland dog evidently intended to be an important factor in the establishment there was imagination everywhere dr ramsay came an astonished voice at his elbow he turned to see mrs tresillian pausing in the very act of giving two shillings to her cabman mrs tresillian he echoed howhow very she stepped forward and looked at himhe stepped forward and looked at her then with one voice they both said ned i felt it was ned helen tresillian gave a sigh of relief i have been wondering ever since i got this she held out a letter and dr ramsay mechanically held out his also who it could be who was offering me this place of matron and nowdear me how silly of me not to think of ned before but you see i have been away in scotlandi only came back todayand i had not heard any blackborough news since i was here before christmasso i could hardly guess could i she cast a glance around her but this is ned of course it is like a fairy tale let us go in and see it i expect it isperfect they went up the steps solemnly followed by the newfoundland the hall porter and the hall boy but on the threshold helen paused isnt it like a fairy tale she repeated and in an instant there appeared a most beautiful hospital all fitted with cots and medicine bottles and nursesah here comes one of them how quaintbut oh how sensible it was rather a buxom little person who came out from a sidedoor something both in her fair smiling face and her dress recalled an old dutch picture her neat white stockings and black rubbersoled heelless shoes were well seen below a darkblue cotton dress full in the skirt loose in the body just fastened round the throat without any attempt at a collar and ending short above the elbow on her head almost completely covering her smooth fair hair she wore a white linen cap gathered in to tightness with a narrow tape tied at the back dr ramsay gave a big sigh by george he murmured thats workmanlike if you like i was to give you these said the newcomer holding out two notes one addressed to peter ramsay esq md frcs medical officer designate the other to mrs tresillian matron designate st helenas hospital egworth it is from ned said helen softly handing him hers when she had read it i expect he has written you the samei think he is certain to have written just the same they were in fact the same word for word short and very much to the point dear ramsay or heleni have built this hospital for you and no in the queens ward you will find him waiting for you in no overlooking the garden he is at present sole occupant of the hospital i hope you will accept the responsibility of killing or curing him if you dont i must find someone else as st helenas hospitalwhich by the way has a permanent endowment of lcannot possibly remain without a doctor or a matron so dont say no unless you really dislike the place yours blackborough the tears for some reason or other came into helens eyes and even peter ramsay winked it was a fairy tale indeed these are your rooms sir said the little dutch nurse the governing body desire me to say they would be pleased to alter them in any reasonable way you might desire peter ramsay looked round the wide rooms whose walls were almost all cupboards which was heated by a selffeeding stove where the doors and drawers shut automatically and the very washhand basin tilted itself empty with a distinctly annoyed smile i dont believe even i could be untidy in it he said grudgingly but if you will excuse me nursewho are the governing body oh there are several gentlemen i believe but i only know the one namelord blackborough i have not seen him he is to be here today howeverit is their first committee meeting you know itit was built by a syndicate wasnt it asked helen yes by a syndicate i dont think lord blackborough had anything to do with it these are yourthat is the matrons rooms helen gave a little cry they were the replica of her rooms at the keep even to the row of flowerpots on the windowsills and the little niche for her priedieu chair what a memory he hadand what an imagination they must have spent any amount of money over it continued the buxom little nurse for everything is quite perfecton a small scale of coursei mean in comparison with the london hospitals but none of them so far as i know is half so well equipped for children it will be a pleasure to work here she threw open the door of a ward and introduced nurse mary an elderly woman also in the quaintly dutch dress there are only four cots in each ward said sister ann and they have all a wide balcony on to which the cots can be wheeled and every ward in thus part of the house is practically selfsupporting she threw open another side door in the landing the bathroom and the nurses room are over there and this is the pantry there is a lift from the kitchen everything in truth was perfect and peter ramsay gave a great sigh of content over the marble operatingroom with its glass casing its endless silverplated taps and tubes and sprays and levers i believe he said suddenly excitedly it is a replica of pagenheimsyes i am certain that is his new adjustor he was deep in the mechanism in a moment there were german or austrian workmen at it i know said sister ann beaming over with content but it is absolutely complete isnt it truly it was complete in every detail a very gem amongst hospitals a very pearl of places where disease and death could be faced at close quarters yes even to the little marble mortuary where carven biers stood waiting under the shadow of a great white cross we must see number said helen to dr ramsay it was built for him remember as well as for us the plural pronoun gave dr ramsay a little thrill which he shook off impatiently that is the worst part of it he said i am by no means sure about no but the first sight of the boy who was playing draughts with his nurse in a great wide playroom with a lift from it to the wintergarden below set him wondering if in very truth he could not set those crooked things straight the secretarys compliments please said the hall porter when they found themselves back in the vestibule and the governing body will be glad to see you when you are disengaged they looked at one another they had lingered over their inspection it was already close on four oclock and if the oriental mail had to be caught peter ramsay must leave at the half hour if it did not take him long to decide he thought of the appeal in those words dont say no unless you dislike the place he would not at any rate go to vienna that night i am disengaged now he said looking at helen tresillian if you are so they followed their guide down a passage to the right wing of the house where he knocked at a door labelled secretarys office a small man sadly humpbacked but with a quick intelligent face and a most determined chin rose as they entered and bowed if you would kindly step within he said opening an inner door dr ramsay and mrs tresillian sir the door closed behind them andand ned blackborough jumped up from a comfortable chair by the fire and came forward with outstretched hands by george i was nearly asleep what a time youve been i thought you must have gone away disgusted my dear ned gasped mrs tresillian you dont surely mean that youyou onlyare the governing body if you will sit down and pour us out some tea he said coolly pointing to a little table laid out by the fire i will tell you what i amor rather what i am notfor i have been most things this last month i had no idea it would have been such a business he might have said he had had no idea it would cost so much money but he did not for to him the only use of money was to spend it so as they drank their tea he told them how the idea had come to him before christmas when helen had first told him of no and the discussion concerning the pot of beer had begun how he had rushed everybody bribing everybody to unheardof haste just a month he said from start to finish but he had had to get bricklayers plasterers painters over by wire from the states and buy all the fittings in germany it was very unpatriotic of course but what could one do when the trades unions would only allow a man to lay onehalf the number of bricks in a day that the americans laid and when english firms talked of christmas day boxing day and the general holiday dislocation of trade he never could have done it but for woods the little dumpity who had introduced them the man was an old watchmaker who had lost employment through the swiss competition and who had had the pluck to spend his last pound or two in going over to geneva to see how it was that the foreigner could work cheaper he ned had come across him in the park one night and had lent himonly lent him of course with no hope of ever seeing him or it againa sovereign but the fellow had come back and had repaid the sovereign he had written a pamphlet on his views and sold it in the streets soso they had joined hands being of the same way of thinking i was awfully afraid when we were down at plas afon helen he said that the thing would get blown upon what with all the telegrams and the people who came to see me but you told me she replied reproachfully that it was mostly about that strike at the works so it waspartly he answered with a smile then he looked grave ill tell you what ive been busy this last fortnight and no mistake with the strike she asked quickly yes with the strike he answered after a pause i went into the whole thing from the beginning and i found that those particular factories had been working at a loss for the last three years i showed the accounts to the men and pointed out that under the circumstances no master could be expected to accede to a demand for a rise in wages they wouldnt listeni suppose really they couldnt listen so i closed the works gave them each a months pay in their pockets and told them i hoped theyd find a better master i couldnt do anything else in common fairness it comes to that in the end he walked to the window moodily and looked out then turned to them with one of his sudden brilliant smiles and you good people what have you decided but perhaps i had better give you a short outline of what st helenas hospital is to be in the first place woods is to be the secretary and treasurer and all that sort of thing with a staff under him there is to be no governing body but the money will be vested in a trust and the whole staff of the hospital shall form a general committee this will ensure the appointment of really reliable persons all through sister annyou saw hershe has every diploma under the sun and is as hard as nutsis for the present head under you ramsay of the nursing department you are head for the present of the medical and surgical with help as required and helen here is to boss the whole lot of you in housekeepingit is really what you are cut out for you know helen though you did fuss over the chauffeur dinners but i dont quite see why began peter ramsay argumentatively all this has to be done if it was to provide me ned blackborough interrupted him it was to supply youand the world he said almost sarcasticallywith a place in which there were no vested interests it was to provide youand a few other working men and womenwith a place here they could work without let or hindrance where they were responsible for the whole showyes even for those who were to come after them dont bring in any one ramsay because he is a brilliant operator pay him if you like to come in and operate but keep your staff good men and true who will try to secure an apostolic succession of good men and true thenthen no one will quarrel over a pint of beer do you accept i accepted from the very beginning ned said helen quickly the moment i saw the newfoundland dog i ned laughed i thought of bringing your fathers retriever but he wasnt warranted with childrenso i got that bumbler peter ramsay was taking his turn at the window looking out with eyes that had a blur in them suddenly he wheeled yes i accept lord blackborough andand may heaven do so and to me and more also if he wrung neds hand instead of finishing his sentence lord blackborough threw himself into the armchair and stretched out his legs in relief nunc dimittis he said and now for a few details you wont be able to start of course for some time the place is fairly dry having been roofed over you remember but some of the partition work is a bit damp though weve had it all dried as well as we could and your rooms are dog dry so is number seven ward but for a while you will have to go slow sister ann woods and the housekeeperi hope you will like her helen if you dont give her the sack for she will have her vote in the housekeeping committee though of course the under servants wontor at any rate only on certain points you will find woods has it all worked out however he has a head like an american rolltop desk well those three can manage so if you want any special fitup oh by the way ive left the instruments to you ramsay except the ordinary ones woods has enough in hand to pay and what is to become of you ned asked helen anxiously noting a certain jumpiness of insouciance in her cousins manner a certain almost uncanny clearness in his eyes are you going back to new park ye gods and little fishes no he ejaculated do i look helen like a churchwarden or any one else who would find comfort in turkey carpets i my dear child am going to find rest unto my soul in my own way ii am going to the grecian archipelago my dear ned she laughed dont be so ridiculous what are you going to do you look tired tired he echoed with a quaint hint of a break in his voice i should think i was tired so would you be if you had to consort withhow is it walt whitman puts ittinsmiths locksmiths and they who work with the hammer cabmen and mothers of large families i know now how my uncle must have felt excuse me helen but i am a little bit harassed you dont know what ive had to do and havent had to do over this business but ive got through it without any one guessing i was the syndicate however since ive started you i really am off to athens tonight afraid i shant have your company on the oriental expressah ramsay now as i have to see ted cruttendenwho is just back i hear from parisbefore i start ill say goodbye but will you catch the express asked dr ramsay incredulously i expect so i have a special replied lord blackborough carelessly they looked at each other after he had left the room i hope he will take a rest said helen still more anxiously ive never seen him look soso curiousas if he were seeing visions he is a little finedrawn said the doctor shortly quiet will set him all right i expect meanwhile ned in his motor was running close up to timelimit on his way to teds office even if he missed the express he was not going away without telling the latter that he had spoken to aura that she had refused him but thatwell he had some reason for hoping she might change her mind he would have written this had he been able to get teds address in paris but no one knew it at the office or at any rate they professed not to know it ted however had returned that morning and ned had telephoned down to him warning him to expect a visit so there he was in his private room looking just a little disturbed just a little combative yet the paris visit had been successful beyond his hopes so successful indeed that there was a really magnificent diamond ring in his breastpocket awaiting leisure for him to take it down to cwmfaernog im off for six weeksto be exact for thirtynine daysto athens said ned and i wanted to see you for a moment first because i have something to tell youthat i think you ought to know i asked aura graham to marry meon new years day it was teds heart gave a great thump it made him conscious of the engagement ring in its fine blue morocco case in his breastpocket yes he said chillilyandand he could not get his tongue to say she accepted you although the instant he heard neds confession he made up his mind that it must not force his hand in any way the engagement was not yet made public they had a perfect right to keep it secret if they chose she refused mebut here ned found some little difficulty in going on but i am not so sure ifif she would refuse me again that really is all ive come to say he looked frankly at his companion ted stooped down and stirred the fire thanks of course that is your opinionii dont agree with it but anyhow a man can but take his chance you take yours and ill take mine done said ned with a laugh and they parted chapter xx little blue wavelets were lapping on the pure white coral dust at his feet above his head little white cloudlets were sailing upon the pure blue of the sky as ned blackborough lay on the flat of his back looking out over the soft southern sea he had edged himself away from the turf beyond the sand for fear of crushing the great drifts of tiny iris which everywhere grew encircled by their bodyguard of greygreen scimitarshaped leaves whether they were actually of the same sort as the one which aura had dubbed the most beautiful thing in the most beautiful place in the world ned was not botanist enough to know but his heart warmed to them because of their likeness to it but then his heart went out to almost everything in this wonder island of the sporades group which he had purchased for a mere song from the turkish government a mere song indeed it filled him with awe to think of becoming the possessor of so much pure loveliness when he had spent hundredsnay thousands of times as muchin trying to make one house fit for children to die in even as it stood it was an earthly paradise when he had finished spending a little more money and a good deal more leisure on it when the white marble ruins on it were restored when books and music came to its pleasant pavilions above all when love came to take up her abode there it would be a veritable fragment of the heavenly jerusalem chipped off and dropped here by chance in the still deep blue sea yes it was extraordinarily beautiful it satisfied the soul straight away from the waters edge save where here and there a coralsanded creek broke the clear cut of the cliff the land rose steadily cleft by sharp ravines to a central peak not high yet high enough to hold on this early morning in february a dusting of frosty dew upon its summit which shone evanescently like snow then disappeared before the rising sunbeams as they fell the ilex woods were already green and bronze in their new soft yet spikeset shoots the olives grew sturdily amongst the burnished leafage of the wild lemon and the wild orange and down the ravines where trickled scantily among the stones tiny streams of water the oleanders were already preparing their blaze of red and white and the flowers ye gods what flowers it would take aura a lifetime simply to find out their names every thicket showed them aburst with coming blossom and the open spaces even thus early were carpeted with fritillaries and narcissus and the birds a pair of tiny sunbirds flitted past him twittering playful a flash of scarlet wheeling wings and ruby throats on the rock yonder an emerald and sapphire kingfisher sat silent looking with large piercing eyes out to sea so indeed might halcyon have sat looking for her ceyx and as he watched the bird immobile mournful the full beauty of the farway greek legend struck ned blackboroughs mind with new force ay so must all those who love the something they know not what which they find or seem to find in some womans beauty some mans strengthso must they watch and wait flitting ever over the waves of life seeking the beloved not even the halcyon days when zeus gives the wisdom of calm could end that ceaseless quest aura had been right behind love was the something better which he had felt in which both he and she had been lost as they had sat together hand in hand listening to the robin as it sang on the hollytree the sunbirds flitted past again less playfully more lovingly and ned blackborough started up remembering that it was the th of februaryst valentines day naturally the birds were pairing naturally there was spring in the air naturally his blood seemed to race through his veins he also could have made love fautes de mieux why should he not send aura a valentine he had not written to her he had virtually said he would not but a valentineespecially a valentine by wire as this must bewas a very impersonal affair he strolled over to the rocky point behind which in a natural harbour lay a fairsized english sailingboat beyond at anchor rode a steam yacht but its fires were outits crew had gone off that morning in a double lateensailed felucca to rhodes for some festivalst valentines day no doubt but for this it would have been easy to steam over to the telegraph office there was the sailingboat however and the weather was perfect he looked out seawards critically there was a certain hardness of outline in that deep blue horizon otherwise the calm of fourteen days might well be beginning it would be a lovely sail twenty miles or so over these ripples with just enough warm southerly wind behind one to blow the boat straight to the telegraph office without a tack as for the return journey the feluccas crew would have to make that and bring the yacht for him next morning he liked rhodes it was a quaint old town full of memories pagan and christian five minutes afterwards he was afloat the sheet looped within reach the tiller set steady towards a paleblue cloud which lay upon the northwest horizon it was the most perfect of mornings the boat lay over a trifle to the wind which was stronger beyond the lee of the island and sent a little halfapologetic tinkling bubbling laugh of water along the side as it slid through the waving lines of ripple let me pass good people it seemed to say let me laugh i have a purposeyou have none hahaha so unheeding of the ripples might the unchanging purpose behind all things break through the little waves of the world and laugh at their disturbance ned blackborough lit a cigarettea good sound opiumsoddened egyptian cigarette such as his soul lovedand set himself deliberately to daydreams it was becoming more and more a temptation for him to do this for he was only just beginning to realise the intense pleasure he derived from it a sensual purely esthetic pleasure for the most part though every now and again yes every now and again he left even the supersensual part of him behind and lost himself utterly in what he did not know he only knew that it was there and he was forgotten today however he was in no mood for the infinite the finite was quite sufficient for him so he amused himself by looking steadily at the shining dark surface of some bilge water which lay by the tarred keel of the boat and trying to imagine that he would see visions in it as the little cairo boys see them in a drop of ink he had tested this often and knew that they did see strange things just as helen apparently had seen the fire on cams point in the crystal truly there were many mysteries it was of course not hard to conjure up auras face or see her seated in the sheep shelter listening to the bird or standing in the moonlight among the cedar shadows on the lawn holding out the sovereign or on her knees beside the little purple iris while the sphinx looked down on her but beyond all these tricks of memory what could he see nothing yet what was this a wide stretch of blueblue everywhere bah it was only the reflection of the sky it was the floor of heaven his eyes narrowed themselves from dreaminess to thought it was strange that that inner eye which could produce things from the past with such absolute accuracy should be so helpless in regard to the present except in negation it could make one forget that altogether as for the future truly the mind of man dreamt idly when it sought to discover what lay beyond possibly because it sought to recognise itself in conditions in which self should have been merged in something beyond self so as he sat idly looking at the drop of dark water he felt for a momentaided no doubt by the opium in his cigaretteas if he were sailing on over a sea that vibrated ceaselessly with a soft quiver which brought no sensation of light to his eyes no sense of feeling to his touch no sense of sound to his ears and the old indian definition recurred to hima bubble upon the ocean of bliss the sharp rug of a running rope recalled him to the present the loop of the sheet was slipping as the breeze freshened it was freshening indeed behind him lay quite a squall crisping the ripples to little indignant waves and over in the southeast a cloud palegrey but threatening already showed as a widening arch from the horizon one of the swift spring storms was coming up apace and he must run for it for all he was worth there was no more time for dreams every ounce of the squall that goes before the storm must be made use of if he was to send his valentine but he would send it safe enough unless the wind shifted after a while during which the boat hard held flew through the waves and the blue cloud to the northward rose higher and higher on the horizon the wind did shift just at a point or two towards the south and he in his turn had to shift his tiller so as to keep that extreme northeastern headland before him so it became a harder tussle than ever between him and the wind to keep full way on the boat she was carrying more sail than was safe but he could not afford to lose a moment of time although all things being equal he had still a fair chance of making the land another slight shift and now before hima gleam of light on the land that was already shadowed by the coming stormhe saw a creek of white sand slightly to westward of him where he could at least have a chance of beaching his boat where for the matter of that if the worst came to worst he would at least have a better chance of not being dashed to pieces if he tried to swim beyond the coast was cliffbound rockbound would she take so much he let the sheet slip through his fingers half inch by half inch gauging the winds pressure on the sail cautiously yes she would take it he could make the creek if all went well but he had reckoned without the current which here close to the land began to gather itself for a headlong race round that eastern cliff so inch by inch the boats prow slid from the white streak of safety to the rocks would she stand another inch of rope she stood it and leapt forward like a greyhound giving to the full sweep of the storm which at that moment with a crash of thunder broke over them then righting herself and careering before it like some mad thing her way redoubled by the fierce wind which sang in neds ears as clinging to one taffrail with his hand he stood almost on the other there was no time now even for thought the feeling of fight came in its place since to steady the tiller for the creek one moment and give to the huge rollers the next was enough for soul and brain and body then on the crest of a wave he saw the creek in front of him but saw also that a giant roller just behind him must swamp the boat unless he steered straight towards the rocks on the northeast they were sharp jagged rocks like teeth just showing above the boil of the waves how far out did the reef run what length was that ravening jaw who could say the next instant with his boots kicked off and the thwart on which he had kept an eye this while past held under his armpits by his outstretched arms as a buoy he had leapt into the roller as it lifted the boat the water felt warm to him spray and windchilled as he was warm but rough as it seized him ducked him cuffed him bruised him all but broke him ere with a mighty rush it flung him forwards ye gods what it was not to be quite soundto have an arm that could not stand a strain still that awful something against which he had struck in the downdraw had been warded off somehow and then once more the following roller stronger of the giant twins which hunt the wide wastes of water in couples overtook him caught him buffeted him knocked him senseless so with a wild shrieking scramble of pebbles and coral sand swept him up to the very last corner of the creek his head as he lay stunned was within an inch of a jagged needlepoint of rock which would have crashed into his skull as if it had been an eggshell it was full five minutes ere another giant wave reached out for him and felt him about the feet but by this time that was enough to rouse him he stirred sat up and halfmechanically withdrew himself stiffly beyond any further touch he was bleeding from cuts in the hands and on his knees but that seemed to be all the damage done except for the boat of course what of the boat it was matchwood already amongst those devilish rocks to the eastward that was a nearish squeak he murmured softly as he rose and limping a little sought shelter among the clefts of the cliff from the blinding torrents of rain an hour or so afterwards however having with easy grace and some small knowledge of turkish and modern greek hired a gaily caparisoned mule from a neighbouring farmer he rode up the knights street quite cheerfully dried and warmed by the sun which after the brief storm had shone out again radiantly carelessly he had settled what the valentine was to be from the very moment that the idea of it had entered his head but it took him fully half an hour to see it safely through the hands of the turkish officials and then they charged him for a message in cipher yet it was only a very simple quotation haply i think on thee and then my state like to the lark at break of day uprising from sullen earth sings hymns at heavens gate he did not even put his name to it for it seemed impossible to him that she should not know who sent it by this time it was close on four oclock and he computed the difference in longitude by his watch she ought to get it at latest by four he said to himself as he strolled off to the old church to live awhile amongst the ghosts of the crusaders and the knights hospitalliers of st john as a matter of fact it was a quarter to four when the brickdust coloured envelope was put into auras hands but she was still looking at it with a certain scare in her eyes and a certain flutter at her heart when ted came down from her grandfathers room at four oclock of course she knew who had sent it no one but ned would have thought of anything at once so consoling and so disturbing to rise from earth and sing hymns at heavens gate was quite in order but how about the haply i think on thee whats that asked ted kindly as he sat down beside her on the sofa which had been imported into the bare empty room for the invalids use anything i can do that again was so like him always thinking of material help in everything nothing she replied hurriedly crumpling up the paper and thrusting it under the sofa cushion nothing at least of any consequence she was wearing the diamonds now and they flashed on her finger bringing the sunburn brown of her hand into greater prominence you look worried ted she went on you dont think grandfather is worse do you he was very disturbed i know but ted shook his head not worse certainly i left him asleep besides the doctor says there is no immediate danger of any sort but i am worried the fact is my darlinghis arm was round her but not too aggressively for in truth though he loved her dearly his world held many other interests besides lovethis sort of thing cannot go on this is the third time i have been sent for since the new year i dont grudge it dearest one bit there is always the joy of seeing you but if hirsch hadnt been kindness itself i couldnt have managed it and it doesnt really do the dear old man any good here he is today fretting himself ill about my having to go away about our being married so i was wondering dearest yes ted she put in calmly ted took his arm away and sat resting his head in his hands and looking vexedly into the fire it is a good deal to ask of usespecially to ask of you he went on but you see i must go off this evening so it wouldnt make any real difference since we are bound indissolubly to each other as it isarent we he took her left hand and kissed the diamond ring as he spoke of course we are she assented go on ted soif you will consenti could fetch the rectorhe is a surrogate i find but as a matter of fact i got the license at blackboroughand we could be married before i go dont look so startled my dearest it shant be if you dont wish it and i hate asking for it only i believe it would really quiet the dear old man and give him a better chanceand me too of course for this sort of thing is a littlejust a littlewell limiting and as i say it would make no differenceexcept perhaps that i should find it harder than ever to leave my wife his voice sank to almost playful tenderness his arm stole round her waist again and she rose hurriedly butbut is this possible she asked incredulously i thought there was so much formality he smiled tolerantly not at all a special license is all thats required and i have that so if youyou dear solemn thingwill really consent to do without a wedding she looked at him startled but surely we are going to be married he laughed loudly of course we are i meant the bridesmaids and the cake and the orangeblossoms and all that i dont want them darling if you dont its enough for me to have you she set the question and his kiss aside as of no value whatever then i think you had better get the rector if you can ted she said thoughtfully i expect it will make a great difference to himto grandfather i meanand to you also and youve been so awfully good will you tell grandfather she added with a little blush as she released herself from her lovers thanks well you see he confessed ive halfpromised him alreadythat is why he went to sleep you are always so reasonable aura i felt i might count on you and then the sight of her standing there so sweet so kind so absolutely unconscious seemed to overwhelm him and he cried passionately oh my dear my dear i hope i shall make you happybut you are a thousand times too good for me he told himself so over and over again as he hurried on his bicycle to the rectory and he swore to himself almost incoherently that although the rush of mere moneymaking had absorbed much of his waking life it should never invade the corner that was sacred to his love and as he said this he turned his head suddenly towards the winter woods for in his ears that mellow blackbird call to the wilds seemed to sound as it had sounded that evening when all unwitting he had sold his soul to mr hirsch when he had gone on his mission aura drew out neds valentine again smoothed it over and looked at it once more for the first time in her life she felt the need of some onesome woman to whom she could talk finally she folded up the telegram put it on the mantelpiece and went into the kitchen there was always martha and marthas sound commonsense was a byword martha she said after standing for a few moments watching the deft hands dab butter over paste and roll it in with swift decisionit was almost like watching the mill which grinds small i want to ask you something but you must promise not to mention it even to adam even to bate echoed martha with a sniff if id my choice miss haura id as lief mention it to the towncrier not that bate doesnt mean well it aint his fault being born so but there one must just take holt of men as theyre made and be thankful they is no worse why this should have heartened aura up it is hard to say but it did she actually smiled what i wanted to ask was this martha in your experiencedo you think it hurts a man very much to be in lovei mean of course to be in love with some one who doesnt wanti mean who wont marry him martha poised the rollingpin on one hip her hand on the other hurt em she echoed lord sakes no its the makin o them bate wouldnt be alf so spry at his years if he adnt bin wantin to marry me any time this fourteen year back thats why i wont ave him even now miss haura bate says i if i was to take you now youd get fat an lazy you wouldnt rise no more youd be like whipped eggs as is let stand all gone to froth an water no miss haura men is like heggs they want beatin ard all the time else theyll never rise to better things the rollingpin came down on the pastry with more decision than ever and aura laughed out loud something in the very phrasing of the last words comforted her yet she was not quite content as she changed her daydress for the white cambric one she wore in the evening after all it was but putting it on an hour or so before her usual time and the mechlin lace about her throat was a concession which would please her grandfather auramy dearest you look quite bridal exclaimed ted as he came in to find her sitting by the firelight it seems too good to be truebut the rector will be here in half an hour he knelt down beside her and laid his head in her lap my dear my dear he said almost with a sob i dont seem able to say anything but that somehow he added almost pathetically far away dimly he saw a vision of something better unattainable incompatible with his sensuous life it was beautiful butwhat would you man is but man and he must have money wherewith to live then there is something which i must tell youbefore she said it is something which i think you ought to know ned asked me to marry him on new years dayand i refused teds heart gave a great throb as it had done when ned blackborough had used much the same words nearly a month before ii am sorry for ned he said softly but i dont see for answer she held out the telegram he sent me this today she said and i wonderif he is waiting waiting echoed ted hotly waiting for what you say you refused him yes i told him i would not marry himbecause i was afraid of loving him too much that was the truth for one instant the whole room seemed to spin round with ted he had to steady himself by holding to the back of a chair i dont understand what you mean he said thickly i dont think he did either she replied with a lingering regret in her voice for he said he would ask me again in two months as if that would alter anything ted caught swiftly at the ray of light then if he asked you againyouyou would refuse him the firelight had died down so that he could not see the flush which surged into her face but he could hear her voice as she replied yes i should refuse himmore than ever then he said slowly after a pause i dont see why you need bother oh it was not that she put in quickly i was only wonderingyou see i know so little and i have no motherif he would expect me to wait the firelight flared up again and he saw her with the lace about her throat let him wait he exclaimed passionately he had his fair chance and i have mine i am sorry but one of us had to win you cant help that you poor little dearthat is fate he told himself it was indeed fate he swore to himself that he would be the best husband ever woman had but for all that the ceremony damped even his joy to begin with martha wept copiously in a corner as she had wept ever since ted had gone in to the kitchen and taken her away unceremoniously from her pastrymaking as a witness at first she had sunk into a chair and steadfastly refused to budge on the ground that she couldnt ave sech things going on in the ouse but after a time the importance of being in possession of a dead secret and her perception that if his lordship was not going to come forwardand he seemed indeed inclined to play the back stepthis was decidedly the next best thing for her darling induced her to yield and if you loves im and e loves you there aint no fear same as there aint no fear but what good barm and good flourll make a good batch o breadno fear at all my deary dear she had sobbed consolingly to aura who stood quite composed but very white ted strong and kindly clasped her hand and what soul was left over and above his bargain was in his eyes the rector in biretta and cope read the service unabridged while sylvanus smith propped comfortably in his armchair averted his face from the sacerdotal symbols even while he added an unctious amen of his own to let no man put asunder he even essayed a burst of hilarity as he kissed mrs cruttenden but ted scarcely availed himself of his privileges he only stood beside aura holding her hand divided in his heart of hearts whether he should go or whether he should stay but in the end prudence triumphed and a sense of duty for the last month of constant interruptions had not been favourable to business and if auraif his wifewere ever to appear in that pink satin and diamonds it behooved him to bestir himself so adam bate coming in after milking the cows at eight oclock found the house silent curiously silent with martha seated on a chair her feet on the fender her eyes on the fire he cast a glance at the table it was bare so after a while he coughed beant there no supper martha woman he asked apologetically martha rose in an instant aflame theres bin that adam bate agoin on in this ouse this day as no one didnt want to ave no suppernot if they was christianbut bein a mantheres bread and cheese in the cupboard chapter xxi march had come in like a lion even in the village of dinas sheltered as it was the east wind swept down the funnel of the valley and through the very houses as only an east wind in wales can sweep bitter absolutely unsparing of man or beast alicia edwards gathered her crossover shawl closer to her as she stood in her fathers shop and listened for the click of the telegraph instrument it was almost the only amusement she had now and any moment might bring the wire for which adam bate and the housekeeper at cwmfaernog had been calling in vain these two days past it was becoming serious they would have to bury the poor dead gentleman after all if some one did not come to help them to arrangethe other thing for in this far away welsh village where every boy and girl had been educated up to the standard set by the most advanced progressivists of the day the very idea of cremation was absolute damnation it could be nothing else since how could the creator resurrect a body that did not exist so half the village thought it only right that such an atheist as mr sylvanus smith had been in life should meet the fire without delay and the other half more mercifully inclined explained the difficulty in getting hold of mr cruttenden the dead mans executor as symptomatic of pity on the part of providence alicia edwards thinking over this sighed it was only one more case in which the teaching of school ran counter to the knowledge that was necessary in daily life for what would her father the elder what would she herself say if she was to allow even elementary science to interfere with her belief the world was a very confusing place there was but one certain thing in it for a woman and that was love but every one could not get love she thought of her own struggle for it and her failure myfanwy had beaten her she had reft mervyn away even from his great vocation and rumour had it that after a little longer service in williams and edwardss shop those two would be married and set up in a small business of their own in face of this what did all the rest matter despite all the talk in the village concerning mervyns sudden departure and morris pughs equally sudden resignation of the pastorship of dinas she had held her tongue with fair discretion only allowing a few mysterious surmises to leak out to begin with myfanwys last words had alarmed her and then the offenders had passed altogether from her control what would it matter to mervyn now employee in williams and edwards if it was found out that he had ruined half the girls in dinas besides something new and stern in her fathers attitude towards her in regard to the revival made her suspect that he was not without his suspicions the less said about morals the better especially since the effect of those midnight meetings was already making itself felt in the immediate neighbourhood for isaac edwards was relentless on this point he had downright refused to let her go on with her sweet singing now that all her companions had died or disappeared so having of course lost her post as pupil teacher there was nothing for it but to stop at home and prepare so her father said for a normal college the girl herself stiffened a sullen lip and looked down the lane which led to the ministers house now occupied by the reverend hwfa williams for he admired her of that there could be no question the possibility of marrying him indeed had become quite a factor in her life and she decided most points with a view to this possibility small wonder then if alicia edwardss amicability and her general desirability as a ministers wife had begun to strike hwfa williams himself while even isaac edwards was beginning to waver in his insistance on logarithms and the science of tuition put on your hat alicia he said from his ledger and run down the road it will warm you up before you have to go to the bible class and alicia went nothing loth it was better battling with the wind than watching for telegrams which never came especially when there was the chance of coming back with the wind and with a man whose pale heavy darkbrowed face was beginning to become to you by diligent care and concentration the handsomest in the world so she fought her ground steadily against the swirling clouds of dust had she only gone up the hill over the short springy grass and the broken brown bracken she would have enjoyed the wind as ned blackborough was enjoying it on his way to cwmfaernog for it was the st of march the day on which he had promised aura he would return and ask her once more to marry him he had come back from the east but the day before and being so to speak made up of impulses moods fancies in the indulgence of which he had of late sought his chief pleasures he had determined to find his way to her as he had found it that very first night over the summit of llwydd y bryn the eye of the world such fancies hurt no one but he was beginning to realise that in them lay all the salt of life what was it to the world absorbed conventionally in the sordid sleep which follows perforce on sordid money grubbing if he found the highest rhythm of life in the quiver of the moonlit woods nothing let those see who had the eyes to see so when a bit wearied with his climb he sat down where he had carelessly put out his hand to catch the flying footsteps of day it struck him now thoughtfully that in truth it was all a mans life all he could do towards gaining happiness he must just catch at the flying footsteps of something unseen ever since the day when death had so nearly overtaken him while he was studying life in a black drop of water he had been haunted at times by that feeling of sightlessness touchlessness soundlessness which had come to him then it came to him now on the top of llwydd y bryn though before his bodily eyes lay half the principality of wales spread out as if it were a map surpassingly beautiful too in its way as beautiful as that island in the aegean now waiting ready for its mistress for he was quite prepared to follow aura into the wilderness if needs be he had thought much concerning her and concerning himself during the last six weeks and he had begun to recognise that in some ways she was right in shrinking from what she called love as a desecration of herself and of him the feeling however was due to the absolutely unnatural association in marriage of the mind with the body an association which was simply an attempt to find a mental figleaf for what either required none or was beyond decent cover one thing however seemed to him certain aura must both love him and also desire to marry him yes she loved him or thought she did which to her was the same thing he sprang to his feet that thought being enough to start him on any path and ere leaving the summit cast one look round it remembering gladly that it might be the last time he should see it all was as his recollection held it just a brown peaty stonestrewn rise and beyond on all sides an immensity of sea and sky and land only the placard on the shieling had been damaged by the winter storms the ultimate d was gone and ginger beer stood alone vaunting itself free like the nectar of the gods ginger beer that was about what it came to for the million with an amused shrug of the shoulders he began the descent every step of which was beautiful every sight in which brought to him the feeling as if he trod on air as if nothing in heaven or earth could trammel him again as he crossed the stream above the farm buildings where on that night nine months ago they had stood and shouted the whole steading struck him as looking forlorn and deserted but being sure of finding martha in the kitchen he went boldly through the cottage and passed through the door that was like a coal cellars to the garden room but this time there was no flash of blinding sunlight to dazzle him it was almost dark for the green sunblinds on either side were drawn down that however was surely a figure by the window at last came auras voice full of infinite relief i am so glad swept away by the wholeheartedness of his welcome he went forward swiftly and had her in his arms but his first touch was enough she shrank back with a halfarticulate cry of surprise and thrust him from her by force aura he said almost incredulously and you soundedsoso glad i thoughti thought you were ted she explained with a little sob ive been expecting him so long you see ted he echoed you have been expecting him i dont understand no she replied hurriedly in a low voice of course i forgot you couldnt there was a faint pause then she collected herself wewe were married this time the pause remained unbroken until coolly almost sarcastically the question came you were married may i askwhen the darkness of those drawn down blinds was in a way a godsend to them both it hid all expression and it seemed to ned blackborough in his incredulous dismay as if he were speaking to a disembodied spirit was he also by some chance a disembodied spirit ii dont remember came her voice all strained and curiously weary oh yes of course i do it was on the th of february she was just beginning to remember dates and to recollect that this must be the st of march everything seemed to have been blotted out by her grandfathers sudden death two days before and the impossibility of getting any answer to her telegram from ted ted on whom she had learnt to rely ned laughed suddenly st valentines day he echoed so i sent you my valentine as a wedding present if i had only known i mightnt have taken so muchtroubleto send it off i expect i was pretty near death when you were getting married young lady and i compliment you on the quickness but we were engaged quite a long time before she said in idle protest for something in her seemed hammering at her head beating into it the knowledge that she had been mean once more he laughed may i ask how long onon new years day he could scarcely hear what she said on new years day he echoed incredulously impossible then the conviction that if this were so ted cruttenden hadwell almost lied to him came to rouse his anger to the uttermost and he strode towards her shadow but this is foolishness he exclaimed you know you love meyou know you do hush she cried interrupting his swift rise in tone remember please that my grandfather lies dead upstairs dead he said stupidly after a pause dead ii didnt know ii am very sorry the conventional words of sympathy came slowly as he stood feeling baulked indescribably done out as it were of his just claim to anger are there any more terrors to tell he asked at last recklessly do you happen to be dead yourself or has the coo been killed i beg your pardonyou wont understand the allusion he added hastily but i must be excused there are limits so i see you took me for tedfor your husband save the mark why isnt he herewhere he ought to be the sudden blame following her own thought so closely took aura all unprepared the dull grievance which had been hers all those long hours of vain waiting became suddenly acute she dissolved into young selfpitying tears i dont know she murmured strangling her sobs and i dont in the least know what to do for an instant ned blackborough felt inclined to arraign high heaven for thus robbing him of righteous wrath but he was a gentleman his heart was soft so there was nothing for it save to accept the situation with the best grace he could and the grace came to his surprise with such exceeding ease despite his illusage that he had to drive himself not towards patience but to impatience as he listened to auras tale of ignorance and loneliness a man with money behind him or rather money with a man behind it can do all things save avoid vulgarity ensure happiness or escape death by the evening therefore ned blackborough was able to give aura a most sympathetic and affectionate telegram from her husband we ran him to earth in vienna where he had gone on business said ned refraining why he scarcely knew from saying also that ted had been found in a biergarten and that he had left strict orders that telegrams were not to be forwarded i got him through hirsch but he again was unfortunately in paris they have some big scoop on hand but it is all right now and he should be home tomorrow as for the rest you need not bother it is all settled and i will tell martha what to expect so i will say goodbye she could not stifle down the quick appeal must you go of course i must go he replied roughly i ought never to have come and i am sorry i did even though i have helped you goodbye she watched him put on his greatcoat without another word almost angry with herself for feeling so inexpressibly mean she would have liked to tell him that she had been unable to wait that even if she had waited her answer would have been the same but she felt that all this must come afterwards when he had had time and then suddenly he turned to her again ill leave this here i think he said putting a flat parcel he had taken out from his pocket on the piano you might while an hour or so by looking at them itit isnt all cussedness mrs cruttenden i should like you to see them i should like you to know something of it once goodbye throw them into the fire when you have done with them i shall not want them again when he had gone she went over to the piano and taking the packet crouched down with it beside the fading firelight which she stirred into a blaze to other eyes the room might have looked inexpressibly dreary large bare empty even the very sofa imported into it for the old mans invalid use taken away for him when the stairs became too much for his strength but aura was accustomed to the bareness it had been part of her life always they were sketches evidently and on the fold of white paper which was their last covering ned had written one word avilion she sat looking at them all these plans and sketches of the island in the southern sea that was to have been that island of the blessed of which a glimpse only can be seen by mortals when at sunset time the golden sea fades into the golden sky and far awayis it land or is it clouda purple shadow tipped with rosy light into distant peaks fades with the sky into the grey of night how beautiful they were and in every one of them in front even of the foreground looking out as the painter himself must have looked out over the blue ripples down into the pellucid cave depths where strange fish showed in flashes of colour towards the leafy contours of the ilex woods along the flowerdecked lawns or through the fluted columns of marble pavilions stood the filmy diaphanous figure of a woman white immobile mistlike with averted face but she knew who it was and a lump rose in her throat as she recognised it as his dream of her she was not worth it no behind his dream of her stood a reality that had nothing to do with her he was seeking and she was seeking something that had nothing to do with manhood or womanhood the fire blazed up fiercely fitfully as one by one in obedience to his request those dreamful figures caught flared up for a space and then died down into little trembling sparks behind them all lay darkness and peace so to her as she sat holding the dream of a mans love in her hands came for the first time a glimpse of the sightlessness and soundlessness and touchlessness which lie beyond all earthly things ned meanwhile was giving his orders to martha in the kitchen she was taking them as usual with many subservient bobs but with a certain waveringness of voice and an unsteadiness of eye which augured ill for her calm of mind ill do my best your lordship she said finally with an odd little sniff half tears half anger but what with folks going away as shud ave stayed an them as might agone away an welcome stoppin on an both together comin back an staying away im like a oven with the door bein open constantnot fit to bake a pennypiece ned looked at her for a wonder distastefully do you mean he said that you didnt expect to see me again martha grew red then white so sure as my names martha higgins she began tearfully if id expected your lordship wasnt playin the backstep he interrupted her calmly im sorry to say it martha but i think you are a fool he said calmly and left her collapsed in a chair crying silently not so much for herself as for him since she had seen the tragedy of his face adam bate coming in ten minutes later found her so and being diffident of his power to console crept away again to administer comfort to a newly calved cow who was lowing for her young one cooup cooep mdear he said wisping its back with a handful of straw th shallt ave it for sure when th bags full so set th mind to the makin o milk see theres a bit o mangle fur ee but mind ee to whom much is given of them shall much be required as passon says sopailfull cauffull think o that an dinnot squander gods strength on booin he felt inclined to read some such moral lesson to martha when he returned to find her in no better case the fire dwindling and no sign of tea but as has been said he felt diffident so he contented himself with laying the tea poking up the fire and putting on the kettle accompanying these unwonted actions with the hissing noise which grooms use apparently as an encouragement to their own ardour perhaps this aided him to courage perhaps the presence of death in the house taking him back to fundamentals roused in him a revolt of vitality a desire to secure safety in equilibrium anyhow after a time he sat himself down in a kitchen chair and scrooped it by excruciating halfinches towards marthas until they almost touched martha woman he said tentatively if this sort o things goin onif you urns goin to be taken this no supper no tea way as you urn bin doin o latewhy there aint nothin for it but ter marry me as doant forgit them things martha shook her head forlornly ititll have to come to that in the end i sippose she sobbed you might have knocked adam down with a feather after all these fourteen years to be even so grudgingly accepted as this made him feel that the round world was no longer sure he sat with his mouth wide open wondering what topic of conversation would in the future take the place of unending proposal and refusal then the sense that he must leave such dark things to providence and do his duty in the present by himself and martha made him ask tremulously will you name the yappy day my darlin will you my darlin name the yappy day martha wiped her eyes and became more composed some time afore we dies i suppose she said with a disconsolate whimper i cant promise moren that adam batean dont ee see the kettle bilin chapter xxii when ned blackborough left cwmfairnog he left behind him also the very desire for dreams he remained simply a rich man with no wants save for what wealth can bring all the restthe capacity for imagination inclusivewas mere moonshine for the first time in his life the pompous luxury of new park did not offend him he drank a bottle of ludicrously highpriced champagne for supper he smoked a good many ludicrously highlydrugged cigarettes not as he generally did almost unconsciously but of set purpose taking a solid joy in the fuddled state to which they reduced him he woke of course with a headache next morning and having had breakfast he looked at his bankbook a thing he had not done for months it was not exactly exhilarating to a man who had just made up his mind to enjoy what he could as a millionaire but even as he looked at the balance something in him rose up and mocked at him how long would this phase last how long could this pompous acquiescence in wealth as a means of pleasure last how could eyes that had once seen ears that had once heard remain blind and deaf to the only realities the only pleasures of life he put the question aside in an attempt to find anything but party in the politics of the morning paper and coming to the conclusion that they were synonymous terms he ordered the motor and went round to egworth to st helenas hospital woods the little secretary always had a tonic effect on him and he really wanted to see how things had been going on in his absence he found the secretarys office full up with business and little woods face keener than ever it is going on all right sir and i have kept strictly to the lines you laid down but it involves a good deal ofof tact and correspondencehe pulled a file towards him and fingered it this for instance contains nothing but applications to me personally for fairly fair contracts of sorts based on secret commission these i answer myself as the firms sending the suggestions are really quite respectable the minor tradesmen and all applications made through the servants i leave to the clerks you leave to the clerks echoed ned thoughtfully and some no doubt never come into the office at all woods shrugged his high shoulders one can expect nothing else it is impossible to gauge the extent to which dislike to what they call splitting obtains amongst domestic servants they will never tell on another a great many of them of course refuse these monstrous suggestions for taking toll but they would never dream of speaking to their employers about them as they should he sighed impatiently but what can you expect where are the fundamental principles of fair dealing taught in england nowhere hullo woods remarked ned with a laugh dont throw over caveat emptor it is the foundation stone of englands power then he frowned by the way how are the men down at biggie getting onyou gave them their wage every week for a month i suppose i did replied woods gravely there is a lot of distress down there you see it is not like a strike you have definitely closed the works and paid forfeit on contracts so the unions wont help some of these men have drifted away but the trade is slack all over england i wont say because of dumping but the fact remains it is slack lord blackborough looked at his secretary narrowly woods he said what would you do the keen face lit up do he echoed i know what i should dearly like to dotry an experiment there are a lot of clever men in that factory your lordship i should lend them the capital to run the concern at one and a half per cent interest andand await the result either way it would be an objectlesson it would pay me said lord blackborough if the state of affairs is to remain as bad as it has been illill see about it woods then i may take it that the hospital is really working on the lines i laid down woods coughed we are all very much on the lookout for fraud your lordship he said meekly but there must always be a percentage of error so long as every one wishes to coin his neighbour into golden sovereigns and that will be always woods remarked lord blackborough with a laugh i believe it to be an entrancing occupation and i mean to try it myself he sought out helen after this and found her also up to the ears in business it is a terrible responsibility ned she remarked and i am afraid i have to deluge poor mr woods with references but really i cannot trust to any onei mean outside the hospital within it we are a picked lot and we dofairly well the doubtful praise fell almost wearily from her lips and how is no he asked she brightened up going on sister ann says splendidly dr ramsay operated on him a fortnight after we started and it was a complete success the doctors from st peters were over seeing him yesterday and even they allowed it was splendid and how about the expenses will the parents pay anything reasonable for board she shook her head mr woods says you cannot expect it you see the children get their education free very often their dinners free so why shouldnt they get cured by charity there isnt much responsibility left to poor parents nowadays itit doesnt pay and ramsay asked ned with a smile i hope his shirts are in decent order she flushed up a brilliant carmine has dr ramsay been complaining she asked great heavens above no exclaimed ned aghast has it come to thatnoi havent seen him yet perhaps you had better ask him yourself she said coldly then she looked at him and about yourself ned youve told me nothing because dear he replied lightly there is nothing to tell by the way have you heard that aura graham married my friend ted cruttenden on valentines day you hadnt well its a fact anyhow and she has just lost her grandfather ned she cried rising in swift sympathy ii am so sorry yes it is rather sad he remarked coolly of course it breaks up that jolly little unconventional home by jove i daresay it will have to be sold and in that case i shouldnt mind buying it it would remind me of rather a jolly time his insouciance silenced her and he went off on his tour of inspection to sister ann whom he found in the convalescent ward very spic and span very precise and satisfied he has not had a single drawback she said glancing complacently at no who lay looking like an angel for virtue on a wheeled bed if he goes on like this he will be discharged in a month at most of course he will not be quite sound he is too radically diseasesodden for that but he will be able to make his own living and and marry put in lord blackborough calmly it is altogether a most satisfactory business sister ann looked at him doubtfully so far as i am concerned it is so certainly i disclaim responsibility after a patient leaves my hospital my dear sister ann laughed lord blackborough i disclaim all responsibility for anything it is the only possible way of feeling moral he found dr ramsay looking a trifle egare in a room of surpassing tidiness helens hand was visible also in the doctors dress he had nothing but good to report in every way except that he had found it extremely difficult to ensure a supply of absolutely undeniable drugs it is not that any one deliberately means to cheat but that the real thing is so difficult to get he remarked ruefully you see if a fellow sells wine or spirits that isnt genuine he can be run in but you may kill half a dozen babies by selling stale ipecacuhana wine or any other filth and no one asks questions he was loud in praise of his assistants the secretary sister ann each and all were firstclass and helenmrs tresillian i mean asked ned drily i hope she is satisfactory as matron peter ramsays face showed a trifle more colour satisfactory he echoed she is more than satisfactory do you know his voice sank to an almost awed tonei believe she looks after mymy underclothes herself ned blackborough burst into a roar of laughter my poor peter he said vested interests again its too bad then he sobered down and looked quite gravely at the doctor who was laughing too ramsay he said why dont you ask my cousin to marry you i asked her yesterday replied the doctor gloomily the devil you did ejaculated ned vaguely all this interested him made him forget himself what did she say peter ramsay got up and walked about the room what did she say it is an odd thing blackborough what different ideas people have about love i used to think it was a kind of fever that would yield to strict diet and a saline treatment it isnt at least something which has got mixed up in it may be so butnow on the other hand your cousin who is a sensible woman mind you seems to me somehow to have got hold of the wrong end of the stick she thinksoh hang it all i cant go vivisecting what she thinksits bad enough to do it for oneselfbut because she cant at nineandtwenty feel the sameyes ill say itpurely physical attraction for me that she felt for that poor sick man at nineteen she says that it is a desecration for any one even to speak of marriage to her i often wish the good women of the world could be made to understand how purely evanescent that sort of thing is for how little it counts in the aggregate sum of life here is helenmrs tressiliangiving it first place while other good women relegate it to the nethermost hell and all the while they prate about love with a big l my dear ramsay remarked ned ill give you ten thousand a year to go about the country and preach your viewsand ill give you a thousand extra for every woman you convert to them quite safe assented dr ramsay with a growl i should be lynched before my first quarters salary was due meanwhile you will stick to itand manage oh ill manage all right i have an a prescription for the febrile part of the diseaseii should like to give it to you the red brown eyes looked into the blue ones yes replied ned coolly she has married the other fellow because no doubt love seemed to her to be the devil you are about right ramsay women are impayable in that connection goodbye he tried to amuse himself in a thousand ways that afternoon but they all failed so he took to business the next day and went back to new park in the evening and drank another bottle of champagne and smoked still more cigarettes the next day brought him a letter in an unknown hand was it a mans or a womans he wondered a womans surely since the blackedged envelope smelt horribly of scent as he opened it aura cruttenden the signature gave him quite a shock the idea of her using either blackedged paper or scent revolted him but the letter waspassable dear ned it ran i suppose i ought to call you lord blackborough but i cant i shall never forget you you have taught me i think everything i know thats worth knowing perhaps ever so long age you and i were the same amoeba what are we going to be in the end that is the question dontdont quarrel with us pleaseyours aura cruttenden dont quarrel that was all very well but what else was there to do it was impossible for him to go on drinking champagne and smoking cigarettes till he died finally he tried london and a round of the theatres and musichalls he amused himself immensely and was never for one instant content he played bridge at the club and went no trumps until a choleric old gentleman remarked that it was no wonder he had such a dislike to the day of judgment whereupon he laughed and played no more then he sought out mr hirsch and went goldbugging in the city but after dining en petit comite with many jews turks infidels and heretics at every smart set restaurant in london at every one of which mr hirsch called the waiters by their names as if they were his own servants he gave it up in sheer disgust and tried to feel an interest in the grand national even to the extent of allowing himself to bet freely with his friends he did everything in fact that a man can do to please himself short of buying cheap or dear kisses and even that he might have done being for the time quite reckless but for the fact he was soulweary of womanhood her ways and works finally he went back to blackborough and felt the first really keen and natural emotion of which he had been capable for a month when he met ted cruttenden by chance in the street i hope your wife is quite well he said sedately feeling then and there a desire to throttle his successful rival it was a most wholesome feeling he recognised for it sent the blood coursing through his veins once more in honest antagonism to something of which he disapproved ted seemed to feel this antagonism pierce through him decorously dressed in a black business suit though he was for he said hurriedlyoh all right wont you come into the office for a moment ii should like to speak to you ned regarding himself once more from the outside felt vaguely amused and acquiesced of course began ted for his part feeling absolutely a somewhat illused and thoroughly misunderstood man i know the whole affair must seem as it were underhand but he looked doubtfully at his companion as if uncertain how much he knew before resolving on the whole truth as safest i suppose you know now or guess that when you came here last aura and i were engaged well it was so your coming and telling me you had asked her put me in an awful hole for i had no right on my part to tell youanything the whole affair was strictly private i hope you understand i understand that you wished it to be private remarked ned clearly it had to be my dear fellow replied ted eagerly to begin with we were engaged rather hurriedly in order to please her grandfatherchiefly and ii felt i had no right to presume on it it might never have come to anything it couldnt for a long time for i wasnt in a position to marry here his face fell and he threw down the pen with which he had been fiddling in sudden impatience for the matter of that im not in it now these confounded interruptions have played the dickens and we shall have to begin in a small way for she hasnt a penny the place is overmortgaged and even the furniture has to be sold in fact if it doesnt realise a decent price i might be let in where was i oh yes then in february just as i was in the throes of a really good thing i was telegraphed for again i had been down twice before and really only because the old man was not satisfied that we would keep to our engagement so he paused well remarked ned i took down a marriage license with meit was absolutely necessary you see that i should get away again as soon as i could and i thought if the worst came to the worst it would calm the old man to feel that we were married so you see there was no time to give any one any notice and you were married remarked ned again in the same clear hard voice yes the rector married us in the old mans room with martha and him as witnesses half an hour before i started that is really the whole storyexactly how it came about and you went back when asked ned blackborough quickly i never went back it was awfully important that i should have a free hand and that is how it cameabout the telegrams i meani had purposely left no address the tapping of neds stick on the floor which had been going on as he sat his elbow on his knees listening ceased then you mean to say he said slowly rising as he spoke that when i sawaurathe other dayshe suddenly he laughedgoodbye ted youre not a bad sort of a chap on the wholebut you have the devils own luck if i had only knownif i had guessed that she his voice rose in sudden anger then paused what was the good are you going to finish your sentence lord blackborough flared up ted in anger also yes replied ned without an instants hesitation reverting to his usual tone i am going to finish it i am going to tell you the truththough you havent told it to me there is no use in your not facing it man aura doesnt by right belong to youshe belongs to me if id known thenwhen i was at cwnfairnog i meanwhat i know now ii should have tried to take her away from all your cursed moneygetting even then its different now if you make her happy and if you dontii wont be such a fool again thats fair and square and above board sogoodbye as he walked through the streets once more he felt that this was the last straw why had he not made her understand herself why had he not carried her off then and there to avilion truly he was cursed as a fool he ought to have known he ought to have guessed he ought to have understood so as he wandered aimlessly through the city looking with a lacklustre eye upon all its hideous sights and sounds having in his ears the silly giggles of girls as they crowded round the shop windows having in his eyes an endless procession in those windows of hats and garments and flowers and frocks and fallals set there by men as a bait to the only barter which is allowed to womanhood without restraint he told himself that he would have done right if he had carried her away from contamination to that island in the southern seas where she would have lived to rear his children and be ye gods what should she not have been for an instant he caught a glimpse of reality and then the dream of life was his again but though the dancer of the world had on all the charms of money and civilisation and culture her dancing did not hold his eyes that evening he went over to the hospital and found helen darning away busily at something which she hastily thrust into her workbasket as he came in vested interests of course i am going away helen he said going away she echoed why ned you have only just come back my dear i do wish youyou would settle down that was exactly what i came to say to you he replied helen why wont you marry ramsay youyou are not likely to find a better fellow or one whomyou like better why not marry him instead of darning his underclothes on the sly he pointed to the workbasket my duty as a matron she began flushing gloriously that will be cold comfort byandby he replied kindly your duty as mater would be more satisfying helen held her breath for a moment then it exhaled in a little childless sigh that is true ned she said quietly but when a woman knows what love is she cannot give herself without it and love comes but once to a woman at any rate it will only come once to me i wonder said ned reflectively what womanhood would be like if one were to pound down every one who possessed it in a mortar and fashioned them afresh well i am offfor six months where i will say india this time he replied cheerfully then my letters can be forwarded to algiersbut this he added seeing her remonstrant facei will leave my address with my agents so you can write through them if anything is wantedbut it wont be wanted the world gets on as well without me as i get on without the world he went round afterwards to the secretarys office how much capital do you think they would require to run that factory on cooperative lines he asked woods shook his head moremore than you ought to afford lord blackborough he replied evasively i cant keep the expenses down as i should wish even here have you enough to go on with plentybut then work out a scheme please for the other and have it ready against my return andand stop a bit there is a place in walesill write it downcoming in to the market before long buy it in furniture and all and if the woman who is in chargemarthas her namewants to stop onlet her stop i am off toto indiafor six months chapter xxiii did ned blackborough go to india seeking dreams at the feet of some entranced immobile ascetic hidden away even from the sunshine of the world under the shade of the botree did he go to algiers and seek for them in the desert among the pathless dunes where every step is covered by the eternallyrestless eternallyrecurring windwriting of the sand ripples or remaining closer at hand did he in some remote cornish village seek to hear the secret of dreams that is told unceasingly in the roar and the hush of the sea or on the eternal snows which dominate all europe in its hurry and its hunt for gold which look out with cold eyes on its civilisation its culture its crime did he find what he sought hemmed in by calm glaciers frozen icebound the one would have served his purpose quite as well as another that being the putting in of time in a manner which did not offend his sensibilities for as he told himself often he was fast becoming a crank the world as it was did not amuse him very much it seemed to him hopelessly vulgar even in its highest ideals for individual success and individual culture wherever he went and as to that none but himself knew he returned as usual punctual to a day it was early october therefore when a little thinner considerably browner he found himself walking down accacia road west blackborough looking for no that being the address where he was told the cruttendens lived he was going to see if aura was happy viewed from the outside this appeared unlikely for accacia road was not so to speak exhilarating though it was broad and open enough with the usual wide asphalt pavement at either side and a rather newlooking wellswept road all too large apparently for the requirements of the sparsewheeled traffic in the middle possibly the inhabitants of the desirable residences many of which were still to let had contemplated being carriage people and had failed of their intention as it was it had a distinctly desolate air at intervals of some thirty feet upon the pavement stood little pollarded limetrees each apparently glued to and supported by yardwide gratings of cast iron encircled by the mystic legend blackborough municipal board the trees stood on their iron bases firmly just as the greenshaving ones in the boxes of dutch toys do on their wooden roundels and ned felt impelled by a desire to lift one up and set it down again skewfashion just out of the straight line so as to break the interminable regularity which made him feel as if he must go on and on to the very end and where that might be only heaven knew beyond mortal sight anyhow then mercifully the very quaintness of that iron prisonwindow of a grating between root and leaf drew his thoughts away at a tangent and he became immersed in an imaginary argument between them between the whitefeeling fibrelet down in the darkness of earth mothers breast the small sightless seeker supplying the leaves with all things and clamouring in return for the whisper of blue skies fresh breezes singing birds and the smokedimmed foliage which had no tale to tell save of smuts tradesmens carts electric trams and babies perambulators it was the number on one of the gates uniform in size structure and colourwhich occurred like the gratings at regular intervalsthat made him pause at last and look curiously at the house beyond it impossible it was frankly impossible that aura living there could be happy although no doubt it was what is called by auctioneers a most superior and desirable family residence semidetached it had a carriage sweep belonging to both houses which trended away from a gate with no fernlea upon it past one bowwindow one front door two bow windows another front door and a final bowwindow to the further gate with its no heatherdale which was superfluous the number or the name there was a butchers trundle with hogg upon it in gold letters standing at one gate a butchers trundle with slogg upon it at the other and as ned blackborough turned in two butcher boys each with flat baskets on their blue linen arms passed out from the little narrow green latticework doors which filled up the space between fernlea on the one side and heatherdale on the other and the high garden walls which separated each couple of superior residences from their neighbouring couples the boys took no notice of each other being dignified rivals how could aura be happy thought ned in an environment where the only possibility of differentiating yourself from your neighbour was by employing slogg instead of hogg the door was opened to him by what is called a superior houseparlourmaid a young person of lofty manners frizzed hair and much starch wot nyme she asked superciliously lord blackborough sudden awe left her hardly any voice for the necessary announcement and she fled back precipitately to the kitchen cookie she exclaimed sinking into a chair did you ever lord blackborough im as owns half the town an is as rich as crees iswhoever crees may beis in the parlorsuch a real gent to look at too and that aint all missus called im ned its for all the world like that lovely tale in the penny cupid i was reading last night in bed only he was a hearl her pert eyes grew tender she sighed did she now said cookie a lazylooking fat lump of a girl much of the same type poor master an he if you like is a goodlookin fellar but i always did say she wasnt no lady she havent any lace on her underclothesat least none to speak of meanwhile after her first glad incredulous cry of ned aura had hastily thrust away her work and risen as she came forward a world of welcome in her face in her outstretched hands ned blackborough realised by his swift sense of disappointment how muchdespite his own asseverations to the contraryhe had counted on unhappiness truly women were kittle cattle truly it was ill prophesying for the feminine sex she was happy radiantly happy her face if thinner was infinitely more vivid if less beautiful in a way it was far more alive it was this which struck himthe vitality of itits firm grip on lifeits almost exuberant power it seemed to him as if two souls two minds two hearts looked out at him from her eyes he was no fool he understood the position in a moment he knew that love was worsted so you are quite happy he said still holding her hand happy she echoed oh ned i have never been so happy in all my lifeeverything seems so new everything seems to go on and on for ever as if there was no end to interest and pleasure i am glad he said lamely then added i shouldnt have thought she followed his eyes which had wandered to an electric blue paper covered with gigantic poppies of a deeper hue with a frieze in which positively brobdingnagian flowers presumably of the same species curled themselves in contortions terribly suggestive of a bad pain in their insides yea isnt it awful she admitted with a laugh but i have taken all the furniture you see out of this room and stuffed it away in another empty one for the presentan odd shy smile showed on her face and seating herself on a stool once more she took up her work again and recommenced tucking a piece of muslin with newborn skill for in the old days she had never touched a needle and it isnt quite so bad here at the back where one cant see people but i wish my poor primroses would grow i got them in a wood not so very far away but the cats wont give them a chancethey scratch them up at night poor things her eyes were sorrowfully on the parallelogram of grass gravel and smutblackened stems below the flight of grimy steps which was described in the houseagents list as a charming garden if it happens again i shall take them back it is never fair to keep anything where it cant grow properly exactly so he thought but her face showed absolute unconsciousness what do you find to do with yourself he asked suddenly he felt he would go mad in a week doshe smiled why i never have half enough time you see we cant afford to keep experienced servants as yet this house is really beyond our income but my husbandted i meanwas afraid i should not thrive in the town it is very good of him isnt it to go to such expense for me very assented lord blackborough recognising teds phraseology and feeling bored so i have to do most of the cooking she went on quite eagerly it is rather fun though ted is quite awfully particular about his food but he says i am getting quite aa cordon bleuethats right isnt it quite right assented ned gravely he was beginning to wonder how he should get away from this atmosphere of satisfaction and then she went on and whether she smiled or was grave he could not tell for her face was bent over her work i have so much to think ofyou cannot know how much sometimes i feel as if somehow the whole world was bound up in me for the life of him he could not help a thrill in answer to the thrill of her voice so he sat looking at her sewing garments for another mans child until his heart waxed hot and he said has it never struck you aura that all this isjust a little rough on me she looked up at him her beautiful eyes twin stars of mysterious double life brimming with swift tears youyou shall be its godfather she said softly he could have cursed he could have laughed he could have cried over the pure ridiculousness of the reply but the pure motherhood in her eyes was too much for him the earth is the lords and the fulness thereof the phrase came back to his memory reproving his individualism setting aside all other claims as trivial well he said rising as he spoke there is nothing more to be said sohaving found you happyi must be going going she echoed incredulously oh no you must stop and see ted it is saturday and he is always home by three you might stop and come with us to chorley hill we go there every week because i like it you can see the welsh mountains quite distinctly if it is clear her eyes were clear anyhow she was her old self again in her eagerness the girl free unfettered in every way who had tramped those welsh mountains with him so often he could see her with the wind blowing amongst her bronze uncovered curls billowing amongst the folds of her white linen overall why did she wear black now to save the washing bills he expected and she spent her life chiefly no doubt in buying a herring and a half for three halfpence she who had never seen a sixpence a flood of annoyed pity swept through him at the needlessness of the desecration rousing his antagonism once more as it is just on three now he replied ill stop and see him anyhow it might be wiser he felt it would be a thing got over which after the abruptness of their last parting was desirable though on the whole he was inclined to have done with it all to congratulate ted on his success and renounce all claim on a woman who had evidently forgotten love in motherhoodand housekeeping he felt very bitter though the question as to whether she could be more content forced itself upon him rudely there he is cried aura joyfully as in the jerrybuilt house the grating noise of a latchkey in the front lock became distinctly audible at the back ill run and tell him you are here and then i can change my dress before we start it was on the whole a relief that they twomen who were rivalsshould meet without the cause of the rivalry being present also though magnanimity was the only card to play what else was possible when you could distinctly hear the cause of rivalry being kissed in the hall ned blackborough therefore was frankness itself how are you ted i wont say im glad but i do find aura very well and very happysoso that ends it i suppose ted who was also looking the picture of health and happiness flushed up with pleasure and gripped lord blackboroughs hand effusively upon my soul ned he cried you are just an awfully good sortone of the best fellows living and i feel ive been a bit of a beast only you dont know how the thought that we should have fallen out over this thing has worried me it is real good to have you back again and she is happy isnt shebless her heart though why she should have kept you in this horrid bare room at the back i cant think come into the drawingroom old man it is something like but it isnt a bad house is it far too expensive of course but afloat on finance teds conscious virtue overflowed like a cold douche on neds patience which had almost succumbed under explanations that after all he was getting along but that it was saferespecially with expenses aheadto have a wide margin when aura reappeared she was wearing the white coat and skirt the brown tamoshanter in which she had gone to plas afon ned used often to say that in his last incarnation he must either have been a woman or a man milliner now he recognised without effort that not only had aura knotted the mechlin scarf about her neck but that she also carried the sables over her arm so she also remembered the fact decided him in an instant let me take those he said coolly she looked conscious as she gave up the furs and remarked hurriedly we can walk there ted but we might return by the fivethirty train from elsham then ill wire for the motor to meet me there replied ned it is only six miles to new park and there is no object in my going round by blackborough again besides there is always a wait at the junction it seemed to him an interminable time before they left the lingering outskirts of the town behind them and even when the last bowwindow and gable tailed down into the original foursquare cottage the country about was still grimeclad smutbound but aura did not appear to notice it in her eyes sat eternal hope eternal spring which finds the old world good even when they sat finally on the sandset bit of common interspersed with straggly heath and unkempt gorse which was all the nature that chorley hill boasted she did not seem to see the copious orange peel the screws of sandwich paper which to neds fastidiousness made the place horrible her eyes were on the distances where the welsh hills showed blue how i would love to see cwmfaernog again she said suddenly you know of course the poor place had to be sold ted very nearly had to pay lord blackborough cut short her repetition but he didnt he remarked for i bought it you bought it she echoed incredulously ted never told me that she glanced to her husband who flat on the sand with his hat over his eyes was apparently asleep in the sunshine the attitude discovered the fact that six months of happy married lifeand no doubt auras cookinghad made him perceptibly larger in the waist he was evidently following mr hirschs example thought ned though he might like other folk have grown leaner upon grief for ned happily had not lost the faculty of mocking at his own troubles i wonder why he never told me said aura vaguely vexed making nedlike the fool that he was he told himselfinstant in excuse he didnt know i expect my agent bought it for me yes there it is with martha and adamyou know they are married aura laughed yes i had a letter from martha saying she was agreeably disappointed with her lot that is what i am too she paused i should love to go there again will you take me some day perhaps he replied soberly while his pulses bounded may would be the best month for me she said dreamily besides there are the wild hyacinthsthey are like the floor of heaven the floor of heaven what vague memory was it that woke with those words a blue sea a ripple on a boats side then ted woke also clamouring for tea they had it at a little inn and were very merry only after a time the conversation always seemed to drift away towards something to eat or something to buy it is always the herring or the penny which had to be paid for it that was teds fault the sum of his life seemed to be made up of duodecimal fractions we shall have to foot it a bit if we are to catch the train said ted gaily as they started hold on to me aura its a bit slippery down the hill so with his arm tucked into hers and ned on the other side they made their way talking and laughing before long however the talk resolved itself into an argument between the two men ted defending the action of a certain company ned stigmatising it as a swindle the short cut over the watermeadow aura said ted interrupting himself she is signalled and it will save time he drew back as he spoke to let her cross the plankbridge which spanned the ditch and to clinch his point i maintain he went on that the prospectus was as fair as any prospectus can be for one is bound to put on rosecoloured spectacles in writing one or the thing wont catch on men who have money to invest ought to know take care cried ned who was watching aura but he was an instant too late there was a tiny piece of orange peel on the plankthe rest of it lay amongst the watercresses in the ditchher foot slipped on it and she caught at the handrailing to steady herself so wrenching herself round by a strong effort to avoid dropping feet foremost into the mud it was quite a small affair but the shock of it left her colourless half on half off the plank my dearest cried ted in a fearful fuss you arent not a bit she interrupted gaily give me your hand up please but there was a scared frightened look in her eyes and five minutes afterwards as they were hurrying on she slackened speed we havent over much time my dear said ted grudgingly she looked at him almost with reproach i suppose it is falling so so suddenly she began ted interrupted lord blackborough i believe id better take your wife back in the motor sorry i cant take you but it is only the little de dion if you run for it youll just get it we shall be home before you will with that wait at the junction you dont mind do you darling asked ted solicitously five minutes afterwards he waved his handkerchief from the train at them as they made their way leisurely across the watermeadow you will be home in half an hour and have a good rest said ned consolingly as those beautiful eyes with the eternal hope in them looked into his with that vague dread growing to them yes she said cheerfully it was only the start but ten minutes later in the car she laid her hand suddenly on neds as it held the steering gear oh ned she said imim so afraid her voice was an appeal and he bent hastily to kiss the hand which clung to his as it would have clung to any human being cheer up he said huskily nothings going to go wrong ill have you home in no time so let me steer straight will you the little car swept along at top speed she sat still her face drawn and pale her hands holding hard to the white folds of her dress twelve miles at least allowing for speed limits through the town and new park close at hand just in fact round the corner he made the calculation rapidly and began to sound the hooter i shall take you in here he said decisively and telephone to ted then when youve had a good rest you can go home the gates set wide open at his signalling slipped past in the growing dusk a rabbit or two showed nimble across the smooth surface of the drive it will be best perhaps said aura with a catch in her breath of course it will be best he replied cheerfully as he drew up in the wide portico the housekeeper please he called glad for once of the decorous hurry of obedience take mrs cruttenden if you please mrs adgers and let her rest for a little he said to the dignified lady who appeared as if by magic then only waiting to add in a lower voice and look after her you understand he was in the car again before it had had time to run down and was off over a short cut to st helenas hospital which lay on the hill about three miles off thence he returned in twenty minutes with sister ann leaving dr ramsay to follow more leisurely finally having sent the car in charge of a chauffeur to bring ted along he sat in the library and smoked feeling half derisive at the irony of fate if he had indeed been auras husband and the father of this coming child what more could he have done dr ramsay arrived cool and collected and went upstairs ted arrived in a terrible state of fuss and also went upstairs then the house reverted to its usual staid routine the gong sounded at dressingtime and clad in due decorum ned dined alone in the huge red diningroom which looked like a big mouth ready to swallow him up the footman overlooked by the butler handed him the courses gravely the butler filled his glass with pomeroy ned had not asked for it this time but it was considered the proper thing with sudden and serious illness in the house and all the while he was thinking how little life and death would affect him if all these things could be swept away and he be indeed nothing more than carlyles forked radish with a consciousness then he smoked and read again till ten oclock when the footman overlooked by the butler brought the whisky and water into the library and dr ramsay came with it i shall want help he said but i dont want to alarm himher husband she is as brave as possible but heso i thought you whom do you want asked ned going to the telephone dr ramsay named a london specialist and ned looked up quickly as bad as that he asked as bad as it can be im afraid replied the doctor after the specialist had been summoned and duly bribed there was nothing to do but sit and smoke again since the memory of those beautiful eyes with the eternal hope of the worlds immortality in them haunted him beyond the cure of sleep if he had been her husband could he have done more could he have felt more the london man arrived about one oclock and ned after the slight bustle of his coming and going upstairs heard no more noise the house seemed to settle down into the usual silence of night what was going on upstairs would she pass into the unseen would she settle the question once and for all it was just as the red october sunrise was beginning to glow through the trees of the park that ned standing at the window to watch it heard the click of the door handle behind him and turned to see the london doctor a tall man with eyeglasses and a stoop well he said eagerly how is she as well as canahahbe expected said the specialist who appeared to be afflicted with a stammer after such a very seriousahahoperation asahahwas necessary to save thethethe interesting patients life butahahdv it is saved andand i need hardly say wewe have every reason to be thankful even though the future is or may beof course here dr ramsay entered the room and he turned to him i was just preparing mr cruttenden for theahpossibility this is lord blackborough sir interrupted peter ramsay impatiently i told you i had given mr cruttenden a sleeping draught after the immediate danger to life was over mrs cruttenden was brought to lord blackboroughs house just after the accident now sir if you are in a hurry they are ready to take you to the station just soah murmured the great man a trifle confused very pleased to make your acquaintance my lord thanks doctorah ramsay said the latter carrying him off still blandly stuttering when peter ramsay returned he found ned looking at the sunrise once more the whole sky was growing red the daylight was outpaling the lamp beside which ned had watched for this dawn suddenly he spoke is it worth while i wonder saving lifesometimes considering what motherhood means to some women i doubt it and then without another word he turned from the window and sitting down at the writingtable rested his head on his hand and stared out vacantly into the room seeing nothing but those beautiful eyes twin stars of two souls those eyes that were never to be satisfied no it was not worth it then he glanced round at the doctor who stood professionally silent ill give you a piece of advice he said and then well drop the subject if you have anything to say tell her not him you will make it easier for her i expect than he will chapter xxiv we refuse your terms your lordship said the leader of the deputation outside the managers office where the meeting of delegates was being held the works of the biggie factory lay deserted in the autumn sunlight there was no sign of harvest there for man or beast the huge engines seemed asleep the tall factory chimney showed a cenotaph proclaiming a dead life here and there among the rows of workmens houses were knots of men despondently expectant a shrill woman or two voiced her wrongs aggressively the children in the gutter looked dirty unkempt pale lord blackborough stared steadily at the speaker then you hold that i am bound to start these works again despite the fact that they have been running at a loss for some years and you hold also that i am bound to give you a rise in wages the men in these works cannot accept a less wage than that received in others which excuse me being better managed pay their owners wellfar too well replied mr green he was a singularly ablelooking man curiously taut and trim in words speech manner apparently in soul then i am not only to receive no return on my capital but i am to spend other capital in paying you until germany ceases to make our goods cheaper than we can is this fair asked lord blackborough quite fair your lordship replied the leader if only because the capital you own has been wrung unjustly from usfrom labour all capital must be as you call it wrung from labour it does not create itself i offer you this capital at a very low rate of interest one and a half per cent if labour cannot hope to make even so much over and above livelihood that seems an end to any enlargement of trade there was a pause then lord blackborough smiled i cannot complain if the figures before you make you hesitate for to me they are convincing let us therefore pass over that offer my next is one to reopen the works but on a different system an eighthours day piecework and no limitations of tradesunions or any other organisation regarding the outrun of any individual a faint stir could be heard amongst some of the older men but mr green still stood spokesman that is absolutely out of the question your lordship he said decisively we are all of us tradesunion men labour must reserve to itself the right to legislate for the general good of the labourer if it does not who will no one his tone grew bitter we have no right to accept a form of payment which will not give a living wage to to the weakest to the bad workmen the laziest the most drunken put in lord blackborough personally i do not see any reason at all why that class of worker should continue to live you only have to level down to them but i am not here to combat your views only to receive your ultimatum you refuse mr green brought his hand down on the table with dramatic force in the name of labour we refuse the unjust iniquitous thank you said lord blackborough urbanely then turned to the secretary mr woods have you those documents ready they are here your lordship ned blackborough threw off his gravity and holding the papers given him in his hand smiled round the company which as if moved thereto by some magic in his manner rose also mr green looked from one to the other what had this tyrannical employer of labour up his sleeve men said the employer of labour frankly i am going to pay you with these he waved the papers for listening to me for five minutes labour they say is dissociating itself from capital capital from labour that may be so i have nothing to do with that personally i have money i have no work i dont want money and i do want work that is my position but what i do see here in this england of ours is that labour is dissociating itself from work it is labouring all day and bringing forthas little as it can it claims the right to do this little well let it if it likes but why should it deny to any man the right to work at the rate of which he was born physically capable why should it make a swift worker take eight hours to do what he can do in four if i were to put any one of you on oath you would admit that it is far harder work to dawdle through eight hours than to work through eight hours ive seen many bricklayers painters plasterers lately hard put to it how to eke out the time and yet preserve an air of occupation and i have no doubt you have most of you felt this now think what this means it is labour hard labour this the enslavement of free work neither body nor mind gain full exercise muscles and brain decay the type goes down but this is the system of the day we begin it in school where we let children dawdle eleven years over what they ought to learn in half the time it greets the boy in his first workshopit dogs his footsteps everywhere turning work into labour work isis play labour isis the devil what beats me is this why instead of slaving and dawdling shouldnt the good workman classed together of course be allowed to work say four hours and then go their way it would give us some chance of breeding a type of englishman that is now fast dying out that soon must pass away altogether men dont be fools men dont be slaves that is all i have to say now for the payment this is a free deed of gift of these works made out with a few necessary legal restrictions in the name of you delegates to be held in trust for the workers therein and this is a cheque for the capital necessary to work it for six months i have already signed both i was so certain you see that your friend and leader mr green would reject my other very reasonable proposals that i came prepared will you take them mr green my solicitor is here and you can arrange with him my part is done am i to understand almost gasped mr green lord blackboroughs face sharpened to the keenest edge of contempt yes you are to understand sir that tired of being abused up hill and down dale in your organs for behaving like a sensible man i am behaving like a fool well men labour and capital have for once met and kissed each other see that they dont fall out again mr green stood with the papers in his hand for a second then he flung them on the table you fling our own money to us as if we were dogs he began hotly dogs echoed ned blackborough in the same tone i would far liefer give it to the dogs than to youyou men who will have the handling of it it is you who starved those poor children not i their fathers could keep them in comfort for fiveandtwenty shillings a week you made them stand for out sixandtwentyas if it matteredas if money physical comfort even freedom counted for anything in a mans search for happiness that he pulled himself up quivering feeling the uselessness of speech come woods he said it is time i left this temple of mammon goodday gentlemen that is a clear waste of a hundred thousand pounds mourned mr woods as they crossed the courtyard you cant get beyond human nature my lord each man will naturally go for that gold the cleverest of them will get it and so capital will rearise out of its own ashes you must begin further downwith the children set up a school eh woods in which they would be taught the truththat work and play are merely interchangeable terms for occupation hullo whats up a small crowd of women mostly carrying babies but a few of them carrying baskets stood at the gates blocking the way beyond them waited the motorcar the chauffeur standing at the crank ready to start ned blackborough walked on until he nearly touched the first woman she was better dressed than the rest but who for all that had a coarse violent face do you want anything he asked quietly if you dont you might let me pass do we want she began in a rhetorical voice yes we want the bread you have stole from our children why not give them some of your husbands dinner he replied pointing to her basket on the top of which lay several knives and forks there was a titter for she was in truth carrying refreshment for mr green and his colleagues she flushed scarlet my husband she echoed yes where is the money you have stole from our husbands but youll find that we arent slaves like the ones you drove in the indies before you were kicked out the british workpeople are not to be treated like black niggers or chinese coolies good god woman cried ned losing patience if you have nothing better to say than to trump up the last scurrilous article in the taskmasterhere woods follow onim not going to be stopped in an instant they were the centre of a band of excited women the next they were in the car and the chauffeur was running back to take his seat i dont want to hurt you called ned as he turned on power but if some of you dont stand back there will be an accident cowards fools dont let him go without an answer shrieked the woman with the basket who was entangled two deep in the backward rush the next moment there very nearly was an accident since failing of all else the angry orator flung the first thing she could lay her hands uponthe handful of knives and forksat the car with her full force and one of the missiles a threepronged iron fork buried itself in the fleshy part of neds right hand as it held the steerer making him and it swerve the fork quivered as he steadied the wheel then he turned and raised his hat with his other hand thank you he said and the word fell on a halfawed halfalarmed silence she didnt mean to do it began woods hurriedly shall i pull it out my lord of course she didnt replied ned coolly if she had meant to do it she would have killed a baby that sort of woman is built that way wait a bit woods till we are through the works i look like a blessed st sebastian with it quivering in my flesh you ought to have that seen to said little woods when the surgical operation was over and they had had to call on the chauffeurs handkerchief as well as their own it has gone very deep ill get ramsay to tie it up properly we can go back by egworth replied lord blackborough they met peter ramsay on the steps carrying a leathern instrumentbag come along to my room he said cheerfully ive everything i want in here as they opened the door a womans figure rose hurriedly from an evidently searching inquiry into the contents of a bottom drawer for undervests and stockings lay strewn about both helen tressilian and dr ramsay blushed scarlet but neds eyes twinkled caught in the act my dear caught in the act he said amusedly i thoughti hopedhe had gone out for a long while on an urgent call retorted mrs tressilian looking quite viciously at the doctor who to hide his vexation was searching in his bag i am sorry i disappointed your expectations mrs tressilian he said stiffly but when i arrived i was not wanted the man was dead helen looked as if she had received a blow in the face her lip quivered undo these rags will you said ned to her kindly wishing in his heart that he could take them and shake them together once and for all i havent much time to lose she had forgotten her annoyance in sympathy when dr ramsay looked up from his task im afraid i shall have to hurt you a bit i dont like those very deep holes possibly from a dirty fork it wasnt very clean admitted ned perhaps i had better call sister ann began the doctor doubtfully and helen flushed up in a second i have done some work of the kind dr ramsay she said but if you prefer the challenge was too direct if you do not mind i shall be glad he replied bending over a little array of instruments on the table will you stand here lord blackborough hold the hand so nurse helen and be ready please with the carbolised gauze halfway through ned winced and the doctor said sharply that was my fault move your hand a little nurse helen it gets in my way there thats done he continued at last now for the bandages was it only fancy or was ned blackborough right in thinking that the supple skilful hands were not quite so skilful as usual that there was an unwonted nervousness about them he pondered over this as being hurried he went downstairs leaving helen tidying up peter ramsay sterilising his instruments before putting them away he left behind him also a sense of stress in the air a feeling on the part of both those busy people that things could no longer go on as they had been going on suddenly peter ramsay flung aside a probe and walked up to helen decisively helen he said i shall have to go away if you wont marry me think me as much a fool as you likethe fact remains you sawyou must have seen how disgracefully i did that simple little thing why because you were therebecause your hand touched mine i will never offer to interfere with your work again she said coldly interfere he echoed with a bitter little laugh you always interfere i feel the very touch of your hands upon my clothes a slow crimson stained her very forehead i am sorry i will never touch them again that will do no good he replied gloomily can you not see that your influence touches my life at every point when i go through the wards i hear you have just passed i almost see the flutter of your dress i am always reminded i am always thinking of you if you will not marry me i must go away i cannot marry you and i have told you why it is not as though i did not know what love meant i have known it andand i do not know it now but you need not go away i will go that you shall not do he replied his chin setting itself long and stern besides it would be no good this place is redolent of youyour goodness your sweetness oh helen helen if you will only marry me love will comefor you like mei dont believe there is any one you like betterexcept perhaps ned blackborough ned she echoed glad of evasion poor ned i have had such a curious feeling lately that he is in some way maimed and yet not maimed i dont know how to express it but he seems to me to be using his soul more and his body less i wish i could get rid of my body muttered dr ramsay so quaintly that helen perforce had to smile whereat he said aggrievedly it isnt all that either mrs tressilian love she checked him with a soft sympathising hand do i not know what love is dr ramsay i cannot pity you then i shall have to go he said obstinately i will not have my work spoiled by any woman she felt small somehow a trifle remorseful perhaps as she left the room he certainly had been rather dejected of late and it was such a pity and ned also he was not dejected but he was changed curiously changed in truth the past six weeks since the night when he had outwatched the stars to be met in the dawn by the mischance of a confidence not intended for his ears had changed him a great deal he had not seen aura since he had purposely left new park before she was well enough to receive visitors and had only returned to it after she had been moved for a freshening up at the seaside but he had heard of her constantly from ted who after two or three days of intense anxiety had gone back to business with renewed zest this time interruption had apparently been beneficial at least the first few days of auras convalescence and disappointment had been cheered by him with the most sanguine of outlooks on the future he even went so far as to say that perhaps after all things were best as they were they would move into a still better house and be able to set up properly before taking upon themselves the responsibilities of life aura had said perhaps and after he had gone had lain and cried softly to herself there is nothing in the wide world so sacred to a woman as her grief for the child which has died to save her life it is grief of the most inward type unknown unrecognised by others which lasts through the years and grows no slighter than it was when in the dim between life and death she first learns that her child has paid the ransom for her in a way therefore the doubt which by degrees grew into a certainty that fate had denied motherhood to her had at first almost brought her comfort if there was no probability of her being more fortunate in the future happiness neither awaited her nor could there be any rivalry between the dead child and a living one there was a tragedy in both lives not only in the one such thoughts as these aided by the very intensity of her grief kept her going until she began to face the world again at the seaside then came one of those fiery furnaces of the soul through which so few pass unscathed she used to wander down at the ebb low tide past the groups of children building castles in the sand past the uttermost outermost little waving fringe of seaspoil left but for a brief half hour by the regretful retreat of the waves and gaze out over the long low sandbanks claimed as their own by clouds of fluttering settling fluttering seagulls the tide had truly ebbedthe mudflats of life lay bare her thoughts were like the gulls never still for a second only in the slack tide of the estuary there was rest for a moment and the long brown arms of the seaweed waved sleepily seeming to call her to rest with them so she would go back again to her lodgings but in the night time she would rise and draw up her blind and look out and lo the tide was up again the sea lay like a sheet of silver and there was no more land neither was there any sound of tears thus after a time she came back to the new house on which ted during her absence had been lavishing enough money he felt to prove his undying affection twice over he was quite full of its many advantages when she finally arrived there for one thing they would be able to entertain in it and entertainments would be a great feature in his coming life one of the chief reasons for mr hirschs enormous success had been his genius for giving recherche dinners ted could not hope to rival him still with the cordon bleues helphere he became exceedingly affectionatemuch was possible they must certainly entertain mr hirsch and his daughter oh yes had not aura heard of the daughter mr hirsch had imported her readymade grownupreally a very nicelooking girlfrom berlin she was about twenty and no one had had any idea hirsch was a widower but he seemed devoted to the girl and to have given up the search for a wife which had been his pursuit for years the fact of the matter being though ted did not know it that having failed once more in his endeavours to marry a wellconnected englishwoman mr hirsch had fallen back on a less legal establishment of his youth for which he had always paid with scrupulous honour hence miss hirsch who being a goodnatured creature like her father bid fair to fill up his affections and give him the home for which as he grew older he was beginning to yearn anyhow mr and miss hirsch would have to be entertained when they came to blackborough and aura should have the long talkedof pink satin gown in which to receive them it might even be possible to put them up there were two good rooms on the first floor which would not be wanted yet awhile aura might see them after she had had her tea thanks ted she replied hurriedly butbut perhaps ive done enough for today i can see them tomorrow just those few minutes of facing the new house the new life had wearied her absolutely and she had other things to face in the near future sooner or later she felt that she ought to tell her husband that those rooms would never in all human probability be wanted but she could not tell him now that was beyond her strength chapter xxv mrs edward cruttenden requests the pleasure of lord blackboroughs company at dinner it was a printed card and ned blackborough laid it down on the table feeling that the world was getting beyond him this was about a week or so after auras return and he had intended to call on her that very afternoon now he refrained i am so sorry we had to give you such short notice said ted whom he met in the street next day but the hirschs were coming down unexpectedly and it had to be hurried i hope you can come oh i am coming all right said ned a trifle surlily i hope it wont be too much for aura ted looked at him with immense surprise my dear fellow aura is as well as she can be and awfully interested in it well im glad you can come youll like miss hirsch shes charming so fresh and gay it was a real parlourmaid who announced lord blackborough this time and he saw a furtive greengrocer in the background otherwise the house seemed to him much the same only larger more pretentious the drawingroom was distinctly morewhat was the word chaste yes distinctly more chaste it was white and gold and was that aura in a pink satin dressye heavens above in pink satin she did not look ill but as their eyes met he was conscious of a distinct shock there was something wanting in them the best part of her was not there where was it the question absorbed him even while he was being presented to miss hirsch a jolly handsome rather stout girl alsoas the fates would have itin pink satin but she was literally ablaze with diamonds aha my old friend blackborough laughed mr hirsch explosively this is good sight for sore eyes make me your compliments for my daughter sir i prefer to make them to miss hirsch herself replied ned gallantly and then they went in to dinner it was an excellent repast ted had evidently pursued the only course consonant with success he had ordered it direct from benoists and kept the minions of the great caterer out of evidence iced mellon gave place to consomme biscuit truite a laurore to filets financieres poularde casserole to something else until at the end the conversation became interspersed with cigarettes and coffee it was an enormous success and all the time ned blackborough was wondering what had become of aura whither she had gone only once did he get a glimpse of what he had known in the past and that was when after miss hirsch had sung like a secondclass professional in other words like her mother to his accompaniment he had asked aura if he might not accompany her also my dear blackborough ted had exclaimed after such singing as miss hirsch has just given us im sure my wife would hardly like but i should like he had interrupted imperturbably then it was that aura had said swiftly in an undertone please dont he had obeyed as he had obeyed the same order once before but that night he sat up again and drank whisky and water and smoked opiumsodden cigarettes and the next day he went down to call for he did not intend that sort of thing should go on she did not intend it should either he found her in the back garden which was really quite of a decent size busy planting something between the prim privets and eunonyms and variegated hollies which even in this late autumn gave the wallsurrounding shrubbery a semblance of green do you know what i am planting she asked frankly i am planting some iris alata he narrowed his eyes and looked at her hardly in the most beautiful place in the world he said cynically that wont make them any the less beautiful she replied and then suddenly her whole face melted her eyes shone with tears with smiles with happiness regrets with fair passions and bountiful pities and love without stain oh ned ned she cried holding out her hand to him again i have to beg your pardon for so muchi have to thank you for so muchwhich shall i do first what could he do save take her hand as frankly as it was given and say neither since between them he knew there was no possibility of gratitude no possibility of forgiveness so they began to talk not of her illness or of these later days at all but of cwmfaernog and plas afon and how she had found the snakestone under the old yewtree i always wear it you know at least i do nowadays she said and drawing up her loose sleeve showed it to him worn as an amulet warm against the fair whiteness of her skin his heart gave a throb for all her courage then she was not happy such trifles tell of a search for support then ted came in breezy and full of life it had been a success last night had it not the pink satin had not suited aura quite so well as he had hoped not so well as it had suited miss hirsch who had looked ripping perhaps it ought to have been blue or perhaps it was the diamonds that did the trick had any one ever seen better diamonds than miss hirschs anyhow it had been a great success and they must give some more dinnerparties and get into the way of entertaining aura might ask mrs tressilian and dr ramsay as a beginning you wont get ramsay remarked ned blackborough he is away in vienna he has taken three months leave but he put in a very good man for the time in truth st helenas hospital was as peter ramsay had declared it would getting on quite as well without him as it did with him the only person who was dissatisfied with the new state of affairs was helen tressilian and she was frankly in a very bad temper both with him and with herself it was so foolish of him had she not known it would be absolutely useless she would have sent in her own resignation but what good would it have done it would only have made matters worse since he would never return if she went all she could do was to hope very sincerely that the three months change would effect its object and that he would forget her and yet even this did not quite soothe her irritation even this was not quite what she wanted what did she want she was taking herself severely to task one afternoon when sister ann came in looking grave i have just had a letter with some rather bad news in it she said i hope it isnt true but it sounds serious it is from my friend who i told you had gone to study at vienna helens heart leapt to her mouth well she said impatiently wondering the while with a sudden feeling of dread why she should feel so disturbed ill read you what he says we are all a bit downhearted just now because ramsay who is one of the nicest fellows who ever lived is ill with pyaemia it would be a thousand pities if he were to go out for he is quite the best operator here of course he is being well looked after but it must be awful away from all ones friends helen went deadly white do you think it is true she asked almost helplessly sister ann refolded the letter methodically it must be true of course and it is not unlikely you know he was always a trifle reckless when there was anything to be done even here one can only hope he is not so very bad you will send a wire i suppose yes replied helen of course we will send a wireandyes i will send a wire i think it is terribly sad said sister ann for all her invariable cheerfulness quite mournfully apart from his immense value to the world he was such a dear soul in so many ways i have often thought what an excellent husband and father he would have made after she had gone to tell the news presumably in that even tone of voice helen thought with a rush of resentment the latter sat in a perfect tumult of emotion anger pity regret all fought for first place what right for instance had sister ann to use the past tense in speaking of dr ramsay he was not dead dead impossible incredible it could not it must not be true but what good would a wire be to a man lying perhaps unconscious at any rate alone she stood up pushing her hair back from her forehead a great wave of pity for him but more for herself overcame her she stared out of the room scarcely seeing what was before her just on the opposite side of the room a long pier glass filled up the space between the two tall windows it was growing dusk and the mirror showed dark and empty looking against the light no not quite empty there was a figure in it going away from her into the darkness it was the figure of a man making haste it hurried on its back towards her down an interminable pathway that was lost in the shadows it was going oh so fast and she recognized it it was peter ramsay as she had last seen him hurrying away to catch his train it grew smaller and smaller it overtook the shadows they gathered it in no no she cried aloud dont godon t go was there a pause she could not tell the vision vanished and she was left to the knowledge that she had once more almost overstepped the bounds of the unseen and to a dim sense of something unsuspected in herself one thing was certain he must not go thinking she cared not at all how many hours was it to vienna that mattered very little if she started as quickly as she could she must get there sooner or later half an hour afterwards she was at the station and by midnight she was standing looking out at the stars from the deck of a channel steamer with the lights of calais ahead of her she did not regret her impulse all she thought of was that somehow that figure she had seen losing itself in the shadows must be stopped must be brought back to the light it was a wearisome journey she had left without due preparation she was all unused to foreign travelling and she did not care to forage for food for fear she might be left behind so it was rather a dejected helen tressilian who got out in the struggling daylight of a november day at the haupt bahnhof and after a while found herself driving she literally knew not whither through wide streets and narrow streets to the public hospital it was there she knew that peter ramsay was working so there she hoped to have news of him at once but she had reckoned without the formalism of german institutions at first she could hardly elicit the fact that there was such a person as a scotch physician by name ramsay in vienna for she had called him english and that error a grave one to the foreigner had seemed to discredit her altogether then who was she sister or mother if not what claim had she to be admitted to the bedside of the dangerouslysick unfriendrecognising patient she had better see the chiefheadoversuperintendent and if he consented perhaps so she drove off again disheartened the chiefheadoversuperintendent was out and after waiting for him till she grew sick and cold she determined to follow him to the medical college here she was met by more formalities to which was added a suggestion that not being a relation she should go to the british consulate and get a certificate that she was of the duerespectableandtobeadmittedfriends and then suddenly to her despair at the delay came the memory of pagenheim it was silly of her not to have thought of him before yes she would go to pagenheim he was her only hope she was shown into a room stuffed full of furniture where a florid bearded man had evidently just been smoking he sat looking with immense interest at the card she had sent in mein gott he said going on in fairly idiomatic english but your names t r e ss i l tressilian said helen impatiently tressilian now miss what does that mean trethreesilian does it mean three fools wass fur eingott in himmel you are cryinggnaedige fraulein pardon it was the truth helen worn out by her long and hungry journey disappointed driven from pillar to post had found it too much that her last hope should waste precious time in philological studies i beg your pardon she said stifling her tears but i have come all the way from england to see dr ramsay and now i cannot get at him do help me if you can dr pagenheim blew out his cheeks as if a pipe might have been a consolation to him soh youyou cannot be his motheryouyou are his sister doubtless helen behind her handkerchief shook her head ii am a nurse she said faintly and i have come on purpose but gnaedige fraulein interposed the great man becoming professional he is already nursed nursed devotedly there is no place for you i fear it is against the rules if you were a relation it were different helen looked up at him goaded to desperation butbut i am more than that dr pagenheim she said ii am engaged to be married to him the blond florid face melted into instant sentiment the tongue into german soh oh love love what dost thou not so he is betrothed and we knew it not stay is your name helen yes helen tressilian she replied liebes kind cried the great professsor he has in his delirium called for you by name dry your tears we will mend him for you surely helen ach that is an allpowerful lovecompelling nameofuttermost victory so have no fear you shall to him go so soon as i can get on my boots he stuck out a big slippered foot in explanation and encouragement as he beamed on her if i might have a glass of milk helen felt emboldened to say i havent had time somehow gott in himmel she is hungry roared the professor oh love love what dost thou not greta this to the elderly servant who answered his furious ringing milk food drink everything for this graciousbetrothedone while i put on my boots fortified by hot coffee and a roll helen being whirled through the streets of vienna in the doctors coupe felt that come what might she did not repent her hasty impulse even if peter ramsay lived thou must remember liebes kind came the professors jovial voice all softened to warning he is very ill only the good god knows how ill but we are doing our best for him the high fever has gone but the weakness remains you must be very quiet i am a nurse she said i know in a way it was only as a nurse that she had come only because she could not bear to think of him dying alone it seemed an interminable age that she sat in the coupe while dr pagenheim was preparing the hospital authorities it was quite a small place almost private a place reserved by the doctors for their most serious cases it had a conventional air and helen as she sat could see a sister of charity or two with large whitewinged caps moving about would they let her in surely dr pagenheim was powerful enough for that he came back after a time with the matron a severe looking sister with a weary face he was much graver you can see him and if you are quiet you can remain but he will not know you did he not as she entered the wide white ward empty save for the bed set in the middle the low hurried muttering from the figure which lay on it ceased for a moment it almost seemed as if the mutterer was listening then he began again too low to be intelligible even to the english ears which bent over to listen the nurses two fair simplefaced sisters looked at her with kindly compassion and curiosity he is so restless said one speaking in the low even singsong which so many nurses acquire as a kind of whisper if he could only sleep but we dare not give drugs his heart is so weak his right hand all bandaged up to the elbow lay slung in a shifting cradle just above the bedclothes his left the fingers closing and unclosing with a terrible regularity hung half over the bedside she slipped hers into it and it closed on hers tightly so tightly that after a time the blood seemed to seek a way through her fingertips the muttering became more distinct number i am not sure about number he is doing very well she replied softly sister ann is quite pleased with him the dressings were not in the least disturbed and he slept all night without drugs he is to have beeftea today the muttering had ceased the sick man lay quite still the grip of his hand was slackening and tomorrow he will have chicken and then if he will only sleep sleep sleep quite quietly sleepsleepsleep gnaedige fraulein came the nurses whisper seat yourself so there must be no movement if possible how long she sat there her hand in his she did not know long enough anyhow to feel that when or how or why she knew not the very touch of him had become dear to her for it was not only the tingling of the veins after the almost benumbing pressure of his fingers which sent the thrill to her heart and her brain he had told her the truth the past was in the present after a time he stirred swallowed a spoonful of nourishment and slept again another nurse stole into the room and whispered with the two in a corner helen could not see their calm fair untroubled faces but she could hear one word a word they had renounced for themselves which for all that sent a thrill through their woman hearts lovetrue love was it that or had she merely wrecked herself and him for something evanescent worth little helen was half asleep herself all she realised was that something had brought rest to him for the time so when the bad turn came again he was stronger but so long as she was in the room the painful restlessness never returned and day by day the dressers were more satisfied helen of troy is sufficient to bring any man back from the grave lich du liebe gott what will not the true love do beamed herr pagenheim and the nurses sighed and smiled finally there came a day when peter ramsay really opened his eyes found helen beside him and closed them again contentedly after this came cogitation so by degrees a puzzled look grew to his eyes it was awfully good of you to come and help nurse me he said weakly at last how did you find out i was ill sister ann had a letter so i came i knew you must be alone she replied sedately it must have been an awful journey for you i feel so sorry about it he continued almost impatiently you must have had a lot of trouble and then when you got herewhat beats me is why did they let you in they are so strict she felt the colour rising to her face oh i managed she said evasively now you really must take your valentines extract and go to sleep he shifted restlessly how can i go to sleep when i am worried he said pitifully fretfully as a child i tell you it must have given you a lot of trouble and im so vexed her face grew tender as she bent over him i assure you i had no trouble at all it was quite easy will youwill you promise me to go to sleep if i tell you howhow i managed do he said with a little sigh i really want to know they asked me if i were your mother or your sister she said scarcely able to speak for her trembling lips so i said nobutbut that i was engaged to be married to you he lay quite still he did not even put out his hand to hers but the swift tears ran down his hollow cheeks and wetted the pillow you promised you would go to sleep dear she said softly and he closed his eyes once more like a child chapter xxvi if madam will leave it to us said myfanwy jones we will give her satisfaction she took in all auras grace and beauty as she spoke full of shrewd sense appreciative by virtue of her race of all that makes for beauty knowledgeable in all that enhances beauty her bold dark eyes realised that here was some one worth dressing we willyes we will make it of white velourspanne and dead white velvet it will become madam i am sure i will consult the buyer regarding the price she swept away over the turkey carpets of williams and edwards shop her shiny undulating black satin train rippling behind her towards a tall most immaculate figure in a long frock coat who was busy comparing scraps of silk with another tall broadshouldered young man both might have entered a grenadier company and looked all too big and strong for their task excuse me mr morris said myfanwy with the most superb courtesy but i should like to speak to mr pugh for an instant having got him to herself her manner changed merve she said sharply what price order costume panne and velvet my weddingdress designyou know i want to make it for that lady he said looking across to where aura stood feeling as she still felt in shops utterly shy and miserable in an instant a hot flush overspread his face and he turned back to the silk patterns thirty guineas myfanwy sniffed scornfully you will oblige me mervyn pugh by having some sense look at her will she give more than fifteen guineas for a dress never and i want to make it fiveandtwenty he said refraining from the look he would gladly have stuck to the thirty and so have driven aura from the shop had he dared but he did not dare he was under myfanwys orders and so far he had had no reason to regret the fact he had climbed like jonahs gourd and was now williams and edwards first buyer and next year when after his marriage with myfanwy who was now head of the costume department the additional interest of making money for himself instead of for others had come in his life and there could be no doubt of their success he had all the cymrics fine feelings for feminine fallals which is shown indubitably by the names over the drapers shops in london and myfanwy had a perfect genius for dress considering therefore the crowds of women absolutely without any taste at all who desire to dress well the result was assured he began to wonder how he had ever thought seriously of being a pedagogue a demagogue or a minister i shall say twenty remarked myfanwy reflectively it can be made for fifteen and she shall have it for that in the end but i want to make it she is lovelyand i want to know how i shall look in my weddingdress twenty said mervyn wavering i hope it may buy her all she desires as my dress will buy me contended myfanwy with a challenge of lip and eyes i will say eighteen mervyn to begin with with that she swept back to aura it will be eighteen guineas madam she said sweetly but if madam will give us the mechlin scarf she is wearing to utilise it will be fifteen fifteen it seemed enormous to auras ignorance yet ted had given twelve she knew for the pink satin and he had bidden hersince he was too busy to shopbe sure and get something very nice indeed for ned blackboroughs dance on new years eve fifteen whole sovereign remedies and fifteen shillings over what an immense amount to spend upon herself she who at best was but a poor maimed thing every now and again this feeling of being as it were a castaway a derelict on lifes sea would come to her though she knew that millions of women many from choice went through the world and left their mark on it with never a child to call them mother still the sense of being as it were out of the fightingline was at times oppressive so few things seemed to matter certainly not the spending of money it will have to be ready by the st she stipulated and then she smiled as she invariably did when she remembered ned blackborough myfanwy jones took in the smile with critical shrewdness had she been asked she would have said it was not exactly the smile of a married woman although aura had given her name as mrs cruttenden what of that myfanwys notions were decidedly broad and if she could compass a good time as she herself counted a good time for this lovely girl the lovely girl should have one miss moore madams measure she called in queenly fashion and searched in her beadedsatchelpockets would have disturbed the elegant set of her dressfor a pencil it had slipped inside a folded paper and as myfanwy removed it she smiled in her turn for she had caught a glimpse of the writing and printing inside the paper miss alicia edwards messrs williams and edward per m jones only that morning myfanwy had paid the bill and received her commission on the sales so there it was awaiting developments if madam will come for one fitting suggested myfanwy superbly she was going to stake her reputation on this dress and she meant not to lose it the result exceeded even her expectations aura looked at herself in the long glass and then at myfanwy who with infinite condescension had insisted on seeing madam dressed what have you done to me she asked i dont know myself was it the long straight brilliant moonshiny folds that made her look so tall and slim was it the tiny scarcelyseen silver threads outlining the flowing curves of deadwhite velvet about the hem which made one think of moonlit clouds was it the cunningly devised drapery of lace which made the bodice seem a loose sheath to loveliness myfanwy jones looked at aura with undisguised pity it is only that madam is so seldom dressed she is only clothed but tonight she will be the bestdressed person in the rooms she looked at her doll with a sphynxlike expression not without some malice in it if madam will allow me she said and her deft fingers were in the bronze hair sothe shape of madams head is heavenlyandand not the diamond broochthe dress requires nothing but madams self that is right i trust madam will enjoy herself aura went downstairs to show herself to her husband with a queer new feeling of power tingling in every vein why at twoandtwenty should she hold herself derelict a ship need not always steer straight to the pole ted had been extremely busy and rather irritable ever since she had returned not irritable with herhe never was thatbut distrait and careless in a way it had been a relief since it had given her time to try and adjust herself to her new outlook she had not even spoken to him regarding that new outlook she was almost doubting if she should her silence would no doubt be a bar to perfect confidence but was such a thing as perfect confidence possible between two people so dissimilar as she and ted perhaps it was better to drift on whither the question would come with a pang sometimes bringing the thought that it might have been better if she and the little onethe little daughter they told herhad gone out hand in hand to wander in the groves of asphodel that was neds phrase and with that would come another pang what would she do without ned he had been so kind he had lent her books to read he had taken her out in the motor he had even talked of the dead baby almost as if he understood how dear a memory it had to be ted looked at her from head to foot and a slow smile crept over his goodlooking sensible face that is something like he said by jove you look most awfully fetching a little icebergy he continued bending to kiss the white shoulder above the mechlin lace butbut thats your style only i wish you had more colour if this biz of mine comes off well take a holiday somewheremonte carlo perhapsthe hirsches are going there now we ought to be starting you dont mind my dancing do you dearest i do wish youd learn it looks so odd your sitting out with the old fogies i shall sit out with ned she replied lightly for the first time in her life ted frowned at her it seems to me he said quite nastily that you have done a lot of sittingout with ned lately i dont half like it she stared at him and all the way to new park sat thinking of what he had said was it possible he was going to be jealous of her of her who had married him to get rid of the very possibility a ray of light from a gaslamp lit up her face and she found teds eyes fastened on her you are most awfully fetching tonightyou look so jolly mysterious somehow he said joyously putting his cheek against hers give me a kiss wifelet she gave him one she would have given him a dozen of the trivial things had he asked for them then she laid her hand on his you werent serious about ned were you she asked notnot altogether he admitted with a smile but you cant be too careful my child people are the devil to talk and you mustnt forget that he did want to marry you she must not forget and all her efforts had been to forget it utterly what a queer world it was here we are said ted cheerfully by jove blackborough is doing it well for once indeed new park looked habitable ned remembering the east had had it illuminated in indian fashion and even the heavybrowed architraves and the stucco columns looked passable outlined by rows of little lamps great cressets blazed following the ground plan of the huge pile the balustrades of the formal terraces shone in lines of light the wide portico carefully enclosed was full of palms and festooned with vines from which hung great clusters of grapes within it was impossible to recognise the formal suites of rooms they seemed to have vanished taking with them all the stiff furniture the gorgeous clogging carpets in their places were airy pavilions orange gardens great groves of tall lilies money had been spent lavishly in getting rid of all traces of money and in the centre of it all stood ned blackborough with helen tressilian looking years younger beside him as she received congratulations on her approaching marriage all the time keeping a watchful eye lest peter ramsay should weary after his recent illness but he looked alert and keen as ever a small and early and you come at a quarter past nine said ned then paused absolutely dazzled by the shiny folds the moonlit clouds the parted sheath of the bodice concealing surely the most beautiful thing in the world his vagrant mind reverted on the instant with a quaint admixture of regret and exultation to the adornment he had ordered for the select suppertable at which aura was to be entertained this woman was beyond such simplicities as a little purple iris for her white roses tuberoses gardenias stephanotis all the deadly sweet white things in the world even the poisonous dhatura i have put my name down for some dances later on he said handing her a programme i shall be busy at first butlet me seelord scudamore i am going to give you the honour of being presented to mrs cruttenden remember you are engaged to me for supper is that wise what will they say asked helen doubtfully as aura and her cavaliera diplomaticlooking wearer of an immaculate dresssuit with some sort of a ribbon across the shirtmoved off they my dear helen will by that time be envying me my good luck at least all the men will and i will tell the cavilling women she is a bride did you ever see such a fairly bewildering dress she is the whole dream of fair women rolled into one let us go into the winter palace have you seen it said auras diplomat and she went with him nothing loth ten minutes afterwards however she complained of a draught and left it somewhat hurriedly she with fine flaming cheeks and he somewhat sulkily that was the worse of rustics they could not understand the most ordinary persiflage where would you like to sit i am afraid i am engaged for this dance he said icily oh i anywhere i like to be alone replied aura it was not long her fate mr hirsch spied her out and bore down upon her white waistcoat and all his open admiration was almost a relief mixed up as it was with still more boundless adoration of his daughter who came flitting past in teds arms they were too much absorbed in their waltz and their enjoyment of it to notice the sitters out but mr hirsch waxed enthusiastic over their appearance they were a couple to be proud of and he really was becoming quite proud of ted who promised to be a very rich man he felt quite like a father towards him he had indeed fathered him into the world of speculation andhahahathen he waxed exceedingly hilariousif mr cruttenden hadnt been in such a terrible hurry to get married who knows but what a family arrangementshe must excuse him but really if she would look so superlatively beautiful she must expect the world to go crazy what are you laughing at so loudly papa asked miss hirsch pulled up in the next round by her parents laughter im sure he must be boring you terribly mrs cruttenden and there is mr leveson papa just dying to be introducedhe told me so just nowdo go and fetch him youll find him awfully amusing mrs cruttenden he has seen so much life he had seen too much for aura she came out from the conservatory white with anger by this time half the men in the room were looking at her and it was no longer any question of being alone she was beginning to feel frightened she looked vainly for ted but he having seen her as he phrased it selfcomplacently wellstarted was amusing himself so in the crush of smiling flattering faces she saw ned blackboroughs and caught almost convulsively at his arm and his quiet decorous claim our dance i think oh ned she said hurriedly do let us go to some quiet place where we can get away from everybody the suggestion was but too welcome free for a time from his duties as host he cast all prudence to the winds the sort of thing that had been going on was all very well but it must end in the inevitable way when she was happy he might have been a fool now he would not be one it was not as if he would be doing ted any real harm if he was free of her he would be free to marry and have sons to inherit his money he could even marry miss hirsch the library whither they escaped looked snug and comfortable all untouched by the babel without the reading lamp by the blazing fire neds book as he had left it this is nice she said with a little shiver of satisfaction and taking up the book crouched down in her usual fashion by the fire to see what it was neds pulses were bounding it was all he could do to keep his voice steady you oughtnt to do cinderella in that lovely gown he said aura looked at him critically i feel like cinderella she said i believe i want to go home before twelve and i dont think i like the gown it makes me something i never was before there was a silence ned blackborough was telling himself he was a fool i shall put out the light if you insist on trying to read a bad french novel instead of speaking to me he said there the click of the electric button sounded clear its much nicer with the firelight give that thing to me bad french novel she echoed why do you read it if it is bad i wouldnt all people are not perfect he said recklessly most of usexcept youhave a bad side i often wonder what you would say if i were to show you mine you couldnt she said softly he had literally to harden his heart before he could go on and then he had to double back itit isnt a bad book after all he went on turning the leaves idly it is only real life ill tell you the story if you like of course it is about a woman and a man andand a husbandthe old story that is always cropping up in the world so the books no good he threw it aside in sudden impulse upon the table and knelt down beside her aura he said passionately you and i know the beginning of the story well why should we try and escape from the ending of it oh for gods sake child dont look like that she had sprung up and was glancing down at the white shimmering folds of her gown in absolute horror it is the dress she muttered it is not meit is not you nedoh ned it cant be youit is the dressi will go homei must go home aura he cried but she eluded him and was out in the wide lit corridor ere he could even ask her to be calmto forgive himto forget he glanced after her for a moment then with a curse at himself closed the door and sat down moodily before the fire what was the good between the palms the roses the endless flowers and curtains of the corridor were many a cosy corner many a prepared nook where men and women in the intervals between the dances sought seclusion and lovemaking more or less casual according to the taste of the makersand where passion doubtless had gone further than neds brief outburst hullo aura came her husbands voice as he issued from one of these corners with miss hirsch on his arm all alone why whats up the necessity for calm came to her i was looking for you she said i want you to order the carriage for me im feelingnot very welland i shall be better at homeyou see as i dont dance she looked helplessly at him wondering if she would be allowed to go ill take you home of course if you want to go he said gloomilythat is if miss hirsch will excuse me his regret for three more dances with the jolliest girl he had met for years was in his voice then i wont go she began i couldnt spoil you are not looking a bit well said miss hirsch kindly see ill take you to the ladies room mr cruttenden you might send her in a glass of champagne then you can have a quiet rest there and go home later if you want to but i expect youll be all right by supper time she nodded knowingly to ted and went off with aura bursting over with friendliness but left alone in charge of a bevy of prim maids with the untouched champagne before her auras courage rose she would do what she wanted to do so on her programme card she wrote a note to her husband using all the most consoling phrases she could think offeeling a little bilious was in itself sufficient to allay any anxietyended up with a cheerfuli shall be asleep long ere you come home please enjoy yourself and leaving this to be given to him when he came to inquire slipped away the clocks were just striking halfpast eleven when she paid the cabman at the gate she had forgotten the latchkey but thank heaven the servants were still up it was new years eve her thoughts flew back to cwmfaernog to the last new years day when she had learnt so many things she was going to learn more now she could not understand she did not know what the world meant she was going to see for herself once and for all as she thought this she was stripping off myfanwys creation enjoy herself she flung it into a corner almost with a cry and the next minute stood in her white serge and the brown tamoshanter mercifully some faint instinct of selfpreservation made her muffle up the bronze beauty of her hair and hide some of the perfection of her face under a thick veil the next instant she had carefully closed the front door again and was hurrying away down the road towards the electric tram they went till midnight that would take her quickest to the heart of the great city she had teds duplicate latchkey with her she would try and be back before he returned hitherto she had sought for the uttermost wisdom of nature amongst the everlasting hillsnow she was going to seek the uttermost wisdom of man in his haunts hullo polly my dear aint you comin my side came a voice from the shadows over the way but she was close to the tram lines now and a car was coming along it was full of holidaymakers singing shouting harmless enough but over hilarious here there were more appeals to polly why perpetually polly rather puzzled her as she clung to a strap until a jovial elderly man pulled her down on his knee whereat the whole car roared as if it were some exquisite joke but they meant no harm they were only just a little convivial the car stopped at the cross the centre of the great city and she got out it was a fine old cross weatherbeaten worn bearing on its four sides beneath the soaring quaintly floreated symbol of salvation four basreliefs of the passion of the master the scourging the mocking the crosscarrying the crucifying beneath the latter aura stood looking out with clear eyes at the conduct of christendom the radiating streets were all thronged the late musichalls were belching out their crowds the supperrooms were preparing to close by turning out their guests but the streets were not ready for bed what a crowd gaily dressed women of almost all types some painted bedizened unmistakable others apeing them amused uncertain even faintly repelled men with every expression on their faces from evil passion through vulgarity to contemptuous tolerance halfgrown girls more outrageous than their elders halfgrown lads jostling leering raiding the pavementwalkers into the very street the electric light danced and quivered the moistened mud of a thousand footsteps sparkled and shone where in all her midnight walks upon the hills had she seen a sight like to this as she stood more than one offer of a drink fell on her ears but she took no notice if you aint goin said a policeman familiarly you must move on i cant ave you standin doing nothin so she quitted the shadow of the crucifixion but at the corner of the street also it was still move on when she herself had failed to move on so the next time the offer of a drink came she accepted it bully for you my girl come along said the offerer and they went across to a gin shop the doors of which had never once been still the flashing of their backwards and forward swing beating out the seconds with the regularity of a clock how bright it was how full these last few minutes before twelve the offerer appraised his guest critically sherry he ordered and the usualnow my girl drink it up sharp the nights young for pleasure yet but we shall have to turn out and find some other place aura looked at him clearly at the face not bad in itself but overlaid with sensuality i am not going to drink she said coldly i only came in to seeand i have seen she turned to go luckily for her his torrent of obscene abuse was interrupted by a general exodus for suddenly the town hall clock boomed the church bells rang out the old year passed the new year began began with shouts and curses and kisses and laughter some one struck up should auld acquaintance be forgot and a band of perfect strangers to each other handclasped and feeling wildly at each end for further friendship lurched across the street a salvation lass her face vivid with intent clutched at auras arm dont go with him my girldonthe is the devilhe is sin incarnatehe is i am not going answered aura in a queer strained voice i am in school i am learning i want to see for myself that was eves sinyou are lostcomecome with me the crowd jostled them apart jostled aura into the shadow of a narrow archway more than one mans face looked into the shadow spoke then passed on with a jibe the streets were beginning to empty the crowd was dissolving into couples men and women were hurrying away into the side streets she must be going also hullo you young devil i have got you again have i came a hoarse voice and a hand clutched at her arm she wrenched it away and looked for escape beside the low archway rose a flight of steps above the steps a wider archway a small door in it stood open scarcely thinking what she did she sprang towards it set aside a leathern curtain and for the first time in her life found herself in a church at least the man would not follow her here what a quaint little place it was almost dark but lights were burning small twinkling lights set in the form of a star at the further end and she went forward curiously the chapel for it was no more than that was not quite empty here and there among the shadowy chairs some figuregenerally two figures togethershowed dimly it must be a roman catholic chapel for that gracious womans figure crowned with stars uplifted above the sanctuary doors with a child in her arms must be the blessed mother auras heart leapt up to her that she understood and what was this at her gracious feet beneath the fivepointed star of light that was the mother again kneeling in adoration before her newborn child while the ox and the ass worshipped with wide soft eyes and the shepherds and the wise men thronged the door aura knelt down before the creche her eyes wide soft as those of the beasts that perish here was peace here was perfection no not perfection but the road to it this was the solution of the horrors of human life outside but beyond human life lay the life that was not human the something better of her dreams a touch on her shoulder roused her one of the sisters of the immaculate conception engaged in this rescue work was beside her courage she said courage my sister our blessed lady will help you give up your sinful life aura rose and looked at her simply i am not a bad woman she said ii dont think i ever could have been one now i know i couldnt then she flushed up ii should like to give something she continued and thrusting her purse into the sisters hand she turned and passed rapidly into the street again she had seen enough she had learnt enough now to get home she would have taken one of the cabs of which two or three still stood by the cross but she had no money there were two pennies it is true in the pocket of her jacket but the trams had ceased running for the night there was nothing for it but to walk and she had no idea of the way her two first experiences of asking it one entailing immediate flight from insult were not encouraging so the clocks were chiming halfpast three ere utterly worn out draggled beyond belief she stood in the hall of her own house again thankful to find from the darkness that ted had not yet returned he might be back any moment however so she must make haste and remove her garments she flung them all soiled and stained with the grime of the city on the top of myfanwy jones creation the beginning and the end together then as she stood in her white dressinggown she paused to listen was that a sound in teds study could he have come in already come in without seeing how she was she went downstairs there was a light beneath the door she opened it the room seemed to her to be full of smoke making all things in it unreal almost fantastic and was that her husband looming large jovial content through this new atmosphere she shrank back from it hullo little woman aura ive such news for you ive turned up trumps with a vengeance im a hundred thousand pounds richer than i was yesterday i found the telegram when i came home half an hour ago and ive been dreaming ever since such dreams you shall have the best time a woman ever hadfrocks jewels everythingand by and by there may be no by and by she said quickly tedoh ted be good to me chapter xxvii it is may said ned blackborough in rather a strained voice and you promised to come to cwmfaernog in may you look as if you needed a holiday come yes it was may four whole months had passed since myfanwy jones dress had upset auras cosmogony and she had fled to find some foothold in the slums of the city she had found a faith there and had spent four months in trying to put that faith into practice it had been uphill work but her courage had not wavered her eyes were clear as she looked back at ned who had come in to find her as she so often was nowadays alone for teds first great success had been but a preliminary to months of daily excitement spent in gaining losing gaining again in the midst of which he seemed to have lost sight of the future altogether and for the present he was too busy to care then underlying all things was his consciousness of youth the outlook before him was long he could not but see that chance might come into it why in five years time he would be just reaching the age at which it was prudent for a business man to marry for of course his marriage to poor dear aura had been grossly imprudent though but for this one disappointmentwhich naturally meant more to her than to himit had turned out very well if only she would have condescended to amuse herself like other girlslike rosa hirsch for instancethey might have had a jolly time together in the various european capitals whither his business took him but what was the use of taking her when the only places in which aura was not shy and ill at ease were musty fusty old picture galleries and dreary botanical gardens and the zoo of course she had always been at home in the zoo but then there was that beastly smell of smaller mammals all over the shop so he had gone his way kindly quite affectionately wholly without sympathy to aura it was rather a relief it gave her time to rearrange her world she was looking a little weary over a pile of household accounts there was no need nowadays for heartburnings as to expense but none the less ted expected a properlybalanced book and the items were terribly numerous it was the herringandahalf problem expressed in pounds instead of pence and there was quite a wrinkle of thought between auras eyebrows for she was no arithmetician to ned that wrinkle was a tragedy but then it is always a tragedy for a man to watch from a distance the woman he loves trying to reconstruct her life and reconcile herself to the lack of what he knows he could give her and the greater her success the greaterin a wayis the tragedy ned had felt this every instant of those four months during which the memory of that pitiful protest not you ned ah ned not you had come between him and even apology when he had gone back that evening to fling himself into a chair and gloom over the fire for a few minutes he had told himself he was a fool he had told himself so hundreds of times since that evening until there had grown up in him the conviction that this sort of thing could not possibly last for ever why should it why should three human beings be sacrificed and in heavens name to what not to a marriage of either soul or body they all needed something which they had not got ted needed or would need a wife and children these might be his if aura were taken away she needed the old free natural life this ned could give her in that island on the southern seas and how much more ye gods how much more of lovetrue love and tenderness and truth as for his own needs they were simple being summed up in that one wordaura he needed her every instant of the day and night he could not be content without her love had left his body it had invaded his mind it had not yet touched his soul the personal element was still too strong for him so by degrees he had brought himself to believe that perhaps the best way out of the impasse for all the three actors in the tragedy would be for him to beguile her awayif he could you know you promised me last year he reiterated yes i promised she said sadly and he knew where her thoughts had fled he used to see her so often in his dreams wandering through great drifts of purple iris the flower which brings the messages of the gods leading a little child by the hand she was there now and a sudden dread came over him again lest nothing short of that would ever make her really happy but the next moment he had roused himself i should love to go of course she went on fancy seeing cwmfaernog and the floor of heaven only i cant can i till ted returns and that may be never perhaps interrupted ned sarcastically he hasnt been much at home lately has he she flushed up hastily why should he be he is not like youyou are an idle man besides she paused her pride refusing to justify her husband even to ned it may not be for a fortnight she went on coldly he never can tell and by that time the hyacinths will be over and it would be no good soso it is no use thinking of it but her very readiness in the selfdefence of this refusal to blame her husband decided him if that went on much longer the tragedy would become permanent a sudden weariness of the whole foolish muddle seized on him he was not going to have aura spend her days in saintliness and martyrdom growing more and more dignified and gracious more and more motherly in the look of brimming affection she never failed to give to himto him her lover it was beyond bearing he would break down the prison walls at all costs he was tired to death himself of civilisation they would go into the wilderness and be happy i will ask mrs ramsay to come with us he said knowing that he had not the slightest intention of so doing but if he was to take the law into his own hands he would require a few days to mature his plans she cant come he said two days afterwards she isnt quite up to it aura looked for a moment as if she were back in the iris fields im sorry she began but went on ned coolly i believe i could take you there and back by the fourcylinder panhard in a dayif you dont mind starting rather early do come ii want a holiday toobadly he looked like it poor ned she said softly for she had begun to realise her responsibilities towards him also that was the worst of life the great hidden tie between all creatures could so seldom be felt or seen until some wound stripped the quivering flesh and left the ligaments bare yes i will come she said after a pause making up her mind that there standing on the floor of heaven she would try and make him understand that she was worth no mans passionate love when shall we go something seemed to rise in his throat and choke him the first fine day shall we say tomorrow but we must start at five and breakfast by the way at five she echoed joyously looking more like herself than she had done for months oh ned how jolly i havent been up at five for ages and ages it disturbs ted soand then she hurried onthe servants loathe it they hate you to know how late they are she was ready waiting for him with quite a colour in her cheeks when he drove up it was a delicious morning cool clear full of shafted lights and shadows from the rising sun aura tilted back her head triumphantly and gazed up at the little white fleecy clouds that were drifting steadily overhead before the westerly breeze im not going to look at anything grimy today she said with a laugh and even blackborough cant soil those they are too gladly far away do you know that often when ive nothing else to comfort me i lie on my back in the garden and dream they are just feathers out of a great soft pillow where i am finding rest he felt a pang for her innocent selfbetrayal but he retorted gravely that is your fault for not being contented with a good civilised wiremattress she laughed out loud how nice of you to talk nonsense it is exactly like old times exactly she cried ned do you think we were made to forget i dont some things he said soberly are best forgotten not many she replied cheerfully sometimes ned i seem to get at the meaning of so much by remembering and then i see how all these little lives of ours work into one big whole and thenand then she was silent her eyes still upon the clouds if her majesty will deign to look upon this poor world said ned blackborough after quite a long while she will see primroses they were beyond the grime the skies were blue the trees the grass were green and far away the distant hills showed purple through the blossoming apple orchards what need was there for more not once not twice but many times that day as the car sped almost noiselessly through lanes and past homesteads and fields where the lambs lay white like little clouds dropped from heaven ned told himself joyfully that this was but the beginning of an end which would never come why are you putting on your goggles she asked as by the low road round the coastfor the straight hilly pitch over the head of the valley was too bad for the motorthey came within measurable distance of dinas there are a lot of slate spiculae on the road he replied coolly and one got into my eye once you had better put on a veil too i brought one on purpose you think of everything ned she replied gaily i never knew any one like you except guy fawkes or some arch traitor of that sort he felt with a pang but one had to take precautions and if you set yourself up as a deus ex machine to get people out of a muddlewhy some mud was likely to stick so disguised out of all recognition they swept through the village of dinas and passing the staring schoolhouse took the turn towards cwmfaernog the villagers looked after them with slack curiosity for dinas was as it had always been immersed in its own trivialities the revival had passed away leaving its traces physical and mental no doubt but ceasing to bring any new interest into life at the present moment however the village had an absorbing interest of its own for in two days time the reverend hwfa williams was to marry alicia edwards and all the other young women in the place were in that curious state of mingled spitefulness and vicarious nervous excitability which a wedding so often provokes in the feminine sex they will not find any one at cwmfaernog whatever said isaac edwards at his door for martha bate and her husband went for a jaunt the day before yesterday it is only old evans from the shepherds hut that is to milk the cows and feed the cocks meanwhile the motor sped on curving round the rocks there is no more slate here anyhow cried aura joyfully tearing off her veil oh ned look look the floor of heaven ah do stop and let us look he did not answer the engine slowed quivered sunk to silence now at last he understood now he knew what he had seen in the boat so long ago when the swift southern storm was sweeping up unseen behind him this was the blue mist which had enveloped him and held him a blue mist hiding the earth hiding even every green thing from sight as it lay in wreaths in the hollows or crept up and up and up leaving itself in clouds to cover all things until it met the sky the floor of heaven indeed not quite so blue perhaps as that distant roof of heaven over which the heat of the day had spread a faintly violet haze but stillthe floor of heaven no other words expressed it here surely the angels of god might tread with unsoiled feet does not everything of earth seem to fall away came auras voice all hushed and quiet and leave one free at last she was out of the car standing her sandalled feet just touching the carpet of hyacinths her hands stretched out towards them her face full of absolute undimmed joy see she continued the dear things grow on to our very pathwe wont hurt them will we let us walk on to the house and see martha then i will take you through a path in the woods to the best place of all she paused and looked at him curiously nedwhat is it something is wrong what is it there is nothing wrong he answered quietly and i may as well tell you here as elsewhere martha is not at the house she paled a very little she is not there she echoed why because i sent her away you sent her away yes because i wanted to be alone with youandwe are alonealone with nothing but our love between usfor you do love me aura he cried his quiet giving way as he seized her hands and drew her towards him why should we go back to all the grimeto the dull useless foolish life come with me no one wants us no one will miss us not even ted it has all been a mistake from the beginning there is but one way to set things straightto leave him free to do as he choosescome my poor ned she stood unresisting before him with all the motherhood that was in her looking at him through eyes that brimmed over with tears and her voice full of an overwhelming pity smote on his ears a knell to all his hopes he knew it he felt it to be so even as he listened he let her hands fall with a sense of impotence to hold her it is my fault dear she said softly i ought to have told youi ought to have made you understand ned i am worth no mans love i shall never he interrupted her with an angry impatient laugh but i do understand it is you who cannot understand that love lives untrammelled by such trivialities aura were i your husband now you would be a thousand times more dearthe tie between us would be a thousand times more strong hush she said with a world of mysterious solemnity in her voice if that is true ned if love really can live untrammelled by the body why should it not live untrammelled by the mind you want to see me to hear me toto touch meperhaps but ned there is something that is beyond all thisthat is beyond everythingbeyond you and me and yet it is you and ithat is ours now suddenly her tone rose swift and sharpcome ned let us forget the restis this not enough he looked around him and even amid such transcendental beauty as was there shook his head i cannot live on air aura he said bitterly no man can her face melted into gentle smiles there is the lunchbasket she said he turned aside almost with a curse it is easy to laugh he began is it so easy she asked and once again her voice brought to him that sense of infinite pity infinite denial then let us laugh ned while we can come let us lose ourselves oh ned give me one day unspotted by the world untouched by trivialities just this one day and as she took his hand the glamour not of this world but of that which lies hidden beyond it above it claimed possession of his soul the blue mist closed in on them they stood on the floor of heaven with the sky above them down in the hollows with the silken fans of the halfopened beechleaves overhead a saffroncoloured azalea dropping its gold upon the blue the pink campion struggling for a place amongst the blossoms a tuft of white poetsnarcissus looking up from the pool of water into which a scarceseen runlet dripped and dropped what colour what almost unimaginable beauty out in the open in a cup in the hills where the carpet of heavenblue hyacinths dwarfed into closer growth showed like a shadowy cloud against the clearer blue of the sky what dreamfulness what peace away on the springing heather on the mountaintop with half wales spread before you and the westering sun obscured by just such a shadowy cloud sending a great sloping corona of light rays to nestle in the dimples of the hills and shine in shafted reflections on the distant sea what visions of unending space of ceaseless life is it not time she said at last as they sat in the sheepshelter the sun was beginning to sink in the west calmly serenely the light shone round them purest gold down in the valley the blue hyacinth mist grew darker colder yes it is time he said quietly it has been quite perfect she said again almost perfect he assented after all he was but human and humanity does not live by sight alone it craves to touch also the motor was awaiting them where they had left it she laid her hand on his for a second ere he started it say it has been quite perfect ned she pleaded he looked at her and smiled i will not say ityou can say it for me she was silent for a moment and then she spoke it has been quite perfect the motor sped on the mist wreaths of the hyacinths grew dulled by young green sprouting ferns and the rocks closed in for the swift turn by the school the children were already out and a group of them were playing on the road they scattered leaving it clear and then suddenly from the shadow of the parapetwall a little toddling child escaping from the hand of its wideeyed curiositystruck elder lurched out into the open oh ned take carethe childthe child aura stood up and in neds sudden swerve inwards an overhanging root from the high rocky bank above struck her full upon the temple the child shrieking more from joyous excitement than fear lurched back with outstretched arms to the shadow but aura sank back her head resting on neds shoulder my god aura he cried there was no answer he did not stop the car but sweeping it round the open space by the school raced back to cwmfaernog there he knew all was ready for her reception there everything would be to hand as he sped through the misty blue cloud once more he saw nothing of it his eyes were on her whitening face dear god how limp she felt as he lifted her in his arms and carried her across the drawbridge and so through the garden to the house a scent of violets and primroses of lilies of the valley of all things sweet assailed him as he entered the door that was only latched he had brought the flowers when he had come down secretly to see that all things were prepared he had brought them for her and the table set out with flowers and fruitthat was for her also he stumbled up the stairs with his heavy burden to her room he had not entered that he had only climbed once more to her windowsill to set it abloom with white and purple iristhe messengers of the gods how they mocked him now with their tale of immortality his mind went back to many a kashmir grave which he had seen long and narrow like the sill set as thick with irises high upon the hills low amongst the dales but she could not be dead yet her head lay on the pillow just as it had touched it her arm slipping from his support sank till it could sink no more aura he muttered faintly aura he knelt and laid his ear to her heartoh sweetest restingplace in all the world there was no sound no beat yes she was dead he turned his face round into the soft pillow of her breast and whispered aura it seemed to him as on that midsummer night when he had first met her as if all the world were wailing aura aura how long he knelt there he scarcely knew a faint sense of sound in the house roused him to the remembrance that something must be done he must call for help but if he did that every one must know that she was here with him alone the world would judge and what would that judgment reck of her spotlessness or his forbearance no that must not be if he could compass otherwise his mind almost unhinged by the terrible shock chased possibility through a thousand impossibilities the least grotesque of these being a grave of his own digging amongst the hyacinths his subsequent flight being easy since he had made all arrangements for a sudden disappearance was that a noise belowa faint creak on the stairs the possibility troubled him he crossed to the door and opened it to find himself confronted by ted cruttenden his face distorted by passion you scoundrel he cried youyou infernal scoundrelwhere is auramy wife his very vehemence his very lack of self restraint brought back ned blackboroughs wandering wits he closed the door behind him and stood with his back to it she isnot there he said slowly ted listen for one moment i brought her here do you think i dont know that you damned villain burst out tedwhen i came home this morning and found you had taken herthere was some cockandbull story the servants had about not sitting up for her and a latchkey and all that rotdo you think i was fool enough not to understandive never really trusted you and nowand nowlet me pass in i say or therell be murder done listen one moment the voice was inexorable you never trusted me i know that have you not trusted her are you fool enough to have lived day and night with her to have lain with your head upon her breastand not knownno it is impossible you know what she isyou mustyou do know it even to ted cruttendens mad jealousy memory could bring no fuel to feed the flame his very anger sank for the moment to selfpity i come home he muttered i find her gone i follow i have walked over the hill to tospy upon us interrupted ned sternly go on to spy upon you if you will cried ted his passion rising againand i find you here in her room ned opened the door behind him quietly because she is dead he said and leaning against the lintel his head upon his arm waited dead the whisper reached him from within full almost of fear and there was a long empty silence you will not say i killed her i suppose said ned bitterly at last it was an accident we were going backback to you the very wonder of that fact stayed speech but he knew he must go on i am quite ready to let you shoot me by and by but at presentii want you to think of herof yourself i dont count i need count any more but we must be quick about it as i stand beforebefore something that is mightier than i i swear to you that i have done you no harm we wont go into the other question as to what harm you have done me and for heryou know butbut even if we had what use is there now in making a fuss in letting the world know that you have found her therewith me not a soul knows i am here you can take my place as you have taken it before i can go as i have gone before from within where ted cruttenden stood beside the bed vaguely remorseful at his own lack of anything save anger horror regret no answer came ted went on lord blackborough you must decide i can go the way you came and you can call for help it must be done at once ill tell you how it happened so that you may know we got here about noon we didnt go into the house we werewe were in the woods and on the hills his voice failed a little then grew monotonous she said it was time to go and ii was a fool i said so too just at the corner by the school a child a little child ran in front of the car sheshe called outand rose there was a rootoh curse the damned thingit struck her as i swerved it has left a little blue markyou can see it on her temple if you look she never spoke i brought her back she was dead you say you didnt kill her burst out ted his voice now full of crude anger grief hate but you did you brought her here is there any use in recriminations asked ned wearily you have to decide and after all sheshe was no wife for youyou are young yet ted listening cursed him for repeating the inward thought that had forced itself into his mind you have all the world before youand for an instant the voice hesitated as if ashamed uncertain then went on i had made out a deed of gift to you of a hundred and fifty thousand pounds it is about all i have left and the works and all that must go to the heir you know you see i meant to disappear and i meant to take your wifeso this was just payment it can be just payment still i shall not trouble you again butbut you must decide at once he stood waiting for a moment or two his head resting as before upon his upraised arm upon the lintel then he heard a step and lifted his eyes to check what he knew all too well would come from teds lips did he not know it was it not the answer of the world where everything even honour had its price and was it not far better far wiser was it not what he himself desired you will find the motor by the bridge he said quietly you had better call some one from the village first and then the doctor the children will give evidence some of them were quite big and no one at new park knows anything goodbye i shant see you again when ted had gone he closed the door went downstairs gathered up the telltale flowers and fruits which he had brought climbed to the windowsill and removed the iris so putting them all into a basket went back to the woods before the car returned with its first consignment of help the mistyblue wreaths of the hyacinths darkening with the dusk had hidden him chapter xxviii he roused himself for the night was passing the last twinkling lightsthe lights which he had been almostunconsciously watching in the valley below himhad gone but one steady star remained that came from the room where she lay dead it seemed incredible such sudden endings to all things came into life sometimes of course still why should they come into his it was unfair he risked everything on this one stake bit by bit he had given up everything else he had chased love to the outside edge of the world and nowit had gone over the verge he stood up and stretched himself wondering vaguely how he had passed the last few hours he had slept for a while he knew that was at the beginning after he had gone down to the hollow where they had sat together and where he had planted the iris by the side of the narcissus which was too proud to look for its fellow in the earthbounded pool at its feet it had amused himyes positively amused himto dig holes for the bulbs with his penknife and make a gravelong and narrow like the windowsilljust such a grave as he remembered on hill and dale at kashmir and it was not an empty grave either for he had buried in it the violets and the primroses the lilies of the valley and all things sweet in that first hour he must have been almost crazy with grief but then he remembered he had lain down halfhidden by the hyacinths dogtired in mind and body to sleep a dreamless sleep then he had come and watched the lights until it should be dark enough for the night to bring disguise now it had come and it was time to be going whither as if that mattered he had come prepared for a secret journey and there was a hundred pounds odd in his pocket the thought made him smile bitterly so far as outward circumstances stood he was in exactly the same position as he had been two years ago when he and ted had first met in a bicycle smash in exactly the same position since what was there to prevent his turning up at new park in a few days and resuming his life as lord blackborough there was nothing to prevent it since the deed of gift could stand of course nothing but his utter weariness it would be better to start afresh he looked at his watch yes it was time he was off he would walk down the coast road to potafon thence take the cargo steamer to liverpool all roads meet there he would go off to the wilds somewhere and after a year ifif nothing changedhe could easily fabricate his own death and let the heir come into what he did not want he set off for his night walk cheerfully enough the glamour of that past day was upon him still he seemed to hear her voice saying for him it has been quite perfect in reality those had been her last words since the cry the child the child had been wrung from her by chanceby one of the unhappy chances and changes of this most unhappy world it has been quite perfect ay perhaps but in the past tense what of the present he paused at the bridge below the village where the mountain stream joined the river afon to look down to the still pool below the arch in the moonlight it looked very quiet one might sleep there without dreams if people would only leave one alone but they would not he leant over the parapet and smiled at the oddness of one hive of swarming atoms objecting to another hive of atoms choosing the hollow of a pool wherein to rest interfering to fish it up and put it somewhere else in order to disintegrate into atoms again and after the atoms there lay the question the atom and the human consciousness were not both an equal mystery born of the unity beyond as he stood there absorbed in thought the sound of rapid footsteps echoed down the steep road from dinas and not wishing to be seen he stepped back at once into the shadow of a tree that overhung the bridge looking up the roadway he saw a womans figure she was running swiftly with a curious unevenness a curious uncertainty yet evidently with some set purpose as she passed him he caught a glimpse of her face andmere hive of atoms though he washe started after her in a second none too soon either he had just had hold of her in time as she wavered for an instant on the parapet you young fool he said roughly whats the matter what are you doing that for the girlshe did not look more than twentystared at him vacantly as if she did not understand what he meant then with a little cry of horror apparently at herself covered her face with her hands and crouched down beneath his touch in a perfect storm of sobs dont cry he said more kindly what is it all about what were you going to do ii dont know she wept itit came upon me suddenly that it was the only wayit swept me off my feetoh wicked wicked girl that i amifif it hadnt been for youoh what shall i do what shall i do whats wrong he asked impatient at her helpless emotion anything i can help come its no use crying of course youre a wicked girl but as you evidently dont really want to kill yourself youll have to live so you had better make a clean breast of it i daresay i can helpif it isnt her face looked innocent and pure still one never could tell comeout with ithe went onif its anything about money she caught at the word money oh if i could only get the money she wailed come he said with a smile if it is only money so by degrees she told him her name was alicia edwards she was the happiest luckiest girl in the world who was to be married in two days to the man she lovedto a saint upon earth and she bore an unblemished character and her father was also a saint upon earth but that very evening by the post had comenot a bolt from the bluefor she had had an awful prescience that it would come though who would have thought that myfanwy would be so cruel and she just married to the man she loved oh it was wicked a bill and such a bill too a hundred and three pounds and if it was not paid for at once it would be sent oh she would go mad with shame what was it for asked ned wearily goodnatured that is it wailed poor alicia it is for hats and dresses and i ought to have paid and what am i a ministers wife to ask him to pay such bills and my father will not what am i to do if i was a bad girl it would be nothing but i am good so very good i cannot face them saying i am bad they would have said you were mad i suppose if you had jumped from the bridge just now said ned grimly alicia looked at him furtively and wept again what a world it was thought ned bitterly here was a welleducated deeplyreligious girl occupied entirely in thinking what her neighbours would say of her those neighbours who in a way were as responsible as she for was not humanity as a whole responsible for all the deeds of humanity was he not in a way responsible for his own birth being as he was but the outcome of his forefathers virtue and vice honour and dishonour were they not all hidden in that first step of dancing prakrit so there came to him for once a great humility a patient acceptance of all the evil in the world as being part of himself i will give you the money child he said you shall marry the saint and be a saint yourselfwhy not i canti cant take it she muttered for all that holding fast to the purse he gave her i cant take it from a stranger a stranger he echoed bah in the beginning little girl you and i were one remember that in all your little life as it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be world without endamen he stooped and kissed her as he left her at her fathers door and she stood looking after him wondering if he were indeed a man or a vision but the money was there a hundred pounds in notes and three sovereigns she would send them by the mornings post to myfanwy pugh and then alicia edwards fell on her knees beside her bed and thanked god for the money meanwhile ned blackborough had paused to remake his plans in his new condition of pennilessness for he had but a few shillings left for the immediate present afterwards there was money and to spare awaiting him at various points on the route which he had carefully prepared for flight still he must first get to a point then the remembrance of the hundred pounds he had hidden away in the cleft of the rock up on the hills came to him making him laugh because there was no question now as to who needed it he came back to it a beggar beggared indeed of all save life yet life was all the words of the indian sage came back to him indestructible the life is spreading life thro all i say to thee weapons reach not the life flame burns it not waters cannot overwhelm nor dry winds wither it impenetrable unentered unassailed unharmed untouched immortal all arriving stable sure thus is the life declared vaguely he felt comforted the sense of unity lay around him in the air he saw the golden gateway he knew that its door was open but his love kept him from entering he could yield himself without one sigh to the beginning that was the end but he could not yield her for he had not yet realised that she also was the beginning the end the dawn was just breaking as he reached the gap and searching in the cleft found nothing was he glad or was he sorry he was not sure in a way he felt more free since he need now have no plans for the future he could sit down and watch the sun rise after that he could walk over llwyddybryd to the coastline by the country town and soanywhere this was sufficient surely for the moment the sun rose in a panoply of purple and red with low down above the hills a band or two of torquoise blue to hint of the vast fields of calm ether beyond the storm clouds of the world aura aura aura even there to the far unending depths the cry echoed a cry apart poignant with individual anguish he started up and moved on the staghorn moss trailed clinging to the soil beneath his feet a hawk hovering in the air was held to its place also by the same force which sent the world on which he stood spinning on its way but still that love that grief of his would not be made one with nature aura aura aura he stood on the summit of llyddybryd once more even the gingerbeer had gone from the shieling now but it would not be long before humanity returned once more with placard and pastepot to appropriate the spot to base uses down in the blue hollow yonder lay cwmfaernog and in cwmfaernog layno not aura aura was of the woods and hills he could feel her in them separate distinct from himself he would not give her up he could not he would give one more look at the peaceful little valley from the crag yonder and then take her with him something he would not yield not even to the force which held the round world sure the round world perhapsbutye gods his foot slipped he caught at a root to save himself it gave wayhe fell the hot noontide sun was beating down on him when he woke to consciousness again he tried to move and could not after a time his mind returned clearly he pinched himself upon the thigh and felt nothing that then was the reason why he felt no pain for one of his legs was evidently broken he had injured his spine and it was paralysed below the waist this then was the end aura aura his heart leapt up in him it could not be long now he was lying in the corrie into which he and ted had vainly tried to get that first night of the storm and as he lay he could watch the sun tilt from its high glory in the heavens to touch the world in the west then disappear it would be a beautiful sunset how many more would he see he wondered how long would it last some days perhaps how idle all thingsmoney happiness even love itself seemed beside this certainty of leaving them all the only thing that money had brought to him was the death of a wild animalthank godalone except for aura aura aura aura yes she had been right love like his needed nothing it could existnay grow to greater strength without trivialities they were beyond the shadow of the night now nothing could touch them again they would go on and on that night he slept a little under the stars and in his dreams he saw her walking amid the drifts of iris leading a little child by the hand her face was sad and as he tried to comfort her his eyes opened and lo it was dawn once more a primrose dawn with little faint far grey clouds just flecking the wide waste of gold it was quite perfect her words came back to him she was wrong the part could not be perfect and what were they their griefs their joys their loves but part of the great whole his mind was beginning to wander a little and in the high noon tide he slept to dream that he saw the little child alone her head was crowned with iris flowers her feet were among them her eyes were violet and white as they were they looked into his mother says you have no right came her childish voice i am the immortality of the race die and forget her die and forget all things when he awoke a raven perched on a rock hard by cawed hoarsely and flapped lazily away to watch from a greater distance a few drops of water trickled from the rock close beside him he had hollowed out a little cup for it with his hand and drank of it from time to time now he poured some of it on his head which had begun to ache what use was there in prolonging the agony the sooner it was over the better he searched in his pockets for any scrap of paper which might betray him and tearing them up dug them toilfully into the ground almost amusing himself in restoring the spot to perfect homogeneity with its surroundings his gold signet ring he flung away into the little pool which collecting the surface drainage of the very summit brimmed up below the rock to overflow in a tiny stream he tried to make a duck and drake of it as his last contribution to the sovereign remedy but he failed and he smiled at his failure he was becoming very much detached even from himself and the one thing to which he clung was the memory of his love aura aura aura he must find her somewhere and she seemed so close sometimes he wondered if she were not there in his eyes in his heart aura he murmured to himself aura that night he slept dreamlessly and when he opened his eyes lo there was a sea of light the great shining arch of the sky seemed to him the golden gate the open door lay behind him he was on the other side he had found himself and her as they had been always not as a part but as the whole tad ek am he thought realising with a rush that he was all things and that all things were in him so as he lay gazing the round sun rose gloriously and he sank into unconsciousness when he awoke it was to find himself in a workhouse infirmary a long bare room set in a straight row with beds some hive of atoms must have found him on the mountaintop and brought him to die here well it could not be for long there was a black screen folded up ready for use at the foot of the bed he knew what that meant but nothing seemed to matter now that he had passed the open door to lose and find himself only those who lose can find his mind blurred confused lingered over this certainty he is conscious said a voice beside him and a face dark curiously eager bent over him it was morris pughs walking over the hills that morning on his way to caeron the county town he had come upon ned blackborough had summoned help and brought him to the infirmary and now although having seen him but once in his life he had failed to recognise the lighthearted maker of ducksanddrakes in the worn unconscious man so close to death he longed with all the eagerness that was in him that ere he had to leave him to death he might have the chance of saying some word for the master for these eighteen months of hard practical work in the slums of london while they had sobered morris pugh had left him still ardent hullo said ned weakly ive seen you before somewherehavent i he paused and some one gave him another spoonful of stimulant he wondered vaguely why he took it since death must come but it was as well to please peopleif you could i remember now he went on as if he were recalling it from very far away it was when we hid the hundred pounds you were the parson who said money was the root of all evil he gave a ghost of a smile then looked into the dark eyes curiously i suppose you took it morris pugh flushed at the very memory of that nevertobeforgotten search for gods providence on the mountaintop so it was you who made the ducks and drakesi remember he said slowly no i did not take it butbut i looked for it and it was gone gone echoed ned and lay thinking then it must have been ted who took it he murmured going back into the past he must have gone that midsummer nightwhy yes of course then suddenly his dulled mind grasped the whole sequence of events heand hirschthat is how he got auramy moneydamn him hush came morris pughs voice sternly you stand too close to the judgment yourself for curses ii will say bless him if that suits you better murmured ned wearily and if you dont mindi prefer to stand alone no man can stand alone before the judgment seat of god pleaded morris pugh earnestly i do not know what your life has been but the best of us need an advocate and there is one my life echoed ned dreamily i want to forget my lifenot to talk about itif you would goand leave me then he opened his eyes again did you bring me here yes i brought youi found you unconscious but there is one who will bring you safe into the fold i wonder if you wouldbe kind enough to let medie alone alone echoed morris pugh you can never be alone and even for this world would you not like us to call your friendsto let them know ii have my friends he answered i wantnothing so after whispering about him regretfully they left him for a while and he lay staring at a ray of sunlight which slanted through the window at the further end of the ward and fell in a golden glory upon an empty bed if it had only fallen upon his gold yes everything was gold in this world how people fought for it selling their souls their bodies for it yet how little it meant a hideous mockery indeed was this christian greed of gold and yet money meant muchteddamn him mate came a voice from the next bed where a tramp holloweyed unshaven who was recovering from an attack of pneumonia had lain listening coughing taint no business o mine in a way but there aint no good your lyin an damnin a man as aint done you no arm taint in a way fair on you for me ter let you go to ell over a lie its the rummest start as i shud be ere butye see tedooever e may bedidnt take that undredi took

me an welcome if it do you any good he rolled over on his pillow and said no more ned lay still and smiled inwardly his mind was clouding fast he felt vaguely glad that ted had not taken the money but then how could he have taken it seeing that it had never existed they had all thought of it and relied on it and gone to look for it and there was nothing it never had been anything but a dream the gold sunray had crept down the ward it lay now closer to him if he could only die in the sunlight that was the only gold worth having how the atoms danced in it unceasing endless he felt their vibration in himself but beyond the dancer lay sightlessness and touchlessness and soundlessness faint voices came to him from around his bed there is time yet repent and be saved put your trust in him keep your eyes fixed on himremember that you are bought with a price there was just the flicker of a faint courteous smile caveat emptor murmured the dying man and turned his face to the sunray aura he murmured tad ek am the sunray shifted crept to his bed and lay there golden
